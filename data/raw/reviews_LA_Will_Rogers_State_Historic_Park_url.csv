50,A Nice Diversion,"For those who do not know Will Rogers, he was a very famous American film actor, humorist, cowboy, vaudeville performer, a Cherokee and a social commentator. His vast wealth was spread in estate at the foothills of LA where he maintained his residence in a large ranch. The area is now a state park. People can enter for free and enjoy walks or open ball games across the lawn of his house. There is also a trail towards the back, a very enjoyable way to enjoy nature. There are free tours to see the house inside at certain hours. It costs $12 to park so they can keep maintenance of the place. We hiked towards the back for a bit and took a peek at the house. Note: there are other Will Rogers sites to honor him. This is the place where he maintained his residence. It is an interesting place to visit and learn more history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indiana_Jonesse
40,Really interesting,"Will Rogers ranch sits on an enormous park with one of the very few polo fields left in LA. The house (ranch) is definitely worth seeing, there’s a guided tour every hour. Everything is as it was when Will and family lived here, the furniture and art is really interesting and the kitchen has so many “modern” features and equipment, you will not believe your eyes! The upper floor where the bedrooms are located, is really interesting too. Definitely worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurydice2017
50,Recommended,"I had a private tour at noon as there were no other people, I enjoyed seeing the house and hearing stories of Will and family. There is a free guided tour every hour 11am-3pm and on weekends 10am-4pm. The house has beautiful features, so if you value old houses and interiors, this is a lovely place to see. The stable is beautiful as well and you can see horses at the pastures. I went for a short hike up the hill, lovely views and you can even see the ocean. I came with Uber from Santa Monica (around 8$) and took the bus coming back, the bus stop is a tiny hike (like 5mins) from the park, a beautiful little path downhill. I will be coming back on a weekend to see a polo match!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennivii
50,"Nice historic ranch, easy hiking, scenic views","A tribute to Will Rogers, this was his home in the 1920s-30s, trails back up to the much bigger Topanga State Park in the Santa Monica mountains. Nice for walking, easy hiking & picnicking Horseback riding is available, although I’ve never ridden here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cinchud
50,"Easy, beautiful hiking...","Wonderful house, the home where Will Rogers lived. Great story, and frankly I felt like I could just move in! Sometimes a polo game is ongoing, but always wonderful walks up into the hills, short and long, views in every direction. Maybe it will even be wildflower season!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bitely
40,A great visit,"We spent a wonderful afternoon here. Entry is free, parking is 12 dollars. There are tours of the house starting on the hour. The grounds are beutiful. There is a 1.5 mile walk up to a great overlook with some of the very best views of of the coast and inland LA. Learned a lot about Will Rogers and his family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenM46
50,One of my favorite hikes,"This is an easy and beautiful hike to do, up to Inspiration Point. The lookout offers an incredible view out over the city and along the hike you can also see some pretty magnificent celebrity homes--including Spielberg's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer772006
40,Good Park and tour of the home,Big park on the Sunday we were there empty. No polo that day. Good tour of the house by a very knowledgeable ranger. A few families and a birthday party. Big lawn to play on. Lots of picnic tables. Horses to ride and watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPD4Train
10,Terrible Guide for the House Tour,"This was our second visit to Will Rogers State Park. Our first visit occurred when the house was closed for tours, so we did one of the hiking trails which was great. We recently returned on a Sunday, so while my spouse went hiking again, I chose to do the noon house tour which was just about to start.The first docent who approached me about doing the tour was new so she chose to let the more experienced docent, Nathan, take charge. It turned out that I was the only person doing the tour at this time, so I expected to have a ""personalized"" tour. Boy, was I wrong!Nathan spent the first 10 minutes or so chatting with the novice guide discussing colleges, his field of study, etc. He then spent 20 minutes or so taking both of us around the exhibits in the visitor's center (which I could have easily seen on my own later). We then walked over to the ranch house and before we entered, he and the novice guide chatted between themselves about other employees and docents -- people I obviously did not know. Once we got into the house, there was another discussion between them about the damaged knob on the front door and the probability that it was caused by guests at the polo match held the previous day.We entered the house in the living room and I expected to get a talk about the art and architecture of the house. Wrong again! All Nathan said was, ""Well, what do you want to know?"" When I suggested he tell me about the art and architecture, he proceeded to tell me about one piece of art that Will Rogers got from Amon Carter (whose museum he mistakenly said was in Dallas, not Fort Worth) and the fact that the stairs were made from railroad ties. That...was...it. I saw nothing of the house other than that one room.When my spouse returned from hiking, I said, ""I should have gone with you. That was one hour of my life I'll never get back again.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longhorn74
50,Beautiful scenery,We took a hike in the Santa Monica mountains in the Will Rogers State Park. Nice hike. Great views. Some areas are steep depending which path you take. We ended at Will Rogers Ranch. Took a tour of his ranch. He was an amazing man. Very well respected. Learned a lot about him.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brennaed
50,Fun day watching polo and touring Will Rogers’ Ranch House,"The Ranch House is chock full of Remington and Russell masterpieces, plus Rogers’ silver saddle and his roping calf. Interesting stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbrothers50
50,Love this place,"Whether you're a Will Rogers fan or wonder if you should be, this is a wonderful place to learn about his life or just take a nice relaxing stroll around the property. I loved the tour of the house and learning about his life. The park is well maintained and worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8fish2017
50,Great Stopping off point on way to Malibu,We visited the park on our way to Malibu and another state park. Beautiful location. The beach which is a separate park not far away was easy access and clean. Lots of surfers to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424bradleyv

50,Heaven for Will Rogers fan,"Loving the wit and brilliance of Will Rogers, and admiring the way he treated people, I made a special trip to visit the ranch. It did not disappoint. The house is so warm and down to earth and I just loved being there. During the tour, the docent was kind enough to show me where Will Rogers put his gum under the dining room table. The house was great. The one downside was that they don't allow inside photographs. The park property itself is lovely... nice trails and of course, the famous Polo field. The historic stables were neat as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobbCoGA

50,What a great park!,"Friends held a picnic for their 50th wedding anniversary here. We had a blast. The picnic area has some trees, so you're not completely broiling under the sun. It's across the parking lot from the polo field and we were lucky enough to see a few chukkars. We also checked out Will Rogers' house--to gain entry, you must take the tour, which happens hourly (at least on the weekends). It was one of the better tours we've ever taken--so informative! Also walked up to the stables Will Rogers had built for his horses. Unfortunately, we ran ot of time to hike any of the trails, but we'd like to come back and try those as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelaao2018
50,Excellent Park!,I enjoyed taking a hike on the Inspiration Trail which offers great views. It's an easy two mile loop which gives you wonderful views. I took the house tour which is also very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq
50,No better place to picnic,There is a special spirit here. Will Rogers was a great thinker and was able to capture America in a few words. His home reflects him well. Great grass area to picnic. Maybe see some Polo. Hike and see the city and the sea. Tour his house. All for a small parking fee!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeTom547
50,One thing to LOVE about LA,"As a San Diego dweller, there is a lot not to like about LA, however Will Rogers State Historic Park is amazing. You completely forget about all the traffic you just sat or will sit in. Parking was $12. On a clear day the vista from the 2.2 miles loop was amazing, snow capped mountains, to downtown, to ocean. There are much longer trails than the 2.2 miles too, if well prepared with water (not much shade). At the Will Rogers residence, they have docent-led tours at the top of every hour. No photos were allowed in the house. Both docents were excellent story tellers and impart a genuine appreciation Will Rogers the man and legend. Couldn't believe the house tour was free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9171FFmichellec
50,Really Neat park,Very nice park to walk around. Really enjoyed learning about Will rogers and what a fascinating person he was. Worth seeing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dennancy
50,A Gem!,"This may be the best short easy hike in the Los Angeles area. The 2.2 mile loop over Vista Point gives spectacular views of the Western Los Angeles Basin, the Pacific Ocean and Topanga National Forest and mountains. An added bonus were the beautiful spring flowers as a result of the relatively wet winter. This is a wonderful urban walk at the edge of the wilderness. More adventurous types can hook up with the Backbone Trail which provides a potential 20 mile walk into Topanga State Park and beyond. This park is a jewel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathb5
50,"Easy hike to the top, and wonderful, historical tour of Will Roger's family house!","I recently had the pleasure of doing the hike up to Inspiration Point, followed by a Docent tour of Will's family home. It was such a delight.The hike itself is an easy 2.5 mile route, with a slow, steady incline. At the top you'll see great vistas of the ocean, mountains, and Santa Monica, Century City, and downtown. This hike is easy for people of all ages, including kids and dogs! I've even seen people pushing strollers, although the path is dirt and unsteady.After hiking, we asked a Docent about the house. He was so kind and generous with his time, giving us what turned out to be our own tour. In each room of the house he shared fascinating details of the Rogers family and friends, even the celebrities who joined in the many family BBQs.I think our favorite part was hearing about all Will's philanthropy, and efforts to keep Americans hopeful during the worst of the great depression. What a true Patriot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAKtraveler
50,Don’t miss it,"We were looking for something a bit off the beaten track to do near the Santa Monica end of LA with our teenage and younger children. We looked up the Will Rogers State Park with the intention of doing a short hike and instead had one of the most memorable experiences of our trip to LA. We started with a lovely clearly marked hour circular hike to inspiration point in the park, enjoying amazing views over the ocean, across LA and towards Topanga, we could hardly believe we were so close to the city, it was so rural and quiet.. At the end of our hike we happened to hit visiting hour of Will Rogers’s ranch in the middle of the estate. Will Roger’s wife Blake, willed the ranch and all it’s contents plus the land to California State, who have done an amazing job of keeping it as it was when they lived there. It is an incredible family home, filled with all the rich memorabilia of the first mega celebrity really, and until that point, someone I knew very little about. We had a wonderful guide, so knowledgeable but also fun who totally brought it all to life. If you want to experience genuine Hollywood in it’s heyday, this is the place where it happened. Presidents and stars all met here, Hearst flew in here and landed on the Polo pitch! It’s that kinda place!! Full of magic and the stardust is still there..... A fantastic experience, and well worth the small parking fee. Everything else is free, (donations are gratefully received by the ranch guides to help towards the upkeep of it all) Also unusual in Los Angeles!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839tamsinw
50,"Lovely view of LA, the mountains and the beaches","We hiked the easy to moderate trails around the Will Rogers home and had the best views of LA and it’s natural surroundings. The parking is on the expensive side ($12) but the house tour was free. Tours are on the hour starting at 11 am on weekdays. No reservation needed. The docents did a great job; they were super friendly and welcoming. They clearly enjoy their job and are great advocates for people learning more about Will Rogers. The house looks very much as it would have while Will Rodgers was alive. Original furniture, western art and beautiful Native American rugs. A real national treasure and a tremendous asset for the public to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kellyclan50
50,Must Visit if you like hiking and history,"Some of the best local hiking is in this park. A 2 mile a hike through beautiful eucalyptus trees and vistas looking over the Pacific Ocean is great and easy. You can also take the backbone trail from here to over 50 Miles to the end if you care to.If one likes history, visiting Will’s home with a tour guide is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652bobp
40,Very good!,If you have some extra time a visit here will not disappoint. A really nice park in the city of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
50,House tour was great!,The tour is only given at certain times but it is well worth the wait as Will Roger's led a very unique life and was someone to respect. House and grounds were also interesting but the tour makes it special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O89UPdavids
50,House tour,Tour guide very friendly and well informed. Property is well restored and visitor friendly.Parking is abundant and easy to use. Car friendly. Film should not be missed. Signs for finding its location could be improved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddgs123
50,Wonderful Piece of History,"We visited Will Rogers State Park just before New Year's. We toured Will Rogers' home, which is exactly as it was when he and his family lived there, and the guide was very well informed about the man and the history behind this wonderful hidden gem. Before this visit to the park, I knew very little about Will Rogers, but he left an incredible legacy behind that I think many can learn from. The grounds of this property are beautiful. It's a great place to picnic. You can also visit the stables and go horse back riding. After we toured the home, we went on the two-mile hiking trail. It's not too strenuous and was very enjoyable. It was well worth the trip up the trail to see the panoramic view of Los Angeles. It truly was breathtaking. We could see all the way to downtown Los Angeles, Century City and Westwood. We could also see a lot of the shoreline of the Santa Monica Beach. If you like hiking, Hollywood history and would just like to enjoy a pleasant day among nature, I highly recommend this beautiful park. This is a great place for locals and visitors from out of town. There is a fee for parking, but other than that, the grounds and tour are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlemissmaggie
50,A Park That Has Something For Everyone.,"You can hike into the Santa Monica Mountains to a magical view of the ocean, or you can take a shorter walk with your dog. Whatever your ability there is something to do at the Will Rogers Park. From easy walks, to a picnic, to pretty hard trails, you will find a spot that makes you happy.This park used to belong to Will Rogers, the actor and sometimes cowboy. He has a house there and it is open sometimes. You will need to check the web site or call to see if it is open that day.From May through September they have polo games on a beautiful grassy field. It is free. You can bring a lunch and watch the games or not, there is just so much to do.Parking is for a fee, 12$ as of this writing. This park is huge. People have Birthday parties there (you need to get permission) or just go there to have some peace and quiet. It is lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

50,Amazing views,"We went on a day when they were prepping for a polo match, but still were able to walk the grounds, see the stables, and take a hike that had a beautiful city and ocean view.The house wasn’t open that day, but it is worth seeing as well. Lovely grounds and very peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peggille
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"A wonderful place close to Sunset Blvd.Great hiking here and the views are stunning.A camera is a must because you see L.A., the ocean, mountains and more from high up.This is a whole day thing so plan for that.Don't confuse this with Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills.A few have.They are two very different parks, but this one in Los Angeles is the best by far and I live in Beverly Hills.A great experience.Don't forget the camera.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
50,"Quiet, peaceful, very relaxing spot to get away","Will Rogers state park is a little gem hidden above Sunset. Parking is $15 or, if you're lucky, free down a ways from the gate (before the stop sign - pay attention to the signs!)Once in the park, there are hiking trails into various canyons, a polo field, and the Will Rogers house. Take the tour, you'll be glad you did. Great big lawn, wonderful place for a picnic, let the dog and kids run, overall a really mellow place in the middle of LA's madness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeni2003
50,Energetic trail workout,"My wife booked a holiday weekend dance camp in L.A., so I planned some outdoor activities for myself. An avid trail runner, I was seeking someplace both challenging and scenic. The trails that start from this state park certainly fill the bill for a range of activities! I encountered hikers and mountain bikers as well as a few other runners. The terrain is generally pretty steep, but by choosing a comfortable pace, people of all ages were out enjoying themselves.If you continue up the Backbone Trail, you can easily get in 15+ miles roundtrip, as the trails and unpaved fire roads transition into Topanga State Park. And the higher you go, the more awesome the views!On a practical note, the parking is quite pricey at $12. If you arrive early enough, there is some on-street parking available about 100 yards before the park entrance. Mind the signs, however, as on-street parking is NOT allowed both before and after this limited stretch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mtrob326
50,Beautiful,"It is a very easy hike round trip (about 45 min) and you get an incredible view for not so much work. The trail is a loop so you can go up one way and come down another. If you are coming to LA and are looking for a simple hike with a good view this is definitely the one. Also, sometimes you can see polo practices at the bottom and there is a really nice park to have a picnic and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isahomberg
50,Nice change from the beach,"Very close to downtown Santa Monica, the ranch home of Will Rogers makes a fun half day excursion. The ranch house is open by guided tour, and has been left just as it was in the 1930s. The tour includes most rooms of the house, and along the way visitors learn all about Will Rogers, a cowboy, journalist, actor, and writer who died an untimely death in 1935. There is a polo field where you can see polo played on weekends, a historic barn, and some hiking trails up into the mountains. We took a short 1.5 mile loop with ocean and city views. Spectacular. There was a fee for parking, but not for the grounds or the house tour. A highly recommended day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travgal0766
50,WOW,One of the high lights of my trip to CA. The house tour was great. They have polo games on Saturday and Sunday. I wish I would have spent more time here. I would have hiked the Inspiration trail and brought a picnic lunch. You will love it. The only coast is the $12.00 for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234normal
50,A lovely hike just off Sunset Blvd.,"You'll get a good workout if you hike the 1.5 mile loop above the polo field and historic home of Will Rogers. Great views of the Pacific Ocean all the way around to downtown Los Angeles. If you get there early enough in the morning, you may find parking on the street. But, if you don't, there's plenty of parking at the Park and the money goes to support the upkeep, a worthy cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseWakeman

50,Humorous History,"This is a hidden gem. It was originally Will Rogers' ranch in Los Angeles but is now a State Historical Park. There are quite a few buildings, his ranch house, a polo grounds where they play every weekend in the summer and a several trails. The house tours are first come, first served so we arrived early so we would definitely get on a tour. Funny, since this is such a 'hidden' gem, we were the only ones on the tour. Very nice tour, extremely knowledgable docent and a fun, informative tour.Afterwards we toured the grounds, the stable, viewed a film and then took he rail to Inspiration Point above the ranch. Well used trail and spectacular views of the LA area from the top.We would definitely recommend this tor for everyone. Will Rogers was a wonderful, pithy, funny, human being who was the most well known actor of his day. Check You-tube for his film called 'Roping Fool.' Amazing tricks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406

Great cruise to the location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,Loved the tour of the Ranch House,"This is a wonderful park in the middle of busy Los Angeles. We joined the Ranger led tour of the Rogers' Ranch House.

50,Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Rogers,"You might want to rely on your GPS to take you up through the hills and bring you to the part of Will Rogers property that his widow gave to the State of California. This is a must wee site providing not only trails but entry into the Will Rogers house and on Sundays time to watch some polo. if you're only familiar with Will Rogers' name, do go into the house; tours start on the hour and lsat about forty minutes. The docents are more than knowledgeable and you'll learn more about the man who was once described as the most loved man in America. After you enjoy his legacy, you'll love him too. You'll have to pay to park, but bring your lunch, water, and good shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfessorCharles
40,Just go as the hike is not difficult,"We were on a road trip and wanted to see and do as much as we can. We were in the area, checked out the reviews and decided to try the hike.

40,"Really nice, not too hard hike up to Inspiration Point","During a visit to Santa Monica, my brother and I had a couple of hours free in which we could visit Will Rogers State Historic Park to hike up and back to Inspiration Point. What I like about this particular trail is that you feel the elevation gain immediately, but not so much that you cannot continue talking as you ascend. The trail is short enough that it can easily fit into part of a morning or afternoon journey without taking away the rest of the day for other activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195susanr

40,Hidden in Plain Sight,"High above the Pacific Palisades along the curvy western end of Sunset is this gem. Though I was there on a Monday, when there were no house tours, just being able to walk the grounds was a treat.The trail to Inspiration Point was not too taxing, but provided good exercise on a sunny afternoon. People with dogs, a cyclist, and even someone on horseback, were making the trek at the time I was. Along the hike up, you can get varied views of the polo field on the property, distant Santa Monica and downtown, some of the adjacent luxury homes, and the glittering Pacific. It definitely feels removed from all the urban hustle, yet is tucked within it.For a taste of the California outdoors within city limits, this is a spot worth considering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanPok

40,Nice little park,"We missed the free house tour by about 10 minutes...We walked the Inspiration Point trail. While it was a nice trail, at no point were either of us truly inspired. So, a bit of a disappointment given the name. :)We could see some of the horses as we walked the paths.If you can go to the house tour, which others seem to say is interesting, it's probably worth traveling to the park. But, if not, there's not much else to see here and I wouldn't go out of your way to see this park. The ""hiking"" part is similar to a lot of other parks in the vicinity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AaronsTravels
50,By all means take the guided Ranch House tour,"The historic family home and getaway of American humorist, writer and broadcast star Will Rogers occupies a scenic perch above Pacific Palisades and Santa Monica. But the highlight for our visit on a rare rainy day was the Ranch House tour led by a California State Parks ranger. The Rogers' ranch-style home looks nice enough from the outside, but not terribly remarkable compared to the modern mansions you pass outside the park. The not-to-miss element here is the retelling of Rogers' fascinating life as shared by an articulate ranger as he leads you through the perfectly preserved interior. The furnishings and mementos offer a time-capsule of early Hollywood and the luxuries a movie star could afford. In particular, the vintage electrical appliances were a treat to behold. I confess I only had a vague idea of what a special personality Will Rogers was before taking this tour. Afterwards I felt joyfully privileged to have insights into this unique figure in American history.Check the state parks website for tour times before making your visit. There is a vehicle entrance fee for the state historic park, but no additional charge for the roughly 50 minute ranch house tour. On a nicer day, I plan to return to hike the recommended Inspiration Point trail. In the right season, there is also polo practice to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiscJockey

40,Will Rogers Family Ranch 1922-1944 to Today with the Last L.A. Polo Field,"Just a few minutes up the coast from Santa Monica pier and then slightly inland a few miles, take yourself back to Will Rogers' life by touring the ranch grounds and ranch house. Park nearby the ranch house after paying the admission fee and then take a tour of the ranch house with all of its contents remaining as they were in 1944 when Mrs. Rogers deeded the ranch to the State of California. Located in the Visitors Center adjacent to the ranch house is an interesting set of murals, displays, and movie chronicling Will Rogers's life, family and history of the ranch. The property (including polo field, riding arena, roping arena and stables) is open to walk through as well as hike the numerous trails that are in the state park adjacent to this property. There are also horses on site that are boarded here which give you a sense of how horses were a key part of the ranch. Rogers' favorite sport was polo on horseback. Polo is still played here on the last remaining polo field in L.A. Matches are held most weekends from mid-April to early October, weather permitting. Be sure to check dates and times the facilities/events are open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5026OSjohng
40,Lots of interesting things to do,"Went on ""part"" of the house tour. It was fascinating, but I'm not one for guided tours. If you don't mind them, it's well worth your time. Rogers was an extremely interesting person.I bailed out after awhile and spent the rest of my time watching a polo game on the grounds. Also, beautiful scenery, and you can bring your own picnic items. There is a fee to get into the park, bur well worth it. Lots of hiking, too, but unfortunately I'm past the age for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHP2
40,Fun outing,Fun place to go with friends and or family. The house tour is interesting as are the polo matches. Great place for a picnic. Bring lots of water and sunscreen. There is some good tree shade available. Hiking the trails is a must especially inspiration point where both the city and ocean view is well...inspirational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomy857
50,great place to spend an afternoon.,"last saturday, my out of town friends and i spent a most enjoyable half day at the will rogers state park off sunset blvd in santa monica. mike, the ranger at the park, gave an amazing tour of the house where will rogers and family resided until his untimely death in 1935. the tour lasted an hour. we learned about the life and times of will rogers while being shown this most lovely ranch house from a bygone era.we then took this ""inspirational loop trail"" that begins and ends at the park. the trail is under a mile but with enough elevation along the way to allow for some breathtaking views of the santa monica bay.our final ""treat"" was watching the polo game being played in a proper polo field while cooling off in a shady part of this huge lawn that would be great for picnics and kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiY_13
50,Good hiking trails and views of LA and Malibu,Went for a few hour hike that was well worth it as the weather cooperated to provide some hazy views of the LA area and Malibu. Grounds near the historic area are well kept.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waltersN6914XQ
30,I couldn't find the Klingon Bird of Prey!!,"if you have seen Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, you will remember the scenes where Captain Kirk and crew land the stolen Klingon Bird of Prey in Golden Gate Park. In reality, this was filmed in Will Rogers State Park. here is where Dr. Jillian Taylor dropped off Kirk and Spock after having dinner at the pizza place (Where was Spock during dinner?). The Bird of Prey was parked in the middle of the park, but cloaked so it wouldn't be seen. At any rate, I visited the park and took lots of photos of the area. It is a nice place to get away from it all, but there was nothing going on when I was there. I saw lots of corals for animals, but no animals. I didn't trek through the hiking trails. I'm not sure what else is available here. Apparently, they use the main field for Polo, but there wasn't any going on when I was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
30,Attended a picnic,"Meh. Attended a picnic here, just basic picnic tables, not much of a view. Polo was happening in a field nearby which was kind of cool. I heard there's a good hike up further but I was not particularly impressed with the part of the park we were in. I will say the gate attendant/ranger was very friendly and funny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohliz
40,A Hidden Historic Gem,"Since our daughter and son-in-law live in the LA area it's often difficult to choose things to do since there are so many interesting alternatives throughout the area. During our recent trip we spent a most enjoyable afternoon at the Will Rogers State Historic Park. First, be sure to stop at Visitor's Center and view the short film covering Will Rogers' rise to stardom while remaining a humble family man always giving back to the community. Next, take the one-hour informative house tour. Our CA Park Guide, Mike, was extremely knowledgable and could answer any question. He gave a wonderful tour. They offer tours on the hour-ask for Mike. The large estate offers hiking trails, horseback riding as well as a host of other actvities. Don't pass this by!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460terryb
50,"Park, hike, horses, hour tour","Great place to spend the day watching polo, taking a trail ride, hiking the Santa Monica Mountains, and taking a tour of the historic house (at the top of the hour).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatherineHPat

50,Historic Site with Hiking Trails and Awesome Views,"The Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades is another surprising discovery in the L.A. area. This peaceful, vast park has a variety of activities including a polo field, historic home of Will Rogers, riding stables and miles of trails adjacent to Topanga Park. After the gatekeeper collects the $12.00 fee, nominal for this park in this area visitors discover a museum and gift shop. Inside the very small museum a film providing a short history of the life of humorist, political commentator, roping-cowboy, and early movie star Will Rogers is shown in an area next to a gift shop. After leaving the museum, visitors have additional areas to freely explore, tour or sit and relax. The polo field provides areas for those wanting to picnic. (Some report this is the last remaining active polo field in the area.) The home tour is available only certain days of the week. Definitely check out the days/times, if you want to tour inside.The many trails draw locals to the hiking trails in the 187 park. One trail leads to Inspiration Point with fantastic views of the city and ocean – stunning. Benches are situated along this hiking trail to take a break and enjoy the views overlooking the Pacific. Will Rogers State Park was on my list of sites to see in Los Angeles, and now my husband agrees. We love hiking, exploring and enjoying the ocean views while taking an easy breezy hike to Inspiration Point or hiking the many other trails as we wind up and above the polo field with the Will Rogers home below us. Pets are allowing on the easy Inspiration Point trail. After our discovery of this park, this continues to remain on our list of places to relax and hike while in L.A.Reviews are somewhat confusing regarding the three parks in the area baring the name of famous humorist Will Rogers: (1) the 187 acre Will Rogers Historic State Park in Pacific Palisades, with its polo field, historic home of Will Rogers and miles of trails overlooking the Pacific Ocean; (2) the tiny, but lush, Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills on Sunset Boulevard, lined with tall, palm trees; and (3) the Will Rogers State Beach along the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica with fabulous sunset views. Highly recommend the three different locations for three memorable experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
40,A Nice Tribute to a Great American,"This park in the Pacific Palisades area northwest of Los Angeles is a quiet retreat and former home of Will Rogers, cowboy, movie legend, world traveler and commentator and widely read journalist. In a very low key manner, the park tells the story of Mr. Rogers. Interesting video and even more interesting tour of the house give a great historical perspective and personal glimpses of this remarkable man. Nice picnic areas, a polo ground, riding stables (possible to take riding lessons) and hiking trails of modest difficulty are to be found. Great for a low key family outing or just to learn about Will Rogers and his unassuming approach to becoming a world renown statesman and philosopher. He was cut down tragically in a plane crash in 1935, but his memory lives on and is well represented by the park and its docents. Suggest taking one of the free tours of the house offered weekends and by appointment (on the hour).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsutigre
40,Inspiration Morning Hike,"We arrived early at 8:20AM, and there was no one at the gate to accept payment. (You then need the exact change to place $12 in an envelope with your license plate #, date, etc. A pain.)It took a minute to realize the direction we needed to walk to reach the start of the Inspiration Point hike (up the hill to the right of the house, then right at the blacksmith's). It really was a beautiful hike, and the views of LA, the ocean, and mountains were incredible. In total, the hike took about an hour with a few stops to enjoy the view.We did get lost once on our way back, and I wish there had been more trail signs to distinguish the different paths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcast27
50,Could have spent a whole day,"The house is very interesting; even if you go there when it's closed you can look inside at Will Rogers' home. There are hikes to views, stables, and open fields for sports, kids, & families. Our time was limited, but I would definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PKBadger
50,A lovely walk & fascinating history,"We enjoyed fabulous views from Inspirarion Point, with a very nice walk through the park.We also took in the visitors' centre and docent tour (on the hour) of Will Rogers' ranch. Fascinating history and beautifully preserved artefacts.Whilst you may choke on the $12 parking fee, everything else is free and there is a lot of upkeep for the park. And the views and tranquility are truly wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitbug2010

Fun, you'll enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Lovely Hike above the City,"Really lovely hike with great views. It was a bit hot and dusty, even in November, but had a good hour, very easy-going walk. Well worth the trip out here. The house also looked nice but was closed on a Monday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken0739
50,A Favorite for years,I love this park. Catchy to get too so keep your eyes peeled for the turn off. A spectacular view and don't forget to enjoy the POLO games here as well. Be safe and take a whistle or something for protection (snakes) can be found here on the higher ground. Water and food always good to take along. This is a super place for those who like nature. I used to see President Regan at the Polo games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britneylynne2015
50,Beautiful,The Ranch house is nicely preserved and the guided tour was fantastic. The grounds are picturesque and well kept. I didn't get to do the hiking trails but did walk up to the barns and was rewarded with beauitful view and lots of wild and domestic animals. Highly recommend visiting and taking advantage of the gorgeous park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theladyknownascady
50,Historic Home,I came to see the Will Rogers ranch house. The 50 minute free tour was excellent. Will Rogers loved the outdoors. He had a real ranch here with horses. The ranch house started small. He expanded it with a second story. There is a patio between the two wings of the house where he had BBQ. The house has many original furnishings. The tour guide was excellent. She shared many stories of Will Rogers and his life at the ranch.The house looks out at the polo field. The road to the State Park is closed to visitors when there is a major polo event.The parking is $12 ($11 for seniors). There is a small lot before reaching the house and another lot above the polo field. I think there is additional parking. The park is popular with hikers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charles6346
50,Picnic and Polo,"At times, the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles can be a bit much.To experience the feeling of ""getting away from it all"" in a day trip, I recommend Will Rogers State Park near Pacific Palisades.You can tour Rogers's historic home, choose from several hikes(including the popular ""loop hike""), or enjoy a picnic on the lawn.From May through October, I truly enjoy the excitement of taking in a Polo tournament.They are usually scheduled between 2-5pm Saturdays and 10-1 Sundays, and are free to the public.Prepare to be refreshed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivinTheDream90272

50,Great hike with a Amazing View at the top! Tour of Will Rogers's home too!,"My girlfriends are always looking for fun places to hike ... this is one of our favorites! We love that it is not over difficult but gives us exercise. The view at the top on a clear day is amazing! Also ... check the schedule and you could also catch a polo match that uses the polo field that Will Rogers built. If you have time, do the tour of Will Rogers' home. It was so good that I took family back and learned some different things each time because the docents add the elements that they have learned. There is no charge except for parking. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calgal405

50,Beautiful Vista's,"We went hiking up a 2.0 mile trail up to Inspiration point. The grounds are nice with a huge soccer/Polo field along with stables with horses/guides for hire. The trail (one of many) winds past historic structures and greenery. At trails end is a spectacular vista of Santa Monica, LA and of course the Pacific. Very beautiful and a nice spot to rest before heading back down. BTW there is ample parking ($12) and clean restrooms. You can park on the approach to the park for free with a short hike to the grounds. The day we went there was drizzly rain and a cloudy sky. Nice and cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnNV51
50,BEST Views in ALL of LA,"I can't believe I was born in Los Angeles and have never come to this State Park. It is BEAUTIFUL!!! We took the family horseback riding and saw the most beautiful views I have ever seen in LA. We saw tons of people hiking, walking their dogs, picnicking and setting up to watch Polo matches. My family and I have already made plans to come back again soon and enjoy more of this park. It really is a hidden gem in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedesv714

20,Mostly an Outdoor Park,"I again was fooled by the website for the Will Rogers State Park. It does state that tours are provided on the hour, but it doesn't say that the house is closed to visitors who choose not to tour with a docent. With LA traffic we made it to the house at five minutes past the hour, so a locked door greeted us. For those who want to catch a half-tour, wait around the fireplace area between the two wings of the house. The group comes outside about fifteen minutes into the tour, so you can join up then. That's what we and another couple did. So we got to see the music room and bedroom wing.We were mostly interested in the house and learned enough about Will Rogers on our half tour to sate us. We peeked into the windows of the main house to see what we were missing.This park is designed mostly for the outdoorsy types. There is plenty of open space and you can bring in your horse to ride. If you are coming simply for the house, it's only a half hour total, so it might not be worth it to you, unless you're doing something else in the area. Also, at least for the portion of the house we visited, there was not handicap access to the top floor. All in all, we were disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEC24
40,Humorist's gift to California and the world,"Will Rogers State Historic Park is situated off Sunset Blvd. in West Los Angeles. Its keystone is the rambling former home of the cowboy-humorist, which has docent-led tours. The sprawling grounds (which include a Polo Field and the remains of some golf practice holes) are the perfect place to picnic and play Frisbee. And there is more: a short walk from Will's home will take you to an exhibit of old farming equipment, and a small building containing a wooden carriage and antique tool sets which could have been used to build it. Nearby is the old horse barn, and a series of horse stalls for the nags you can ride through the Park. For walkers, there is a horseshoe-shaped (what else?) trail which leads to Inspiration Point and its panoramic views of the Pacific and L.A. For hikers, that same trail leads to the beginning of the Backbone Trail, which stretches over 50 miles North (West) paralleling the coast. Dogs are allowed on Park trails if leashed (but not on the Backbone) Picnic tables abound.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cos39
50,"For moderate hikers, this is great","Really beautiful place with lots of history. Nobody was complaining because the hike wasn't that long and the views rocked. Bring a picnic. No food here and you don't want to rush out of there. Parking is not free unless you park down the block and walk in but people, please pay! We need parks like this to be able to stay open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arbella8
40,Step Back to a Cowboy Movie Great's Ranch,"This is a must if you are in the Malibu vicinity and an excellent add on if visiting the Getty Villa. Be prepared to pay $12 for parking ($11 Senior). But the docent led tour is free. And the house contains some magnificent cowboy artwork (Charles Russell), beautiful Native American blankets and is a testimonial to the life style of one of the most famous Americans in the 1930s. Will Rogers wrote for over 500 newspapers, had a radio talk show and was probably the greatest roper to ever live (films of his amazing abilities to lasso horses and cattle can be viewed in the visitor center). After touring the fascinating ranch style house, be sure to walk up to the stables, which originally housed his 29 horses. There is also a huge polo field still in use today, and used by Will rogers with his contemporaries, Walt Disney, Clark Gable, to name a few.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristieC665
40,Nice place for a short hiking tour,"We visited the park for a hiking tour. We took the ""inspiration loop trail"" it was really nice, good spots for great views and really quit - good to clear your mind. Picnic area is availed as well but we didn't use it.Parking cost 12$, entry is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/154stefanr
40,Will Rogers was a Fascinating Person,I would give this park 5 stars except that it is hard to find (call ahead for directions if you are from out of town) and you will need exact change to park ($12.00). Don’t bother to go unless you take a tour. Call ahead to get days and times. Tours will take you inside the house and the docents will tell you “The Will Rogers Story” I felt privileged and honored to have toured his home. It is very cool. Highly recommended even if you don’t know who he is!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2075BPmichaelr
40,New Years Day family walk,Lovely place for a walk. We parked a bit down the street as they charge a fee to park. If we were going to be there all day would have paid but we were only going for a wee walk.The trails were very easy to walk and not too steep and the view from the top was stunning.The grassy area around the Historic house was a great place to picnic .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vmcconville
50,Champagne and horses...need I say more?,"Love this beautiful park, and always come when I can. If an event is happening here, I always do my best to make plans work out. The Veuve Clicquot Classic was a fun, upscale event - great fun to dress up and wear a wide brimmed hat!! - where there was plenty of bubbly, yummy food, a great crowd of celebrities to watch, and just an overall nice time. I will go again if I get the chance!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBWillsy
10,Event Closed the Access Road,"Although we checked on the website before leaving home, the park access road was closed the Saturday we went. Event parking was further down the road at a high school and other neighborhoods. I assume it was a polo event since that occurs on Saturdays, but no mention was made of road closures on the website. With two handicapped individuals in the car, we just turned around and went home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEC24

Short walk and we were up on top and could see the ocean although the view wasn't very clear.Went back down to wait for the Ranch House tour that started at the top of every hour.

Please do take the tour to learn about this very interesting person, Will Rogers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkmaro
50,Will Rogers,"Had a pretty sweet hike up and down the promontory hill. Amazing views of Santa Monica and Downtown Los Angeles. No parking fee if you just set up camp a bit further down the hill.

You can also see the Will Rogers home, admire the stables and catch some polo ponies in action too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deniseka
50,Will Rogers Historical House,"We visited the Historic house of Will Rogers. There is a parking fee, but the house tour is free. The guide was excellent; very knowledgeable and the tour lasted about 45 min. There is a short movie in the visitor center that I recommend. The grounds are beautiful, including a large grassy area (which used to to his golf course) for picnics or throwing the Frisbee around, Polo Grounds (still in use today), the stables, and hiking trails with beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean. No food sold, so bring a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parksfam
40,Great spot for locals and tourists!,"Revisited Will Rogers State Park last weekend (Mother's Day) with husband and 15-year-old son. Hadn't been there in 20 years! Was delighted that not much has changed, except possibly the parking fee.The park grounds here are excellent for a bring your own lunch (and shade, if possible!). They surround Will Roger's homestead which his wife donated to the California State Park Service. There are working bathrooms, a water fountain and a spigot for dog bowl fill ups readily available. As mentioned below, try to go Thursday-Sunday if you want to see the house, visit the gift shop and learn more about Will Rogers. The WR Polo Club plays on the weekends May-September -- we sat and watched some of the match that was taking place during our visit.Hiking is the big draw here. It's a bit ambiguous as to how to get to the Inspiration Point trail (if gift shop is open, just ask them for directions and a map!), but once on the well trodden fire road, it's an easy 1 mile ascent (2 mile RT) with wonderful views of the ocean, downtown LA, Santa Monica and Catalina Island. There are a few benches scattered along the way for resting and a picnic table at the top. Saw no bikes on our trip -- saw many dogs -- this is a very dog friendly place! Bring water and a hat -- when it's hot, it's hot. There are no trees to shade this arid path.Parking fee is $12, seniors $11. Beware if you park on the streets around the park -- residential areas are permit-only on the weekends. This is a lovely park that is now an urban oasis. House tours are free. If you are visiting LA, make a day of it and have lunch or brunch in Santa Monica or Malibu after a morning hike! Worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohiofamily
40,Cowboys Rule,"A wonderful park with the original house of Will Rogers and family. The grounds are pretty with stables and horse arena, great lawn area for picnics, (bring food as no concessions are in the park). A must is to go on the house tour with the park ranger. The ranger was very knowledgable about the history of Will Rogers and his informative tour of the house made the stop excellent. The house has the original furnishings and is an excellent representation of the era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsth

40,"Beautiful views, easy to find.","I spent Christmas Day 2013 here and was pleasantly surprised by the well-maintained grounds and number of trails for hiking. The views across the Santa Monica Mountains to the Pacific Ocean and across greater LA were breathtaking - Inspiration Point is definitely a detour worth taking! The trails are easy-moderate but not well marked. Make sure you have a map, especially if wandering into the nearby Topanga Canyon!Many people parked on the road and walked up the hill to avoid the $12 parking fee. However, once inside, the ranch tours are free and the grounds are impressive. Please support the state parks by paying this small amount!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayB35
50,Home and the Range,"The Will Rogers Park is home to Will's original estate, polo grounds, corrals, and stables featuring horse trails into the mountains above Pacific Palisades, California.

Westwood, The Getty Center, and the coastline. Parking is around $12/car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Dphotographer
40,"Good trails, great views","I went for the walking, and didn't visit the house. The trails are smooth and wide, and not to steep. The views of the Pacific Ocean, the coast, and Catalina are spectacular. Good cityscapes too, showing most of the westside. The trails lead initially to Inspiration Point; once there you can go into Topanga State Park via their trails (which I did - it was quite a hike) or go back down into Will Rogers State Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrisPopenoe
40,"Quaint site to visit quieter, gentler time","Docents were very knowledgeable of era and area. You must see the short film showing Will Roger's roping skills before you tour the house. Mr. Roger's was amazing. I wish we had come prepared to hike, it looked like there would have been wonderful views. This is a hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lascassaslass
40,Transport Yourself to the Early 30s,"I have toured the Will Rogers Ranch House many times and always enjoy being transported to another era, thanks to the docents or rangers who conduct regular tours. At the gift shop area, there is a great film about Will Rogers, and it will provide everyone with an overview of this gifted man’s life.There are polo fields and stables on the grounds and I understand that there is a 2.1 mile hiking trail that is a loop that can be done by any age if you stay on the flat bike trail. There are slightly more difficult hiking trails that branch off to Temescal Canyon.The Western art and paraphernalia in the Ranch House are priceless and I especially enjoy eyeing the titles of the many old books in the library. Everything appears to be as it was in the early 30s, with wonderful furniture and a kitchen that was probably state of the art at the time. It’s a great old home to visit. Entrance and tour are free, but there is a parking fee. Please be aware that, although their web site says that the park is open daily, tours are only available Thursday through Sunday. If you arrive on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, you will only be able to walk around the Ranch House and the grounds, but the Ranch House and gift shop will be locked tighter than a drum. So I advise to plan your trip for Thursday through Sunday to see the inside of the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
50,"Wonderful place to picnic, hike, learn history","The park is set near the ocean, so there are always nice breezes and beautiful views of the coast when hiking. There are nice trails that are well marked and diverse. There is a large lawn for picnics, nice bathrooms (real toilets and sinks), and even tours of the historic home of Will Rogers. A favorite place to spend the day! Something for everyone. There are even stables and kids can see the horses. (These are private stables, there is NOT a way to pay and ride the horses.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dance4fun2
50,"Unique State Historic Park, 5 stars","The hiking is unparalleled, the views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina are spectacular. There are a couple of trails that leave from the park but once you arrive to Inspiration Point you can choose to go into Topanga State Park via their trails or go back down into Will Rogers State Park. I chose the first option and only passed one other person on the trail: one of the best hikes I've ever done. The tour of Will Rogers' ranch home is fascinating and educational, there is a short film you can watch before you take the tour which will make it even more enjoyable. Everything in the home is originally owned by Will Rogers. Indian artifacts, saddles, western wear, furniture, china, books, everything. You can take a riding lesson or go on a trail ride. The lawn in front of the ranch house is sprawling and lush. You can picnic here with your family or friends. All this for a $12 fee for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redpatch7
50,The house tour alone is worth the trip!,"My wife and I visited in the late afternoon and just had time to stroll around the house area and take a tour before the park closed for the day. We were fortunate to get a ""personal"" tour (we were the only ones for the last tour) from a docent who knows a lot more about Will Rogers than he can fit in a 1-hour tour. Because we are from Oklahoma, we engaged in a lot of conversation about Will and had a great time getting a detailed look at where he lived in the Los Angeles area.If you're a history/Will Rogers buff, the park is a great place to visit. We also heard that the polo matches and hiking are excellent, but didn't have a chance to try those. The only fee is parking ($12) and it's worth the price and then some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577MichaelK
40,"Beautiful hike, fun house tour.","Take an afternoon and go to Will Rogers State Park. Start with the loop hike (about two easy miles with incredible views) followed by the tour of Will's house, and learn what an interesting guy he was. Did you know his daughter was married to MacArther? Learn why they were in the tropics. Twelve bucks to park, then everything is free. Ya gotta go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margob290
50,Beautiful,"I enjoyed my visit to the park. Polo matches on the weekends, great hiking with excellent views. Stay on the fire roads for the easiest hike. The trails have some steep areas, and you need sturdy shoes if you use them. The marine layer stayed in place while I was there. I'm certain the views can be spectacular on clear days. I will certainly visit again to take the ranch house tour. Great photo ops during the polo matches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7320UP
40,Peaceful retreat in the heart of West Los Angeles,"Take in a polo match or tour the ranch house. Or take a hike, which is what my group does when we visit. All the main trails are easy ""fire roads"" that route roughly in figure 8 loops around the park. Inspiration Point is the climax of the trail, with the reward of a spectacular 360 degree view of Santa Monica Bay and the surrounding coastal mountains. Great place to introduce kids to hiking. $12 fee for parking which helps subsidize the ailing State Park system, although free parking is usually available along the road leading up to the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LightPro
40,Nice park in LA,"Enjoyed break from shops and freeways by taking quick hike to Inspiration Point to look out over City and Pacific coast, caught a glimpse of Beverly Hills Polo exhibition",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flawanderingwoman
40,"Expensive to park, be prepared",While it is a little pricey to park ( so plan on staying for a few hours) it is a huge beautiful park. On Sundays you can watch Polo matches..so much fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fallcolors2
40,A Walk in the Park,"I've been to this park several times over the last 10 years. It has a good amount of walking trails that wind up, down, and around the rolling hills above the neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades and Brentwood. There's not a great deal of vegetation because of the almost desert-like climate, but that's mainly a good thing because it means there are lots of pretty views in every direction, especially looking out to Santa Monica Bay. There are a few benches where visitors can stop and rest, which is probably a welcome relief to those not accustomed to a fairly rugged setting. The downside is parking costs $12 (or is it $15?).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaCasanaSeattle
40,"Early ""Hollywood"" History and a Present Day Retreat","I went to this park in order to hike the two-mile Inspiration Trail that was supposed to have a wonderful panoramic view of the Pacific Palisades area, and it certainly does have a great view! I enjoyed the hike and a group of horseback riders passed me on the trail going in the other direction. The trail is also open to mountain biking, although some diversions from the main trail were closed to bicycles due to some restoration efforts. The Inspiration Trail also connects with a longer trail that is part of the Topanga State Park system for those who want a much longer hike.There were people doing polo exercises on the polo grounds that is there, I saw that this was also a great place to come picnic or for kids to just play around on the extensive grass fields. It costs $12 to park there (which is used to help maintain the facilities, something if not done will cause the park to regress back to the Will Rogers Estate), but there are restrooms and drinking fountains and plenty of parking, so the entrance fee is not out of line.After my hike, the timing was perfect for a docent-led tour of the interior of Will Rogers's house (included in the park admission fee), which was not his main house; THAT was in Beverly Hills, but as roads were dirt at the time, it took too long to travel back and forth, so Will had this ranch as a retreat and as a polo field. It seems clear that this was his favorite place to be, though. The Beverly Hills house is no longer standing.The tour was quite enjoyable and the docent was very knowledgeable about the house's contents and history. There were several wonderful examples of western paintings and sculptures, gorgeously-tooled and silver-decorated saddles, and blankets and baskets and other treasures from various Native American tribes. Will Rogers referred to himself as ""the Cowboy Indian"", but he was well-beloved all around the world, having close friendships with people like Florenz Ziegfield and Charles Lindberg. In fact, after the Lindberg baby kidnapping, Rogers ""hid"" the Lindberg's away on this ranch so as to protect them from the paparazi and to worry and grieve in piece.During the Depression, Rogers was earning half a million dollars a year (you may want to use an inflation calculator to see what the spending power of that would be in today's money), but he gave almost all of it away save for basic living expenses. Apparently he did not believe in having a lot in the way of possessions, and so much of what he had in that ranch house were not things he bought, but were gifts to him from others.Rogers had a several-thousand-volume library of books, all gifts, but he read almost none of them because he didn't have the time (he read newspapers, instead)...but he did write about twelve books himself!It was great seeing this house and its contents, which adds to ones appreciation of this beloved entertainer and personality, and it also gives visitors a peek into this ""early"" period of ""Hollywood"" history when a person could buy 300 acres of prime land extending from the hills all the way over to, and including, the seashore (which is now Will Rogers Beach). And today, what had been a retreat for Will Rogers, can be a retreat for us, to escape the traffic and the L.A. rat race!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasdosborneii
50,I didn't expect to like it but I loved it!,"This used to be Will Rogers' house and ranch. When I saw it many years ago, I expected it to be a tacky, wildly lavish movie star's palatial estate but it wasn't at all. When I saw his living room, it looked like a really friendly place--the kind of place where you could sit on the couch, take your shoes off and kick back. If Will was still alive, I'm sure you could.I quickly realized that given the amount of money that he had (and the time that he had it), he could easily have built something close to the Hearst Castle. Instead, he built a warm and comfortable house on some land that's fun to walk or ride horseback around. Nothing pretentious anywhere. That told me more about Will Rogers, the man, than any biography ever could.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryw799
50,Tranquil setting wonderful history,Parking fee paid on entrance to park. As you enter you see the polo field which is very well maintained and used (we were told) every weekend. There is a small gift shop and theatre featuring Will to view before taking the house tour. The home is vintage 20's - 30's and gives you a wonderful glimpse into the short life of Will Rogers. The stables are also available to view on the impeccably kept grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nurse024
40,Great view of the pacific,Good small trail park. It is a simple and moderate close to 3 miles loop. Great look up point at Inspiration Point. Family friendly park but with a parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinharly
40,"A neat combination of Americana, hiking, views and natural parkland near LA","Although I was aware of Will Rogers, I hadn't really appreciated his importance in early 20th century American popular culture until visiting this park which preserves much of his former ranch and belongings. We arrived on a Tuesday morning and it was very quiet. Threatening signs said we had to pay $12 to park or else, but there weren't staff at the entrance to answer our questions, so we wondered if a visit would be worth the cost.However, we soon discovered the park rangers - they told us the tours of the house only happened on weekends at this time of year, but when learning we were visiting just on that day and were from far away, gave us a special tour of the ranch house and answered our questions about Will Rogers and Hollywood and LA in the 1920s and 1930s. The house is fascinating and contains some significant western art. In addition, rangers gave us tips on local trails and we enjoyed a pleasant hike uphill through native chaparral vegetation to a good viewpoint. We also learned that our $12 entrance fee would get us into other California state park properties in the area on the same day.Bottom line...price turned out to be very reasonable, staff were informative, friendly and went beyond the call of duty to enhance our visit, we learned about a very interesting person from early 20th century history and popular culture, and we had a nice hike. The park is easily accessible by car and trails connect with others to make for longer hikes in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Just remember to keep your receipt if going into other state park properties nearby if you want to keep your costs down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65Rambler

40,Great quiet retreat and views close to town,"The $12 parking fee is a little steep, but the hike is worth the trip.Some of the trails are a little rugged, but the main trails are like roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vao_Fefe
40,a good place to go,"Go here to watch polo.see Will Rogers home, picnic and hike.We really enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mflickermd
40,Beautiful park and Horse-riding stable -but watch out for rangers!,"This is a beautiful historic park with large open field for enjoying the sun and Eucalyptus trees, there are picnic tables and grills, hiking trails and the Westside Riding School stables and riding ring for English riding lessons. They have trail ride horses as well. I have walked here many times and enjoyed seeing deer feeding on the lawn in front of the historic home of Will Rogers or near the Carriage house/stables, which you can walk through. Be careful if driving up the access drive to the stable area at dusk/sunset if you park up there while you wait for your daughter or son to finish their lesson, the park ranger will curtly give you a ticket ($72.00) because you're not allowed to park there. I paid $125.00 for a yearly pass to park in the State Park parking lot, but they are a little revenue-happy there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelmom_fun

40,"Lovely Park, Fun Polo Matches","Ok, where else in LA can you enjoy a lovely park and watch a Polo match? We went on May 8, 2010 and the weather was absolutely perfect. We packed some snacks and sat in the shade and watched two matches. The WIll Rogers polo club plays on Saturdays at 2:00pm and on Sundays at 10:00am. Free, (except for $12 parking). We even got to meet some of the horses. Even if you know nothing about Polo, just seeing the horses race around the field is really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boston-LA
40,A pleasant place to hike.,"Even if you have no interest in Will's house, this state park has scenic hiking without having to drive all the way to Malibu if you live in Los Angeles. The main trail is a mere two miles round trip. While there is not much color to be seen on the hike and it is dusty, you will run across snakes, lizards, birds, and splendid views of the Westside, downtown L.A. (if you can see through the smog), and Santa Monica. Temperatures are high in these mountains so be sure to take water.Parking is $8 for a day pass. Hiking here isn't a must-do for tourists, but it is a nice change of scenery for the locals living in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LordSakana
30,Interesting if you like Will Rogers,"Had an interesting private tour of the ranch house as there were no other guests at the time. If you like Will Rogers, this would be fun. If you don't, it, would probably be boring (my husband and I are both great fans.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osusieq
