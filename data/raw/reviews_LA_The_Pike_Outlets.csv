50,Great place to visit during the day and night!,"We shopped, dined, rode scooters, and went on a short cruise around the harbor!There are many restaurants to choose from, a huge outlet mall that goes on for blocks, a Ferris Wheel, scooters and bike you can rent. We took lots of great pictures of the lighthouse and Long Beach Harbor. We had such a great time we went back the next night!Becki C",Rabecca C
50,Great place to shop,"We only went shopping here once and bought some trainers in Nike outlet. The prices were good, and the stock quite in date (rather than 'really' last season).We parked in the Pike car park a few times, and found it easy to negotiate and reasonably priced.The Pike feels like a great, safe, place to start from as a Tourist and there are lost of restaurants close by. Worth a visit.",RichardN28

30,Not really outlet shopping,Some good bargains to be had at some of the stores but it’s not really what you’d think of as outlet shopping as many of the stores have regular stock as well.Converse is really worth a visit and there’s lots of food options here too,Travelozzy
40,Perfect fun place to shop,"Perfect location to shop, grab bite and explore. Great shopping location near the Rainbow Harbour, Rennaissance Hotel, convention center and downtown Long Beach. There’s even a local shuttle bus that brings you directly to the outlets and some of the best shoppes ie Nike Outlet. For family fun the outlets even have a Ferris wheel. It’s a must visit.",leenylove

20,Very few stores,It is already hard to get excited about outlet stores anymore because they are everywhere but this one is even more disappointing because there are so few stores. Unless you are staying in a hotel right by the outlet I would skip this and find somewhere else to shop.,Susan3181959
30,"small outlet center, but plenty of activities nearby","If your goal is to spend an entire day shopping then this place won't meet your needs its alot smaller then other outlets like the citadel or orange outlets. However, it might be of interest to folks looking for specific stores like the restoration hardware outlet or the nike outlet, H&M.This outlet will suit those looking for a day activity with a mixture of things to do because the following are nearby shoreline villlage, the aquarium, cinemark movie theatre and downtown long beach all within walking distance.There is paid parking here with validation at certain stores",Hoben01
30,"Nice stores, but during my stay, I few shoppers","It is handy if you are staying or live in the neighbourhood. Nice mix of stores, supplemented by eateries and cafes. I went passed by about eight times, and saw few shoppers.",KodoDrummer

50,Great shopping and restaurants.,"If you like your brand name stores and restaurants, you will find a lot of them there. I highly recommend Gladstones's for seafood. The movie theaters have the big recliners, and amazing sound systems. I usually stop by the Sunglass Hut to see what's on sale.",Susy Sailor
50,A Place to Wander,"We had a little extra time so decided to leave the hotel and wander through the shops. It's a small area, but clean and offers a little bit of everything from clothing stores, coffee shops, ice cream, entertainment.",Mimi of 2
20,Disappointing! Not much here! Used to be a fun roller coaster back in the day,"I thought this was the Pike of the 1970's...with its huge wooden roller coaster that went out over the ocean, but this is nothing but shops now and a roller-coaster-looking bridge over the busy street as a memorial, I guess...a mere shadow of what used to be there!",SueSuitecase
40,Something for Everyone,"This is a popular spot with lots of places to eat, a nice big theater, and shops. There are some really nice hotels nearby and is close to the waterfront, downtown, the Convention Center and the Aquarium of the Pacific. You have to try the Ferris wheel!",aaronap7

40,Nice Perk At Our Hotel,"While staying at a hotel at this location, The Pike is clean and a nice amenity to spend some time. There is a Cinemark movie theatre, outlet stores, a Starbucks and plenty of restaurants to choose from. Ate at the Islands restaurant. There is also a city parking garage. It’s not too crowded here, especially on weekends.",Josh P
50,A Place to Chill,"The area was such a nice place to chill out and relax. The Pike is a mixture of: part retail centre, part food court/cafe district, part amusement park and part boardwalk around the harbour.In comparison to everywhere else we went in LA (with the exception of Melrose Ave) the Pike offered us reprieve from the crowds which I absolutely loved.The Ferris wheel offers a pretty good view of the harbour and surrounding area and it’s decently priced.The harbour boardwalk is nice and has kid friendly activities often stationed around that area.The grass-spit by the lighthouse is a cool place to sit and relax with family and friends.",Qwin M
30,Touristy Area,If you are looking for a tourist stop -- this is it. Chains and expensive pretty much some it up. It is sometimes confusing to find locations and would be helped by larger signs near the harbor docks.,AdventureWriterMN
40,The Pike is a wonderful place to site see and stroll,The Pike is a safe place to walk and see the sites. We enjoyed the Buba Gump Shrimp Co. for lunch. There is a ferris wheel that we took a ride on. Many outlet stores & many Restaurants.,happytoberetired

50,Nice stroll,"Beautiful scenery, very laid back atmosphere. Loved strolling around here. The pier is full of life, people having fun everywhere. At the outlet center you can find some good bargains. In the evening the area is also very cosy to stroll around as everything is lighted up, for example the ferris wheel. Lovely place!",Danielle
40,Fun day with the family,The pier offers many restaurants and activities. The lighthouse us awesome and the grounds to walk on are well kept. Great for families with small kids just have to keep an eye out there isn't many barriers to keep u fromgoing over.,cookie V

I expected a lot of last minute shopping. Maybe shopping online...I enjoyed the view and restaurants although many of restaurants closed early. Would go again. Nice place for kids.",Angelia W
40,PARKING STRUCTURE - MESS / FAIL,"I work for an inventory service that has taken me here over the years, dating back to when Borders Books was still there... For the life of me I cannot understand why the parking structure is such a mess... You drive to the end of Bay Street and are unable to cross directly into the structure. You have to turn left or right with NO DIRECTIONS or arrows indicating that you must enter the structure on Shoreline. Once you finally get in it's like a cramped maze. When you do leave there are NO CLEAR arrows to guide you to ""Exit"". And if you end up where Bay Street dead ends at the structure ( see previous unable to cross directly into structure ) you may again not be able to exit onto Bay Street to leave. You will have to circulate more in the structure until you find a way to get out, which might put you out onto a street with a bunch of tractor trailer rigs almost running you over... You would think that by this time somebody with a BRAIN could clean up this mess of a structure where you cannot intuitively Enter and Exit, Where there are strange dead ends ( Example Level 1d ), etc. Or where you might end up in industrial zones competing with tractor trailer rigs, Parking here is a ""Dumpster Fire"" and needs to be cleaned up and fixed. Evidently not enough people have complained about it,",Geoff G
40,Take a stroll,"When we cruise out of Long Beach, we usually make it a point to go to the Pike area to stroll along the waterfront, walk out to the lighthouse, and generally just soak up the ambiance of the area.Mainly consisting of shops, restaurants, and ""watering holes"", the Pike also offers a carousel and Ferris wheel as part of the amusement. In general, it is a great place to ""people-watch"".",LuvToCruise4001
40,Wasn't really impressed,"Lots to do in the shoreline area of Long Beach however, this is essentially a shopping precinct that you could go to anywhere.",JudyandBillG
40,Many restaraunts. The bay view is wonderful,"We have been to dinner in this area many times, and all of the places that we have gone were great! Parking is extra.",Bill Curran
40,"Outlet shopping, anyone?","Nike, Gap and Converse outlets - need I say more? We weren't focused on the shopping for this trip but did get a few things that were very $. Best restaurant is Aulde Dubliner (Old Dubliner) - amazing waiters - kind, friendly, helpful.",Chi-Girl
40,"Beautiful Mall, half empty","In thr Shoreline Village area, The Pike Mall is a nicely architecturally designed shopping area. The storrs there are good, but many are empty. There is s beautiful waterfront park, many great restaurants, but a smsll number of shoppers.",frugalarnie
30,Pity about the empty shops,We used the LB free community bus to access the Pike. Unfortunately the idea of a full mall does not to seem to have reached fruition as many shops remain unleased. Those open (such as Gap etc) are offering great bargains. How about advertising this place via local hotels etc?,ScrabbleAustralia
40,Getting better all the time!,"We have made a number of visits to this area since it was re-developed in the 1990's. With the constant addition of new and interesting attractions, shops and venues, the place just keeps getting better and better!",Jonaleen A
20,Need a lot of TLC,"Mayor please get this mall going great place to put outlet stores, great place to eat but needs a lot of TLC need to fill in the empty spots",Maria Irma A
20,Sad semi empty venue,"This is a poor representation of an outdoor mall. Lots of empty spots. Stores like Nike, H&M, StaRbucks, Irish pub, California kitchen, Gap, phone store and others. Old inventory, staff bored. The outside booths were all closed during our visit there. Too bad this is beside the convention centre and hotels.",conjuror88
40,"Great place to shop, eat at the various restaurants and people watch!","I live on my boat by here so come to the Pike often to either shop, eat, or go to the movies. It is a great venue with lots to see and do, and the people watching is an adventure in itself.",Gary G
30,Shopping,Lower parking prices and maybe more would visit. Please fill empty spaces with shops and or restaurants,TMas777_10
30,"Basic mall, shops outlets. No reason to visit...","No reason to visit unless you're already nearbyBasic mall. Basic shops. Basic outlets. Basic, basic, basic...Not sure if Pike exists without the chain restaurants across the street or if chains exist because of the boring, standard, nothing special, average mall type shopping.",Summerasalifestyle
30,A shopping area that is not too appealing,Lots of shops in the area but not many shoppers. A very quiet shopping centre. It's clean and easily accessible but there is no buzz about it. A few tourists and locals but it is not a must see or go to destination.,tonyraye1
40,Hanging here prior to going to airport,"Basically a shopping area, movie theater near the waterfront. Parking garages, parking was a bit of a pain. Good area to walk and people watch.",5kaddict
40,Concerts and quiet,"I have been there many times since 2010. Music festvals are great, well organized and the area is just across from the harbor. Lots of diffrent foids offered around the area and during concerts.Relaxing there is pleasant too, away from busy city life, a large Farris Wheel near by and the lagoon has peddle boats to rent. Parking downtown is easy. The walk over to the Pike is nice too.A great place to enjoy the out of doors...",nsfalk
20,Very disapointing,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but I have to write this time. The Pike is maybe 8 stores. I don't understand why it is considered an outlet mall, because of the lack of stores. But my biggest complaint was the ladies upstairs bathroom. The line was out of the door because only two stalls had toilet seat covers, but no toilet paper at all in any of the stalls. The paper towels holders were also empty. Ladies were washing their hands, and then shaking off the water onto the floor, making it a slippery mess.",devaandrews
50,Loved looking in the shops!,"Great location for outlet malls near the water lots of good restaurants, and things to do, go bike riding or walking!",Kris K
40,Walking around,We find this place just out walking one night after dinner. This is really a cool place. Like the light house. We enjoyed looking at all the boats. There is a lot of good restaurants around this area.,JRK1970
40,Lots to do near the waterfront,We were visiting the aquarium-but there is a lot to do nearby. There are not a lot of shops at the Pike but they are great name brands. Very convenient to have a skyway from the waterfront. There is also a theater. Several chain restaurants across the street-walk further down to the village for something better.,ElkGroveChris
30,Shopping Center,This is a shopping center with a movie theater and lots of places to eat....Parking sucks and you have to pay for it...,Susan B
50,The Pike,This is shops close to the Harbor. It's pretty much close to everything. I would recommend going if you want to look around.,Margie C
30,Small outlet mall,"A few outlet stores including H&M and Gap. Not a lot of other stores, but a couple of other bigger names. Outdoor mall directly across from the harbour and the village. There were some restaurants such as California pizza kitchen and a buck. Would only make the trip here if you were already checking out the area.",Ero40

40,small outlet with great outdoor views,"One of the local smaller outlets with great views, and a new special event: ""Thirty Thursday"" on top of Nice... 3 breweries offered their best beer - Ballast Point"" and two others - i tasted their IPA's and they where all great. Drawback entrance fee $10, so head on over to Long Beach Ballast point instead for the beer, see my review. MeuterMedia",MeuterMedia

30,Limited Choices for Shopping,"We had no choice, when were taken here on a bus from the Princess Cruise dock. We had to wait about three hours to board our ship because of a previous cruises's noro virus outbreak. The weather was rainy, and we found The Auld Dubliner Pub for a wonderful lunch. There is also a Bubba Gump's. The only store of interest was Columbia's sportswear. We probably would only come back for lunch, not shopping.",Joan H
50,Colorful Fun,"Beautiful and well thought out, loved the Rainbow Harbor and lights throughout the area. Great for a fun vacation or a quick getaway weekend.",deMol101
50,Nice Restaurants and Shops,You have a wide variety of restaurants and shops. Easy parking with valet service. Close to Shoreline and Boardwalk.,southguy
10,Be wary,Walking around here was awful. Skateboarders and bikers are all over the place and extremely rude. They ride where they want and don't get in their way. Saw one almost knock over an elderly man with no apology just laughing. Not impressed at all with this area. Shops are all the same as anywhere else. Not worth wasting anytime here.,roytan1947
30,"Outlet Shopping, Nothing Special","While this shopping center was within easy reach of our hotel, there's nothing special to see. It's basically a mid-sized shopping center with chain retailers like Hot Topic, Gap, Starbucks, etc. There is a cool old ferris wheel you can ride nearby, but the hours vary widely. The ride is $3 per person, so bring cash if you want to ride. If you enjoy a stroll through an outdoor mall, this could be a place you'd enjoy.",Krista E
40,Typical outlet chain stores,"Has a bunch of stores (H&M, converse, nike, forever21, etc.) Not many 'botiquey' places tho. Similarly with restaurants - California Kitchen, chili's, hooters, outback, starbucks... There is a Cinemark theater as well.",offkilter2016
40,Good multi-use center,"With shops, restaurants, movie theaters and access to the aquarium, a waterfront walk, boat tours and trips to the Queen Mary, this area has something to offer just about everyone. Although parking could be challenging, once you've handled that, you could easily spend a day here.",CMN14
30,"Shopping, anyone?","Small shopping venue -- lots of clothes shops (my favorite was Columbia), movie theatre, restaurants, and at this time of year -- an outdoor ice skating rink. There is a public parking structure behind the Long Beach Aquarium. If you combine it with a visit, parking all day is $8. Or if you're in a nearby hotel (my husband and I stayed at the Queen Mary) there is a free shuttle service.",Pandamonium1362
50,"Nice scenic area to exercise, get some fresh air, hit up Pokemon stops...","I like the Pike area. Now there are some outlet stores to add to the many restaurants nearby. Nike, Converse, H&M, Forever 21, Columbia, The Gap, Sunglass hut, Hot Topic, Perfume store, Starbucks, etc... we need more shops though, like Sephora, MAC, Macy's, Nordstrom,....how about Old Navy, Off 5th, Nordstrom Rack?The waterfront area is also very nice, long boardwalk that winds around the Aquarium of the pacific and then it leads you to the Lighthouse park where you can get a good view of the harbor and downtown area. Lots of kids and people also playing Pokemon go here, they are looking for rare pokemons, lol....",1akamai
20,All great aside from the parking,"Started with a movie - nice easy access good sound and comfy seats.Time for shopping. Spent $$$ at Columbia on jackets then headed for the Nike store. Spent $$$ there as well. Starbucks too? You bet a welcome stop.Plenty of other stores to choose from. A pleasant afternoon and a great place for a stroll.So when it is time to go you feel as if you have done your part - spent a ton of money in exchange for the ability to park relatively nearby. Go to the the pay station and find out that even with validation it is $12. Dumb dumb and dumb. So the landlord is a terrific example of corporate greed.Go enjoy the mall. Support the merchants. Based on principle alone, find a way to park anywhere but in the Pike garage.",TFamLLL
40,Wonderful shopping in a relaxed setting,We shopped here with friends while on holiday recently and enjoyed the experience. The outlet shops were diverse and provided good bargains and the lay out of the area was very conducive to relaxed shopping,David N
40,Awesome Place!,"So convenient! I really love coming to long beach and actually staying in the hotels in the area because of the outlets! Just this past weekend I was here for the Halloween festivities and it just so happened that there was an additional piece of clothing that I needed. My hotel literally 20 footsteps from all the shops! Now I needed H&M and thankfully they had one here. Now I won't name all of the shops but just know that they have a nice small collection! There is always the Ferris Wheel that's going along with other activities! I really love that you can even grab a movie during your visit here as well. You know like a one stop shop kind of deal. Restaurants across the street, bars, and then walk over for some ice cream and a movie! Why not?! I encourage everybody that visits in the Long Beach area around the Queen Mary to stop here!",BugattiBoi88
50,Loved this place,"Huge outlet mall with restaurants and plenty of stores, I didn't get to see it entirely because I was pressed for time, but I highly recommend it and will definitely visit on my next trip. If you are like me that likes to walk into every single store, plan this to be an entire day thing.",made1024

40,Great views,"My husband and I walked around and enjoyed the views of the marina, the Queen Mary and the Carnival cruise ship. He took about 50 pictures of the sunset.",veliagonick
40,Fantastic area! Good way to spend a few hours!,"The weather is beautiful, scenery gorgeous, great way to spend a few hours browsing in the stores. Forever 21 & Converse fit the bill for 20-something daughter, and Columbia fit the bill to get some new hiking clothes! :) Parking wasn't too difficult with lots of meters around; however, they do have a parking structure should you wish to stay longer.",AvidTraveler507
20,Waste of time,"Been to many other outlet villages around the states during our travels over the years , usually buy gifts to take back to the grandchildren and treats for ourselves , nothing to buy here , hardly any shops open ,unsure if this is a new outlet trying to attract more businesses but they need something desperately",Jangransutton
30,"Average shopping, difficult parking","This place is a lot light on shopping for what you'd expect in an outlet center. It's ok = average, so you'll not be wasting your time, but parking is a big challenge. Street meters are $2/hour.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
40,Pokemon Heaven!!!,"Apparently, this is the place to be if you're a Pokemon Trainer!!!Rares spawn all the time and there are constantly lures at almost every pokestop...oh yeah and there are a million pokestops...I literally caught over 200 pokemons in a little under 2 hours on one night!There are a lot of people here though so be aware of your surroundings at all times.",Charlaine M
40,Modern small complex,"Nice enough shopping area with a modern feel, probably would benefit from having a few more stores to compliment the current outlets. A big plus point is the cinema with large comfy reclining seats, we wouldn't normally do the cinema on vacation but it's nice to get out of the heat for a few hours and watch a film.",ThePowerNapper
50,Shopping Extravaganza,Everything you need to find is right here and enjoy a movie too! Restaurants are plentiful...and the walkabout makes for great exercise.,Sandy F

30,Typical outlet mall,Make sure you get your parking validated. There really are not that many stores and the Customer Service is again lacking in Long Beach.,Amy C
40,Nice Place to Visit,"If you're in Long Beach and are looking for a change-of-pace, potentially low-cost attraction, this might do it for you. The Pike Outlet Mall includes a few discount outlets, a lovely Hyatt hotel, a few eateries, and a ferris wheel (left over from the time when this area connected LB to its pier). The area itself is nicely designed and landscaped, clean and pleasant to walk around. It's on the free Passport bus line, and is near the excellent LB aquarium, the Queen Mary, Shoreline Village and the Convention Center.",Cando
40,SUNSET OR NIGHTTIME IS WHEN TO VISIT,"There is no shortage of things to do, places to spend money or just people watch. There are lots of buskers at night to bring the place to life. The city often has promotions so keep your eyes open. Really enjoyed wandering around and a ride on the ferris wheel at night is a must!",SenorGancho
50,Nice place.,"There are all these wonderful stores to choose from.. Long Beach now has it's own ""outlet"" in such a beatiful location...",abakerPS
40,Nice area with nice shops,"Anywhere I can find Forever 21 and H&M side by side is awesome for me! The Pike is cool, clean, quiet and convenient and located in a great area.The Cinemark is awesome and there are places within and around the Pike to eat as well.",SenoritaBlackBarbie
50,Enjoyable,"Yes it's a shopping outlet but it's long beach California! Lively cheerful people, lovely weather and lots of choices for meals and snacks while you shop. Best of all of course is the wonderful location! Just across from the ocean, the shoreline village, cinemas, ferris wheel, lighthouse, yachts and moored boats. Truly scenic location!",Amin A
30,Typical Outlet Shopping Mall,"This is an outlet shopping mall the same as you can find in just about any major city. The only difference in this one is the location; it's at the scenic Long Beach Harbor with the Aquarium of the Pacific, Queen Mary, beach, lighthouse, and walking trails. It's clean and attractive, but we were not lured inside to shop when there were so many more interesting things to do. There are many restaurants in the area.",CrankingChick

50,Great Restaurants and Shopping,It is amazing how the City of Long Beach has transformed a once seedy area into such an amazing attraction of great restaurants and shops with a beautiful view of the marina. The amusement park from 40 years ago is gone and the area totally cleaned up. Highly recommended location.,PatrickLongBeach

50,The Pike at Rainbow Harbor,"""Pike"" originally, was the name of a wooden boardwalk connecting the incline of Pine Street, to the, one time Long Beach Pier. It was laid directly atop the sand west along the shoreline connecting the pier to a bathhouse named The Plunge.It grew, over decades, from a simple beach access made of planks to a midway of concessions and amusements. Unimaginably, there were over 200 such enjoyments on the Pier. Henceforth, today's Ferris Wheel, Carousel and Rollercoaster, the ""Cyclone Racer"" inspired pedestrian bridge.The Long Beach Pier and Rainbow Pier both existed, sharing combined shore access at the Pine street incline. Because of its shape, it was named ""Rainbow Pier"" truth be written, it was more of a horseshoe shape. In the late 1940s, the City of Long Beach began filling in the water area enclosed by the Rainbow Pier breakwater, creating today's Rainbow Lagoon.",TGDino
50,Something for Everyone!,"This area at the waterfront downtown offers something for everyone. Whether you want a great dining experience, good shopping bargains, exciting sightseeing excursions or just a peacefully stroll on the boardwalk, it is all here within easy proximity to great hotels.",Ramon G
50,Upbeat and Fun!,"The Pike is great if you want to stay in a smaller area with a bunch of things to visit My boyfriend and I walked around the area at night when most of the shops were already closed. I personally loved it because we didn't have to deal with the rush of people. It was really nice and peaceful with beautiful lights everywhere, and a cool view of the Queen Mary. This is great for couples to have some time to bond and look around, or a group of friends on a sunny day out to walk around, do some shopping, and find some food. There is plenty to keep you occupied!",andaum90
50,Nice Boardwalk!,I enjoyed the boardwalk. Plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you busy for a few hours. Not crowded. No beach.,DougTMesa

40,New Shops and Restaurants!,This place is beginning to be the new hang out area in DT Long beach. There are many shops and restaurants coming to this location! Parking is either meter or in the parking structure. Many places do validate. Hard to find a restroom. This place need better signs.,soko y
20,Not much there,"There's nothing much to do. It is a really nice looking area. You can do simple things there that you can do at your local mall, like get ice cream or shop at GAP. Half of the area is unused space or shops that you can find anywhere. The only reason to go here is for the movie theatre.. Which features a seating chart so you choose which seats you want to sit in prior before getting into the theatre, and the most comfortable recliner chairs in any theatre.Otherwise, unless you wanna catch a movie, it's not worth the extra time.",Milzbury

40,"Convenient Area for Food, Entertainment and Harbor Views","We stayed at the Hyatt Regency across the street from The Pike and had a fantastic view of the harbor and Queen Mary from our room. The Pike is an area of large restaurants, a Cinemark Theater, comedy club, piano bar, Irish Pub, ferris wheel and shops next to the harbor. We highly recommend the Cinemark Theater which has very low prices and reclining lounge chairs. Extremely comfortable way to see a movie! We enjoyed the Islands Restaurant for great burgers, drinks and surfing videos. The outlet stores are currently being built although most stores are open. One night we went to Famous Dave's Bar-B-Que for the Burnt Ends Brisket and the Chopped Smoked Pork. Both excellent ! Expect a long wait at dinner time. During the day, you can catch boats that will take you to the Queen Mary or around the harbor. There is also a boat that takes passengers up and down the coast and makes stops. It's fun to walk around the area next to The Pike at night for beautiful harbor views. Good views of the Queen Mary, lighthouse and hundreds of small boats. There is parking both at the harbor as well as across the street from the Cinemark Theater on Pine Street.",alanmhersh

Contrary to everyone saying how dirty the beach is & the area don't listen until you go first!! My parents who are in their late 40's enjoyed it and loved the beach! Very clean & fun! We stayed at the Hyatt Regency and there happened to be a FREE concert going on across right in this area and it was a fun environment. There is a lot to do here as a family (sibling and I are 20 & 21) and many places to eat from! I suggest doing a bike ride and the harbor cruise. We saw a whale!,Alba V
30,Looks better in everyones pictures,There was a lot of construction so I didn't see the same side of this place as many travelers did. Looks like it has a lot of potential I was there a little early so during the evening it might be better but wasn't too impressed.,Pixtonian

I always check their website before I come. I had planned on coming today to buy some books so I checked their website, no where did it say it was under construction so we made our way here to find out the entire place is blocked off only few stores are open during construction and the book store is gone. Not sure if just being remodled or going to be completely taken out. As there are no signs. Very disappointed and wasted my time coming here.",Viv415

20,Empty Feeling,"We went to dinner at the P.F. Chang's. They validated parking at the Pike, so we stopped by. Other than the movie theaters and restaurants, there is not much here. The restaurants are spread across both sides of Ocean Blvd. accessed via pedestrian bridge. Other than the Restoration Hardware Outlet, most of the retail space is vacant. It is far from the more interesting places to eat at on Pine Ave. and a bit of a hike to Shoreline Village (which is also kind of depressed). We went of a Saturday night and it was not very crowded. It has a very nice parking garage.",Derek O

20,Empty,"The Pike reminds me of an empty Movie set. Everything is bright and shiny and at first glance has lots to offer but in reality its just an empty set. They have done splendidly advertising this place everywhere but it's mostly empty. There are a few restaurants, a movie theater, a cold stone creamery, and lots of empty store fronts. It's not just empty with stores it's also empty with people being that no one was there in the middle of the afternoon. It really is like a ghost town. The best thing to offer here are the restaurants which are located mostly across the street from the main ""mall"" area. Parking will cost you about $8.",TheTravelingKitchen
40,Grand old Lady but showing her age.,"80 years old! Very busy on the weekend of 10/11 due to Long Beach marathon. buying tix was horrendous standing out in withinring sunshine for 45 minutes due to only two tix booths open. Doesn't help to buy on line because yous till have to go to tix booth to pick up. Once we got onboard we had a nice lunch in the cafe - excellent actually and a drink in the observation bar - a blast to the past. Walked the lovely old ship but much of it was closed off due to private functions. Very enjoyable and nice shops. Enjoyed the outer decks. Thought the Dianna exhibit was weird, some lady's tacky souvenirs with a few of the auctioned dresses - not my thing I guess. The ship could use some paint and repair but I would iamgine maintianing an 80 year old ship liek this must cost a fortune. All in all not to be missed when in the area and if leaving on a cruise from the port of Long Beach , make sure you stay at Queen Mary hotel - just accross the parking lot from the cruise terminal. Highly recommend.",Bobotash
20,Like a ghost town,"Walking through The Pike, 60% of shops were empty or closed down.I kept walking and found places that are open and worth visiting - The Pike just served as a convenient shortcut.The foreshore and aquarium are worth visiting.

20,Just a touristy shopping center,"Between downtown and the waterfront, this is a cluster of chain restaurants, movie theater, and shops.

50,Transformation to Excelence,I remember when The Pike was a place to stay away from 20 years ago. They have cleaned it up and moved it to a prominent location. What Wonderful restaurants and Family attractions. The view of the marina and the skyline is breath taking. A Great Place to People watch.,gccamp
20,The poor pike! Such potential,The problem with the Pike it was a victim of beurocracy. This place was left unbuilt for years- reasons which I am not totally clear. When it was conceived it was supposed to be a cool state of the art outdoors mall and entertainment center. However by the time it finally got made it was already tired and outdated. The parking is far away from the location and there is not much to draw people into the area other than convention center folks. If this was being built today and looked more like The Grove in LA it would be great.,Deniselbc

I'll say that again, $1 BOOKS!Parking structure that's actually affordable with validation, which practically every venue hasThat said- there are not really any other stores besides the mentioned bookstore and shops in restaurants. Mostly food, which makes walking around pretty short, or repetitive.The Ferris Wheel is quite pretty when lit, but moves faster than any other Ferris Wheel I have ever seen. It is also in a weird location, so it misses out on wonderful view opportunities and instead just shows you the rest of the center.If in the area, or after a day at Belmont Shore Beach, stop in for dinner and take a walk through after, but don't go out of your way to visit.",Michelle R
50,Nice area. Be sure to visit while in Long Beach,"I stayed at the Marriott Residence Inn near the Queen Mary. You can board the free shuttle service called the Passport, which will take you to The Pike from the Queen Mary side and vice versa. There are a lot of restaurants and shopping. The area is safe with police patrolling the area.If you decide to ride the Passport, be sure to ask the driver if the bus he/she is driving goes to your specific destination. The buses look the same, but they have different routes. I got kicked off the bus in a strange location and had to wait 20 minutes at night for the next bus.",Michael_Tennessee

50,Take your mind off your troubles,What I liked most about this place was the diversity of the people that visited. As I walked along the waterfront I was surrounded by conversations of so many foreign languages. The scenery was beautiful and the sunsets breath taking. This is a wonderful place to take your kids and get a bite to eat then walk it off afterwards. The attractions are a little pricey but if you can afford it there are whale watching tours and the aquarium of the pacific. Parking was 8.00 and that stung a little. Overall the island with the lighthouse made for some wonderful shots of the surrounding city.,Calition
10,Terrible eyesore and ruin of a historic spot,"It was a dark day for Long Beach when this was built. Using the name of the historic Pike visited by people from around the world, developers created this monstrosity loaded with terrible chains bringing gaggles of tourists and rough trade while diverting business from local businesses across the road.If you love chains and places that could be anywhere USA, then you will love The Pike. If you are looking for good food and or local color, avoid at all costs.",Alexander_Designs
30,There are Better Places with Free Parking such a Bummer!,"I am so sorry that this place is going downhill. It was built with high aspirations but unfortunately there isn't really anything special about it. The stores are mostly mundane or sub-par. A used bookstore that looks and smells like a thrift store now occupies the mall's former flagship Borders Books location. And the parking at this facility costs a fortune -- even with validation. IMPORTANT NOTE - the city is so desperate for revenue that if you park on the street for even a minute without a parking sticker, Parking Enforcement will have a ticket on your windshield before you even get back from a parking sticker machine and the attitude is horrible. Go to South Coast Plaza where the stores are great and the parking is free -- even Downtown Disney parking costs less...",Observer333

There are restaurants, shopping, a movie theater, a comedy club, a piano bar & pubs, etc. which were hopping by Friday night. A few closed storefronts. When a convention is in town the place is busy but not so much otherwise. It needs something more to attract people. There is a ferris wheel & merry-go-round for the kids which is a nice idea. It's nice to see at night. You go through the neighbourhood when going to the Laugh Factory or Sgt. Peppers Piano Bar. Ok to see, but nothing too exciting.",DebiDoubleD

30,Good variety of places to eat,We stayed at the Hyatt for 6 days and walked to both PF Changs and Tequila Jack's for dinner. The city was setting up for the grand prix races so barricades blocked off long sections of road. Take the bridge on the second level in front of the convention center and Hyatt to cross to the restaurants. We caught a movie at the Cinemark and generally liked walking around this area. Really wish there had been more shopping than a $1 book store.,Oldhalloween
10,What a mistake,"The city planners messed up on this one. They had a chance to develop a great shopping/restaurant venue where every store and restaurant could've had a view of the harbor and the Queen Mary with a tiered building type of concept with parking under the tiers. But noooooooo. The parking structure gets the views as does the back of the movie theater. The storefronts all look inward at each other like a little closed in mini-city. So like all bad developments, the stores come and go with many many empty storefronts. They should tear this place down and start over.",Marcasso
30,"Mostly restaurants, but does have Piccolo Bookstore, which is cool!","It's kind of a ghost town here. This is a nice, central location, just across the street from the Long Beach Convention Center that offers various dining, but not much in the shopping department. I too came here a few years ago, but it feels less alive these days. I came here to pass the time before checking into my hotel and succeeded in killing almost 2 hours at the bookstore.Pros:- 90 minutes free parking with validation.- Piccolo Bookstore (a.k.a. ""dollar bookstore"") is AWESOME! I spent a few hours there over the course of 3 days. Used books @ $1 each--it's like hunting for treasure to find a book, but it's fun because they have LOTS of titles, new and old!- nice place to walk around, harbor is across the street (across the ""speedway"") plus more restaurants.- Public bathroom near the ferris wheel (south side behind bookstore).Cons:Not much else to do if you're not super into books.",CLaw_9

50,Great Food and Romance,"I love coming here with my wife when we're in Long Beach. There's a lot of great restaurants to choose from. We like to eat at Outback steakhouse but there's also a Chilies, P.F. Chang's, Bubba Gumps, Hooters, Islands Burgers and a lot of other restaurants that we haven't tried yet. There's comedy club called the Laugh Factory and an Irish pub. There's a movie theater, an arcade, and even a carousel and giant wheel. We rode the giant wheel this time around and we took a few pictures of the harbor from the top. The lights from the lighthouse across the harbor make it a really romantic setting. I also like that it's not as crowded like Shoreline Village. The Aquarium of the Pacific is also close by. All in all, the Pike is a great place to hang out when your in Long Beach.",Josue C
