30,Had Fun,"We had fun here, is not a 5 star thing but is fun. The line was small and as well the place was clean, some of the pics required you be on the floor. I love the Trump one. some IlusiÃ³n make no sense or are hard to see, but either way was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yenyok
30,Most enjoyable and well worth seeing - queuing arrangements a shambles - but highly recommended.!,"Thoroughly enjoyable and some great pictures taken both in the Illusions sections and in the Upside Down House. Well worth a visit. Having said this, even with prepaid/booked tickets the queuing arrangemnts for both this line and the much longer queue for 'tickets at the door' visitors is a shambles. Obviously hugely popular but with no time limit for people to spend in the Illusions section, some people are in there for ages. The result is long and sometimes frustrated queues of people as at times, the lines simply do not move - in our case, even with pre-booked tickets, no control over the lines and little information. This attraction needs a better quality of management for both sets of queues. This marred a most enjoyable visit - nevertheless, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellK524GY
40,Good place to visit once,Bit hyped up place. Better to book online instead of waiting in line. Sometimes the customer service could be loud as if they are yelling at you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753nd
50,Fun and adventurous,I really liked the way it was layed out and how they make it really user friendly to get great photos. The lines can be long but it is worth the wait!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCM91061
50,Nice experience,This experience was really nice and different. I was there with my fiancÃ© and we had so much fun. I really appreciated that they had tripod stands available for pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizbabs
40,1-2 Hr fun for kids,"Place where you will take a thousand pics. Fun for kids and adults, especially the down under. It kind of gets packed during mid day or later so better to be there around 10am",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sendtoaby
40,Fun but too crowded,"Overall we had a nice time and got some good pictures. But it was so crowded and the murals overlapped so it was very hard to get pictures without people standing in your way or without you standing in other peopleâ€™s way. Maybe if they let less people in at a time then it wouldâ€™ve been better, but then that would make the line outside longer. It wouldâ€™ve been better if the murals didnâ€™t overlap each other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciagallegos13
30,Museum of Illusions visit,"My kids had a good time coming up with realistic poses to match the scenario that the museum was trying to create. As for my husband and I, we were disappointed in the entire experience. As intellectuals we were expecting something that would stimulate us mentally (a real illusions house). Turns out this wasnâ€™t for us. Now, if youâ€™re into social media and posting a bunch of photos that seems like trick photography then this is for you. Personally, the photos werenâ€™t great because the illusion was obvious by the strong lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sd120315
30,Too long a wait,Pre booked online to view between 4-5pm however didn't get in past 5pm! Qued up from 3.45pm with children under 8!Inside is very small but interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshAllabux18
50,Such Fun!!,I took two 16 year olds and we had a great time. It was a surprise Christmas gift and they loved it! Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antugel
40,"Fun, but crowded","My husband & I had a blast with the regular illusion side of the museum. We also toured the upside down house, but neither of us liked it; it was hard to get any quality pictures. It took about 2 hours for us to walk through and take pictures in both museums.I recommend paying a little extra money to have a professional help you pose for & take the pictures. I wish that option had been available to us when we were there, but they were short staffed and over crowded the day we went. We waited 3 hours to get into the museum even though we had bought our tickets days prior to attending.A staff member, Gino, was absolutely awesome to work with and talk to. He was friendly, helpful, patient, & funny. He made our trip even more enjoyable ðŸ™‚",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vannajones2107
40,Great Photos!!,"The art at Museum of Illusions was beautiful and creative and FUN! The staff on site floated around and was available to answer questions. We purchased the all access pass and visited the Upside Down House which was very detailed and cool to photograph! It became somewhat interactive as we had to ""act"" according to the specific scenes to get the best picture. I gave 4 stars because of the arrangement of the art. We went on a very busy Sunday. We often had to juggle our shots between others because one room had 2-5 murals in the same area. It required the photographer to stand in the way of the other picture at times affecting the flow. Aside from the set up, we thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer33928603592
50,Great experience,The whole family had fun while we walked around taking some cool pictures! Hope to be back again soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluvcandi
40,family vacations,Really fun and unique experience for our family I totally recommend this museum. Only one thing the wait time was ridiculous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vivatj01
50,cool,the photographer was so helpful. he showed us how to shoot the right angle. the whole experience was so awesome and fun. thank you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smcoco0155
50,Escaping Reality,"Our family visited the Museum of Illusions as a planned Christmas excursion. The staff was cordial and informative. Instructions were concise and extremely helpful. Diagrams were strategically posted to make it possible to capture the best moments ever. We could not have been more pleased with our adventures. We were able to ride on the trunk of an elephant, share a drink with the Statute of Liberty, and even balance on the ledge of a big city skyscraper as we engaged with all of the fun illusions. This was just the start. Where else could we travel so many different places and have so much fun in one building? The layout of the museum was appealing to both the young and more mature members of our family, especially the upside-down world rooms. The 1000 plus pictures we were able to take of each other, whether solo or in a group, turned out exceptionally! Due to the interesting angles we were able to create with the tripod provided by the staff (at no extra cost), many of our pictures taken with our personal phones are now the rave of the internet! Visiting the Museum of Illusions definitely created fun memories that our family will be able to share for a long time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mombcop
40,Great fun - Love it,"Would have given it 5 stars, but the wait to get in was ridiculous. Understand they were understaffed because they weren't expecting the ""rush"" the day after Christmas but seemed like they should have called someone in to help. Otherwise, it was a LOT of fun. A little spendy, but we got Groupon tickets so it was worth it. Don't think would have paid full price for it, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynC777
30,2 enjoyable but rushed and expensive hours,We enjoyed our 2 hours but found it difficult to take pictures due to the large number of people also visiting. Upside downrooms were fun and the helpful photographer/staff member did help us take some great pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474ag
50,"Imagine fun, and all the what if's will bring you here! and it was fun!","This was a early Valentines mom and daughter trip to Los Angeles at the end of January. After riding a surfboard with jaws after us. Smelling the flowers of life, running in a Hollywood scene, floating inside a bubble and lastly glowing peace of an Angel. The best angel the Los Angeles Hollywood invented one.(lol). Nothing less than a grand old fun time. Would recommend highly.So much so that we returned later in the year when they now have the upside down room (sort of cool) not as easy to take the pictures. There are new pictures are good not as fabulous as the first set but fun! We will likely return when they change out the pictures. Its fun for all of the family.. All you need is a camera and if you bring your own selfie stick that's the best.Note: Often we go to the Disney's El Capitan Theater that is only one block walking away. Have lunch across the street at CPK (California Kitchen Pizza) and then go to this museum we usually spent about 1-1.5 hours at the museum. Also Hollywood at night can be sketchy so take this under advisement and make travel adjustments as needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreanicu
10,Horrible experience,Our family was excited to see the museum of Illusions. We paid $20 each and weâ€™re shocked to see how badly the museum was created. It was such an expensive activity and we were totally disappointed! The price would have been set right at $8. Definitely NOT worth $20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarap643
50,Good for all ages,"We visited as 4 families with kids ranging from 4y old to 16y old. Everyone had fun. Cool illusions, great insta/ticktock/FB photos. Lovely memories for all and 1h out of rain ðŸ˜€ would come again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlinaM2320
40,If your kid loves acting then itâ€™s awesome,My daughter 10 was excited to create photos. We actually intended on going to the selfie museum next door and somehow walked into this one. It was great fun so no complaints. I was just disappointed that I wasnâ€™t offered the discount that everyone got at the door. Be sure to pick that up when you walk in or you wonâ€™t be offered it. Preferred upside down world over the photo world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591larih
50,Fun experience,"We visited early during the week so we had the place pretty much to ourselves. Initially, I was reluctant to buy tickets since some reviewers wrote that they completed the museum in 20-30 minutes. We were driving from one hour away and didn't want it to be a short trip. We were not disappointed at all. It was such a fun way to spend time with friends and get great photos. The amount of time spent depends on how creative you are with poses for different shots. Since I've never used a tripod before, it was a learning curve. However, David was a great help in helping with the photo angles, pose suggestions, and even took our pictures when my remote stopped working. He kept checking in on us to see if we needed any assistance. He also took photos with their own camera, which they used to print out magnets and such that you can purchase. My friend ended up buying all of them. We gave David a nice tip afterwards for all of his help. After posting photos to social media, many people asked us about this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nton829782
50,You get what you see,We had such a great time what made it funner was seeing the pictures after... Staff are fun and willing to help you take pictures.. We need to go back with other family members,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daliaserrano1101
50,loved it!!,It was awesome. Had so much fun... people were great and the illusions were over the top... spent almost 2 hours in that one room...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1125OQpatc
40,good photo opportunities,"It's fairly interesting, and you end up with good photos. The ""illusions"" mostly only how up in photos, not in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey311437
30,Great place for kids and family,Me and my wife and my family was there on October 11th and it was for both of their birthdays my wife and my son and we had a good time the only thing I would say that you guys should improve is just making the place more bigger it's a little crampy in certain areas but other than that overall we enjoyed ourselves thanks a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1screezzy
50,Amazing,"First and foremost I am from Orange County, California and decided to have a tourist day in LA. Best decision. I had so much fun visiting this museum. Very inexpensive and super creative inside. I do wish it had a bit more rooms but it was definitely a great experience and I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dayzers_
10,Low Budget and Small,"The illusions did not look like illusions, even in he pictures, everything looked fake. The museum is very small, so small that we finished viewing it in 10 minutes. My friends literally were checking to see if there was more to see or if we missed something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamyg3695
50,Great experience!!,Great photos and experience at the Museum of Illusions. Make sure you visit the upside down room during your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion43883661719
50,Great time for reasonable cost!,Had a great time on our mini vacation visiting college daughter ! Something wonderful to do on a budget and short time !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nflsouzas
40,"Cool, but small","There arenâ€™t as many attractions as I thought there would be, but the ones that are there are incredible!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanae242019
40,Good experience/ over priced,The museum is fun to take pictures. But I think is kinda over price if you do both sides. I recommend just doing the illusion museum since is more fun and not too expensive. The upside down is very short and 20 is over priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adriel727
50,Creating memories,Awesome memories made here with my husband and kids. Definitely a place where adults have just as much fun as the children! Everybody wins!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoardingPass784216
40,Very cool!,This was a vey fun exhibit! The photo opportunities are amazing! Me and my kids thoroughly enjoyed our visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyLeeHollis
50,Family visit,It was our first time there. My kids enjoyed it. Staff was helpful and we loved all the pictures. The location is perfect easy parking and price was reasonable considering the amount of artistic work it takes to make it happen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leonel8905
50,Go in the evening....,We walked by early in the day and I wanted to go in but the line was around the building. We decided to go back around 8:30pm and it was very quiet and we didn't feel rushed at all. They have examples on the wall of how to stand and arrows on the floor to show you where to stand to take the picture. It was a really fun time and we got some cool pictures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrieg1982
50,Museum of Illusions,I went there with my cousin and a friend for my birthday. Fortunately I had made a reservation the night before so didn't have to wait in the long line. Inside were various exhibits where the floor and walls were painted. There were a few props. All made terrific photos. How great the photos were is up to the imagination of those in the picture. We could make them funny or dramatic.Also there was the upside down house. In each room everything was nailed to the ceiling so you basically take a picture and rotate it 180 degrees and it looks like you're upside down. Once again the key is being imaginative so to make the pictures look like you're balancing on things or whatnot.I had a better time than I had expected. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarunchaiV
30,Overpriced and Small,"although it was a fun experience, the ""museum"" was too small and over priced for probably the max of 15 mins you would spend there. I expected a little more to do and better illusions. I would wait for next year's paintings as this year's wasn't as cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117arelyh
50,The greatest place to bring friends and family,I had a great time The staff was a great help. Time is the best . He helped me out with my picture taking. The young lady on the register with the piecing was great with telling the rules. The employees make you feel good about the place. I canâ€™t wait to bring my daughter next month. I give this place 10 stars. This is the place to bring your family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janicejmmc40
40,Girls day out,"Had lots of fun. Upside down part could have done without, too confusing as how to photograph correctly to get best results.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jandrews922
50,They have Pro Photographer (Couples need to go VIP),"Good staff. You go with your girlfriend you gotta go VIP and get the delux hookup on all the cool 3d pics with you and your gal in the pics. The blonde guy is a great photographer and made our vip package feel special when I know it wasnt, it felt like it was though. My girl had a blast and more pics to post so no doubt she had a great time. 2316 SCV PWG",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saadi_Salmoon
50,So different! A must if you are visiting Hollywood!,"As soon as I posted my photos from the Museum of Illusions, all of my friends wanted to know where it was and what it was like. It's a completely different and fun experience! I mean, it's just paintings on walls and floors but they are so life-like it's incredible! We added the upside-down house into our visit. I walked in and sat on the floor - i had to take a minute to gather myself and think about the mind-blowing images I was about to take. If I had one complaint, it's that the rooms aren't big enough to capture you from head to toe if you are short. I had my 5 year old with me and i could really only get her from the chest or waist up to make the shot look good. Otherwise - a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer438198
50,Fun Use of an Hour in L.A.,We had an hour to spare in Los Angeles and wanted an unusual fun experience to entertain some guests visiting from out of town. The Museum of Illusions achieved that goal. We really enjoyed it. I would suggest going to their social media pages prior to look at all the best angles and poses so you get the best photos when you visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thebigman8
30,Overpriced,"We saw every nook and cranny and took tons of photos, but we were finished within 40 minutes. We spent $140, ( for 3 $40 per adult tickets plus one $20 child ticket). This is not much value for the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristeend2019
50,Great for the family,My kids had a blast. Very nice time with the family. We were a party of 15 people. I would def recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448pamelal

50,Birthday Trip,It was a birthday gift for my daughter. Her and her friend had a wonderful time. The pictures were very animated. It was a fun experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/t0y85
50,Great Family Fun!!,I recommend getting your RSVP ahead of time- Also it is a great deal to visit both the Museum of Illusion AND the Upside Down House!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyage14132078629
40,Good nice experience,I thought it was bigger but itâ€™s cool The paints are really cool I love them just a little bit more rooms will be great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idalia792019
40,FUN TIME- GREAT PICS!,So much fun! We loved the room with the box that made one person look really big and one look really small. It wasn't too crowded so we had the opportunity to take some fun pictures too. It would be nice if they had a camera stand at each section to make it easier to take photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinebS3302AQ
50,Unlike anything I've seen before! Almost NO LINE at 6pm (earlier in the day the wait can easily be an hour or more),"To thoroughly enjoy this attraction it is to your benefit if you have 'an eye' for 3 dimensional experience. We had a ball. BEST if you can get others to take pictures of you. WEAR SOLID clothing -- my floral print dress did not look so great in the pix. GO ALL in and lean in and make facial expressions.- LOOK for discount code on line (chatting in line with others they saved 20%) The recent code was DiscoverLA - but it changes frequently.- I recommend the 2 for 1 price for both the illusions and the upside down house ($40) vs. $25 each.- For the upside down house - GET TIPS from the staff, the pictures will be WAY better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TereseB_12
40,Something different and fun,"The experience was a different one, a good one I might say we all had fun and have some awesome pictures as memories that we can keep for a long time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4orlandor
30,One shameful photo area,My grandson and I had a very good time at this museum. It wasn't until we came up to a photo-op wall of an ugly caricature of President Trump getting his teeth knocked out in a boxing ring. There were real boxing gloves for the children to use to pose smashing the president's face in. Did they have this for Obama too? I'm curious about that. My grandson said he was not going to try to hurt a President of this country.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coolartetc
40,Fun Family activity,"Fun, interactive experience. But, too crowded and other visitors weren't always respectful of your space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyfromCA
10,The worst experience I've ever had in LA,"Simply put, the upside down house was supposed to be ready on May 25. It wasn't. We drove all the way out to LA just for this. They said they sent 2 emails asking us to reschedule. No emails were ever sent, nothing in the spam folder, nothing in the trash, nothing period. They offered to reschedule us... FOR JULY 13 and that was the only day they could accommodate us on a weekend.No refunds, just reschedule ONLY.We've been calling them every day for a week and leaving message after message with no response back. Emailed them every day, for the last week with no response back.Simply stated, it's a ripoff and not worth the hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8790TRtomp
50,Good place for kids,"This is a neat place. Had fun taking pictures. It is FOR taking pictures. It's not a museum that shows history of the art of Illusions, magicians, etc. It's a hands on picture taking of people standing by murals strategically painted to create illusions museum. That's one part of the place. The other is the Upside Down House where again, one takes pictures in a fully furnished house, where everything is glued to the ceiling. The staff is very nice and helpful. It's very close to the Walk of Fame and all the rest of the Hollywood Blvd stuff. Would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/usernametaken777
50,Nice,This was my first time coming to this museum and my friends and I had a blast. It was so much going on. In a good way!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resort653478
30,Family Fun,Great place to get exclusive photos to show off on social media. A little pricey for a 30 minute experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigator580793
40,Super fun and creative in the heart of Hollywood....,"First off, full disclosure. I live in LA and have for 20 years. However, I love doing the occasional touristy thing. This place inudated by Instagram feed and it looked really cool, it also helped that I had a friend post photos from his visit several months back, so this place was on my radar.I have to say, it was a lot of fun. I totally felt it lived up to its purpose and delivered on what it promised. How many tourist-trap type places can you say that about?All the murals were really fun, the staff was totally chill and cool.I went there with my kids (13 & 10) and we all had a total blast. kudos to the artists that do the murals. Apparently they change them quite often and the staff let us know that the full upside down house will be opening in May and encouraged us to come back.Another positive was crowd control, they were really good about keeping the flow at such a great pace I never felt like I could not get good photos because of you know....people. Everyone was having a great time and asking or being asked to take photos for a couple was never a problem.I'm a fan and I will certainly return to do this again and let others know about a fun way to spend about two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8342FAkarend
40,Fun,I went with my boyfriend on 4/3/19 it was a pretty cool place to go many pictures did look realistic. The staff are so amazing very cool and so helpful as soon as we went in they told us to go outside get a coupon so we can save money I feel like there should be more paintings but my boyfiend and i really enjoyed the experience we had there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vcruz7597
50,Fun!!!,"We visited this museum while in LA for the weekend and decided to do some touristy stuff. Itâ€™s a little pricy but was good fun. They seemed to keep the crowd thinned enough where you could enjoy it and take pictures and they had staff available to take your picture if needed. If you liked a photo you could airdrop it to them and they would make a refrigerator magnet for you. All in all, it was good fun for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1HungryPeggy
40,Neato Memories and Many Posts for the Gram,"We visited the museum of illusion not knowing what to expect. Well, the family had a lot of fun. I enjoyed the art and the setup. The room flows and makes for easy picture setup. The vantage points are clearly marked for awesome pictures. The staff is accommodating and helps with any questions. The museum is about a 2 hours or less visit, leaving time for more exploring around town.I recommend a visit. We have neat pictures for neat memories, and the kids were excited to experience the art. There wasn't an issues with bringing kids, they were louder than normal because of all the excitement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamianDevours
50,Take your time,It was a great place. Super cool just wish we would have been there longer. It was kinda crowded and we went during the week.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shilobeagle2017
50,Fantastic Photo Fun,"I just loved posing for the pictures they have as wall murals. When you see the photo it looks like you are really there. i loved sitting in the bubble while my friend was blowing bubbles, and the balance on the chair catching a balloon was great.Loads of ways to pose and they give you photo samples to imitate, so go and have some fun. I will take visitors there for a fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fran525
50,Sunday Funday,"My husband and I went to the museum of Illusions on a Sunday and had so much fun taking all kind of fun and cool illusion pictures. It was not too crowded even for a Sunday, which we were concerned. Everyone was respectful waiting they turn and not getting in the way of others photos. Fun event to do!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stagemom3
40,Use Those Discounts,"It is definitely something different to do while in the area and fun for the entire family. They have various discounts available for students and AAA members. Our fee ended up being $20 per person. While there were a lot of people, everyone was gracious and allowed time for others to get that perfect shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
20,Save your money,"This museum could have been so much better with a little more creativity and effort. As it is, an hour is.more than enough time to spend there. Too expensive for whatâ€™s there, even with the Yelp discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396lauriek
50,Something different,This was great fun and something I had never done before. My 11 year old daughter loved acting in all the scenes. We rented the tripod for $5 so we could all be in the pictures - I used my apple watch to trigger the phone to take the pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858marisaj
50,Pictures,"This is the perfect place to take some fun pictures. Get creative. Everyone that is there goes for the same reason, so feel free to ask strangers to take a pic for you so your whole group can better in it. Take someone else pic, offer as you walk by. Yes, it can get busy. Fear not. Be patient and have a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/majelr
40,Really fun and would recommend,"We really enjoyed the Museum of Illusions, it was hilarious to look back on the pictures! It was so much fun and the staff helped out with pictures too so we got some pretty good ones! Only thing I would say is there isn't enough there for the price personally. We got mega lucky because it was really quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isabelcmoore
50,Photo Fun with Painted Scenarios on Floors and Walls,"I was taken here as a birthday surprise and boy did we have fun! My date paid the extra $100.00 for the VIP treatment, which included a gift bag and a staff photographer to take pictures of our adventure. I believe that paying the extra $ was a huge benefit because Roman, our staff pic taker, knew the right angles to create the right illusion. He took about a hundred pictures and then sent them to us to download. Now we have stock images to use as party invites, Christmas cards, etc. We got there early in the day to find parking and it wasn't crowded in the museum, so we had time to set up our shots and help others create theirs! What a great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickwilliamsontravel
40,A bit overpriced but fun nonetheless.,"My friends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon to check out what this place was all about. Luckily, we were able to find parking on the street (free) and so we only paid the steep $25 entrance fee. The place has a lot of cool paintings to get creative with but it was notably humid inside and even with the blowers they placed in different areas, it was a bit uncomfortable. Iâ€™m not sure if the A/C is always out but Iâ€™d recommend waiting for a cool day to do this. It gets crowded and the place is not terribly big so it gets warm quick. The crowd is patient though and we had no problem doing all the photos we wanted. It took about 45 minutes or so to go through them all. Iâ€™d suggest to go early in the day or go late. Mid day seems a little too crowded. Overall, we came out with some unique, fun pictures. We will not be coming back though because the price just seems high for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,"Fun place, can get busy","There is a per person admission fee. It does get crowded too. So, after paying to get in, have fun and be patient. Spend a good part of the afternoon in there while having fun and get your creativity going while there. Youâ€™ll get some great shots and you donâ€™t have to pay for someone to take your pictures, thereâ€™s more than enough people there who are ok with taking your pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judzv2016
10,Creepy man taking inappropriate pictures of young woman,Has anyone noticed this man hanging around the Museum of Illusions in Hollywood? Wednesday night he was caught following and taking inappropriate pictures of my daughter through out the museum. At low angles. Her boyfriend confronted the man and saw he was deleting 44 pictures of her butt. They spoke to the staff who did nothing and dismissed them. He seemed to be friends with the staff as he was hanging out and talking to them in a foreign language and laughing with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer1801
50,Anniversary Day Date,This place was pretty rad! Definitely gotta be patient! Lots of fun photo ops! Better to have a few people with you or rent a photo stand to hold your phone. If you donâ€™t have a large group then bring a selfie stick!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914mamaj
40,Great pictures,"There were four of us (one being a teenager who LOVED it) that spent about an hour on a Saturday afternoon with lots of patient people squeezing around one another to take the perfect picture. There were about 18 backdrops to stand (lie down) in front of. Would I go back again...probably not. The price was a bit high and at this time (7/2018) Groupon has a discount of $5.00 off per person Mon-Fri. There is a discount of $1.50 per person on Sat & Sun. There was a woman with two small children and a toddler, bad idea because the toddler was wanting to go everywhere and the woman couldnâ€™t control her while taking pictures at the same time. Iâ€™d like to see more backdrops added. We had a lot of fun and walked away with great pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_kmen10
40,Looking for something different?,"So much fun! Great for people 3 yrs old to 83 years young ðŸ˜€ The optical illusion paintings are amazing. Would love to see this place expand to offer even more illusions. Make sure your phone is on full battery, because you'll be taking lots of pics. Wear comfy clothing. You may find yourself sitting ... or laying on the ground for some shots. Bring friends. This is best done in groups up to about 8 folks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep868
50,Let's stop here,"Walking down the famed street, I peeked into the door and said, ""let's stop here."" $70 later (2 adults, 2 kids) we managed our way through the museum. This was great for photo opportunities and we giggled the whole time. If you're on a budget, you may not enjoy it as it seemed like only a 30 minute visit. If you're into laughs and photo fun, it is well worth it!Don't want to post too many pics to spoil your fun! A staff member kindly took our last photo in front of the City of Angels mural.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreastcancerRN
40,Pricy but fun,"It was too hot to walk on the Walk of Fame, and museum of illusion was a great place to take a break from the heat and have some fun. It is pricy but fun for family. There are many different background we can use and most of them have guidance picture to show you how to make a pose and take a picture. Not many people were there and you can take plenty of photos, but still finish in less than 1 hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiniAPB
50,Fun fun fun,We did the VIP package. It was so nice to have a photographer follow us around. He was more than happy to use use our phones camera as well as his own. We had so much fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820dival
50,Sensory delight!,"I took my friend here for her birthday. I wanted to find something cool to do with her, having to keep in mind I have a new 5 month old baby. We had a great time taking pictures and finding creative ways to incorporate the baby. We went during the week on a afternoon, so it wasn't very busy and the staff photographer was able to help us with a few pictures. He was very nice. I would say hiring the photographer package would be worth it as you would get all the pictures and the would be photographed correctly. Also you can't beat being able to include everyone In the picture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caribbeanmamma

We came on Monday afternoon so it was not that busy, the stuff was very nice and they helped us and took photos for us. We had so much fun, some of the paintings are so cool and some were so funny so we couldn't stop laughing. We spent there more then an hour and took about 100 pis! Bring your friend and definetly your imagination",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drobach1995
50,It is awesome place! It was so much fun.,I loved this place! It was so much fun. I went with a group of friends and we had a blast. We went during the week so it wasnâ€™t too busy. We were able to take our time and take a bunch of pictures. The staff was super nice and explained everything in detail. They even have a photographer that walks around and helps you take pictures. This place is great for kids and adults. I would totally recommend that you visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Q377TL
