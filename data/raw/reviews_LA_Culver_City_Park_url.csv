50,Nice workout!,"If you are athletic or just like to do moderate walking, this trail is a good one. There are multiple trails to take including ""The Stairs"" which are very challenging. The trails are moderate hiking. You can push a stroller up the hill on the street...but the best part of all of this exercising is what is to behold at the top! A glorious view of the city of downtown Los Angeles to the East or the ocean to the West! The mountains to the North which completes a majestic view includes Century City...you can rest up there and take it all in before heading back down. There is parking on the street with some meters or parking up at the top for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeane141

40,Nice park but drones should be forbidden,"This is a very nice park with something for all ages with several different areas to enjoy. The only downside I've noticed is that there is no security person or supervisor on duty at least on the upper field. Last month while I was there a man who was parked on the other end of the field next to the baseball diamond was operating a drone. He was flying it around the field and while I was talking with my friend that I came with, the drone almost hit me in the head. If I hadn't ducked at the last second it may have been more than a close call. I then yelled in protest across the field to its owner who continued to operate it. Unfortunately there was no Parks and Recreation staff person on duty to report this to.Coincidentally, that night I viewed a segment about drones on SoCal Connected which is weekly program aired on PBS. The program was very informative and spelled out the scary facts. 1. That most people that operate drones do not have any training. 2. You do not have to have a license in order to operate a drone. 3. There are very few if any restrictions on their use other than they cannot be flown within a certain distance of an airport. Alarming but true!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549richs
50,Great for walking around leisurely,"The wrap-around, snake-like, ramp is nice. It's an easy walk, quiet. Not when it happens, but people can also do some ""rock climbing"" there as well. There are a couple baseball fields, soccer fields, you usually see people out there playing around. There are some nice, steep stairs where you can get more of a workout in. The view from the top of the ramp is nice. The other great thing, there is free parking. Across from the parking lot, there is a dog park. Down the way from the dog park, off Jefferson, there is a great play area for kids, and a basketball court. It's a nice place to visit for sure when you don't feel like doing the culver city stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennysL7322WY
40,Having a view of the city,Beautiful place on the top of the hill from where you can have a city view. You can go up by car or by the stairs. There is a sport field on top and places to relax or enjoy the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vi2011jan

50,Great authentic outdoor activity,A great gem in a very busy city! Great to exercise with a ton of locals (not a bad thing). Very safe!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janed556
40,More than meets the eye on this hillside,"Park is a loose term here as there are Dog parks, skate park, hiking/walking trails and sports fields! This spot has it all. Lived and worked in the area for 5 years now and glad we have this. The skate park is newer so nice and smooth and designed by a Local Pro shredder Ngoho. You will find him shredding often as well as Tony Alva and others who may want to ditch the tourist trap Venice beach(thought that SkatePark is bigger and better). The pool here is the key to happiness as most of the little scooter kids stay away!The Dog parks here are great too, one for little guys and one for big guys! We had come here with our Pup Pepper but he ahs finally passed with old age.Now we will come here for the kids playground as our Son grows up! The kids playground is small but packed with cool stuff to keep the kids moving!The oddest thing about this park are the rope courses they have towards the top. Never looked into using these(assuming its special events or training for some dept)Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reverantone
40,Nice Hillside Park ...,"I was in Culver City recently and had heard about the hillside park, so my pup & I paid a visit - Nice. It's doggie friendly which is especially great, we used the leash though. I loved the hilly features of the park with layers of neat wooden steps. Nice city views up top w recreation areas. A little hidden jewel! .....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,love the new lower picnic area,family picnic. Love to take the kids to the new playground and picnic under the shade of the eucalyptus trees.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickr847
30,Nothing Special,Just a park near a cemetery that you can spend some time making sports. I was there for a quick run after eating and drinking a lot! It was near our hotel and this is why we visited it. Doesn't worth the visit in other cases.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547gustavov
50,Surprising gem,Very spacious park with amenities not always found in our parks. Restrooms and water fountains were all open and thankfully there are many garbage cans throughout the park with bagged liners. This obviously helps to keep this park clean and mostly free of littering.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmetcalf54
50,Great park in a hill!,"Culver City Park is very different because its amenities are located in different levels of the park as the hills go up the mountain. First you will find the Skate Park at the level of Jefferson Blvd. Then you will see the playground, picnic area and basketball courts. As you go up you will find the entrance of the wooden boardwalks that take pedestrians up to the hill. If you keep going straight, you find the dogs enjoying the Bone Park. One leve up they have a soccer and baseball field with a lookout from where you can have a great view of Culver City and Los Angeles. On the highest level they have two or three baseball fields and walking access to the Baldwing Hills Overlook.It is a great park to your workouts, enjoy great views and see your kids play sports.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayra-EstiloFamiliar
