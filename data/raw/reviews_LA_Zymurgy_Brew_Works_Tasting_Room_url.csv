50,Nano Brewery in the South Bay,"We had a fun and educational beer tasting at the Zymurgy Brew Works in Torrance. It's a small brewery where you can taste their beers or make your own beer. What a fun idea for a party! They were really nice and glad to educate us non-beer drinkers. We were on a tour of three breweries, and Zymurgy had our favorite beer of the whole tour (Hazy IPA) and we ended up the day buying a growler of it to take home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joycie0274
