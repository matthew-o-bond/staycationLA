50,3 yr old Birthday Party,"The day EXCEEDED my expectations in ALL ways. My 3 year old Granddaughter had a planned Birthday Party at Pump It Up. Beginning with the perfect time (for a 3 year old) we were met at the door to assist the unload and they did all the set up. The staff was ready for us, happy to see us, and there was no confusion. They were very experienced with children of this age and made for a perfect party. They were able to move it along at the perfect pace from beginning to end. I especially liked that they had additional interests for a bit younger and a bit older guests.We progressed to lunch, which was ready, and cake, in a room well decorated and ended the day with all smiles.A perfect solution for a large crowd and I highly recommend this Facility.Thank you to the staff for all you did.",johnpL7028PA
50,Best birthday party for my 4 years,Absolute gem of a place for kids. The place is well laid out and very contained. Also the attention to cleanliness is superb. The staff has always been very attentive to the kids.We had our son's 4th birthday party here and it really could not have gone better. From start to finish everything was superb. They helped unload everything from our cars and take everything down afterwards. They also did a beautiful job with the set up. It was the first birthday party we have hosted where we truly felt relaxed and were able to enjoy it because they took care of absolutely everything. And the kids all had a blast!Overall this is a truly incredible place for both free play and for birthday parties. I can't recommend it enough!,ritz

50,Rock on Birthday Party place for kids,"Pump It up ROCKS! We have been here for couple of birthday parties and each time I've been impressed with the level of service by the staff. It's a cool space and you get transitioned from one room to another and then to party room. Glow room, glow necklaces, inflatables. They do a fantastic job!",Andy S
