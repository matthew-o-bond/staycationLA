40,A good experience attending The Talk,"I came here last month to attend a live taping of The Talk. While I haven't regularly watched the show on TV, when we were in Hollywood we got the chance to grab some tickets so we thought it would be fun.The instructions said to use a parking garage about 5-6 blocks away, which we found without an issue. We parked and as we walked out, CBS had a shuttle bus waiting to drive us to the entrance gate to CBS. After passing through security, we checked in, and then were pointed to a room to wait in.This room was a nice waiting room, with a board telling us who was on the show, plus a life-size cut out of the hosts and a photo booth to take photos with the shows background. Once it was time to head to the studio, we were directed to walk through the lot, and ended up lining up along the studio's residential street, which was very cool. We got to stand right outside the house from American Housewife!After about 20 minutes, we entered the studio and were given our seats. We were seated on the left side with a good view of the center stage, where the whole show took place.One very cool item to mention, this is the only TV I've ever been to that allowed us to take photos of the set. Usually cameras and phones are banned, but here, they actually gave us a chance to take photos. They just didn't want photos during the show itself.The show was fun. The comedian was decent, and he would talk a lot with Sheril during the commercial breaks. Unfortunately, she was the only host to interact at all with the audience, the other hosts just ignored us. It was a bit offputting, considering how much they want the audience to participate in the show. That being said, it was still a fun experience to be a part of.After the show ended, we were given some free giveaways that were mentioned during the show. We got a free book, some Metamucil, and a gift card for Walmart. We then walked back through the studio towards the front gate, and I ended up having a nice chat with one of the security guards. She was very friendly and not scary or offputting at all.Once outside, we opted to walk back to the parking garage, since it was a nice day. The show had validated parking so we didn't have to pay.Overall it was a fun experience. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 was because the hosts basically ignored the audience. I don't expect a personal reaction with everyone, but it would be nice if they at least acknowledged the audience instead of ignoring and using their phones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobOnLocation
