50,Near Cruise Ship Terminals,"I get a surge of excitement, when I see this amazing green bridge. It's the iconic symbol of the busy port of San Pedro. I know that soon I will be aboard my Princess Cruise and on my way for another vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
30,A place to watch,Watching the traffic cross the bridge from the harbour was interesting. We were on a cruise ship so reasonably high and close enough for a good view. It was interesting to see how long it took the container lorries to get across from one dock to the other side. Guess it is a strange hobby watching traffic crossing a bridge but we enjoy it. We did not actually need to cross the bridge so cannot comment on a drive over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday-view23-7-11
20,Scared of heights?,"I have a panic attack just getting near this bridge. I realize many people love this old bridge, but if you're scared of heights and a really old structure filled with semi's coming in and out of the port ....eeeeh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephtc
50,My favorite bridge!,"I love this awesome bridge because it reminds me of going over when I was a kid... there's so much to see and you feel like you're flying over water, ships, and industrial areas. The bridge takes you to and from the wonderful towns of Long Beach and San Pedro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8fish2017
40,L.A.’s answer to the Golden Gate Bridge!,"L.A.’s answer to the Golden Gate Bridge! If you enjoy big bridges it’s fun to look at and drive over. Watch the huge container ships sail under and check out the cruise ships at the nearby cruise ship terminal.Not a destination, simply part of the harbor scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Bridge Over Troubled LA Waters,My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt in Long Beach and needed to get To San Pedro for a cruise. The ramps and access to the bridge are under construction and you need to be careful. Views for the persons riding with you are of an industrial and busy port. There is not much more to say about it. Bridges are bridges. This one is no special deal at all.There is no toll. Be careful not to miss exists or getting on by mistake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardS778
50,I Love Bridges!!,"Driving over this bridge was so cool! Yes, it's just a bridge, but you get to see the huge cargo ships coming into the port or being loaded/unloaded.The new bridge was under construction, but it looks amazing as you drive past it. Such a massive construction project! Can't wait to drive over this new creation when it's finished!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhlegmMaster
40,Interesting Seeing New Bridge Construction While Driving Across Vincent Thomas Bridge,We were staying in San Pedro and drove across the Vincent Thomas Bridge again several times. We like the views from the bridge area. They are slowly working on a replacement bridge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,A beautiful and graceful bridge across the river.,We had the opportunity to cross the bridge several times going between LA and Long Beach. It is a great attraction and provides incredible views both east and west as well of the port facility. Take the time to traverse this bridge and you will not be be disappointed. .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
30,Scary. Sagging section?,"Maybe it's an illusion, but it looks like there's a sagging section on the west face near the left truss. If nothing else, looking at that bridge and the port operation, gives one the sense of it's strategic importance to the city and the nation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
30,It's a bridge,Not sure how much more you can really say about it. You can see the city Skyline from it which I guess would be the highlight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricP278
50,Scenic Vincent Thomas Bridge,"We have driven Vincent Thomas Bridge a number of times. It is in the Port of Los Angeles area.The bridge first opened in 1963. It is named for California Assemblyman Vincent Thomas of San Pedro. The bridge links the area of San Pedro to Long Beach area.It was the first welded bridge in the United States.I like the bridge due to personal reasons such as:1) We have driven it from Long Beach to San Pedro so we could stay at the Doubletree Hotel prior to our cruise to the Mexico Riviera. As such, seeing it reminds me of delightful vacation to Mexico.2) We also liked seeing it from our cruise ship The Great Outdoors cafe of the Norwegian Jewel. We had a wonderful view of it on our first day as well as our last day of our Mexican cruise. We had breakfast with the bridge and port area as our back ground scenic view for our breakfast.If one is going out on a cruise from the San Pedro area, one will see the Vincent Thomas Bridge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,"See the Port, Ships, Harbor & Long Beach ...","Yes, it's just a bridge but you get to see so much from it when your down this way - the port, harbor, ships, the Iowa and Long Beach, pretty neat. The curving bridge is also fun to cross and the immense harbor facilities are endless. Interesting! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,More than just a bridge!,"A quote from Port Of Los Angeles web site""In 1996, the Los Angeles City Council declared the Vincent Thomas Bridge as the City of Los Angeles’ official welcoming monument.""At first, I was a little surprised to see this bridge listed on Trip Advisor. But, after a little thought, decided its presence is well deserved, even though the average Joe might not go out of his way for it. But, if you like engineering/bridges or are already close to the area, then this is an almost must-see. Actually, if you are in the area, it would be quite difficult NOT to see it! Wherever you are going, if you can use this bridge to get there, do think about it as an added extra. Perhaps you might be heading for the Aquarium of The Pacific in Long Beach, as we were at the time.This really is a very impressive bridge indeed, either looking up at it or driving over it. It impressed the HECK out of me and I was pleased I wasn't driving so I could really take it all in. Slow moving traffic helped with this. What makes this particular bridge even more special, apart from being BIG, is its graceful curvature, both horizontally and vertically. Crossing a straight, flat bridge, car passengers are rarely able to see the the full majesty of even bigger bridges than this one. But, here, you can't miss it. Be sure to take some photos - it's well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John-Tropi
30,Just a bridge,This is No.Big.Deal. It's just a bridge that saves people time. It's not iconic like the Golden Gate nor historic like the Brooklyn Bridge. JUST.A.BRIDGE.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
30,nice bridge,"I didn't plan on reviewing this, but saw a couple of reviews.I saw it from the port and the cruise ship. It is a massive span and appears to handle a high volume of vehicles. It should be a great place to view the port and I think many slow just to see the view. I say that because it looks as if the outside lanes move very slowly over the span.If I had a vehicle I would probably cross just for the view, but I don't recommend crawling over it as it can cause gridlock and safety issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryG668
40,Bridge with a view of the port and harbor,"I used to cross it daily to and from work. I always love to see the harbor sites. I miss the bridge, back in the days when I could see it from my house. A nice landmark in San Pedro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBsleepsurveyor
