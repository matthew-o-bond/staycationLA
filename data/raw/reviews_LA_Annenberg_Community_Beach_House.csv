50,Beach club you don’t need membership for!,"This is an absolute joy. There was a need for a place with ample parking, a cafe, pool, clean bathrooms and showers for the kids, a play area and the location couldn’t be better.A wonderful addition to the Santa Monica beach",khochajee
30,WHY?,I know that sounds bad...but I am still wondering why the built this. There is a pool....very narrow and long and often filled with screaming children. The community house itself is reserved for events.,airbrush1212

50,The Essential SoCal Summer Experience! (Best on a weekday),"This place is FANTASTIC! If you plan your day right, you could have the PERFECT SoCal summer day here. Really... perfect!If you reserve your parking ahead of time (which I strongly recommend), it's $12 and you can get in starting at 8:30am instead of the 10am general admission. It was SUPER convenient and easy.The window to buy tickets for the pool opens at 9am and the pool opens at 10am. We got there right at 8:30am and only steps away from our parking place was the breakfast cafe. It was fantastic! A bit pricey... like almost everything is $17... but there are tables ON the beach. So we could eat, watch the ocean while our kids played in the sand. It was glorious. You do need have everyone with you when you get your tickets, but since we were there right at 9, there was no line and we came with a friend, so they watched our table and we took turns getting tickets. Mondays are HALF PRICED!!! So $12 for adults and $2 for children. After breakfast we played on the PLAYGROUND which is (you guessed it) RIGHT THERE!!!People line up to go in at 10am (I'd have someone in your party get in line a bit early, but really everyone was fine). Go in and pick out your spots! There are tons of lawn cots and umbrellas to shade from the sun.When I first saw the pool I was like, ""okay... it's fine"". But then you are in it, it's HUGE and the ornament and detail... it's the closest thing to being able to swim in the pools at Hearst Castle! Really.There's a small ""splashed"", but it's not great. Like 4 holes squirting a fountain. Not exciting. But everything else is awesome. You can bring food in. So you can picnic here! There is a restaurant if you need it. The beach is right there... so you could hop back and forth from the pool to the beach to the playground and back again. I saw a sign for a game room, but I didn't see it. Also, there is a museum just next door that gives FREE tours!It's just a magical summer place! Do it!",Michael T

40,Attended an event here,"I was here for an event, so that is how I would rate it. The facilities for an event are good. It is on the beach, which means if the weather isn't cold and windy, it is good to lounge for a break. I didnt take advantage of the pool or other facilities, but it was again a basic meeting location with a nice view.",TravelingBbusFun
50,a day at the beach,"I love this place for SO many reasons. All the amenities you need for a full day at the beach. Clean restrooms, a cafe for lunch, and after a day of swimming in the ocean you can have a final dip in a historic pool. The facilities at the pool are very accommodating, with lounges, tables and shade. While not living in LA, I have spent my day on the beach, had a beautiful lunch, a dip in the pool... Then I used their facilities to shower and get dressed to drive to the airport and board my plane. You reserve a time to use the pool, if they are at capacity, they will text you...""time to swim"".",Ms Maney
50,Great Place to Hang out in the sun,"Very comfortable patio open to the public with chairs, tables and umbrellas, clean restrooms. There was an outdoor pool but it had a cover so not sure of hours.

50,Great Place to Work on My Day Off!,"I have been looking for a place on the beach to have a ""Desk Day"" when I'm in LA. I hate LA and have been exploring it for the sake of being able to visit my sister and college friend. They live in the foothills, but I need to be by the beach. Annenberg Community Beach House is far better than the food stall about 1.5mi south on the beach. There was a private event at the pool and viewing deck, but I made do with a picnic table and then in the cafe. This will now be my go-to place for having to work on my day off while visiting my sister in LA.",Ian D
50,perfect for families,We took 4 children to the Annenberg Community Beach House in June. The water is a long walk from the Beach House which worked out nicely with the toddlers. There is a restaurant adjacent to a sand playground with an outside shower for cleaning sand toys and sandy children/people. It was a great place to take the children for a beach lunch or breakfast. Go early because parking is limited and costs $12 per day.,7Alexandra7
50,Very nice clean beach in Santa Monica,"I attended an event at the Annenberg Community Beach House, which was my first time. Easy parking and great location in Santa Monica (right off of PCH). Very clean facility and beach was nice and clean too. There is food nearby and a nice play area for kids to enjoy too. Overall was a very nice experience and would recommend to anyone coming to the beach.",mcorbin560
50,Beautiful swimming pool-right on the beach,We spent the first half of the day at the swimming pool. It was beautiful with attentive life guards. They limit the number of passes sold per day so it’s not crowded. Plenty of beach chairs to go around. They allow you to bring food your own food in but there’s also a restaurant on the property that will package your meal to go so you can take it back to the pool. There are picnic tables on the second level with a view of the ocean. We happened to visit on a Monday-half price. $9 total for myself and 2 teenage girls. Can’t get that bargain anywhere-let alone in SoCal! Highly recommended!,OhioLove2travel007
50,Wonderful day outing,"If for nothing else, one should visit the Annenberg to see and to swim in the beautiful pool that was designed by the architect Julia Morgan as part of the original beach house for Randolph Hearst. It's wonderful to spend time with family and friend and especially with children.",GOSIA P

Before the breakwater was built, the water went right up to the house. Just imagine that, thank Santa Monica & the Annenberg's for making this a public space, and dream away.",dirkj0t

Comfortable parking and the IDEAL location for a wedding, party and event of any kind.

From the Back On The Beach cafe, the fabulous pool, excellent snack bar, clean restrooms and that little walkway over the sand to the ocean, this is a wonderful place to spend a day. If you know you're going 2 days in advance, you can reserve parking in the lot (!) and make a reservation for the pool too. There's a gallery, you can take yoga, volleyball, and paddleboarding classes--there's more to do at this place than just hanging out at the beach.",phantomframe
50,Perfect day at the beach!,"I was so glad to find out about this wonderful place! We came with our 2 girls and my Mother, sister and niece. Perfect day! We had breakfast and lunch at the lovely beach cafe, food was very good considering it was a beach cafe. It was sunny yet breezy. We brought our own umbrella but the had umbrellas and chairs for rent.We got very close to the ocean on the perfect white sand. There was a school of dolphins swimming super close to the shore! It was magical to see them jumping and frolicking!Just a note, the breeze makes it feel cooler but the sun is super strong! Even with sunscreen we got burned. Also even sitting under the umbrella at the cafe my back got burned with an open back sundress so be aware!They have convenient showers at different heights for showering off the sand, super convenient to use with little.kids and the water is not freezing like it often is on beaches. There's a nice little playground as well. A great day to spend a family day in LA!",ohdonnaoh

There are lifeguards on duty. Bathroom is clean. I would just like to request putting more water fountain to drink. I only saw one and it was even clogged that day. Overall, this is a very decent family beach place. Keep it up.",Bukopop
40,Excellent place if you go with small kids,"Awesome beach in Santa Monica. Perfect parking /$3/h, $12max, and not too crowded during the week - and BY FAR not as busy as any beach near the Santa Monica pier.Good to park, great beach access, reasonable prices for food and beverage. Very clean bathrooms.Downside: Many kids though, due to the Annenberg scholarships and workshop classes there.Sadly, I wish the food was as good as the ambiance. Was OK, the fries could have had more time in the oil instead of waiting (= slightly under/ slightly cold ;-) - but unless you come with small kids who enjoy the zillion other kids around, this sure is not a place you would go ""because of the food"". I still give it four stars - as again, if you have kids and want to have a nice beach with a nice ambiance and nice service, this is the place to go.Other than that, I would have instantly 10 points to raise how this place you dramatically enhance their customers experience and double their gross at no cost. So if some one from restaurant management reads this, we should definitely talk.",GuidoKarp

40,A Little Known Santa Monica Historic Gem,"I am biased. I got married here. One of the happiest days of my life. So needless to say I highly recommend it for it's romantic oceanside location. But here's what most tourists don't know. It's the former home of actress Marion Davies, mistress to none other than tycoon William Randolph Hearst, whose architect built her mansion in the 1920s and which had 100 rooms and was bigger than most hotels. The mansion is long gone but the guest house remains -- which is just as big as a modern day mansion and open to the public. It contains historic photos of the original gargantuan mansion where all of Hollywood royalty -- including Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable -- used to visit and swim in the olympic sized swimming pool. The pool is still there and open to the public. Thanks to philanthropist Wallis Annenburg, who procured a 28 million dollar grant, it has now become one of the city's greatest landmarks, where everyday citizens can wax nostalgic, dine at the restaurant, play beach volleyball, swim in the pool, take in various art exhibits, host business conferences ... and recite your wedding vows.",Paul R
50,Party on at Annenberg Community Beach House,We had our anniversary party in the modern Sand and Sea room. A lovely view of the ocean from this space. Plan to watch the setting sun. The indoor outdoor space is clean. The staff is friendly. I did not like the chairs we were required to use. You are only allowed to serve beer and wine/no hard liquor.

There is very limited parking, and always special events, hours and restrictions to visit.There's a restaurant and bar attached. A small playground area and outdoor showers. There's also some equipment rental for the beach. I was really just here to swim.",unprocessed_cook
50,One Of The Best Beach Clubs on PCH and You Don't Need a Membership,"Our friends have thrown more than one party at the Annenberg Beach Club. They pre-sell the parking which is important to get if you are going. You can rent spaces for your event and it isn't expensive at all.

I think the place is great!!!",FlyersFanInLA
40,Pleasant place for a picnic,This is a public beach house and there's no charge for use of their facilities except for the pool and parking. Each will set you back approximately $10.

50,Fantastic perk for Santa Monica residents and overall fun for families,"Annenberg Beach House sits along the Pacific Coast Highway in the middle of a stretch of beach clubs in Santa Monica. The facility includes a swimming pool, event spaces, the historic Marion Davies guest house, a restaurant next door (with takeout bar) and direct access to the beach as well as convenient parking (paid daily or hourly). There are also well maintained bathrooms and changing facilities. Santa Monica residents can make advance online reservations for pool and parking passes as well as canopy rentals. The pool is supervised by lifeguards as it is relatively deep/does not have a wading area for kids. The pool is child friendly, however, and there is also a splash pad where small children can play. Especially during summer weekends, the parking lot can fill up quickly so best to arrive early in the day.",Christina L
50,Great place to relax when not exploring LA but arrive early to avoid disappointment,"We visited this twice during our stay in Santa Monica and had very relaxing enjoyable stays making use of the pool and beach. For a relatively low price you purchase one days access to the pool and other amenities at the beach house. You are given a wristband so can leave the pool area to play on the beach/in the sea as often as you like. Its clean, the pool has plenty of lifeguards and entry numbers are limited so even on a weekend its not too busy. With that last point in mind, my experience is that all wristbands go by 11ish and you must have all people who want wristbands with you when you make a purchase. ie one party member cant go on down an buy wristbands for all.",Jason S
50,Great place for families,"The Annenberg Community Beach House is right beside the beach and provides an alternative to ocean swimming if, for instance, the ocean is too cold, or too rough! It has a huge pool, deck chairs, and provides tables to accomodate a picnic lunch as well...you can play on the beach and then take a time out to pool swim and relax in the shade. The Community Beach House is right beside the 'Back on the Beach' restaurant...and iconic LA destination in itself! Sit in front at a table right on the sand so the kids can dig while you sip wine and sample the delicious menu, or sit inside by one of the huge windows in the cool of the shade (though all outside tables have big umbrellas). Either way you have a killer view of the ocean and a lovely, relaxed place to have a meal or snack.. There is ample parking with reasonable hourly rates.

The Beach House is beautiful, the pool is the only thing you have to pay for, nominally, like $10.00 obtainable by reservation or walk-in.

For only $8 you can park and enjoy the Community House/Pool, restaurant and Marion Davies Guesthouse. The the old Hearst pool is just gorgeous! A docent gave us a free 30-minute tour of the historical landmark - very fun : ) If you've already visited Hearst Castle consider this Part 2 of your visit.After the center, we walked the bike path across the beach to the pier, about 1.5 miles.

40,Excellent Beach - not crowded,We visited this beach on a weekday in early October so not being crowded is to be expected. The outdoor pool was closed. The children's play area is very minimal. Not what we expected for our 2 yr old grandson but no real problem as the warm ocean and beach were the real draw. There is a very nice boardwalk that gets you out to the sand. Parking is $3/hr which is a lot more than at the public beaches. This might be a big help in hot weather however when getting parking at the beach can be a real problem. Didn't eat at the cafe but it looked nice. Overall a nice location for a day at the beach.,Connie W
30,A tour of the Marion Davies Guest House,"We had a delightful and knowledgeable docent to guide us through the house and there are ample pictures on the ground floor to add context to the stories about the life of Marion Davies and her paramour William Randolph Hearst. However, the overriding disappointment is that the house is virtually bereft of any furnishings from the time of Davies’ residence and thus it is impossible to get a true ‘feel’ for what the house would have been like in its heyday. It is commendable that this imposing property is preserved for the public’s use, but as an historical artefact it lacks atmosphere and more than a passing fascination. I am not sure we could recommend it as a ‘must see’.",Hugh_Christina_S

It was a great place to park the rental car for the day, have a nice spot to eat lunch, place for the kids to play, and restrooms. Because the parking lot was so close to the beach I was able to make several trips and leave a good portion of our belongings in the vehicle and still have an easy time getting it.

50,Glorious beach haven..................,"Historic beach home brought up to date..............great pool,art activities,music events, etc.It offers a quiet place to view the ocean and people watch the bike path travelers.Former home of Marion Davies and Mr. Randolph Hearst.... the guest house remains of the original property. Tours available.....",FranChasen
30,A simple beach fix,"Look this is not a gourmet restaurant. But if you want a simple burger or chicken salad, it is perhaps the only place on the coast where you can actually feel the crunch of sand under your feet LA does all it can to prevent us from actually walking on the sand. The stretch of perfectly groomed and totally unpoulated beach off Santa Monica is proof of that. So if you just really need a simple beach fix, just go, with low expectations, and you will feel better for it.",Michael's travels
40,"Oceanfront, friendly with great food","Like many L.A.-area attractions, the Annenberg Community Beach House has an interesting history. The beach house is the former estate of actress Marion Davies. She and William Randolph Hearst hosted numerous parties attended by Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo and other such celebrities. Today, the family-friendly oceanfront beach house is open to the public for playing on the beach and swimming in the pool. There’s a gallery and café and did I mention it's an oceanfront property?",nirmal1976
50,I am completely in love with this place,"Attended a kids birthday party here. We had the run of the place between the birthday tent setup on the sand, access to the beach and the pool. It has a private club feel but the public walks freely through there and that is also one of the best things. I had visited about 1 year early in another capacity (memorial for a friend) but we were in the community center rooms and not on the sand. I would definitely think of this place for my own entertaining but in the meantime I will hope that I am invited again to an event at this lovely place.",dexter619
40,Great Venue,We rented the facility for a large group function and the staff was great overall. They also catered in great food. Overall a great venue for a day at the beach!,scottw
50,great place for a wedding on the beach,Attended a wedding at Sunset on the beach. The location was excellent and the house was beautiful. The back of the house has a porch which was used for the wedding and the stairs on each side to hold the bride and grooms close friends and family. Could not have been more perfect/,JMICHAEL
50,ANNENBERG BEACH,"It's a great place - seems like a private beach - beautiful pool for children and adults alike. Can spend the day there - visit The Marion Davies former home - William Randolph Hurst gave it to her. She had many famous visitors who spent time there. A little café is near the pool for burgers, salads etc. Wonderful, clean and safe place. There is a fee, but can't remember what it was - not much and you pay a little for parking. Otherwise, delightfulA trip back into time.",VendellaS
50,The Beach Club for All of Us,"Love this community beach club. Great food, a pool, rentals, dining on the beach while the kiddies play on the playground? Family bliss. Parking can be tough on popular days like weekends and holidays, so get there early. In the summer swim reservations are a must. Or just bring your picnic basket and head to the waves. Great for younger kiddos, and making new friends.",Kellie H
50,Swim by the beach,My kid loves this place he had so much fun. We have a pool in my condo complex but it is still fun too pack a lunch and have a fun day at the pool with other social people. I like that it is upscale but not snooty.,Erica R
50,Great Place!,I took my son to the Beach House on a Sunday and we both loved it! I reserved parking ahead of time. I definately recommend! It was easy to reserve the parking spot and pool passes online. When we got there they moved some cones for us and we got front row parking right next to the buliding which was great so we didn't have to drag our beach stuff all around. The entire place was nice and clean. We used all of the ammenities. The pool and chairs were nice and the boardwalk to the beach was great! We used the game room upstairs (nice break from the sun) with free board games and ping pong and we used the upper deck to eat lunch. It was nice that you could bring your own food in plus there was a nice resturant with take out boxes as well. The spash pad was nice for smaller kids and the playground on the beach was great and shaded!I can't wait to go back!!! Best public pool/beach house experience I have ever had! I felt like a true SoCal girl!,LindsyF
50,Tribal Gathering for 50th Wedding Anniversary,"This is a wonderful setting, just beyond the California Incline and walking distance to the Santa Monica Pier, with a very pleasant and attentive staff, and very tasty catered food service.",r-j-r662
50,Great spot,"A very unique location to spend time on Santa Monica Beach. It is an entire complex which consists of a cafe, art center, community pool and historic house that you can tour. Call before coming to see what's open. Pool is beautiful. It is a community pool. Cafe is perfect for a lunch. Right on beach. Check when tours are of the old Marion Davies house. There is limited on site parking.",Boca062
50,Public yet private,"Spending a day at a Santa Monica beach doesn't have to be daunting! This is the place to park your car and your party. Although we didn't use many of the amenities offered here, it was so nice to have a ""paved"" path to the shoreline with reasonable beach chair rentals at the ready. As a very family friendly area, there was joy all around as everyone enjoyed the waves.",LizzieHeff
50,Poetry at the Annenberg,"This glass beach house, open to the public, is a beautiful venue for cultural events. I recently attended a Red Hen Press sponsored free poetry reading featuring Garett Hongo on a Thursday night. You need to call to reserve parking for events as parking is limited. There is a casual beach cafe on site where you can get wine and a light dinner. Sunset over the beach and mountains is spectacular.",Susanwt
50,A wonderful find,"I came here because my church that I attend to ""Oasis LA"" had a community event for their baptisms. They worked alongside Annenberg Community Beach House and it was not only such a wonderful time, but it was very well taken care of. The beach was very clean, people were friendly, and most of all, staff was quick, direct, and very helpful with the questions we had for them. All in all, if I ever had a family of my own, I would definitely come here.As far as money goes, the only thing I remember paying for, was the parking. Other than that, it was great.",Brian

50,"Amazing place, if in Santa Monica you just got to spend a day here","We were in Santa Monica for 4 days of downtime and sightseeing as part of our Californian road trip. Our hotel didn't really have a decent pool so I had googled beach clubs in the area. Annenberg beach house came up trumps!. Not only has it the most beautiful heated pool with exquisite mosaics and the fanciest pool steps, it is situated just on the beach, beside a beach restaurant, beautiful historic guest house (owned by silent movie star Marion Davies) museum and has play facilities on the beach and indoors for kids (table tennis, table golf, Jenna, twister etc.,) it also has an eating area if you want to bring your own food, changing areas, locker facilities, water fountains and all for $10 per adult and $4 per child. pool area is well kept with umbrellas and there are 3 cabanas on the beach if you wish to use them also. They only allow a certain amount in each day and you need to be there by 10.30 to have a reasonable chance of getting in that day. Bookings advised at weekends. They have a $1 splash Mondays were it's just $1 in also. Go it's fab",suks
50,Wonderful place to start a beach day,"This is a really nice place with children. There is a playground and a water attraction (just a large fountain kids can run through). They also have clean bathrooms. You have to walk about 400 yards to get to the actual beach but if your kids want to play in the sand and you want a beautiful view, this is great. There is a parking lot that costs about 10 a day next to this venue. You can make a reservation to have a spot by the pool in advance as well.",travelingworkingmom
30,"On used the ""Free"" parts","Don't be fooled. You can easily drop $40 here.The Parking is $12, all other parking in the area is $10 so not a big difference. I think the easy access to a sidewalk almost all the way out to the water, clean bathrooms and showers is worth $2.The beach isn't too crowded and generally clean, although beaches in CA are sadly littered with trash.There are 3 canopies that are free on a first come basis, none were actually taken. The problem though is that you can't take them down to the water, they stay next to the beach house.",RoxannePT
40,Community beach house in historic location,"The Santa Monica Annenberg Community Beach House is the only public beach house on the coast. This is a quieter stretch of the beach, perfect for beach parties, meeting friends and spending time with your family. There are volleyball courts, a children's play area and a lovely pool (the pool has a nominal charge). For fans of silent movie star Marion Davies, be sure to check out her guest house on site. There are free tours on weekends led by Santa Monica Landmarks Committee docents. And there's a great LOCAL restaurant on site--Back on the Beach--perfect for weekend brunch and lunch dates!",88jet88
40,And old fashioned community pool,"How often does an organization take a beach mansion and turn it into a community center? But that's what happened here. The historic beach home of Randolph Hearst's mistress Marion Davis was converted into a community center. The best part is the pool.For a minimal fee, you can use the wonderful restored swimming pool all day. They have great dressing rooms, and lounge chairs, and even a few shaded cabana type spaces. (you have to arrive pretty early to get those)Right next door is the wonderful restaurant Back on the Beach with a handy take out menu. Or, you can eat there and keep your toes in the sand. And, just a few hundred yards away is the ocean. Go run across the sand, dip into the sea and back to the pool. What more could you ask?",Judy S
50,You Want History ? Here is history.,On the beach this property is maintained by the city of Santa Monica and a Foundation as a community center and historic site. The 5-acre oceanfront site upon which the Annenberg Community Beach House now sits was originally developed during the Gold Coast era of the 1920s by William Randolph Hearst for actress Marion Davies. The guest house and pool still are in use.,paul_nancy1

50,Gorgeous facility,"Go check out the Annenberg facility ... we saw it shortly after it opened and were really impressed. It's got a fantabulous lap pool, lounge chairs and rooms for seminars and such where people can host/attend workshops and such. everything looks clean, stylish, modern and inviting. I can definitely recommend this place, it's right on the beach. Parking could get icky on the weekends, so come early if you can.",Skinmeister
50,Conference here was a hit!,"I attended a 2 day conference here; the food was excellent, the location perfect, though the scenery was slightly distracting. An overall excellent event. I loved that you could check out volleyballs and other recreation equipment to use on the beach; a great way to unwind at the end of the day!",jschombe
50,One Way to Visit Santa Monica Beach,"Park readily, enjoy a wonderful, big, clean beach, have a nice beach burger. Great for kids. You don't have to join a club or spend a bundle. There's a pool and places to change. Very close to shopping in Santa Monica, but feels like its a million miles away.",Richard R
50,Worth a visit,"If you are looking for a few hours to chill by the pool, this is perfect. The beach is pretty windy so this is a perfect excuse to find some shelter and relax for an afternoon. Food from the cafe is great, although a little pricey. Perfect for kids.",Karen S
50,Don't miss the Marion Davies Beach House,"The new Beach House is terrific - beautiful pool, children's play area, and a boardwalk to the edge of the shore. Don't miss the Marion Davies Beach House next to the Annenberg Community Beach House - a great part of Hollywood history!",Redhead1566
50,Elegant throwback to civility,"Family oriented community beach house that will take you back to a time of relaxing civility. The Annenberg Foundation has produced a true oasis from the rat race with this facility. Clean, well staffed and managed. Free cabanas make for great childrens birthday parties (but don't bring balloons, they are not allowed).",131Joanne131
50,Great space!,"The refurbed Annenberg Community Center is pretty cool. A kind of ""tony"" beach club with a small pool north of the pier. Great place to have a snack. Yet another one of those former homes of rich people the tax payers have inherited.",Ruben C
50,A good day by the ocean in a historic setting,"This is definitely worth a visit and not at all like your ordinary public pool. We went on a weekday as to avoid the crowds. They do have dollar Mondays and discounted evening swims if you don't feel like forking out the $10/adult $4/child fee. The pool is warm (heated) and clean. Also, the pool deck and facilities are very clean. There are tours of the Marion Davies guest house, but unfortunately we did not make it on time. The Santa Monica Pier is walkable. Also, the onsite cafe has decent meals and fair prices.",Blumagoo
50,The best public pool you'll ever see,This beautiful public pool was once part of a grand estate and retains that aura while availing it's services to the general public for a nominal fee.,RLGalloworth
40,Great location,You won't find a better location - on the beach. We had a business dinner there and the food was pretty good. Marion Davies guest house is next door but it isn't anything extraordinary. No attempt to provide period furnishings has been made.,fussylady001
50,History + Cool,"Few know about Annenberg Community Beach House - I've booked two groups into the Space and gone to enjoy it with friends - so have experienced both ways to enjoy this unique locale. The Miriam Davis-beach cottage is a cool remnant of Hollywood history -- if you've been to Hearst Castle, you need to see this place. The new, sleek building is awesome, the pool (also remains from Hearst days) is wonderful. There's a great beach restaurant in front of the property - go there on Sunday morning for Breakfast, dig your toes into the sand and remind your snow-bound friends how you're living the life in SoCal!",Pamela-Peony
50,Public private club right in my 'backyard',"The Annenberg is an amazing place. It has extraordinary history to it, is right on the beach and is basically free. William Randolph Hearst and his famous actress mistress Marion Davies called this strand their home. The original guest/servants quarters survived as did the pool which have been lovingly restored. There is a modern building standing in the place where the grand manse once stood (55 bathrooms!) The original home was torn down years ago. G bless Annenberg who decided this should be a 'club' on the beach open to all. There is a fee for parking and pool (check website for details) but if you just pull your bike off the bike path there is no charge at all and you can just hang out, take a tour of the house, let the kids play in the small playground or grab a bite at BACK ON THE BEACH and watch the world by the sea go by. There is city WIFI here so if you are working on your next great novel...pull up a chair and research and write away. There is also a nice little boardwalk that extends toward the sea making it easier access. There are showers, etc. as well. Very civilized. They also rent out the spaces for special occasions and meetings and they offer classes like YOGA and Synchronized Swimming. All in all have to tip my hat to the Annenberg Foundation. They did the city and it's inhabitants and guests a real solid in making this happen.",AFoolForTravel

50,great day at the beach,"on th site of one of Santa Monica's former Gold Coast beach clubs Wallis Annenberg has made yet another wonderful contribution to her city by transforming the space into a public beach club which suits all generations.

Great pool, that tends to get very busy no matter what tie of dayStaff can be a little upppity in not allowing sun-beds to be moved to follow the sun - they must stay put!!Beach house is wonderful, However it closes shortly after Labor day - No good for the traveller who comes in Mid Sept expecting to spend a day poolside - Post labor day only open weekends therefore gets mobbed, waiting list to enter",ANDI S
40,Family time,"It's really awesome to finally have such a great beach facility in Santa Monica, open to the public. The pool is great and families seem to really enjoy switching back and forth between the beach and the pool. Vey clean and nicely designed interior. It's also available for private events.",Bitil
50,Must see,This is a fascinating place. The docents love working there and want to tell you everything about the history of the house and it is fascinating. The pictures and the giant ipad thingy can keep you there forever. This is a really cool place to visit.,Brock M
50,Convenient and accommodating,A great resource -- everything in one spot and a real walkway across the lengthy beach,outwood80
40,Nice Tour,"I saw this beach house the last day I was in LA. I did the tour of the Marion Davies and Hearst Guesthouse. It was good, unfortunately it was a bit overcast when I did the tour. The Santa Monica Conservancy run tours of the guest house.",bilby2009

Now you can swim in this downright spectacular pool. Yes, the original one David did. The have a little lunch stand and everything. There are children in the pool, but they stay a the shallow end. We went on a weekday at about 1 and it was just great. Bring your own towel, but they provide lockers and a lovely clean changing area. A must for summer fun",Supa-Andra

50,"Wonderful location, informative docents","I went to ACBH on Jan.8, the birthday of Marion Davies. What a delight! The docents were dressed in period clothing as well as some of the guests. The information about Marion Davies was enlightening and well presented. Going to the beach was so much fun, to come across this gem of an attraction. I'm so happy to have gone and I hope to return as every docent seems to have their own way of telling the wonderful story about Marion Davies and her beach house!",I-triptravel
50,My German friends loved it.,"It was a beautiful morning to enjoy the beach. We were there early, so the Guest House wasn't open for tours yet, but we were able to enjoy the Club and the Gallery.We had a short time to see more when the house opened and they were able to enjoy a few stories from the docent before heading to the airport for the return trip to Germany.I have heard from them since and they have told me again what a treat it was to see such an unexpected Southern California location.",TravelerQuest
50,Beautiful day at the beach,It's free! This tour of the Marion Davies guest house takes you back in time when the wealthy had glamorous parties at the beach. The tour gives insight into the personal lives of Marion Davies and her companion (34 years older) William Randolph Hearst. The photo that are shown are terrific. The architecture of this building is beautiful Drv as well as the engineering feats that were accomplished in that era of time. A lovely visit with well informed docents who volunteer their time to show this historic beach house.,sixxmom
