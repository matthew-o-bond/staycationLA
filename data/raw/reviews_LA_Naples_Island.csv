But this is definitely a nice area for a stroll looking at the high-end houses, the boats and the water. And last week there were also lots of Halloween decorations.

The homes are multi-million dollar homes but are right on to the canal. There is all different types of architecture to see and the residents are friendly as you walk by if they are on their patio.

It's nice to kayak as well, although the water in the canal is pretty low so you don't get the same view of the houses and mostly just see boats and the canal walls. Canals are a little narrow, but we didn't have any issues with passing boats.",Cris4412

30,Kayaking Naples Island,"We were visiting the south coast area for a few days with family and were looking for an outdoor activity. We rentied some kayaks and paddled around this bay for about 2 hours. It sounds like most people just spend one hour and kayak around the small canal area of Napels island. It was interesting to view all the expensive cute houses along the canal we do a lot of kayaking so it only took us about 1/2 to do the whole thing, so we paddled up the canal to were the map said there was a wetlands area. We paddled for about 1/2 hour- about as far as you could go up the canal and if there was a wetlands with birds, we could not find it. We did see a few patheti looking birds sitting on an oil containment barrier with a bunch of oil wells in the background. We the paddled around Naples island even though they don't recommend it because the canal is wide and has much bigger boat traffic. It was a weekday during early spring so there was not much activity. We spend another 45 minutes paddling around the outside of the island and back to the beginning. It was an OK outdoor activing for the Los Angels area but not that great.",JLarquier

At Christmas time the residents go all out to decorate their homes and it’s a fabulous show, not to be missed. On July 3rd, the City of Long Beach hosts free fireworks in the middle of Alamitos Bay. It’s a major attraction. The sunsets on the bay are spectacular.There are several ways to enjoy cruising the canals: rent a Duffy party boat from Long Beach Rentals, or a gondola imported from Italy with a crew member paddling for you while you enjoy the view. Duffy’s are great because they are enclosed so even in winter you can enjoy yourselves and not be cold. You will encounter paddle boarders, water cycles, kayaks and canoes. Everybody loves getting out on the water. The residents are friendly, waving to everyone.We own a Duffy and spend many hours cruising Naples and Alamitos Bay. There are a number of nice restaurants on the bay, accessible by boat.

50,Beautiful place to stop off and explore,Parking was easy in the middle of the Island and then it’s a short walk in any direction to the canal.

40,7 minutes in a car or 60 on foot - 22 by bike,"This review refers to the part of Naples south of 2nd Street... This quaint boating-driven community provides an opportunity to create a lovely tour of a unique canals-oriented lifestyle in the southeast corner of Long Beach. Homes’ styles vary from original 1920’s cottages to 21st century modern mansions. Strolling along the waterside boardwalk(s) gives glimpses into both homes and patios which is a friendly way to greet the people you are looky-looing!! The streets are mostly alleys behind the residences, so driving around means you get the idea of the garages and an occasional peek at the bays and canals. Biking is the way to cover territory both quickly and completely - not to mention efficiently, if time is a concern. There is an annual boat parade at Christmas that draws a huge crowd, and all through the holidays folks walk Naples to admire the lovely decorations competing residents use to add to the seasonal celebrations. Similarly, neighbors from the general area pop over to watch fireworks sent up by nearby businesses from along Naples’ Parks and walkways. Crowds picnic and wave at passing boaters enjoying the summer holiday. So -hint - if it’s a weekend around Christmas or the Fourth of July, park 2 miles a way and call a ride share.",Char H

Turn onto TIVOLI off of 2nd Street, and it dead ends at the tennis courts. There is typically plenty of street parking there, and the canal is a short walk east down St. Irmo Walk. Walk either way around the island, and you'll eventually get to the park where you can have a lovely picnic and watch the small boats and kayaks around the canal, and the larger boats go by outside the canal entrance.There are usually people with dogs around too!

You'll love the magnificent homes, the boats of all kinds, gardens and the friendly residents. Compliment the homeowners on their homes and you'll be in an enjoyable conversation with the locals immediately - you might even get a tour of home.

For some of the canals, there is an alternative way to go around the stairs and up a ramp, but not all.The canals are extensive, so feel free to spend as much time as you wish! There are sweet cement benches scattered here and there, and there are always ""just right"" cement or brick or stone planters that are okay to sit on for a quick rest.No bicycles or skateboards!

50,Naples Island a hidden gem in Southern California,"I am one of the lucky few that grew up on Naples Island. My parents moved there in 1951 and I started school in kindergarden at Naples Elementary School. Naples is a real island connected to the mainland Long Beach by two bridges. Within Naples Island is another island called Treasure Island.The Naples area is the host to the original Long Beach Marina. The Marina was built in the early 1960's and is in the final stages of a complete rebuild.Every Christmas, Naples hosts a boat parade that circles the island and goes through the canals of Naples. The residents of Naples decorate their homes with beautiful light displays.Naples is located adjacent to Belmont Shore, an area of shops, restaurants and bars. One of the more famous bars is Legends, the original sports bar built in the early 1970's.There are fantastic restaurants on the island. Knowing all of the owners, I am not going to single any one out other than to say they are all fantastic. The pricing goes from coffee shop to five star.The closest major hotels are in downtown Long Beach. Long Beach Transit has buses and in the summer a water craft providing service from the downtown hotels to Naples. Uber or Lyft along with the local Yellow Cab provide easy access to Naples from the downtown hotels. Across the water from downtown Long Beach are the Queen Mary and Hotel Maya. Both are unique hotels and again public transportation from them to Naples is easy to get.The City of Long Beach also has a public bicycle system that allows one to take a bicycle from downtown to Naples for a minimal charge.Gondola Getaway provides authentic Venetian Gondolas for rides around the island. Grab a bottle of wine and some salami and cheese and enjoy the sights.There are also kayaks and standup paddle boards available to rent. For a family ride go to the Boathouse restaurant where there are electric boats for rent that can hold 8-10 people. This is a great getaway for couples and families. When you are in Southern California plan on spending a day or two in Naples.",Charlie L

40,Look at the Rich People's Houses!,"Nope, we're not rich and never will be. But, we know where the rich folks live! There's a ritzy area in Long Beach where it's cool to kayak in the summer and fun to look at Christmas lights in the winter. Naples Island really is an island with lots of canals and streets where you can easily get lost if you don't pay attention to where you're going. In the summer, there's a nearby place to rent kayaks, so just get one and leisurely paddle around while dreaming that you live in one of those multi-million-dollar homes. In the winter, it's way too cold to be in the water unless you have a boat, which would likely mean that you yourself live in Naples. But, it's pretty cool to walk around in December to check out all of the elaborate Christmas decorations. On certain evenings, there are carolers singing and hot chocolate for sale. It can get very crowded, which actually is half the fun! Also, there is a boat parade in the middle of December, so it gets even more crowded on that Saturday night. Would I want to live in Naples? Nope, but I like to visit there once in awhile.",patty49er
50,Beautiful place to kayak.,"We spent an hour kayaking through the canal and gazing at beautiful homes and boats. An hour was plenty of time, but more would have been fun too.",jlthorn1

50,Christmas lights and a wonderful walk!,"I grew up in Long Beach but hadn't ever been to Naples for the Christmas lights. We took our kids and walked along the canal, pleasantly surprised at the effort homeowners make to decorate for Christmas. A great way to get outside and enjoy a southern California evening, with or without children. The only downside is finding parking!",MES767
50,Great Neighborhood to Stroll Through,"We strolled through the canals and neighborhood just after New Year's on a rather cool afternoon. It was wonderful. Many people had decorated for the holidays, so it was fun to see all the decorations. I can imagine it's a wonderful place to visit during warmer weather when there are people actually boating in the canals. Each home is unique and it was fun to see so many different styles of homes.",VicksVaporRub
40,Nice walk,"Nice neighborhood to walk around. Beautiful, unique houses overlooking the canal. Parking can be tricky, you park on a side street. Remember where you parked, it's easy to get turned around.",ncjc2013
40,A beautiful Island,Visited Naples Island on New Year Eve. The whole residential area along the canal was glittering with lights. Could judge the enthusiasm of people living there for celebrating Christmas and New Year. Could see many people taking boat rides. Many people were roaming in the area to enjoy the lighting decoration.,Ashwani C
50,Great for Paddle Boarding,"If you are paddle boarder this is a great place to go. You can launch from Ocean Boulevard just east of Bayshore Drive. If you paddle all the way around the bay and then once through the canals, the distance is about 5 miles. Makes for a good workout and a great view at the same time.",res02krs
40,Naples is nice,"This is not really a tourist attraction but it's a nice place to walk or run as long as you don't mind crowded paths. The views are lovely. Paths will take you along zig/zaggy sidewalks, between houses, and sometimes you feel like you are on someone's porch! but overall it's nice. Not my favorite running spot but nice to visit now and then. I feel like I am intruding when running here, I suppose it's very nice for locals. Air is clean, temps cool. Afterward it's so close to run downtown to a shop and grab a bite or get a new pair of shoes.",bonitadc
50,"Away from downtown crowds, charming neighborhood off 2nd street","Naples Island is hidden and if you are driving east or west on 2nd Street, you won't see it. Turn off on Ravenna drive and you are in Naples island. Drive slow. Roads are narrow. Enjoy the canals, the homes, there is a park at the end of this street too. Just be aware of parking signs and show courtesy to home owners.",1akamai

50,Must see Christmas lights!!,"What a lovely surprise this was! My husband researched it and surprised me with a lovely sunset walk. The houses alone are beautiful, add amazing Christmas and Hanukkah decorations and a lovely evening walk and you have a perfect evening activity. I had never even heard of Naples Island and now I want to tell everyone about it.",Teni725
40,Christmas lights,"Been here two years in a row now. If it's not too far off a drive for you I definitely recommend going. You can stroll the canal which is one big circle, no worries about getting lost, you'll end up back at your car eventually. Not too long of a walk. Gorgeous and unique homes right on the water. The lights were nice, nothing over the top. Some boats go through the canal lit up also. The residents are very friendly, either selling hot chocolate and snacks for a couple dollars or handing out Christmas cookies for free. There's a couple spots where a couple musicians are playing Christmas songs. It's a nice atmosphere. It can get crowded only because the walkways get narrow at times. Pet friendly & kid friendly and FREE! Plenty of places within a mile to eat from fast food too nice bistros. No bathrooms so take care of that before hand. Parking is limited on the streets but it's a short walk from the marina parking lot. Only complaint was that not all the houses were decorated. But still nice to see the architecture and walk along the water.",Brandi M
50,during christmas time come at night!!,"We haven't been during the day but at night the homes near the canals are amazingly decorated, un believable and worth walking by.",Eran R
50,Nice stroll through Naples,"Looked around Long Beach for something we haven't done yet while visitingthere this weekend. After checking ""things to do"" on Tripadvisor, it mentionedNaples Island. What a pleasant and energizing walk around many unique and eclectic homes. A systematic and weaving set of walkways around the island gives great views of the canals, bridges and bays. We wish we could have just sat at any number of the houses, drink in hand, watching the beautiful scenery. There seems to be ample parking when there is nothing happening, like Christmas! We may come back for that. Note of warning, though, REMEMBER WHERE YOU PARK! After walking through the twists and turns of the island, we became totally lost. If it were not for the help of a local family (Mom drove us back to where we thought our car was), we might well still be walking around the island. Over all, a great way to spend as much time as you wish seeing the sights.",Bill L
50,Gorgeous,The canal was gorgeous. We rented hydrobikes and biked around the canal. The water and scenery was gorgeous.,koosa08094
50,Beautiful homes and beautiful views,"We live in Long Beach, and we have been coming down to Naples Island for years. We love to walk and look at all the beautiful homes and beautiful views, especially during Christmas. Walking in Naples Island is wonderfully relaxing and lifts your spirits. I just wish I could afford a home there! Parking is at a premium during Christmas, so you may have to park and walk quite a bit just to get there.",Bigbo777
50,This is a must see and around Christmas is the best,"It takes about a half of an hour at a normal pace to make it all the way around the island. Some areas are not part of the loop, but worth seeing. They have competitions at Christmas, and I'm not sure there's anything like it with the Canal waterfront. Take a Gondola ride, but reserve far ahead and go after dark if its Christmas time.",Marisa S
50,Little Europe in Long Beach,"Wonderfully situated between the ocean and the mainland, this little treasure has been greatly planned and amazingly executed to present a canal extension from the ocean and creating a breath-taking well organized habitat. I encourage you to visit it. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee-shops surrounding the area and plan on a nice walk to the oceanic beach that is two to three blocks away..",Samer K
50,Lovely walk or place for some water sports.,Next time i may try the paddle boarding here on the still no wave area of the canals. It's an incredibly picturesque area to walk around the island and see the lovely houses and canals. A hidden area of LA many don't know about.,CelticGirlLA
40,Good Island,We just happened to see this island after finishing the Queen Mary Ship Visit. It was worth it. A short stroll over the road/ bridges brings you to the spectacular beach. Children can play in Mothers Beach. Lot of water activities available,sorabh
50,Really beautiful area,Wonder the streets of this very nice area and sea it's canals and wonderful residences. go down 2nd street for all the bars and restaurants and to the bay for gondolas and water sports. A short stroll over the road brings you to the long spectacular beach.,TonyD33
50,An Unexpected Sight,"One of Los Angeles' great surprises are its two communities named after Italian cities. Naples is east of Long Beach adjacent to Belmont Shores. The community is composed of one large island and several smaller ones with a canal that encircles one island. This is the place to go. Both sides of the canal have walkways that keep you close to the water. The canal is flanked by homes, many of them beautiful. Towards the south end of the canal cross the bridge and walk to the south to see the water and the Peninsula on the other side. This is a real neighborhood and not a touristy area. Over the years we have struck up conversations with a number of the residents. It is always a joy to visit. It is possible to rent paddle boats or to hire a gondola to see life from the water. It is a great place to enjoy the sunset with your loved one, or your dog (or both). Afterwards, there are a number of good restaurants on Second. Great place for no stress day.",Victor N
50,Very charming,You can walk along the canals and see the houses very easily. Lots of variety and very lovely. Just turn off of the main road toward the island and there are places to park.,travelersalem_Oregon

50,"Naples canals, a beautiful and relaxing day","You can rent a Duffy boat and ride through the canals and see beautiful homes, wave at other boaters, have a picnic onboard, and even see a dolphin or seal occasionally ad we did last time. It is truly a must-see when in Long Beach.",Sonna E
50,Great Place To Go For A Walk (with one caveat),"Check your map if you've never been. Naples is an actual island neighborhood, with sidewalks running throughout. The only downside is there are not public restrooms. So plan accordingly. There is a place south of there in Orange County, called Balboa Island, that is similar, but bigger, and has public rest rooms.",NiftyTraveler2014
50,Loved Kayaking Through the Canals,This is a lovely place to visit. It is close to my home but across the bay from where I used to spend many a summer day as a child...even as an adult. My husband and I enjoyed kayaking through the canals as it is so peaceful and serene to do that. Duffy boats can also be rented close by and are also great to use in this area.,Starglow8946
50,Naples is NICER,"Naples is Nicer. There a handful of excellent places to eat. The canals are so beautiful to walk around, especially around sunset time. The atmosphere is perfect for a date. Christmas time is one of the best times to walk the canals of Naples because of the Christmas light decorations.",SteveFawley
50,Beautiful place and unforgettable experience in holidays,"Venice, Italy is one of my favorite cities in the world and this place is designed in a same way. The houses are real nice on the canals. The atmosphere is so relaxing. I took Gondola ride first time when I went there in December. It was holiday season and all the houses were fully decorated on the canals. I would highly recommend it especially in holiday season (please check the dates on their website). One of the most memorable experience for me.",Sidd_LA

40,GREAT RELAXING SPOT TO EXPLORE,"there are no movie stars but you don't need one. Go there for the atmosphere. Wander around by the water, especially around sunset when all the boats start coming in. Makes for some great photos. There are tons of restaurants to take it all in. You're out of the LA craziness and nice place to kick back and enjoy life.",SenorGancho

50,Don't miss it at Christmas!,"This little island goes all out for the holidays. Almost every single home lights up their homes and some even put on a bit of a show. There is a boat parade one night. Don't miss it - you'll feel like a kid again. You can rent an electric boat and see the lights from the water or walk up and down the sidewalks seeing them up close. Either way, its a trip worthy of your time and attention. The rest of the year it's a lovely place to walk or boat. Check it out.",thizizliz

50,Island in the Island,I go to Naples Island several times a year. It is only 5 miles from my home but a pleasant place to visit. Naples Island is a little island within a lager island. It is very beautiful (and expensive) houses on a charming circular canal. Of course the best time of year to go is during the holidays which the houses are decorated with Christmas and Hannukah lights. The Naples Boat Parade is a huge draw. Parking is very difficult if not impossible for that because so many people turn out. It is a relaxing walk around the canal of the interior island. I always take out of town guests to see this area. I have rowed a kayak through the canal and also rode in a gondola. The gondola rides are a romantic event for couples or small groups.,LBCaliforniaTraveler
40,"Dining, gondolas, Christmas lights, ocean/bay views","Compared to the more shopping-intensive Belmont Shore just over the bridge to the west, Naples Island is mostly residential. But they've run with the Italian theme, from the street names to the gondola rides to many of the restaurants. You'll find some excellent eats along 2nd Street, including foodie bars like Crows, Nico's and KC Brannigans, and Naples Rib Company, and the trio of restaurants by Naples resident Micahel Dene: Michael's Pizzaria, Michael's on Naples Ristorante, and the stellar Chiannina Steakhouse.If you drive around Naples, you'll pretty much cover every street, road, and alley in an hour or less. On a bike? About as long. You'll find some grass at Naple's Fountain and nearby Naples Plaza, and Mother's Beach is great if you prefer the stillness of Alamitos Bay to the slightly less still breakwatered Long Beach ocean beaches. There are some benches near the waterways where you can while away the time watching the sunset or viewing folks rowing, paddling, or drifting along as gondoliers do the hard work. These water vessels are rentable, if you want to tour the houses or the bay or the canal by water.At Christmas time, it's a popular place to walk around, or take a slow motion bay cruise, to view the (sadly, diminishing) decorated homes. It's still a decent concentration of huge houses you'll never afford decked out to the nines in holiday decorations.Most of the year, Naples Island is not really a tourist destination. But it can be a pleasant surprise if you want a respite from the crush of Belmont Shore and want a bite to eat or a quiet place to enjoy the view with a loved one, or just your thoughts. It's relatively uncrowded, and those you do see tend to be pleasant and looking for something similar. For most of Long Beach, it's a shortish drive to another world.",James W

30,Nice area but there are better places to spend your time,"Southern California is full of great beach destinations. Naples is nice but it does not have the same feel as Huntington, Newport or Balboa (which are all nearby). Some parts are run down and it does not look like it has received a facelift in some time. A few businesses in the area are trying but this place needs intervention from the city level. Mother's beach is a great spot but if you are going to spend your day on a local, bridge connected island, go to Balboa.",DrMarkG
30,Fun Place to Visit at Christmas,Naples Island is a beautiful community. There are several excellent restaurants ...

Also beautiful & a faster way to travel. My choice is walking though because you can say hello to the residents if they are out, take in more of the breathtaking views of both water & homes.

You can hire a gondola to take you through the canals to see multi million dollar homes.

50,Italian-style canals and seaside living in Long Beach,"Naples offers an endless vacation for its residents. Marked by a circular canal and a protected strand of beach, visitors entering the neighborhood off 2nd Street on Ravenna Drive.

Here, the heart of Naples culminates with a small parkway that looks out across the canal to the beach along Alamitos Bay. The canal is crossed by five Italianate bridges, one of which connects Treasure Island. Duffy boat cruisers, paddle boarders and kayakers make the Rivo Alto Canal, the Naples Canal, and Alamitos Bay their playground. The gorgeous homes here vary in style from Spanish Revival to Nantucket to mid-century modern architecture. Home owners greet each other on the walking path along the canal - a beautiful route for dog-walking or an evening stroll. Resident homeowners keep privately owned docks along the canal. Sailors and boat owners also have access to Marine Park, as well as the Long Beach Yacht Club.

50,NAPLES IS ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS OF SOCAL,I lived on Naples Island in the '80s and return there for a drive around when I'm in the area. This was my most favorite of all places I've lived. Not only is it on the water with some great views but it is its own little secluded spot. No traffic. No traffic noise. Christmas season is always a good time to visit. There's the boat parade and the houses and boats are festively decorated. Then there's the Gondola Getaway that takes you on the canals around the island and across the bay. This is always a hit with visitors but I never tired of a relaxing ride with my significant other and some champagne and cheese. Unique! Naples has changed little over the years. There are some stunning rebuilds but there are also many of the charming bungalows of years past. Charmingly well kept. Great place to just take a quiet relaxing walk around the canals or take the gondola ride. There are also several quality restaurants on Second street which is just a short stroll from the main part of the Island.,LHANN2013
50,Great Place to Paddleboard,"Nearby there is a center that rents kayaks, paddle boards...etc as well as providing lessons. Twice we have rented paddle boards and explored the canals of Naples. The canals have a variety of small boats moored in front of these well kept homes. Many of the homes have rather unique features so it's fun to get your exercise and check out the scenery. There are lots of beginner paddle boarders so take a lesson and enjoy touring the area that many locals aren't aware of.",EdfromPDR
50,Nice place to visit and live in,This is a jewel of a neighborhood with mostly single family homes but some apartments. It is a nice place to be by the bay and see the beautiful boats and catch the breezes.,IDC637
50,Pearl of my hometown,"Naples is one of the nicest and upscale neighborhoods in SE Long Beach /a ""Stones-throw"" to Orange county .It's design was themed after Naples Italy with canals and walking paths.Most ( 95% + ) of the houses are restored nicely and many homes are of unique designs with water orientation for many .As children, we would ride our bikes and jump off bridges.Today, the calm and quiet waters host paddle-boards to authentic Gondolas,in which,one can take a cool leisurely ride or wine taste.Parking is a challenge.Best is the Large lot inside the Marine Stadium..it is free( until one goes inside the Water Ski launch area) and a 10 min. flat and safe walk .Also good is the East Second Street / ""service road"" near the Naples Boutique shopping zone.The walk around the isles is picturesque and charming .Several good restaurants are near incl Top rated""Michael's""Another highlight of the area is the Gourmet Farmer Market /Wed evening 3-8pm..at 5255 E Paoli way,90803",P-and-A-Belmont
50,Hidden Gem,Naples is beautiful well worth a visit but a little tricky to locate but persevere you won't be disappointed. Pretty waterways lined with beautiful houses all with their own moorings. It's a residential area so no shops or cafes but you can have a lovely stroll round and admire this pretty place.,Kathryn G
40,A beautiful morning or evening walk - Naples Island,"Marked by a circular canal, Naples Island is a hidden gem in Long Beach, California. Entering the neighborhood off 2nd Street on Ravenna Drive, an iconic fountain, La Bella Fontana di Napoli, welcomes you to the Colonnade. Here, the heart of Naples leads to a small parkway that looks out across the canal to the beach along Alamitos Bay. The canal is crossed by five Italianate bridges, one of which connects Treasure Island. Duffy boat cruisers, paddle boarders and kayakers make the Rivo Alto Canal, the Naples Canal, and Alamitos Bay their playground. The gorgeous homes here vary in style from Spanish Revival to Nantucket to mid-century modern architecture. Home owners greet each other on the walking path along the canal - a beautiful route for dog-walking or an evening stroll.",rebelann2015
40,Great for Christmas Lights,"I visited Naples Island during the Christmas season. They are definitely a spot I will continue to visit year after year with the family. All of the houses participate in lighting up their houses with lights, music, carolers, hot chocolate, and everything else that brings out the Christmas Spirit. I encourage all of you to visit here and witness the amazing lights they have.",Paul T

30,Visit this place during Christmas and skip the rest of the year,"Naples island is a series of small little islands connected by bridges within Los Alamitos Bay. The houses here build right up to the property lines and every house just about comes with a boat slip. They do a great job of decorating for Xmas and is worth a walk especially if you have kids but it will be chilly at night. Other than that, skip this and go to the beach and save your time.",Bill C

50,Beautiful place during the holidays.,"We come here every year for Christmas since my in-laws live right on the canal. Most houses are beautifully decorated and a wonderful place to walk around in the evening. There are gondolas you can ride and electric boats you can rent. Be aware that locals frown on people who rent electric boats and don't follow the rules. The canals are a no wake zone. Canals are filled with electric boats, gondolas, kayaks, paddle surfers and motor boats. Parking is a challenge here so I would park on 2nd St and walk in.",Cincytraveler621
50,"Beautiful, wholesome way to spend an evening","An evening walk in Naples in December is a great way to spend a night. I've never seen houses decorated like this, and this little community actually looks Italian - canals and bridges. The houses were decorated with lights, some with music and disco balls, moving parts and a mini roller coaster. It delighted both the kids and adults in our party!",Familytravel12
50,Don't miss visiting during CHRISTMAS; take a walking tour,"We were introduced to the Naples Island neighborhood a few years ago at Christmastime.

40,"A beautiful walk, especially during the holidays","Naples Island, in Long Beach, makes for a beautiful walk anytime. The best time to walk around Naples is during the holidays when virtually every home is decorated to the nines! My favorite way to visit Naples is by kayak or via Gondola Get-away.",562MarcyS
40,Kayak around the canals for a great experience,"""Naples Island"" covers a lot of ground. There are some restaurants and lot of fancy houses, but nothing truly stands out except traveling the canals yourself. You can rent a kayak in the cheap (less than $10 an hour) and spend the day relaxing in the sun kayaking around the canals. You might even see the moon jellies (jellyfish that can't sting) rising to the surface if you're still enough. A fun summer day for anyone.",Abbiechan
40,eclectic homes in peaceful setting,"Naples Island is a delightful way to spend an hour or so if you are in the Long Beach area and enjoy looking at interesting homes and exotic vegetation. It is a super-high rent district. To reiterate an earlier review, get off the PCH at 2nd and turn left on Ravenna and cross the small bridge. Very simple access to this tiny island, but limited signage.There was plenty of parking around the fountain during my mid-week visit - probably not so at weekends and holidays. You can walk around the perimeter of the island in a half hour or so, but there are also concentric circles of walkable back alleyways that are interesting. It's a bit like a very upscale Venice (Calif.). Best of all would be finding a kayak rental place (see reviews) and paddling around this fascinating place. Only 4 stars in October 2014 because there are several homeowners who clearly haven't heard that there's a severe drought in CA and had overflowed water sprinkling and dripping for their vegetative coverings. As a general comment, I (from the SF Bay Area) have been horrified that so many Southern Californians seem oblivious to the water situation in our state.",figgie32313

50,Christmas Time spectacular,Naples Island is the location of some lovely upscale houses and a nice boating harbour where most of the waterfront houses have thheir own dock.But the reason I go there every year is the wonderful front yard Christmas displays.

40,Pretty Water Areas Between the Neighborhoods in Island area,There are islands in Long Beach. On the Islands there rae neighborhoods with nice houses as well as beautiful waterways.

50,Wonderful place to take a walk,"We decided we would try to come back and stay on or near Naples Island, so we can take advantage of the water sports. Walking around the neighborhood and seeing the houses along the canal was wonderful. Loved it.",AussieOwl
40,Great place to walk around and sight see.,"This place is fantastic during Christmas and I highly suggest a trip there to sight see. Everything's lighted up and it really does give off an enchanted feel. Easy to walk as well. Parking could be an issue, but the surrounding houses won't really mind if you park outside for a few hours. They know it's a tourist spot. During the Non-Holidays, it's good as well but nowhere near that of the Christmas/New Year's stretch.",Berginyon X
50,Enjoyable kayaking,"Rent a kayak @ Long Beach, most reasonable rate for 1 hour and tour the Naples Canal....a narrow canal between some interesting homes. It is a calm ride and a great outdoor activity. We loved our time together.",Irongate69

50,Plenty to do!,"This is a great place for a fun bicycle ride. The island is not that big and places to stop for food and drinks are plentiful. Also, you can rent a hydrobike from across the bay and circle the island from the water which is more fun than you would imagine.",Ed R
50,"Naples Island,CA.... Long Beach's Best Kept Secret","...If you enjoy a romantic walk while surrounded by $million plus homes on a scenic waterfront, then, this is the place for you. This City of Long Beach off the beaten path spot will let you burn some calories while enjoying great water views (without the taxes that go with it!). Charming with it's venice like canal, boats and many homes from the 1920's, Naples is a circular island that takes about 45 minutes to circumvent and includes views of Alamitos Bay on the outside. You will get lots of landscaping ideas here!...Turn off 2nd Street onto Ravenna by the Thrifty drugstore. A short run across the bridge and you can park near the water fountain in the middle of the island. Walk across the grass pocket park at the end of Ravenna and you are there. A right or left turn will take you around the island and back to where you started. There are also side trips you can take to expand your exploration onto branches of the island....After the walk, a short run down 2nd street will take you to a ton of good calorie-laden restaurant choices or drive over to Ocean Blvd. and rent a kayak or paddleboard to explore Alamitos Bay...",LongBeachboy
40,An Interesting area to walk around - Pre the Queen Mary,"Had a nice, quick visit to the Naples Island area - as a lead in / preview to our tour and stay aboard the Queen Mary.

So we ended up having ot go off the island to grab lunch.But the island does have some beautiful canals and residential areas to tour around",brianwickens407
50,Must see the lights at Christmas time,"This is where almost every house decorates for the holidays. Animated figures, lights, music, themes, all wonderful to walk the pathways next to the water and canals and see all the houses.

50,Loved it,"We almost did not go since we were not sure it would be worth the drive, but glad we did. Reminded us a bit of Venice. Walked for over an hour around the canal, looking at the beautiful homes. Gondolas, SUPs, and kayaks were traveling through the canals. Parking was easy.",wind01
50,Stroller's paradise,"You mioght not like it if you lived here, because we strollers can look right inside your living room and kitchen and see what kind of housekeepers you are.

50,nothing else is quite like it,"I love walking through the canals of Naples Island in Long Beach. There are magnificent homes to look at, even some remaining craftsman-style places, and it's easy to get lost in thought and calm of the canals.

20,"Don't bother, really.","I came there because I happened to be near Long Beach and I had heard it was a nice neighborhood for a walk. Well, it may be peaceful and nice, but there is not much to see apart some canal cramped with boats, and houses in which people, knowing that people like strolling around their neighborhood, arrange their garden furniture as if it was a store display.If you're in that part of Long Beach, do yourself a favor and head directly to the beach.",A_Ciri
30,WE DROVE AROUND THIS PLACE BUT IT DID NOT EXCITE US,This was our biggest disappointment in Long Beach. Not much happening here. Maybe a nice neighborhood on water but it is difficult for a tourist to grasp this. Parking is very limited and controlled. We advise you to investigate for yourself and consider skipping it!,cmschw@comcast.net

50,Oh Christmas tree....,"I've lived within miles of this little gem my whole life and visited for the first time (twice) this past Christmas. These people go all out. It's amazing. Definitely the start of a new family holiday tradition to stroll among the beautifully decorated, canal side homes. Homeowners sit outside and sell hot chocolate and coffee, which is wonderful. One night an older couple even came out and invited a group of strangers to sit on their patio and severed them leftover Christmas desserts....are you kidding me?!?! It didn't hurt that the weather was balmy and clear.",714CaliGirl

50,Christmas Decorations Extraordinaire,"If you are in Long Beach during the Holidays, you must take the walk around Naples Island and see the Christmas Decorations. They are by far the best I have seen in one area. They are the traditional lights and absent of the blow up COSTCO ones which I do not like. The residents do a wonderful job and the only problem becomes parking. Try to get there before they come down. However, its a great walk anytime.",dinerdon
40,Christmas Lights,We waited until after Christmas to walk around the canals and view the lights in Naples. We found parking easily and the crowd was minimal. The houses were beautifully decorated and some were very creative. Only a few houses had lights/decorations that were not turned on. There were decorated boats giving tours in the canals and gondolas for a more intimate tour. We also noticed hydrobikes in the canals so you can view the lights from the canal at your own pace. There were some great photo opportunities so bring a camera!,Trish K

40,Christmas Tour of Lights,"We toured the Naples Island Christmas lights via the Long Beach Trolley company. On the day of the ninety minute tour, they called to confirm and had some helpful hints which was nice. They recommended getting there 30 minutes before the tour started which was in front of Chase Bank on 2nd Street. I did take that advise since parking on 2nd Street can be difficult because of all the stores and restaurants in the area. It is metered parking limited to two hours so we were lucky we had loose change in the car. Before the tour started, they gave a ticket for a cup of cocoa and chocolate chip cookie to be redeemed at Legends restaurant. The cocoa and cookie hit the spot for a cold evening. They also passed out a felt Santa hat and a candy cane which is nice for the young ones. There was a narrator who led the tour in the trolley as we traveled through Los Alamitos Bay to view the floating Christmas trees and as we walked the canal's path. We were in awe of the different architecture of each home on Naples Island. The residents are very creative and the Christmas lights and decorations are beautiful. As we were walking along the canal sidewalk, you can see others enjoying the Christmas decor as they sailed by in Duffy boats and gondolas. I recommend that one wears comfortable walking shoes and a warm coat for a chilly evening in December. There are lots of opportunities for picture taking. I was told this is the first time running this tour so I think they did a good job.",CaliLAgirl
40,I Want To Go Back!,Stopped here the day after Thanksgiving checking out this Dexter filming location as were Dexter fanatics. Such a lovely area would come again.

People really go out with their decorations which is nice. Even saw a couple out on a gondola ride along the canal.,Linnea P
50,Light up your Christmas,"Always a pleasure to walk around, Naples Island is simply magical as Christmas draws nigh.

40,Perfect morning stroll,"My husband and I visited friends who live in Anaheim and work in Long Beach. Surprisingly, they had never heard of this place either, so I was happy they got to see something new after showing us around all weekend. We took a walk around the canal after breakfast on a Sunday morning, and it was perfect. It was so fun to look at the different architecture of the beautiful homes. And so relaxing to see people floating down the canal on paddle boats and water bicycles. I originally wanted to take a gondola ride in the evening, but unfortunately we just ran out of time. I think we would try that next time.",Shanna A
50,Venice without the Smell,"If you've been to Venice,, especially during the rainy season,, it can be a little smelly. And while you are not seeing old world architecture and beauty, bring a bottle of wine and picnic dinner and hire a gondola from www.gondo.net and you will feel like you are in the beautiful Venice canals. Remember, I did say a bottle of wine. Seriously, this is the place to be at sundown. Its so beautiful and peaceful, your Gondola specialist even sings to you.

40,Great for kayaking and paddle boarding,Naples island is a very cool community that has Venice type canals tuning throughout which then lead into the ocean. They have a kayak and paddle board rental on Horney Corner and its a lot of fun to rent and then kayak or paddle through the canals. The homes on the canals are amazing and it's cool to see all the huge boats docked. During Christmas there is a very cool light parade on the boats.,MattA55
50,Lovely place for a walk,Stroll around the neighborhoods south of 2nd Street and enjoy a unique neighborhood: beautiful houses and gardening and the occasional paddleboarder or kayaker making his or her way along the canals.,KrissyR3
50,Gondola Getaways,"What a fun and unusual experience. Gondola Getaways brought over real Venetian boats to take people around the canals in the Naples islands in Long Beach. Nico actually sang and has a wonderful voice. I rented a gondola for two for my husbands birthday. People were there in larger parties for all sorts of occasions. The tour by boat takes an hour where you go through the canals slowly and see all sorts of architecture along the canals. People were friendly, passing in their boats. There are bridges to sail under, water fowl and just beautiful vegetation in the yards. I brought some drinks as they suggested so they could put them on ice. You bring your own drinks and snacks, recommended. Go when it is still light so you can see easily and bring a jacket as the wind can pick up. This was such an unusual and delightful surprise.",suzanochka

There is a big free parking lot nearby. The homes in that area had the best gardens. You can walk for a couple of hours like we did or just take a short out & back stroll.",TZK
50,"Take a trip to Italy, without leaving California!","The Naples area of Long Beach is a system of canals reminiscent of it's name sake in Italy. It's a great place to take a stroll, eat an ice cream cone from Rite Aid, and relax near the fountain or watching the boats on the bay. During the month of December, the inhabitants decorate for the Holidays and host the ""locally world famous"" Boat Parade. it's crazy, and there's no parking, but it's festive and fun! PS: Please have care for the residents when you visit. Pick you your trash and especially after your canine friends! The friendly people of Naples will thank you!",JanAboutTown
50,Naples Island,"Continually frequent the restaurants along 2nd Street and previously worked on Naples Island. Love the people and the neighborhood and the view along the canals! Suggest either renting a kayak during the day, a Duffy electric boat or, of course, the Gondola Getaway to really enjoy the homes and scenery in and around Naples Island..",elliotts321
50,Just Like Being in Europe.,"If you want to find a nice place to dine with the feel of being on a canal in Italy, this is a nice place, nice little Beach area""s,Check this place out, parking in some of the Naples areas is tight, but worth it, bars clubs are nice here as well.",Ritchie H
50,What a Fantastic Hidden Gem,"Off the beaten path and somewhat hidden from the passing crowd, Naples Island is one of the most beautiful coastal enclaves in the USA. Multi-million dollar homes line the canals and streets of this tiny island in Long Beach, California. Most of the canal homes are equipped with a small boat dock too. Yes it is definitely decadent and exclusive but just put that out of your mind and enjoy the engineering accomplishment and some really unique architecture. To live here one would need several million dollars but one of the neat things here is that most of the home-owners are friendly and they knew that being a tourist attraction was part of the deal when they moved here. Most of the homes here are two and three stories tall and a few managed to go higher before restrictions began. In many ways a walk through these neighborhoods is like walking through a home-improvement catalog. The lot-sizes are small and there are no backyards -- oh and even the alleys are immaculate. If you stroll through here you will see some of the most interesting and unique designs for patios and patio accessories. Most of the houses have large front windows so you can also see the inside decor and just about every new or really nice home accessory, gadget or appliance will show up in one of your views... As if that wasn't enough... there are even real Venetian gondolas utilizing these canals -- these trips are available for anyone and can be booked through the local company that operates them (no plug sorry). Romantic couples on gondola excursions are a common sight -- hear a bottle of Asti being uncorked or even a serenade from a talented gondolier. If you come in December Naples Island has one of the coolest boat parades imaginable plus almost every house will be decorated for the holiday season -- some will be done up in ways that are beyond description!",Observer333
50,Beautiful place,"On our way to Santa Monica, after endulging the Pacific Coast Highway from Laguna Beach to Long Beach we have decided to make a stop here. Parked somewhere on a street and walked here and there to admire the view and the houses of the area. Fabulous.",Aburel
50,Hydrobike Holiday Tour through Naples Canals,"I definitely recommend for people to go hydrobiking. I got a deal on living social and had no problem making a reservation. It's easy, just schedule your appointment online. The long beach hydrobike staff were very friendly and helpful. Being guided through the naples canal during the Christmas holiday was awesome! Got to know some history on Naples Canal and enjoy all the christmas decorations. It's completely safe, so for all those afraid of deep water, you'llbe fine. I took my boyfriend for our 8th month anniversary and he LOVED this rather rare and adventurous idea. I say you just give it a try!!",jibarra527
50,the island....,"nice island to visit.....good walkways , lots to see...nice for walking..parking can be a bit of a pita at times....lots to see and do....close by shops and food...",richbonilla
50,The rich are different from you and me,"My wife and I enjoy strolling along the waterfront, admiring the multi-million dollar homes with yachts docked right in front. It's a place to indulge your ""when we win the lottery"" fantasies. Beautiful, quiet, serene. Often there are small sailboats racing in the bay, and occasionally a powerful muscle boat will glide by with throbbing engines. Wonderful!If you are driving, park in the free lot just east of the yacht club.",JTMRPV
50,different world,"I used to live very near Naples Island when I was young and to return brought back many fond memories. It is like a different world, very calm and peaceful.",sheribaggarley
50,"Naples, Long Beach, CA",I loved this little place. It was so pretty and quiet. I walked the entire canal TWICE!! So much to see. It neighbors Belmont shore which has nice restaurants. If you want to kayak the canal you have to go to Alamita Bay nearby and rent a kayak. I saw numerous tour boats. this is mostly a pedestrian trip. I brought my bike but the canal walkways are not designed for bicycling. I went on a weekday so I had no problem parking on the neighborhood streets around the canal. I could see the lights on the canal walkway so I imagine it was beautiful at night. I highly recommend this little neighborhood. There are no restaurants on the neighborhood but just a couple of blocks over is the community of Belmont shores which has fantastic restaurants. Great photo shots!!,JenaiMorehead
50,I Can't Wait to Go Again!!,"I purchased two rentals on a Groupon because it looked like fun. It was!! My husband and I went on a Friday morning so it wouldn't be as crowded. The weather was perfect. The gentleman that helped us was very nice. We opted for two seperate bikes. It doesn't take long at all to learn to control them and you never get wet! We had to purposly dip our toes in the water to get wet. The bikes get alot of attention. Everyone says, ""Look! How cool is that!"" We were out for an hour and wished we had another hour! It was soooo much fun!! We absolutly loved it and will absolutly be back to do it again.",hotellover13
50,Beautiful Canals with quiet neighborhoods,"We love walking the canals of Naples. It's so peaceful and the homes have such varied architecture! We enjoy the gardens and the friendly atmosphere. It's a quiet neighborhood place. But be warned: there are no restaurants on the water, just private homes. However, on 2nd St. in Naples you can enjoy eating at Michaels, K.C. Branaghans, and Nicos. There's a beach at Mother's Beach with shade, grass, a playground, a restaurant, and life guards. You can also rent kayaks, paddleboards and boats in neighboring Belmont Shore to travel through the canals. Or contact Gondola Getaway for a gondola ride ( just like Venice Italy) through the Naples Canals. Enjoy",boloca
50,Our PEACE of Italia,All of the watercraft action in n out of the canals. The water is gorgeous. just slow n easy floating : ),maryl49
30,worth a visit,Get the bus down and walk around. Quality place so picturesque,ssenit
50,Do the hydrobikes!!,"I can't find a place to review the hydrobikes, so guess I'll just do it here. Long Beach Hydrobikes is located in Los Alamitos Bay and it's a blast! They are basically bikes with pontoons on the side and little paddles that ""scoop"" the water to propel you instead of regular wheels. My family and I have done this twice and it was a great time both times. You rent the bikes for an hour ($20, but we've found half-price Groupons) and ride them across the bay and through the canals. There are single bikes and double bikes, where little ones can ride on a platform in the middle. My daughter is 10 and this year was able to reach the pedals and do the single bike, but last year was a bit too short and rode on the platform. Having done both, I recommend the single bikes - it is much more fun to pedal on your own. The people who run Hydrobikes are very nice and easy-going, which sometimes translates into not getting on the bikes at the time you reserved them for. This last time we waited for quite a while BUT they didn't not take our Groupons (so it was free of charge) and we will definitely return and use those Groupons. We also waited a bit the other time we went, but you just have to chill and hang out a bit - it's the beach, and it's worth the wait.",IslandGirl67
50,A charming seaside community.,"Attractive people at ease in a charming ""beach town"" community.",barmac36
40,take a duffy boat through the canals at christmas,"Every house is lit up and very imaginative. Surfers on waves, palm trees, reindeer, santas, star of David, boats, snowmen, and much more. Rent the duffy boats at Alamitos Landing and take a two hour tour, first around the outside of the island and then through the cannals as it gets dark. The weather is usually good if you bring a coat and libations. The boats have plastic windows so wind is not problem. We do it every year and our out of town guests get a feel for how great it is to live in California.",sealbeachtraveler
50,SO PICTURESQUE!,Enjoyed bike riding to Naples while visiting in Long Beach. Love to bike down the different streets and admire the beautiful homes!,Cathy G
50,Worth a visit!,"Naples is the epitome of quaint! It makes for a great walk, and if you want you can take a tour via gondola with Gondola Getaway. It is a very upscale neighborhood where homes back up to canals, and each one has its own boat dock. It is especially beautiful during the holiday season as the homeowners tend to decorate the back of the house, which backs up to the canal, instead of the front of the house. It makes for a beautiful after-dinner stroll.",misspattie
40,Lovely Farmers Market,Great prices on organic veggies and fruits. We bought delicious tabbouleh and hummus,Chity C
50,Incredible!,"This place took our breath away!! We loved walking the canals, by the houses, seeing how everyone decorates their home, watching the boaters go under each bridge and seeing the beaches / sand. Very fun take it for free.",mikki777
50,Christmas in Naples,I went to a friend's Christmas party on the canal to watch the parade. What a great time. So many folks go to this that you have to take a taxi to get even close. There is no parking. But all the houses have parties going on and the parade is funky fun put on by all the neighbors. A very memorable night.,Marcasso
40,Put this on your Christmas list of places to go,"the best time to visit isChristmas time at night - home are wonderfully decorated and it makes a wonderful stroll. It has become a Christmas night tradition and a great way to walk off some of the massive eating. Bring along some hot chocolate, and you have a lovely evening.",YR-LGB
30,"It's like Venice, only smaller and more California..","It's a neat area. Beautiful, old multi-million dollar homes packed into a really small area. Not much to do.. I would rent a kayak and explore the canals! The area was reclaimed in the 30s from the bay.",Chad H
50,The hidden gem of Long Beach,"Stumbling upon Naples and Belmont shore is what drew me here 25 years ago. I knew someday I would move to Long Beach. These canals and the houses that line them are enjoyed by residents, local strollers, the yearly boat parade participants, rental duffies, kayaks and the famous gondola getaways. The Rivo alto canal is a must see at Christmas time when every house is decked out for Christmas. This place is enchanting!",SweetnDandy
40,Great for strolling and enjoying Christmas lights,"Stroll the canals of Naples anytime from Thanksgiving and New Years and you'll find impressive Christmas light installations at most houses, including moving elements on many of them. Often there is hot cider for sale, perfect to warm you on a cold night.it's a great way to experience the local community and enjoy some Christmas spirit for free.",charlieinspain
