50,He brought water to a city that was drying up,"This is an apt monument to a man who had a remarkable life. William Mulholland was born in Belfast, Ireland in1855 and after some schooling in Dublin he began a peripatetic period, eventually arriving in Los Angeles in 1877.Over the next decades he effectively self-taught and rose to positions of Superintendent and Chief Engineer with the Water Authority, the latter in 1911.Around this time the city’s population was expanding phenomenally but they were running out of water. To solve the problem Mulholland and associates conceived of an aqueduct to bring water from the Owens Valley that received large amounts of runoff from the Sierra Nevada.Controversially, large amounts of farmland with water rights were bought up in the Owens Valley. It was this water that was brought to LA by via the astonishing 233 mile long aqueduct, powered purely by gravity.Incidentally the so-called water wars inspired the 1974 classic movie Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunnaway.Water arrived in the San Fernando Valley in 1913, after a 6 year aqueduct construction period. The aqueduct, considered an engineering marvel, continues to supply about one-third of LA’s water.Mulholland’s reputation and profession effectively came to an end in 1928 when the St. Francis Dam, overseen by Mulholland, collapsed. This resulted in a disastrous flood that drowned hundreds of people in the path of the torrents.He took full responsibility for the catastrophe and retired that year. Living thereafter in semi-reclusion, he died in 1935.The fountain and monument dedicated to him were unveiled in 1940.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
