10,Not Ideal,"Whilst it may seem a lovely idea to visit such a historic location it must be said that just because it has been around for so long the decor doesn’t need to reflect this.The fly screen to the outdoor area has a wonderful feature, that been as the server passes through the screen on occasion manages to brush the food and cross contaminate everything.Be wary of the parking, once your in you ain’t getting out without paying.Talking of paying.It may be a good for you to request the server transact the sale at your able with the card reader.It is a lovely location in Malibu but be wary of the pitfalls.Obviously this has nothing to do with the establishment as it would be pure coincidence.I have never been to Santiago Chile but my credit card made over $1500 of transactions in a 24 hour period within 12 hours of our Malibu visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squirrel987
30,"Nice beachside location with outdoor in-the-sand seating, but a so-so restaurant at best.","This place is certainly a mecca for the tourist crowd with its Malibu beachside location, but as a restaurant it leaves something to be desired, at least for me. First off, I object to the $8 with validation parking fee. With the prices they charge, they can do better. If you like large servings of pretty average food with equally large price tags, you'll probably like this place. I find the fried fish to be mediocre although the tuna poke is pretty solid. Other food items follow suit. Fun to watch the seagulls steal people's food right from their tables as they are eating. The drinks are the typical mix of topical delights (mai tais, etc.) and regular concoctions again with pricey costs. Fun to visit on rare occasion, but there are other choices in the general area that would serve the same purpose but offer better food and drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisinSOCA
50,Breakfast with your feet in the sand and great view,"We were pleasantly surprised that we didn't need a reservation and we still got the table in the sand with an amazing sea view. The food was delicious, the service was fast and spotless and we enjoyed every minute in the November sun. The atmosphere was so laid back, very relaxed despite the fact that you could see some A-listers and people from the movie industry having Sunday breakfast here. There is parking nearby, and you are free to take a walk on this most famous beach in Malibu. Would definitely recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva
40,Nostalgic but expensive?,"Paradise Cove is a speck of nostalgia on the otherwise glitzy and developed Malibu coast and beach district. Paradise Cove was the location of several movies including the infamous 1965 ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" movie as well as a popular beach location. When I consulted the web, the reviews for the restaurant were fairly mediocre in terms of the quality of the food and service. My experience was slightly better but I have certainly had a better meal for the price and I suspect the draw card is the location, not the dinning of shrive quality. The parking is expensive at $35 however, if you spent $30 minimum in the restaurant it is ""only"" $8 for 4 hours. Its easy to spend $30 so I would recommend a meal and take the cheaper parking option. What I did like about the place was the atmosphere, the beach and views along the coast. The old wooden pier is delightful and reminded me of the days when surfers would dodge the piles on their surfboards. So if you are after a quiet place which which has the atmosphere of a bygone era without the crowds I would recommend a visit to Paradise Cove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohawk3001
50,"Great view, yummy food and right on the beach","We highly recommend this place! Seafood is so good and it's really a pleasure to be there!Crab soup is a must!

50,Absolutely worth it!,"I love Paradise Cove! Apparently, there’s a lot of old school Hollywood history here. The interior is decorated with tons of photos documenting the many visitors of the cove over the years. Marilyn, the Beatles, and a tons of others have been hip to this spot. The food was amazing! We sat outside, toes in the sand and a rocks throw from the ocean. If you’re looking for a true Malibu experience, visit Paradise Cove. I’m definitely making it a part of my places to visit with each trip back to Cali and when I move back there, it will be a monthly, if not weekly trip. I love it there and you will too!

30,Go on weekdays at night,"The food is fatty and overpriced. It’s extremely crowded with expensive parking. I feel they don’t clean up because it smells like old stale grease. I’ve been many times to take friends from out of town. It’s fun to eat at the tables in the sand or to sit on a lounge on the beach to eat or drink, if you can get a chair.

We spent over $500 for dinner, got the parking ticket validated & still had to pay $8.00 to use their parking lot! What a rip off! That really burned me!The food was very expensive & the quality was not as it once was! 2 glasses of wine was $20.00! We shared the Seafood platter, fish & ships & clam chowder! Everything was just OK! The server was very polite & friendly! Now it's more of a tourist attraction, not like the used to be local hangout!It's located in Paradise Cove in Malibu right on the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathieP_12
50,Great Morning before our trip north,"This was our first stop before heading up the coast. We arrived around 9:30 in the morning. The parking lot as well as the restaurant was pretty empty. We had a wonderful breakfast of egg omelet with potatoes and toast. Our waiter stamped our parking ticket so we only paid for food. (Parking if free with a $30.00 minimum order at the restaurant, up to 4 hours). We then sat at their outdoor seating area and enjoyed a drink. We walked the beach into Malibu which was beautiful. Upon our return about 1 1/2 later the restaurant and parking lot was packed. So glad we got there early to enjoy the beach . A great way to start the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccermkbk
10,You feel trapped,"Wish we had never turned left, the parking charges are a joke, with a minimum payment aswell to spend in the restaurant of $35. All we wanted was a drink for a quick stop off.Left 2 1/2 hours later and over $100 later. Great little fly trap they have there. Fries were ok, drinks average, cheesecake not awful we left most of it. Service was very slow. Very very confusing in general. You can’t just sit down you have to wait to be seated even though loads of seats available but other customers were just sitting down when and were they wanted. So totally unfair treatment, if your a newbie.Beach overcrowded and narrow, not relaxing at all. You can not just drink in the cafe you are forced to eat otherwise you are not allowed a table. Outside no space at all, you can take out drinks but would have to stand or sit on the sand and as so crowded you would be imposing on others space, as a family of 5 very awkward and uncomfortable to do.Will never ever return, especially as lovely other areas of beach around the same area , and parking on the main road too. It felt like dust to dawn movie, Entice you in then an absolute nightmare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfer35

30,This restaurant used to be GREAT!!,"I am disappointed that the restaurant food (although playful and enticing) has fallen a few notches in taste. The tropical drinks look GREAT yet are overly sweet. Appetizers are averaging $20.00 each. I ordered a Shrimp appetizer which consisted of 8 tasteless greasy shrimp ($19.00). The rest of the menu prices are VERY expensive. the location is EXCELLENT. However, unless you are very early, you will not be able to get a beach chair. Bring the usual beach haul stuff and your own picnic food. (Better and MUCH less expensive.) Keep in mind that parking is $7.00 for the first 4 hours with validation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonA966

It used to be chill and friendly, now its a madhouse.I get that summer is a busy time at the beach, but 2 hours wait for any table is nutty. Make reservations!!!Food was fine, but certainly not special. Unless you count massive portions of fried [insert any item here] Restaurant was SUPER loud, babies, families, instagramming tourists, just not pleasant or relaxing.

40,Good Option for Casual Meal by the Ocean,There is some parking but it may get filled up on busy days. There is a $30 minimum bar/food tab to park. There is valet parking also. Pay for parking before you exit. This is an old style beach cafe where you can sit down and get a casual decent meal or there is a snack bar outside. Chairs outside to sit but food is not served outside. There is a small pier and there are some nice views. A good place to relax. I’ll be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SigEpGov

40,Very busy - good but expensive,"We went here for our anniversary dinner.First rule of Paradise Cove, if you don't have a reservation, you will regret it. This is a very popular venue because you can drink on the beach and it is heavily promoted. Reservations are available up to at least the day before your visit. The couple in front of us (who didn't have a reservation) was told the wait was an hour. Our wait was 2 minutes.Second rule of Paradise Cove, the food is good but really expensive. So don't be surprised if you are paying top dollar for food and drinks.Third rule of Paradise Cove, if you just want to play on the beach and don't plan on eating there, don't bring a car and use rideshare instead. Parking without validation is $100. Parking with validation is much cheaper.Overall its a fun place, but has its quirks.

The restaurant offers beach seating and customers can spend the day on the beach in front of the restaurant. If you spend more than $30 at the restaurant (easy to do) parking is only 8 dollars for a four hour stay.

Queued to get in to the car park (you can’t turn around) and then waited for 1/2 hr for our pre booked table. The restaurant was crammed with people, there was nowhere to stand or sit. Eventually, we were taken to a ‘booth’ to eat ‘supersize’ food. The food is ok but the ambience is awful. It is frantic,noisy and feels like you are eating in a factory.

30,Great Beach Spot with Good Food,"This was my second visit to Paradise Cove. On this visit around 2:00 p.m., the wait time was 2 hours. As we waited, we ordered 2 Cadillac (equivalent) margaritas. Unfortunately, both drinks had a funny taste and was completely off. The The Margarita on the rocks had a funny taste and was completely off. They used a very off brand orange liqueur that I think ruined the drink. We then opt'd for a bottle of wine as we waited for our table and to have with dinner.We were seated and for 15 minutes we never saw a waitress or waiter. After getting the manager, we got someone who took our food order (we were starving after waiting 2 hours). Again, our waitress never came over to apologize. We spoke with the manager who assigned us a new waiter who was very attentive. The food here is usually good and consistent and the shrimp did not disappoint.Unfortunately, there was a sweating board in the ceiling and after waiting for 2 hours, not having good service, the water started to drip down on our table. We decided to call it an afternoon and got our check to split.Management comp'd us a dessert and parking for the inconvenience.

20,Paradise Ruined,"I had been a fan for 25+ years. Although the beach has become more crowded, it was still tolerable last summer. This year was different! The parking lot that used to close when full now has valets to stack park the vehicles for $50 each on summer weekends (staying more than 4 hours and/or without a restaurant meal.) One notices multiple families in SUVs and vans sharing the exorbitant cost of parking. The result: the beach is like an ant hill or sardine can, depending on the slope.

The second time, this week, we arrived about 8pm and enjoyed watching the sun set over the ocean. It was the connection to the Rockford Files that drew us here initially, but whether that means anything to you or not, the peacefulness of this place will win you over. The ocean, the beach, the ramshackle pier.....all in all one of our favourite spots. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446grahamh
20,Beach Club gone wrong,"We frequent Paradise Cove several times a year. This review isn’t for the restaurant, because we love that part of it, this review is for the Beach Club and parking for the beach.What they are doing should be considered robbery. Park your car for four hours and buy food from the beach club and your price is 8 dollars. Go over your time limit , even by a minute, your price is 45, plus food. Park your car without food, expect to pay 50 dollars for four hours. It is just disgusting how they take advantage of families during the summer times. On top of that the food at the beach club is beyond ridiculous. Pay 90 dollars for two kids hot dogs and fish and chips? Wait for over an hour to get your food. And if you dare ask where your food is, get horrible attitude from the workers. I know it’s Malibu and things are pricey, but there is pricey and there is just plain wrong. The beach itself is okay, it’s nothing to write home about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hxa0063
30,But the location...,"Decided to grab a bite down by the beach during the wretched heat wave here to see if we could cool off and paradise cove is right on the beach. We had a reservation but please note, on the weekend, even early it's a mob scene and you still might have to wait. Took us about five minutes and we were seated. They no longer use plastic straws, but rather pasta straws!! And their coffee setup was lovely, complete with cinnamon sticks & whipped cream. The portions are huge BUT...found the potatoes to be very bland and bit undercooked, garnish of wilted lettuce & rotten strawberries. My omelette, I think old #3, wasn't very tasty even given the bacon, onions & mushrooms & cheddar. My hubby had avocado on his omelette but it was brown. Not much in the health food or vegan dept but this is not that place. We ate, took some pictures, didn't really get cooled off it was very muggy and home we went. But that location...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/536suannes
30,Crazy busy,"Insanely busy place. We parked out on the highway because parking was full at 10:30 am on a Sunday. We hung out at the beach for a few hours and thought we’d see if we could grab a bite to eat around 2 pm. At that point there was a 3 hour wait. The beach was just ok. Crowded and not much sand. Hard to swim because it was so rocky. But if you love cliffs, it’s gorgeous. Just not very fun if you want to play in the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baue10
10,Paradise cove,The restaurant was so filthy and people where in bathing suits and bare feet. The food was lousy the wait was very long and not worth the wait. The parking staff was very rude and obnoxious. I would recommend McDonalds instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kensustarsic
10,Horrible,The bartender was aweful. It took 40 minutes to get a drink and then you can’t go outside. They Don’t tell you it’s 35.00 to park until you try to leave.... never again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiehnly
30,"very busy spot, but very cool history... ""Rockford files!""","we drove down, noting the parking was 40 bucks but it you spent 30 at the restaurant, it was reduced to 6. We were there over lunch, not a good idea. VERY BUSY PLACE. Buy a tee-shirt, get validated or... put your name on the list THEN walk around and eat. Food was good but expensive, 40 bucks for three ice cream sundays and a piece of pie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/204scottm
50,"First time, hopefully not last","Came to Malibu from western New York for a family wedding. The dinner party after the wedding was at this restaurant. What a beautiful location and view. The seafood we shared was delicious. Loved the frozen drinks served with pasta straws. My spouse and I are hoping to come out this way again later this year. Parking is not free, but after validation from the restaurant, it will only cost $8.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94barbarae
50,Cant say enough great things about this place!,"Been here a few times now, and is my top pick for dining ON THE OCEAN! Can't ask for a better view. Lounge chairs behind the place are for sitting enjoying the view. We usually eat our breakfast, lunch or dinner and then hang out in the chairs for an hour or two. Parking is ""validated"" (if you spend over $30-$40), but you still have to pay the $8 minimum fee; any questions call them to find out exact pricing for parking. During the week is less crowded and no wait in my experience. If you go on a weekend, expect a long wait - but either way food is fantastic and again THAT VIEW!! It is very casual beach dining, very California style; shorts and flip flops and you'll fit right in. But sometimes you see families dressed up - it's all what you make it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11pama
50,The security is AWESOME,"I met Mark Lauren who works at Paradise Cove and he was so helpful, he was so wonderful and he was amazing he works out doors. He is very cheerful.

40,On Malibu Beach,"We love this place. Perfect setting on the sand in Malibu, CA but still reasonably priced. Good bar. Fresh seafood. Shelled peanuts at the entry which you can eat to your heart’s content then throw down the shells. Good service. Reservations highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMasonNashville
30,Pretty beach but cafe was very crowded,"Spent a few hours at Paradise Cove with wife and son. The beach is very nice, but parking is very expensive (unless you order $30+ from the cafe). The Paradise Cove Cafe was too crowded, so we ordered from take-out and ate at the outdoor tables. Food was mediocre, but the setting is lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBS661

50,"Breate Views, Greate Food and Good parking","Whenever I want to treat a friend or family to something special I go here. The place is locate as close to the shore as you can possibly get. You have the choice of eating inside with views of the ocean or on the sand in a covered area. The food is high quality and large portions so if you are not the big of an eater you might want to share a plate. At our last visit we were privileged to see a family of dolphins come up for air during our lunch. After your meal there are chairs on the sand facing the ocean to relax or you can go for a walk on the beach. The steep $35 parking fee keeps the area fairly uncrowded, however you can validate your ticket at the restaurant to pay only $6 for parking for two hrs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nilopedro
50,Great food and fantastic location,"This is the first review I’ve written when I’ve sent the food back! We order the hot sharing platter and soon realised that something had gone slightly wrong. The fries and calamari were at best lukewarm. We pointed this out to our waiter and the problem was quickly resolved, with fresh food being provided and apologies given. Things can go wrong in any kitchen; the difference between a good restaurant and a bad restaurant is how the waiting and cooking staff deal with it. The way the staff at the Paradise Cove managed it was text book - thank you for not making the situation awkward. The dish was enormous and delicious.Many other reviews have made comment about the outstanding location of the this restaurant, all of which we would agree with. The beach is incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigden19
40,Breakfast on the Beach!,"This place is best for breakfast (local malibu people know this) go early before all the crowds. The food at breakfast is best.Lunch & Dinner you can have a very long wait, very crowded, & expensive for the quality of food and service. You can also pay to go there park (at a cost) & spend the day on the beach but it is very crowded. Not for local people to go to the beach but could be fun for tourists maybe...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuFamily
20,Waited 90 mins for a table that was reserved,This place was really disappointing. We booked a table today at 1.45 and were told that it was busy and that if we wanted to eat outside there would be a 30 minute wait. We agreed but the wait ended up being 90 minutes. The service was also really slow and we had to go and find a waiter to place an order. The food was ok but massively over priced. I've been here before and had a slightly better experience but overall this place is kinda tacky and I would avoid it on the weekends as it was way too many people and really disappointing as it was a special occasion as my parents were visiting from England and it kinda put a dampener on our afternoon as we had no time to do anything afterwards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philb123456

40,Love the Beach and View,"My girlfriend wanted to have Easter lunch at this restaurant with friends and family. It was my first time there and I thought it was wonderful! We waited outside on the beach taking pictures and watching the kids having fun. The food portions were huge, but expensive! Fish and Chips was somewhere between $25-30, but it's Malibu so I couldn't complain too much. The food was ok; nothing to rave about, but their drinks were the bomb! The wait staff was very attentive and helpful. If given the opportunity, I would go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garhawk
10,disappointing,"Paradise cove is not nearly as beautiful you might imagine... I prefer Leo Carillo or other spots along the PCH. And the food is all about quantity, not quality. The service is poor. Definitely not worth the $30 minimum charge to go there, although it is easy to spend $30 as everything is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramen67
50,Wonderful Place on Beach,I went here on Christmas day. Even though it was crowded we didn't wait long. It was very very beautiful to sit near the ocean as the sun set. It's got a lively fun atmosphere and a good selection of food. I will absolutely go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Secondavenue
50,Wonderful place,"Took a trip up the Pacific Coast Highway while in Cali recently. Had always wanted to take this trip and wasn’t disappointed with any part of it. Our friends that we traveled with were told about the Paradise Cove Cafe by someone and recommend that we stop in and get something to eat. It was a wonderful place to stop and refresh as well as eat. Food was great, scenery was breathtaking and the atmosphere perfect. The wait staff was excellent as well. Found out this was the beach where several movies and tv shows have been filmed. Including Beach Blanket Bingo and The Rockford Files. Two of my favorites. Food was pricey but we planned for it. We came in the off season and got right in. The waitress said the wait during peak season can be 4-6 hours. If you can go see it. Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KurtR67
20,"Hard to complain about beach side dining, but...","This used to be the kind of place you could take your grandparents to for brunch... I don't know what happened to it, but now it's just an overpriced honkey tonk. Ridiculously crowded on the weekends... huge portions but other than the clam chowder, the food isn't that great either. If you're going to pay the ocean view premium, there are plenty of other options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1632ALphilipm
40,"Once a Paradise Cove, now just a Cove.","I think that this place is legendary. With that said, I feel the luster has worn off over the decades. With many pics from the past, I think that coming here you have to know what you're getting.The beach is really not that clean. Compared to Newport or Laguna Beach. It has its history. Recommended to park on PCH and have a quick walk down to the beach. If you are just visiting, parking can be very expensive. If you are eating at the Cafe, then its a bit cheaper.The food here is a bit expensive, but the portions are sizable.Walking to the beach while parked on PCH, bringing a picnic will help you make the most of the beach here. The cafe has a bar so you can get a pretty expensive drink.With that said, I'd only come back knowing this to make the experience less about spending money and more about enjoying the scenery and atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chillin247365

40,Dinner with a great view,"Decided to eat dinner outside for the view of the ocean.... Come before sunset if possible. The meals were about average but reasonably priced - Especially for Malibu.

If eating outside, keep in mind that the ground is covered in sand so do not wear anything you wouldn't mind getting a bit dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2488joeb
20,Disappointing beach visit,"My husband and I came from Cleveland to visit our son. Naturally a trip to the beach was high priority since all bodies of water were frozen solid at home.

Try the Shee Crab Soup for two. It just as wonderful as the clam chowder. A must try!! The portions are huge so I suggest sharing. Maybe, order a variety and share with one other. The clam chowder is wonderfully delicious. The bread was overcooked so it made it difficult to cut but it wasn't a deal breaker. Our waitress Susan was awesome. Very friendly and great service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianad762

40,Watch out for parking,"Ok, so first and foremost i gotta admit that the only reason i came to Paradise Cove was to see the pier. Numerous video clips/tv shows were shot there so I was a little curious to see it. The parking price is outrageous, you might as well park by the road and walk for about 5 minutes. It was a nice day and the breeze was just amazing. Definitely a place to visit when in Malibu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafaela596

40,The perfect place for Sunday brunch,"People who live in Malibu are lucky: they have access to the perfect place to have drinks on a Sunday afternoon. I thought Las Vegas champagne brunches were perfect, and they sorta are, but Paradise Cove is my preferred place to waste away a Sunday.Sit outside in the sand with an umbrella shielding your drinks from the sun. I had a few Anchor beers, which almost anchored me here, but my family wanted to check out Point Dume so we left before I could get firmly entrenched. Next time I visit I vow to try every tropical drink on the menu. Maybe even some food too...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanHeatt

Surprisingly good coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelaing7
40,Decent Place,From WISCONSIN. Stopped by right before lunch from LA to Santa Barbara. Had the crab cakes. A little pricey but wanted to try it out. It was okay. Was high tide so saw some good waves. We had two couples and bill was around $65 each including tip. Not sure what other places charge to view the beach but would have been about $35 to park without eating in there. Then parking was like $6.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobavam

It cannot be bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philmash
50,Breakfast on the beach,"One of my favorite restaurants in Malibu. The food portions are very large so consider sharing. The atmosphere is fun, and light. There are tables that are directly on the sand which i personally love. There is a full bar and i believe it is the only beach in Malibu that allows alcohol on the actual beach. There is also a private beach in the back of the restaurant with day beds and chairs for rent. I can go on, but overall a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240alexandrias
40,Great Place for food and beach access! Come Early...,We have been to the location several times and you cannot beat it for a classic Beach experience.

40,Lovely Beach location used by many film stars and musicians for filming.,"We went primarily to eat at the Paradise Cove Beach Cafe but also enjoyed a long walk along the beach and a splash in the sea. It is a very clean and pretty beach area. If you visit the Cafe then you can see numerous pictures of stars and the stories attached regarding filming done around the Cove area. It's worth a visit however you should note that parking here is $50 a day, unless you spend $30 or more at the Cafe when you get a much reduced parking rate for a maximum of 4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474debbier

50,Amazing views. Waves for some surfing,"The views are spectacular. Waves can be strong sometimes so be careful not to leave your children unattended. Seagulls are everywhere and are fun to watch. Thinking of learning how to surf? I saw a couple of people who were taking advantage of the waves to get use to being on the surf board. There's a small Pier nearby too. There is ample parking that costs $35 unless you eat at the cafe - will only cost $6.0 ( although you have to spend at least $30 there). Overall, it was an unforgettable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pejenn
20,Nice but pricey,"This is a great spot but.... the parking is confusing and only $6 if you spend $30 in the beach cafe, which to be fair is very easy to do because it is expensive.The food did look good but we didn't try it. The staff looked unhappy or bored or both.Yes there's loads of character in the beach cafe but they're trading on the fame and history of the place.Basically park up on the PCH and walk down, it isn't far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanRB236
50,Very nice location,"We picked this location while staying in LA and we loved the tropical atmosphere and the excellent beach beds and service. It is a very nice place and the $ 30 for a 2-persons bed + umbrella is not excessive. Parking is quite expensive but much cheaper if staying for less than 4 hours and having breakfast or lunch at the restaurant. We enjoyed the beach a lot! Waves are quite tricky, especially combined with the stones in the water – not an easy ocean access… But views are magnificent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SavertFamily
40,Mini-Vacation,"When you visit Paradise Cove in Malibu, think of it as a mini vacation not just for a meal. Now, that mini vacation will include crazy parking, crowds, expensive eats and drinks, and some scenic views. Take the pretty good service, tasty food, and beautiful beach as the good stuff you’ll remember and the other stuff in stride as part of the package. You do feel like you have been away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbM4235IC

However we arrived at 11am on a Friday and the place was already packed and the double beds (which are the comfiest) were already gone! The place was filled with families with young children and tourists so our trip was all but relaxing. Furthermore the food at the cantina was just ok, and we only purchased it to avoid the parking fee. But if you really want to enjoy Paradise Cove, come early, park outside and bring your own food so you just pay for the bed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraheleid
40,Good Food!,"Food is good & plenty of it. Pricey, but family style meals. Hard to choose from the menu because there's so much. The only small portion was the swordfish. Recommend bucket of clams, shrimp scampi, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach,, clam chowder, etc.Bad news - I have no idea what the ladies do at the front desk/reception. We waited an hour to be seated. I could see most of the tables from where I sat at the bar. No less than 8 tables open with no one seated in them for 30-40 min. The ""back"" room was virtually empty. I was told that they give people wi buzzers 10 min. to show up after they are 'buzzed'. The tables stayed empty for more than 30 minutes in some cases. The restaurant has to be losing lots of money. Maybe it's a Malibu thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelPrincess9
40,Great spot for lunch,"We were in town to see a Dodgers game and didn't have much to do all day. We drove up the coast and stopped off at Paradise Cove. The lunch was really terrific and spot was amazing.Our advice is to get there early because by the time we left, the police wouldn't let cars down due to overcrowding. Fun day and great pit stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larrylegend28
30,Historic beach house but paradise?,"This historic Malibu beach house serves truckloads of food (order one plate for two, especially the chocolate cake tower). The giant place is packed and noisy. All efficiency here. Small and relatively busy beach in front of the restaurant, with seating possibility outside. Parking USD 6 and without visiting the restaurant a stiff USD 25! Nothing really special here and definitely not paradise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/appeltjes
40,Summer beach fun,This is relatively a small beach for California beaches. The nice part is that the ocean being a cove is relatively calm. So great for senior citizens or small children. Very pretty cliffs and rocks to wander around. Go early in the day to make good usage of the lounges and to get a parking spot. Need to take advantage of the 4 hour lounge fee of $30. Towels and umbrellas are supplied with that as well. Employees are pleasant. They start taking down lounges usually at 5:30 at least they did the day we were there. Buy food $30 which will go to the $36 parking fee so be sure to get your ticket validated. Can sit in Adirondack chairs for free or bring your own towels and beach chairs. Pricey$$$,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmetzis
40,"Loved walking the beach, but parking is overpriced",If you go on a weekend come early. The parking is limited and what we did not like about the parking is that on weekends if you do not eat at Paradise Cove Café parking costs $50.00. That is outrages! You can get your parking validated inside the café if you et or make a purchase of their merchandise for at least $30. The beach itself is nice and I really enjoyed walking along the beach and visiting the location where the Rockford Files were filmed. But $50 to park?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruths153
50,Great food! Great experience!,"When you are traveling down the 1. Stop at Paradise Cove. The beach is gorgeous but the restaurant is a hidden gem. They brought us Calamari in a huge martini glass, so good. The outside has sand floors so you really feel like you are eating on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/501deannap
20,Overrated Overpriced,I don't mind crowds on a beach but in Southern California there is no need to cram in on a beach so close that you can smell the sweat coming off the people next to you. Add to that the $50 parking fee for the day and this play makes no sense to me other than being a tourist trap. To be fair there are a lot of life guards which is nice and they are very kind but there are sooooo many other options that for me Paradise cove didn't live up to the hype. Also for what its worth this was a very atypical crowd for beaches in the area. I'm guessing because most locals stay away so it was mostly tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915natel
40,"""Barefoot on the Beach"" Casual fun dining","I revisited this restaurant 15 years later and nothing has changed. Relaxed atmosphere, very casual , great for kids, outside seating is on the beach sand.First occasion was off season so quiet and relaxed , second occasion was peak school holidays , so busy and booking essential. Choose your time accordingly what suits your needs.However regardless of season the staff were friendly, service fast, mocktails delicious (they do have alcohol but we were driving). The portions are huge so meant for sharing. Their signature dish of crumbed calamari in a huge martini glass is yum and a great family dish to share.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLEAVES27
20,Waste of time and money,"Okay, this used to be a great place to eat and just hang out. But then, greed set in. You are charged for absolutely everything...parking, to sit on the beach, and of course food. It's a tourist destination which means it's crowded. It's expensive and just not worth going to my estimation. And the food isn't that good. Sorry Paradise, not Paradise anymore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtdanza

First I go here all the time, if I had to guess at least a 100 times, the location is WOW, old school malibu, right on the beach ! very tucked away. I cant even begin to think or remember how many TV shows or movies have filled here.. THE LIST IS LONG! Just look at all the photos on the walls.

50,Mind Blowing,Inspired by Closer by Chainsmokers - the approach to Malibu from LA was just amazing - breathtaking beauty of the Pacific. Although not exactly at the shooting spot - me and my Daughter had a good time of our life spending 2 hours in Malibu at the Paradise Cove. The place is ideal for family - a privately owned restaurant that includes a beach with a fishing jetty. We walked for about 2 Kms along the beach and smelt the balmy sun on our skins. It was a perfect clear weather. Had food at the Cove - well taken care of by the people there. It is a cute little place that is hidden - but for those who know about it - is a treasure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonmoyp2017

I wanted to visit this place as the video 'Britney-Sometimes' was filmed here and I am a fan of her 😀 I think this place gives you what Malibu can give, you can feel in the atmosphere what Malibu is about. The resto is quite expensive but you don't necessarily need to visit it. The parking is expensive but you can park on the Highway for free and it is 5 minutes walk from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoglarkaKov

If you're looking for a beach to enjoy in Malibu you somewhere free and open. This one is kinda closed in and quite expensive.

I love the Paradise Shrimp and Red Crab Chop Salad the chocolate cake for dessert is as tall as a skyscraper. The drinks and beach are great also..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredraymond522
40,Not your average beach experience...,"This is definitely a must visit EVEN with the crowds, and chaos. It certainly is a better visit midweek while people are working for lunch. Weekends are insane, and expect a long wait. Recently, we weren't even able to park there. We had to park on the PCH which was a bear, and the only reason we did it was because we had rented an outdoor area for my nephew's birthday. It was fenced, and private with all of the fun of being at Paradise Cove. The food was plenty!!! It's a great place to bring kids, and the walk to the pier is nice. The view of the cliffs is just beautiful. The thing about it is really timing it so that you don't have crowds! Good luck!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244angelah
40,Worth it for what it is,"I thought it was good. Not the greatest but for ocean front Malibu dining, come on . You are paying for the experience. It's not outrageous probably 60$ for a couple unless you are drinking. I say go and sit in the sand and enjoy your dinner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carl26062

20,Why did I come again.,"Word of Warning: its $50 for a car to park!!!! unless you eat with them and spend $30 minimum on food.Ok, so I have done many road trips from LA - San Fran - Vegas and back with groups of people form UK and Europe (yeah yeah, UK is part of Europe - we kind of know).and 3x now have stopped off at the fantastic little beach cove that seems like a hidden Gem. the views, the beach vibe - PERFECT....then you have to come inside to get food. It's a Family run business and seem like one that has got so carried away with a captive market pricing strategy, their egos as a team are terrible. Well either that or they just don't care - the staff simply look fed up!No friends typical American greetings - the hostess took us to our table without speaking to us once. Then asking if we could sit out on the seats at the beach, we were told we had to go back to the bar and oder there. back and forward.Food wasn't bad - but for pub food bit over priced, but you'd spend anything just to avoid paying $50 parking fee.I asked about WiFi and its not that it didn't work, but the staff just shrug off any question without even TRYING to help. And maybe I keep having a cold spell from them visiting here, but when every time my clients/guests complain of the same thing. Then I realise its a problem - It's simply not the typical California Hospitality we've come to love visiting for past 10 yrs.but seriously $50 parking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaunx10

50,"Wonderful seafood, even in torential rain","My sister, her friend, and I drove up the coast to enjoy a nice lunch on the beach. Unfortunately, it was during the CA monsoons. Nevermind, we went anyway and boy am I glad we did. We all enjoyed a cup of new England clam chowder. It was so good we took some home for later. The chowder was thick, creamy and loads of meaty clams. For our main meal we tried fish and lobster tacos. My 3 tacos had small sweet chunks of lobster served with avocado, salsa, lettuce, and a unique ginger type sauce. So good I didn't even offer to share. Our friend had a fish taco and she said hers was delicious. My sister had a tuna melt. The portion was big, my sister took half of it home. I ordered, to go, a po 'boy fish sandwich. I had a little bite of it that night and the fish was very tender.I'm so glad we went even though it rained. If it were a very nice day, we might have had to wait in line. And, it would've been well worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spajnky
40,Gorgeous beach and views,"Paradise Cove has a gorgeous beach, and we spent a wonderful day lying in the sun and walking the beach. The public is welcome, but you pay for parking. Or, you can pay less for parking if you eat or drink at the Beach Café ($30 minimum). Doing so will get you four hours of parking, which includes your time in the café. You can just walk to the beach, but the difficulty will be to find parking close enough to justify the walking distance.The beach is clean and upper-scale. It's a money-beach, if you know what I mean.The beach is clean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettmI2598CL

Enjoy great margueritas, sandwiches and cold beer, while watching pelicans dive into the Pacific Ocean. This restaurant has many historic connections to several 50's, 60's beach movies and that history can be viewed on the walls as you stroll the area. Wonderful bar sandwiches and seafood are enjoyed while curling your toes in the sand at the outdoor tables or park yourself in the timeless atmosphere indoors. Small parking fee but well worth the visit. We thoroughly enjoyed this 2 hour road break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tavysandin

40,Scenic,Came here midweek and hit it right because it was very quiet. My wife wanted to come to see the pier off indecent proposal. Beach was quiet and was very scenic although when busy get full quickly. We paid the $36 dollar parking. Seems steep but you get $30 back in the beach side restaurant which was good.

50,Hidden Film Location,"You'll recognize Paradise Cove from tv shows like, ""Gidget"" and ""Rockford Files."" But many movies were made here, too. Although all beaches are public and free in California, Paradise Cove charges $50 to park for 4 hours. That sounds like a lot but if you spend $35 in their cafe, parking is reduced to $6. That's easy to do because the food is fantastic! BTW...if you want to save some bucks, bring your own cooler. Beer, wine, and soda is allowed to be brought in to drink on the beach. Otherwise, you'll pay around $8 per drink. If you like cold seafood, try their all-you-can-eat salad bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kl417g

We decided to pop in on the way past to see if breakfast was available - what we found was a restaurant right on the beach.If outside, your table / seat is on sand to add to the experience. The service is exceptional, welcoming and friendly. We had breakfast which was absolutely fantastic.

The beach is so pretty with lots of sun beds but we didn't stop long enough. We had fantastic salads on a hot day. There were two girls celebrating ones birthday. The waiter brought them a mile high chocolate cake with a candle and sang, what a great place to go on your birthday. The girls very kindly gave us a plate of cake to share, it was amazing and it is on the dessert menu.

The cove was packed with people, food was great Lobster Tacos were great.

The place was incredibly busy, very long lines of cars parked by the roadside on highway 1, not surprising given the car park was full and cost $50 !, beach was pretty mediocre, big waves and dirty brown sand. Lots of better places like Zuma beach just up the road, I guess the Malibu name attracts people...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisrheccles
50,"Lovely location, amongst the Hollywood elite.","We came here to eat at the Beach Cafe, but of course the Cove is an added bonus.! The beauty with the cove is that it's relatively quiet as it's not a long beach and is cut off either end by rocks..Parking is pricey if you don't eat at the cafe. The houses around it are all amazing. Happily recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzydisney
10,Please: stay away,"Ok - my wife and I love the Point Dume beach. However, we've been passing Paradise Cove always on our way - and it always looked so busy - a full/ overcrowded beach we wanted to avoid by all means.Still, we tried long time ago - and got scared by the $50 parking fee PLUS the floods of people streaming there (which suggested the place must be really awesome). Now, we have friends over from Germany and wanted to give it a try yesterday - and had one of the worst beach experiences in our lives. It stank - the water line is full of stones - and the when asking for a table we were told rather uncharmingly the wait was two hours. And that on a ""not so busy weekday"".We left after 30 mins, paid the discounted $35 self-parking on weekdays ;-), and ALL promised never to return. In all honesty: with the highest parking we have ever paid we expected some luxury - and not work out sun beds, uncharming staff - I entirely fail to understand how some one could actually love this place - especially with The Sunset Restaurant with a $5 valet parking and courteous nice service and excellent food less than five minutes away (Point Dume Beach). Again, the idea of going was not to find a bargain. The parking already suggests it's not. I would have paid $100 - if the place was an excellent experience.If this place is Paradise, I'd rather pass paradise. The only good part of our experience is that we no longer need to worry if we are missing something by not going there. Sorry guys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
50,Another diamond on a neckless of the Cali Coastline to see,Paradise cove is just breathtaking with gorgeous views and rolling surf.

40,"Cozy, comfortable beach with nice amenities","Paradise Cove is such as lovely cove, protected from the elements even on a windy day. This is the only place I know of in Malibu where you can have drinks on the sand, which always makes me feel like I'm on vacation in Hawaii. The restaurant has pretty good food, though it's a little pricey. I'd choose Paradise over any other Malibu Beach, especially if you are looking for a secluded cove vs. large open Zuma Beach (Zuma is nice, it's just a different experience). Don't believe the hype about El Matador - though it is very pretty, it's way too much effort for what you get. Paradise is nice! FYI there's also a fun easy waterfall hike across PCH, if you want to combine your beach experience with a forest experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183annemariep

50,If you're nearby,"Worth the short drive from PCH to Paradise Cove just for the views. Many years ago I happened on this spot while segments of ""Indecent Proposal"" were being filmed here. So it's etched fondly into my memory. Turns out that this is used as a location for many films. If you're hungry there's a restaurant near that's a bit pricey but worth it for the location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardf736
40,"GREAT ... in the fall, winter,spring.","Lovely place to experience. The food was just ok, but necessary to avoid the high $35 and up parking fee. I don't blame them though because the beach is small and if they didn't do something to curtail the crowd ... well, you get it. Avoid it like the plague in the summer though. Lot's of people and with careless people come trash. You're better off going further north (actually west since Malibu is south facing). The roads are wider with less driving stress than further south (east).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422sh
20,Crazy zoo. Was a nice place and now it is overcrowded mess. Food at the cafe sucks too,"See title. Summertime weekends, think Disneyland on the sand in terms of crowds. Sorry, but this is not my idea of relaxation. I used to live there and it was a great place for kids, dogs and water play, now it is an overcrowded sea of humanity - many of whom are rude and loud! If you go during the week, it is not as bad and my favorite time to go is fall and winter. Hamburgers are about the only thing they don't mess up. Go in the off season, sit in the sand and have a glass of wine and burger, otherwise stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyp400
40,Watch out for the shore break!,Great little bay ideal for a day trip with great restaurant for lunchJust watch out for the shore break - the beach shelves steeply either side of the pier and as such the waves build and break quickly. The number of people knocked over by the surf on what was an unexceptional wave day was entertaining to watch but not fun to be on the receiving end.The secret: go about 100 yards south of the pier where the beach slopes more shallowly or go out beyond the waves (which isn't far).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DomJohn
40,Watch the parking charges,"In the Road trip USA Pacific Coast Highway it states that this restaurant is amazing for Cheese Sandwiches. I have had had better ""Jim Carey Liar Liar Quote""I had the cheese sandwich and this isn't amazing. There are far better things on the menu and the seafood looked amazing.The location is phenomenal and doesn't get any better. The restaurant has a 1950's ambience and awareness of its history. This is just off the pier on the Malibu Beach where they filmed some episodes of the Rockford Files. Children of the 70's this is a pilgrimage site.Must visit but watch the parking.

30,Clean the place up! :(,"The area itself is nice. However, with the price for parking and some beach chairs the beach should be combed each morning to rid your guests of the trash that the tide brought in overnight. There were deflated rafts, flipflops, plastic, just to name a few laying around on the the rocks of the beach. Surely a worker is supposed to be cleaning it up? It looked like it had been there a while. The food in the restaurant was ""ok"" too, nothing spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunturnip
50,Love Love Love This Place,"Need I say more? I love this place!!!It's beautiful and relaxing. Even though sometimes it gets crowded, it's still relaxing.Chill on the sand and feast your eyes on beautiful scenery. Then when you get hungry, run to the cafe and have a feast for your tummy. The average person might get overwhelmed by the price (like myself), $35.00 for an appetizer plate, $50.00 for the paella. But once the food came it wasn't a plate, it was a large skillet good enough for atleast 6 people. There was only 3 of us and a baby so we had leftovers which we ate days after. And I will add, the food is soooooo good!!!Parking is very pricy. $50.00. So, plan on staying no more than 4 hours, eat at the restaurant and order something $35.00 or above, have your ticket validated and pay 8.00 bucks for parking.I'm from SoCal and this is definitely one of my favorite places here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/experiencecollector
30,Quick visit,We walked the beach a bit after eating lunch at the restaurant there. Parking is $50 if you don't eat at the restaurant which seemed a bit high for a crowded beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863marlysm
50,Called in for an amazing breakfast,We just called in for breakfast. The actual beach was narrow and busy and didn't look that appealing. It was a bit cloudy so we sat inside and had a lovely breakfast with great service. I had a three egg omelette and we also had waffles and pancakes.

It was a head if lettuce cut in half with some cherry tomatos and bacon but. $10.95. We paid $117 for 5 people just eating the basics. They validated our parking but it was still $6.00. The beach was dirty. Not for an average Midwestern family. If you are rich and don't care about the cost, go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirbyfive
30,Mixed feelings,"If you are going to charge 30 - 50 dollars for parking then the beach had better be first class, Paradise Cove isn't, if anything i found the beach area scruffy and not very nice.For food they have adopted a pile em high approach. Paella with spare ribs sticking out of it? The largest sea tower ever made – why not?The food was average in quality but the service was good and the delicious rum / ice cream cocktails helped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scudamore
20,First & last time,"I've been wanting to head up to this spot for a while. I'd done my research & knew about the parking rates and the break guests receive if they spend at least $30 in food at the restaurant. Well...lunch for 4 was just over $100 & that was (1) veggie burger, (2) cheeseburgers, chicken salad sandwich, a beer & one large bottle Diet Coke. (Burgers came w/fries). For all that, I still had the privilege of paying $6/parking! The beach was OK - lots of seaweed though. Lots of better beach spots around Malibu than this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinf967
30,Gorgeous,"Not sure if I should be reviewing my visit here on the listing for the beach or on this page for the cafe. I will try to post both places if TA allows me...We wanted to get the kids to put down their iPads and check out some nature up close and personal. This beach showed up in a tide pool guide so we decided to check it out.We didn't know it would be $50 to park ($35 weekdays)! However, if you spend $30 at the cafe the parking fee is reduced to $8. However, you can only stay for 4 hours at that price. I don't know what the price is if you stay longer.There is a take out option if you want to eat on your beach blanket, or in the car on the way home.A cheeseburger+fries, chicken salad sandwich+bag of pretzel chips plus a water put us well over the $40 mark, plus we still had to pay for parking. So we decided we had paid $50 for parking and got the food for ""free""The chicken salad sandwich was excellent, and the burger was really good.The beach was beautiful and the tide pools were great, as they had incredible rock formations that the kids loved. The one good thing about the price is that the beach was not very crowded.I would love to go back, but will be hard to justify the price. Maybe there is a way to park on the street and walk? The area close to the beach has cones set up, so not sure how far you would have to go to make that an option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItsMikey5
50,Stunning as always,"Paradise cove, although a little on the pricy side, is always so so lovely to hang out at. Two weeks later and I still have the tan lines to prove it. Guacamole and chips with a beer on the beach - what could be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA-Ang
40,Paradise Cove Restaraunt -,"There are mixed reviews on this restaurant. We were just there and as it was in the middle of the week we got right in and we're served very promptly. There are comments regarding the parking and it's cost 30.00 during the week and 50.00 in the weekend and thus is for real hours, however if you going to the restraunt and your bill is 30.00 plus they validate your parking pass and then the parking cost of reduced to 6.00 during the week and 8.00 on the weekend. The prices range from mid point to a bit on the higher side, however their platters are priced well. We had the Hot Combo platter that was quite large and had two types of shrimp, ribs, chicken strips, calamari, served over french fries. Too much food for two people to eat and the cost was approximately 30.00. This platter would easily serve 3 - 4 people with normal appetites. All the items were very tasty and did not disappoint. Drinks were on the high side but you sort of expect that when you are at a restaurant on the beach with view.There are several signs when driving into the restraunt that let's you know about the cost of parking and what you have to spend in the restaurant to reduce the cost..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viking112016
40,"Fun, Beachy restaurant on the beach","We've been to this place several times; the food is pretty good and the beach is ok, but it's fun to sit outside and eat on the sand. If you're going just for a beach experience, there are more interesting beaches nearby which don't cost as much to access. If you're going for the food, there are better places to eat. Nonetheless, this is one of the more casual and fun places to hang out on Malibu beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susiespy

40,A must see if you are anywhere nearby,"Came here for all the obvious reasons, as an international tourist, you know more about it from tv so good to see it in person.

10,very expensive walk on a beach,"Driving through Malibu late afternoon and thought a walk on a beach would round off what had been a really nice day, lovely drive through Santa Monica Mountains and a visit to the splendid Getty Villa. We saw a sign and drove down the narrow canyon approach road. Also saw that the car park was a pay area and that the daily cost of $35 seemed very expensive. Then saw that the cafe validated tickets and charge was then $6. We had our walk, tide was high, access wasn't clear and the pier is closed for works. Afterwards we went t the cafe, we considered having a meal, but it was too early for us, so we just had coffee. When we presented our ticket for validation we were told there was a $30 minimum and as this was stated on the sign had to pay the full $35. Our stay lasted about 30 minutes. This will undoubtedly be the worst value of our trip to California. Neither the staff at the cafe were particularly empathetic. Our tough luck. Paradise Cove, what a joke.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noel021
40,Historical and beautiful,"A spot that you've seen on numerous tv shows, movies and commercials The location is amazing and very resort like. On a nice weekend you will be lucky to get parking and the cost to park or even walk in is a little too steep for our liking.

The parking is $40 or $6 if validated at the Beach Cafe once you've had a bite to eat! The beach is very small so could probably get quite busy (same with the car park) however we enjoyed relaxing in the sun and had a short walk up an down the beach. There was a shoal of dolphins really close in which was amazing! I imagine during summer you could spend a full day here playing in the ocean and sunbathing but it was quite chilly when we were there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferb454

40,Big bucks for Malibu food & view,This iconic Malibu restaurant is a charming hide away off PCH in a romantic cove on the Pacific. The small beach view is terrific. Just remember no matter how casual the place seems you're dining in Malibu. We were a party of four ordering four sandwiches at lunch time and two daiquiris which came to $140 with tip. And you have to pay $6.00 to park. If you don't get your parking ticket validated the parking fee becomes $40. Malibu makes sure the Carl's Jr. riffraff stays away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyager005

The kids had several choices and we're delighted to have breakfast--toes in the sand. After breakfast the kids walked up and down the beach, even meeting a baby sea lion on the shore. The setting is nothing short of amazing and the staff was incredibly inviting. We plan to visit for dinner later in our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnstonsB

40,Great atmosphere,"The concierge at our hotel recommended Paradise Cove as a good lunch spot while driving up the PCH so we decided to give it a shot. They have a parking lot that fills up quickly....and offer validation that costs $6 for 4 hours...it's $40 otherwise if you don't eat there and want to just use the beach. They have a regular dining room and a semi-covered outside area that sits on the sand. We were there early enough to secure a table outside and really enjoyed the temperate March weather. The food was just so-so. We had the nachos for a starter and they were OK, the portions for everything are very big. They offer a salad bar for $22 or so and it was OK, nothing overly special. You definitely pay for the location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andym207
50,The greatest and most relaxing beach in Malibu,"Paradise Cove is a must when visiting Mailbu. The restaurant has a unique culinary diversity at reasonable prices; you can seat inside or at the beach location.

And the greatest plus for a California beach, you actually can drink beer or wine at the beach! Yes!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677ricardoa
40,Fun beach,"We have been coming to paradise cove for years, the draw for us is that you can legally drink beer and wine on the beach. The restaurant food is also good, a little pricey but its worth it for the convenience of being able to order food on the beach. The outdoor bar is really fun and there are a ton of beds and lounge chairs you can rent. Its gets crowded so get here early and snag a parking space in the lot, its a long walk up and down him if you park on the street. parking is expensive (I think it was $40.00 last year) but if you order food at the restaurant they validate so if you are going to order food its worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephsoltes

10,Paradise lost,Not what I expected for a relaxing time by the shore. Place felt more like a interment camp. They tell you can or cannot walk. There's a lot of rules for a place that's supposed to be relaxing.You are not allowed to go outside on beach with a drink. I like my toes in the sand when sipping margaritas. Be careful where you walk outside of restaurant. A man told us to stand in certain place. Hated it. The restaurant is dirty and loud. I am from the East coast so I was unprepared for this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brianadams2

30,"Overpriced and to me, over hyped.","I've been wanting to visit this particular ""private pier and beach"" because of all the ""hub-bub"" about it. Supposedly ""beautiful"" ""the best ever"" ""a gem""... But, there's a parking fee of $40.00 parking fee...YES...$40.00. Which supposedly, can be knocked down to $6.00 if you eat at the cafe...But, I had no intention of being blackmailed into spending $30.00+ on a lunch so I parked on Pacific Coast Hwy and walked a short distance in (maybe a 1/4 mile).When I got there, there were an inviting old cabin & motor homes to set a 'beachy feel'. I walked on down to the beach, and the pier entrance was locked tighter than 12 yr old girls diary. I looked Right and walked past the restaurant to the rocks. Yes, nice rocks. Got some nice pictures. At Low tide you can walk through the knee deep water to a smaller beach and yes...nice. But don't let the tide get you stranded...So...worth $40.00? No, not to me. But to be honest, a lot of people have disposable incomes (I do not). And if money meant absolutely NOTHING to me...then I suppose so.I don't know many beaches worth $40.00. And, there are SO MANY FREE (or reasonably priced county & State) beaches, that this beach, is not worth more than an ""average"" to me. I suggest you visit EL MATADOR STATE BEACH just North of Paradise Cove. $6.00 parking. Bring a lunch & drinks and walk and look and enjoy the BEAUTIFUL rocky coast line and beach!!!

You need to eat in the restaurant in order to get your parking validated. You are limited to four hours of parking when you get validated. You can bring lounge chairs or umbrellas or rent there. At low tide it's an excellent walking beach. The waves are not good for boogie boarding as they are pretty strong sets. Tons of small children around; very good bathrooms.

40,Well worth the splurge! It is wonderful,"We enjoyed the beach and the cafe. Fruity drinks that earn their umbrella or in this case, very big straws! My kids loved theirs, and for those looking to enjoy a relaxing adult beverage, you won't be disappointed. We totally enjoyed ours. The food was tasty with very large portions, so plan on taking some home. Delicious chowder!The beach is comfortable. We were in business and business casual attire so no swimming for us but we enjoyed the beach and beach chairs just the same. We arrived about 4 p.m. on a Friday and left about 7 p.m. so we only paid $6 for parking. dinner and drinks for 2 minors and 2 adults ran about $180 before tip. The restaurant was busy but service was decent. While we were there, a waitress spilled something on the floor. She swiftly went to get something to clean it up. My guess is she may have been fairly new because while she was searching for a cleaning cloth a waiter came in, saw the small spill and quickly took care of it then let her know so she could go on with her work waiting tables. This showed kIndness, teamwork, customer care, laughter, delicious food, and a beautiful beach. No wonder it is Paradise Cove! The only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is because the price is high for parking ($40 if not getting $40 worth of food) and food, so many budgets would place this in the splurge category. Beach wise, it is five stars and more! It is worth saving up and going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjm0508

The restaurant and bar are on the actual sand, lovely food and relaxing to just sit there and enjoy where you are!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineO313
30,Not impressed by the place,"I was spending for hours with my family renting sunbeds on the beach. The location was great but I was dissapointed that the service offer was much below what we expected considering the price level of 50 dollars per sunbed and a 40 dollar parking fee. We assumed that we at least would be offered:- towels- welcome tray with fresh fruit- mineral water- after sun- cold towels- smoothie shot- free wireless internet connectionNothing of the above was included which makes me wonder what kind of lifestyle concept they try yo achieve in this place?There is much room for improvement here, and I would not recommend this place to my friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889claesj
30,Nothing special!,"Nice beach given by mother nature so 3 stars only for that. Who are the people behind this concept? I don't know if CA style is suppose to be a bit chabby and that people go without expectations in this areas? I will gladly pay a lot of money for quality and service. I would like to send the people who run this business on a crash course and visit to one of #purobeach lifestyle establishments. Lesson 1 would be to give your paying customers something for their money, how about a towel since a sunbed coast 50 $? We paid 150$ + 40$ parking for what? If your smart you could really do something good here since there are so few places in CA that are well prepared with service like sunbeds, umbrellas etc.+ for the workers who tried their best even though the lack of training was present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne-CharlottN
40,"Spectacular Views, plan to stay for Drinks & Eats ...","This is THE California beach scene locale from the time of ""Gidget"" - the ""Beach Boys"" - gentrified Hollywood, to the present day. Parking is a killer $40.00 last time I was there. So plan to eat & have drinks on the beach. The amount that you paid for parking is a credit towards food & drinks. Overall Awesome..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Fun Place,Paradise Cove is a fun place to visit and eat. The beach is beautiful. Food is good but a bit pricey. You can sit on the beach to eat. Cannot drink alcohol except for beer on the chairs on the . beach . Parking is expensive and scarce.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tchermom
50,A Blast From The Past,"We love going to Paradise Cove Beach Restaurant! Always fun and delicious Sea Food. There is outdoor lounge chairs on the sand to enjoy the views of the Pacific and sip your favorite drink. We shared the steamed clams, calamari, and shrimp scampi, delicious! Great restaurant to take out of town guests. I'm a native Californian and remember going there in the 60's. Always fun. Great Service, Charles our waiter was terrific!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathieP_12
40,Good Food - Fun Beach!,"We arrived at 10:00am on a Tuesday. The most surprising thing was the parking fee. If you are eating at the cafe only the fee is $6.00. If you stay at the beach and are there 4 hours or more the fee is $40.00. A lot of people park on the road outside the beach/entrance area, we decided to pay the fee when we left of $40.00. Another person here stated the parking fee is waived if you spend that much in the restaurant - but we did not find that to be true. Note, we spent $142.00 in the restaurant.There were four of us in our group and the wait to be seated was perhaps 2 minutes. We did not have a reservation, but they are recommended, particularly on the weekend.We ordered a Carrot Cake Waffle, Macadamia Coconut Pancakes, Popeyes Favorite Omelet, and the Classic Eggs Benedict. The carrot cake waffle was described by my 20 year old son as ""like eating a crispy piece of carrot cake"" with lots of soft frosting (aka whipped cream). My 18 year old daughter at the macadamia coconut pancakes and although they were unique and cooked wonderfully - she had ""sugar overload"" when she was finished. The omelet (with spinach and bacon) was huge! The bacon had a fantastic smokey taste and the egg was cooked well. I had the eggs benedict and it was nothing special - just ""classic eggs benedict"" as it is called. The portion was average as at any other restaurant.We all had coffee (black) and juice along with our meals. The service was quick, accurate, and the food was serve hot.After leaving the cafe we spent the next 5 hours at the beach. We did not rent a cabana, yet there was plenty of space on the beach at 11:15am.Somewhere in the parking lot is the location of the Rockford Files trailer. Sure would be nice for us ""old folks"" if there was a little plaque there or something!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnesotaM-GreenBay
40,Nice beach,"After eating in the cafe, out to the beach. Left of pier no rocks in the surf. Right of pier, the rocks come in with surf and can hit feet. But more shells to find. Good for couple hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125alexise
50,"Go for Breakfast, Stay for the Beach",I love the Paradise Cove restaurant for its excellent breakfasts (lunch and dinner just OK). Enjoying the restaurant first also gives you significant break on the parking charge.The beach is a wonderfully scenic spot and excellent for walking. I greatly enjoy taking a stroll up the beach after breakfast to explore the rock formations and tide pools and inspect the varied marine life. Always on my list for visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpb
30,Nice beach but the parking rates are outrageous,The parking here has to be some of the highest price in the world. The restaurant is ordinary but is right on the sand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
50,Rich and Famous Beach Day,"If you want to experience the rich and famous, this is the place to go, at least for the rich! Nice beach with great waves and boogie boarding. Parking is way expensive unless you validate at the beach restaurant. You can park on the street above but it's a good walk! Get there early as the place fills up.Restaurant was really good and on the beach, but be prepared to pay for the view and beach location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HammertimeCA

40,Nice secluded,"Better plan to spend the day for the price to park...everything is pricey for that matter. The beach is small and the water is calmer, but then it is in a cove. Seems less crowded but with the cost of everything it is easy to understand why.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
50,Feels like a private beach for a hotel,"It does cost $40.00 to stay all day; actually that's the parking fee. We didn't rent any chairs as we had our own. We stayed close to the restaurant. We had lunch there, but if we were just going for a day in the future, I would probably bring our own lunch as the restaurant was pricey. The beach is not real deep and parking is close which is good if you have trouble walking far or are carrying lots of stuff. We had 4 hrs for $6.00 validated parking from the restaurant, so we took advantage of the extra time. The water wasn't as rough as Zumma Beach, but that's probably due to this area being a cove. Our short time there was very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelon2468
30,Ups and Downs,"I've been going to the Paradise Cove restaurant for years. It used to be good, but eventually the food quality decide so much I decided not ever to set my foot there again. The view can only make up for so much... Well, I was convinced to try it again and found the food to be bearable. Not great but OK. And so often when restaurants compromise on quality, they are trying to make it up in volume. So the portion sizes are just insane. Having said that, there is something special of sitting with bare feet in the sand while dining!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psjofors
40,Plan to stay all day!,"Nice place to stay for the day. Enjoy the beach with good food and drinks close by. The $40 parking fee is waived if you spend that much in the restaurant - easy. My husband took his kayak and I read and enjoyed the day. Take a look at the website before you go. It's nice to rent the bed and umbrella or if you have a larger party - rent a cabana. And you can bring a cooler, etc. if you do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamReviewer123
50,"Great beach, kitsch restaurant, lovely day out","I love this place, it's not super classy but the beach itself reminds me of Cornwall (just in the US with occasional sealions and dolphins).The food couldn't be described as healthy, but it's all great fun and that beach is ideal to walk it off on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blueworld3000

40,Good food on the beach with perfect atmosphere,"I enjoy coming to Paradise Cove. This time we came with a large group to eat and watch the sunset. We made reservations to sit outdoor so we can watch the beautiful sunset. Even with a reservation, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table. But waiting there is a treat! We sat on the beach on comfortable chairs and relaxed just listening to the waves and the seagulls.Once in the restaurant, the menu has a huge selection. The waitress was very efficient and attentive. I can eat only gluten free and the waitress had the knowledge to recommend me to the right dishes. The portions are enormous! Everybody enjoyed their food. They have great desserts too, huge sizes of cakes. I just looked at it as they were not gluten free unfortunately.Great atmosphere!Don't forget to validate your parking, otherwise it will cost you a hefty $40.$6 for 4 hours with validation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eden4K
50,Father's Day Perfection,"I know we've never met, but please trust my review. We have been coming to Paradise Cove since around 2008. This was the best Father's Day I have ever had due to Paradise Cove's superior service. Made reservations for 11:30 for one of the busiest days of the year. When we arrive at 11:00, the signs said ""LOT FULL"" and I panicked. I told the attended we had an reservation and he gladly let us in. Never trust the ""LOT FULL"" sign because people are ALWAYS leaving. Simply tell the attendant you want to drive down to check it out and I guarantee you will get a spot. We checked in requesting a booth by the window and the hostess could not of been more accommodating; only a 20 minute wait which allowed my wife & I to enjoy our tropical drinks: Me a Tequila Sunrise (delish!) and my wife a Pina Colada (also delish). Our 8 year old loves this restaurant because of the fun, upbeat, vacation like energy. Started with a cup of Chowder which was a solid B+. Had the shrimp tacos, which were the most flavorful, moist shrimp I have ever had. Highly recommend them! We then enjoyed the beach for 2 hours (your given a 4 hour validation for only $6). For such a busy day, the service was PHENOMINAL. Can't recommend this EXPERIENCE enough. This is not just a restaurant, but a tropical fantasy come true. I guarantee you will be transported to a tropical hid a way the second you set foot in here. THANK YOU PARADISE COVE FOR A WONDERFUL AND SPECIAL DAY I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER! Will definitely be back. See you there...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1_Cabo_Fan

40,One of those iconic places to me...,"I am not sure that I would recommend a special trip to this restaurant if all you are looking for is food. Parking is terrible. It is located next to a trailer park that lots of movie stars like to buy and hang out in and pretend they are ""regular"" people. (Many trailers are worth more than $1 million!)But this place always brings a smile to my face. Bring lots of hungry kids/teens/20 somethings for brunch. Get the big table in the back. Order EVERYTHING on the menu. The waitresses will say THAT IS TOO MUCH FOOD! And watch while your guests devour every delicious unhealthy carb, butter and sugar soaked bite. And then run out in the ocean in between courses. Two or more hours of complete fun for me. Watching these demons empty plates full of bacon and pancakes and french toast and anything else put in front of them :)And don't get me started on the time my daughter did a back flip off the pier....And we were almost ejected...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyB4
40,EAT with your toes in the sand.,"I love this place for a few reasons and the menu is not one of them. Its a seafood place but 80% of the menu is all fried food, some of it is ok but a lot of times it will come out luke warm at best. I do love however that you can sit outside and the tables are directly in the sand. and when you are through eating you can have a cocktail on one of their beach chairs or take a stroll along the ocean to the pier. its perfect at sunset. I do recommend the salad bar which is wonderful! it has a TON of stuff on it. there is limited parking down here which can get tricky since people can park to go to the beach but you have to pay. if you eat at the restaurant you get the parking fee waived. I also very much enjoy the cocktails, you can get certain ones served in a carved out pineapple, coconut or small watermelon! fun atmosphere especially if you have friends from out of town visiting. be aware that even for all the fried food it is very pricey for food and drinks, you are paying for the ambience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27

30,Beautiful but crowded,the location and views at this private beach are amazing but the costs associated to attending a private beach go right along with it. We went in August and parking was a nightmare. The beach was packed to capacity and the only food option is a restaurant that was good but extremely over priced. I would recommend it but bring a lot of cash and pack your own food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyL373
20,"Parking is outrageous, but the location is iconic",The food is average---the setting divine. Eat at an outdoor table with your feet in the sand. Good place for brunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanoibelle
40,A great location with lots of people crammed into a restaurant.,If you are not eating at the restaurant parking is very expensive. The beach and restaurant is at capacity just about every weekend.

I have to say that my friend and I enjoyed the Paradise Diner very much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRDDXLX
10,DO NOT BOTHER,"Do not go.You will be trapped if you drive down the road and they will charge you 40 dollars to get your car out. The cafe sells the worst American food I saw on our whole trip, nothing healthy at all. The beach is OK, but the pier is a truncated joke. The only reason we drove down there and got caught was because the corner of the car park is where Jim Rockford of the Rockford Files had his trailer! The awful cafe has loads of old pics of the cove but nowhere is there any acknowledgement of this fact! Just down the coast are free beaches with much better restaurants I say again. Do not go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609ianl
50,Best Stop in Malibu,"I like to take visitors to the best of the best. That's why I choose Paradise Cove. It has an amazing rate for validated parking (between $6 and $8 I believe, depending on the season/day) and has superb food and beach access. Choose fish tacos and then go out on the beach and private pier after your scrumptious meal. Parking is great on weekdays and/or early weekends. The views of Point Dume are matchless. It's simply amazing that anyone can access this private beach at such a low cost. I'm always up for an afternoon at Paradise Cove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399jeremyg
40,Eat outside with your toes in the sand!,Beautiful 'cozy feeling' type beach with seagulls and an historic- type restaurant with old fishing photos adorning the walls. The food and drinks are mediocre and not cheap but the setting is a lot of fun. You can eat outside right near the beach with your toes in the sand as you sip your cocktail and enjoy the sunshine. It's crowded and the parking is only worth it if you eat there and get the discount. We called ahead for reservations and didn't have to wait to get a table outside. The inside bar looked busy and crowded with guests in bathing suits.They charge $25.00 to use the chaise lounge chairs on the beach but the wooden Adirondack chairs near the bar have a view of the ocean and don't have a charge. Overall it's a fun place especially if you come from an area where beaches like Malibu are a rarity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mctraveler_11
40,For us still the epitome of “Going to the Beach”,"Seen from PCH, Malibu beaches and the rows of beach houses with their 3rd world electric wiring may by disappointing for some. If you don’t get invited to one of the estates and still want to feel Malibu - come to Paradise Cove.It’s a restaurant, it’s fun in the sand - and taking a walk on the beach you get a look at some impressive waterfront high up on the cliffs.Don’t get turned off by the parking fee – they validate!Take a walk on the north beach and look for some wildlife in the tide pools or on the cliffs. Then enjoy your meal and some beach drinks.At our recent visit we were somehow disappointed about service and quality – but it could well be that they just had a bad day.One of Malibu’s best – BUT – don’t try it on a weekend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9127CQwalters

30,Good for experience but nothing to go back over and over again,"Great setting, right on the beach. But food is just average, a little touristic to me. We went for a night and they had all you can eat oysters. In fact the server said they are out of fresh oysters and don't serve any steamed. But they have fried. We ordered fried oysters, but taste just average. Side dishes were delicious, we tried one of the big potato and the creamy spinach.Dining on the sand is nothing but plastic tables and chairs placed right on sand. Doesn't feel like you are eating on the sand, just than sand is under your feet (rather than wood or stone tiles on a regular patio). I would do something more original to make the experience feel like you are really on the beach, not just sand between your chairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508andyd
40,"Excellent on beach location, good food","On a drive through Malibu and heard of this place so we had to stop. Outside seating is covered so the sun is not too intense. Beautiful views of the beach, your feet are actually in the sand as you eat. Our server was Ashley and she was great. She suggested a few items and we had the 3 taco plate and the soup in sandwich (yes in not and). Soup was a great clam chowder and sandwich was a grilled cheese with crab and shrimp inside. You can dunk this into the soup, it was really good. For us this place was a great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlagunabeach
30,"Overated, but great location","Loved the location of this large touristy restaurant and probably best for a quick drink and a plate to share.However, had dinner here and, although the meals are huge, we weren't loving the taste. We ordered the calamari - sorry to say it didn't seem very fresh as it was very chewy. The fries that came with them were some of the best I ever had.Tacos were ordered by my guests - various flavors - and unfortunately - no one was gushing over the taste.Very casual, very touristy, but fun to take a drink and go sit out by the beach (only wine or beer though, and mixed drinks were not allowed out of the restaurant).Go for the view and a drink!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docjennings

10,A Trap for the Unsuspecting - Beware!!!,"We were driving down alone coastal highway from Santa Babara to Long Beach via Malibu. Since our goal was to enjoy as much of the scenic route we stopped anywhere we could get a different glimpse of the ocean on right hand side and the mountains on the other side. Also the malibu beach and the luxury homes were subjects of my camera.At some point the road strayed away from the beach and I started looking for a road leading to the beach. A billboard saying 'Paradice Cove' appeared at a road leading to the direction of the beach and I followed. There were two types of signs, one saying '$40 beach parking' and the other saying '$3 for restaurant parking'. Since I was not sure where the restaurant was I first made a U-turn but then a person outside pointed towards the beach and mentioned both beach and restaurant parking is through the same gate. Since the restaurant parking is only $3, I thought we can spend 5 mins taking some photos of the beach and spend $10 on a drink and snack from the restaurant and leave within 15 minutes.It turned out I had taken their bait. Inside the restaurant it turned out to qualify for $3 parking you have to spend at least $30. We decided to have lunch there. The beach restaurant was over-crowded. The cheapest lunch you can get is $20 and for us two we spent $40 buying lunch. But that was not the end of the story, if to be seated we were asked to wait 45 minutes. I said we will take food to go and got to order food at the bar. I was told it will take 15 minutes and take a walk and come back for it. Since we were more eager to get out we hung around. It was not until another 1 hour wait the food was ready!!!The food was not worth the money. It was pure waste of time and money. The beach was too crowded and you can access beaches down the road for $5 parking. Probably, if you are spending the entire day there with a group of people, it is worth and might even be enjoyable. But my displeasure is their bait. They should have included at least in fine print that the $3 parking for the restaurant is for minimum expenditure of $30. Also, their place is over-crowded and the service was below par.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RanilB5

50,"Paradise Cove, a longtime favorite in Malibu","This is a great way to spend half a day at the well-known, popular Paradise Cove. While at first I was shocked at the $40 to park sign, I quickly learned that by eating at the fabulous restaurant, it would only be $6 to park for up to four hours. Turns out this is not only a restaurant, but an 'attraction' in the area because of the good beachfront, beachfront location of the restaurant and other facilities. Watch out though as this entire area can be the victim of major and dangerous riptides if you are the type to actually go into the cool waters of the Pacific. You can see Pt. Dune from here where I hear the whales pause on their travels up and down the coast seasonally. The inside of the restaurant is a local history museum -yes, truly - with black and white photos of its construction, its celebrity visitors, and other bbq and California relics and memorabilia. We could've spent much more time there and the food was outstanding from the sourdough to the ahi tuna and buffet salad bar. This is a must do even though a bit out of the way north of Los Angeles. The site is a piece of 'paradise' for sure. It's all here. I see why they can charge $40.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsihrofhhisc
50,Restaurant /Beach experience,"The $6 carpark was full so they opened up valet parking for the same price, a good move !!!!The restaurant was full and we were told a 40 min wait time was on the cards.There was a barrel of free peanuts (which you needed to shell), this helped pass the time.After 18 mins we were seated and ready to eat.I chose the salad plate (many returns) and some hot fries.($29 without tip)My brother chose the burger option and famous clam chowder.Great atmosphere., happy staff...good tasting food....The food price is up there ,however i suppose you are paying for the location / exclusivity.Afterwards a great walk on the beach.Would definitely visit again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincent414
50,Fun,"Private beach, nice restaurant, beautiful, clean beach. Bring $40 and a good book. Surf gear or just go swimming in the cold Pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/798ralucac
40,Vibrant and fun,Food was great and a lot of it. It can be a little pricey but they fill you up so come hungry or share something. Parking can be a bit of a pain and it is $6 so be prepared for that. Great atmosphere and view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CA858
10,"Total rip off, don't go there!","If you are looking for a relaxing beach and to have something to eat, go elsewhere!The parking lot was full, so we had to park along the freeway, which is really dangerous. After that it's a 10 min walk to the beach and restaurant, but you have to pay a 20 USD walk in fee per person. The hostess told us that if you spend 30 USD pp within 4 hours you would get a 17 USD refund.It was easy to spend the $30 per person, since a simple sandwich with average taste is approximately $20.But when we left the hostess told us that we spend more than 4 hours at the beach (with 10 minutes in fact), so we didn't get the refund and ended up with spending $100 for 2 meals of taco's and some non alcoholic drinks! What a rip off.... She mention that the rules were clearly indicated on the back of ticket, even though she explained it in a different way. But it was her word against ours.So the place is nice for locals who want to get a meal, but this isn't a good place to hang out as tourists, be aware!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skloots
40,Watch out for pricey parking!,First things first. Parking is pricey. $20 whoa! So if you don't mind a walk you can park on the main road and walk into the restaurant. The restaurant itself is very casual but very nice. I saw several people walk in from the beach in their swim suites to the bar for a drink. And that's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I personally don't like sandy people walking from one end of the establishment to the other for a drink. If they had a bar closer to the beach away from the main dining room it would be no problem. The portions are big! You could easily get 1 appetizer and 1 main meal with two drinks and you'll be stuffed! The beach is lovely! Very soft sand and very family friendly. there are showers located next to the restaurant and trash cans are readily available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carnationnation
40,you really know that you are in California...,"This was our first stop after landing in LA. It really was a great beginning to our vacation. I highly recommend sitting outside. The food (we shared the Paella) was excellent. The drinks were pricy but fun. All in all, we really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IleneS540
10,Don't go on a weekend!,"Maybe it was brilliant down on the beach - I'll never know. The road down was closed with people saying it was all full, so you had to park on the freeway (dangerous!) and then walk in. We then discovered that there was a $20 per person walk in fee (outrageous!) which you only got refunded if you paid $60 for a meal in the cafe! the whole place was a frenzied madhouse and well worth avoiding, in the summer at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JinnyJones1982232a
40,Nice place for a day on the beach beware car park charge!,"Great beach and a very nice restaurant with great staff.

Better off looking in here when driving north from L A to San Francisco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22tangotwo
30,Way overrated,"Went with a group of 5 for a late lunch around 4:30. Sat outside and had between the 5 of us had 3 beers 1 tropical drink and an Arnold Palmer. We then ordered our food, 2 Tuna sandwiches (very disappointing),Sea food tower ( really immense portion of assorted shell fish), and a children's chicken finger. The total plus tip. $240.00.. If you feel that this is reasonable by all means check it out. If not you have been warned!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wealan
40,Know Before You Go,"Thanks to the Tripadvisor reviews, I knew what to expect--a pricey restaurant in a beautiful area. If I had not read the reviews, I would have been really turned off by the parking fees and the food costs. Since I knew in advance what to expect, I was able to enjoy the experience. Yes, $20 for a Caesar salad is ridiculous, but the cove was as charming as advertised. Our waiter must have been angling for a life in films (personable, and, according to my wife, drop dead handsome) and the service was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClarkH226
20,Not Worth the Rip-Off,"It baffles me that anyone would give this place a five-star review. This is the biggest rip-off in town.I give it two stars instead of one, which is what I would have given the last time I was here. The actual restaurant service was slightly better than last time, and we had a nice table and were with good friends. Other than that -- thievery.First of all, have a reservation? They don't care ... there's no parking for you. You have to park half a mile down PCH and hoof it in, where you get the pleasure of paying $20 per person just to enter. If you eat there and meet the following requirements 1) minimum $30 per person tab and 2) less than four hour restaurant/beach visit, they will refund $14 of that. But don't think they make it easy for you. We were given such a runaround .... first we were told the restaurant would credit us, then we were told to go to the top where the street is, then down to an Airstream trailer, then back up to the street. It was obvious they want you to be frustrated and give up at the end of a beach day.Then -- the cost, for what you get! One tuna sandwich, one shrimp plate, two drinks (alcoholic) and the walk-in fee (after the refund) totaled $112. We ate again as soon as we got home.Every time someone wants to meet me here, I dread it. Next time I'm saying no ... I'd rather go to Malibu Seafood down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86DeborahL
50,Sumptuous and best!,"Had heard about this place, and it lived up to its name! Had a most sumptuous meal at the beach... really loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlokS_12
50,Beach eats and view,Fun restaurant with great food and service and there is also a beautiful beach! The catch is that if you eat at the restaurant And validate the parking is 6 dollars if you just want to go to this beach for the day parking is $40 dollars. Our group had a great breakfast and the food and service was top notch the parking fee would mean less crowds on the beach and would probably be worth it to spend all day on this clean beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lasvegas_NVDoglover

40,"""Good hangout""","We visited with the kids and another family. There are beds and umbrellas you can rent. Cute. There is a small restaurant that serves drinks, snacks and fish and fries, overpriced, ok taste. The beach is right in front. You can walk down the beach, nice views. We probably will not go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yeddie_go
40,OK Visit,"Stopped here for an early dinner on a recent weeknight. $6 to park for dinner with validation. Chose it as it reminded us of dining on the beach in southern France. It was a bit touristy, but we were able to sit outside without a wait. We noticed on arrival that there were a couple guys who looked like bouncers working the restaurant, which made me feel a bit weird as it was only about 5:30 p.m and supposed to be a family-friendly place. Then, as we were looking at our menus, one of them approached occupants of a nearby table with a second warning against smoking a certain substance. Shortly thereafter, a guy from that table tried to jump one of the security guards and after a few seconds was restrained and quickly escorted out, along with the rest of his party. Yikes. Staff thereafter visited all the tables and apologized for the incident. Food was served promptly and was OK, a bit overpriced for the quality, but you are paying for the beachfont location. Beach looked nice, very clean, and they had loungers and chairs for relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooKat
40,Good food and great location!,"My daughter and I ate here and then relaxed on the beach in one of their chairs under an umbrella. The cove with its cliffs and gentle waves is so pretty.I love this place!Oh, yeah, the food was really good too. There is something for whatever you're in the mood for.We will definitely go back when we're in the Malibu area next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyHd
50,Best Beach in Malibu-Paradise Cove!,"My family began visiting Paradise Cove over 20 years ago, if you want a perfect day at the beach in Malibu-this is it! Paradise Cove is a gorgeous beach and an added bonus-there is a fabulous restaurant on site- the perfect combination for a relaxing day. The cafe offers a delicious menu and you can eat indoors or outside, either way you get a view of the water.Parking is $40 per day, if you spend $25 at the cafe the parking fee reduces to $6. Win, win!If you want to experience a beautiful walk along a clean beach, no overcrowding, and with a variety of amenities- look no further. You can even rent a cabana that holds up to 30 people. Chairs, cabanas, and lounge chairs are on a first come first serve basis, get there early!Another plus-The bathrooms are clean and there are rinsing stations available outside of the bathrooms.You won't be disappointed visiting this family owned beach!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonVoyageFriend
10,Pay 20$ for what?,$20 walk in entry. That should be illegal! Its just a plain old boring beach. Definitely a tourist trap. Why not at least lower the price? The water is too cold to swim and the cafe is nothing special. Go further down the road to the public beach you will be more satisfied.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivana-banana
50,It's amazing,Great waves and a great surf and wave I recommend this it even has good food it's a beach place there is great survive and a good looking restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/154alenaa
40,Come Early! Very little parking...,"If you are ok with paying $40 to park or $20 per person to walk in (Not a short walk…) get there early. The parking lot fills up on summer days and even worse on the weekends. A great place (once you're in) to make memories with the kids. One of the few places in So Cal where you can have a drink with your feet in the sand. Surrounded by beautiful cliffs and a pretty calm bay, it is the perfect place to play in the water. Zuma Beach can get pretty rough while this area is a bit more protected. Walk down the beach towards Pt. Dume and be rewarded with beautiful views. Typical bar food- good burgers. A bit pricey but, location, location, location...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianettewells
30,"Cool Setting, not so great food.","This place rocks because it is right on the beach, you are literally toes in the sand! Adirondack chairs are available but you can only bring beer or wine outside to use them which we noticed caused a bit of confusion for patrons and kept the beach monitors very busy. None the less loved it! The restaurant and outside patio, again toes in the sand, are very fun! The food was great for my seafood lovers but not so much for myself. I had the bar b que tacos, bar b que and tacos do not go together IMO,and it was very pricey $20 for tacos. The guacomole was really good though! Overall great setting! I loved it for drinks and will go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sake2015
40,Great Beach view restuarant; not really a locals spot,"Paradise Cove is a great spot to bring your out-of-town Guests for breakfast, lunch or dinner at the beach with terrific views of Paradise Cove and Point Dume. As one would expect, prices are a bit higher than some other spots and you have to pay for parking. Also, you are not allowed to bring your surf boards into Paradise Cove to surf, which is a bit odd but it's to keep folks from just filling up the parking lot to go surfing. Give yourself some extra time so you can take a walk along the Point Dume coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,"Great dining, but paid parking??","We had a wonderful late evening meal at Paradise Cove. While the food was great (don't miss the clam chowder), it seemed a little high priced . . . and then to charge for parking?? Not sure if I would return for that reason. There are many great spots in Malibu for food and drinks that DON'T charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrys881
50,Do Not Miss Out on Paradise Cove!,"When we visited Malibu for the first time we found Sunset Bar & Grill. It was okay but we were really looking for something on the beach. (or more of a beach bar). The bartender gave us a tip to check out Paradise Cove and it was EXACTLY what we were looking for.It's kind of hidden away but the food is excellent. Huge portions for both appetizers and entrees. In addition, it's less than 250ft from the ocean. The outdoor seating is actually in the sand so you can kick off your shoes and enjoy some sand on your feet while you eat.They also can sell you sealed drinks and you can then carry them to the beach in front of the restaurant. Then you can sit in their comfortable beach chairs and crack open your drinks to enjoy. This allows you to chill on the beach and have a few drinks. (think Corona commercials). Perfect setting and a memorable experience for me and my buddy. We will return someday when we're back in the area. Can't recommend this spot enough!Be sure to spend more than $30 so that your parking gets validated. It only costs $6 for parking if you spend more than $30 and park for less than 4 hours. Otherwise, you have to pay like $40 in parking. If 2 people get food and drinks it's simple to spend past the limit. :)Do not miss out on Paradise Cove!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGameCrafter

50,California Vacation 2012,"Paradise Cove is a wonderful place for a family outing. Both adults and children loved the place. We rented a cabana on the beach, and had plenty of room for our party of 15. Everyone had a great time. THE CALAMARI WAS EXCELLENT. Service was good, and everyone was friendly without too many roudy people around our children. We will defnitey return next year on our annual retreat to Southern California from Indiana.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/867darylh
40,Location always wins...and this place has it!,"It's hard to mess up a great location, and the folks at Paradise Cove have continually improved and polished what they have, which simply put is THE best beach location on the sand in Southern California.Yes, the parking is expensive if you don't spend a certain amount in the restaurant, but when you own the best spot in town, you can get away with that.The best part of Paradise Cove isn't the restaurant, which is serviceable but not spectacular. It is the walk along the beach headed north towards Pt. Dume. Check when the tide is low and you can walk for several miles on unspoiled and mainly empty beach. The tide pools are accessable and shell finding is a fun distraction.Once you have had your fill of the ocean views and beach, the restaurant has solid food in big portions. It's not cheap, but the location merits it. If the weather is good, sit outside. The inside has great old pictures of Malibu but the design of the building doesn't take advantage of the view of the ocean unless you are at a table along the windows.If you want a relaxing afternoon on the sand with a sandwich or fish and chips, oysters, etc. washed down with a bloody mary or longboard lager, this is a great place to stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Socalicouple

50,Food with a view,"Found this place by accident and so glad we did. The menu is extensive and the portions Huge! The chef was able to help with my gluten free requirements, no trouble at all. The location is great but if you want a table outside be prepared to wait. Get your parking ticket validated before leaving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drennan2
30,Rip off,"To avoid the $40 parking fee, you can eat at restaurant to validate parking. Avoid French fries with any meals at all costs. Dripping with oil....yuck! Way overpriced.Nice beach. A lot of drinking since you can BYOB. A lot of obnoxious birds on beach and all over water during bait fish season. I just don't feel it's right to charge so much to visit Mother Nature. Always thought public access was the law, but they will charge you just to walk in. Just not right! Otherwise, one of the best swimming beaches I have been to. Went as a kid before it became so commercialized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubadiva2125

This is a beautiful place, I was really iffy of going because of what the reviews here say bit these $30 were worth it. We where here for 5 hours, we brought our own beer and just drank the day way. My son and I got in the smeared, beautiful! NO rocks! And no crazy waves, they were smooth. We even took pictures under the pier and walked along the coastline and it was beautiful! They even have beds for you to tan on. Wow! The most you will spend here if you bring your own food and drinks is the parking ticket.

30,How a beautiful place became a tourist trap.,"My husband and I visited Paradise Cove as one of the places we went to in a trip down Memory Lane, as he grew up in L.A. and that's a beach where he often went as a child/teenage. What a letdown. A beautiful place that has been transformed into a tourist trap: a restaurant/cafe built right on the beach, chairs, umbrellas, $40 to park ($20 for walk-ins), $20 for two beers. How to spoil beautiful memories...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelseeds
30,Has changed...not for the better.,"Went twice this summer, once for lunch and once for breakfast. Parking rates and restaurant prices have increased. Pier is closed. Menu has gotten simpler and boring. For breakfast I had the eggs benedict which I've had before so I trusted the source. This time I had the p**ps for three days. Not fun! The carrot cake waffle was excellent but if you have to be worried about getting sick it takes the fun out of dining out. PC was a gem before but now is an overpriced beach joint with boring and spotty food. Will probably not go back unless they go back to their former ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikerBiker2
40,"Hey, it's a tourist trap. Go with it and have fun.","Valet parking was free with a minimum restaurant purchase (I believe $30). I loved seeing where some of my favorite old shows were filmed (Rockford Files, Gidget). The food was mediocre and overpriced, but a small price to pay for access to the beach. We happened to nab chairs in the shade, which greatly enhanced our experience. It was fun watching the dive-bomber pelicans, although I wouldn't want to share the water with them. I was expecting a movie set-type beach experience and this place met my expectations. Got great pictures with the family, the kids enjoyed the beach, and the people watching alone warrants charging admission. We all had fun. Can't ask for more than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickytraveler56_25
10,What's to like?,"I hate this place. I don't know why I've come back a couple of times as each time I'm disappointed and out of cash since its so expensive.Parking and entry fee is an absolute farce. They charge $20 per person to enter their beach which is full of seaweed, hundreds, literally hundreds of pelicans and seagulls all diving about the water.So you park on PCH because the parking lot is full and then you have to pay $20 per person. If you eat at the restaurant and spend $30 per person they'll give you $14 back. Wow - what a deal!! Or you can pay $40 to park your car if you're lucky enough to get a space.The beach is crowded at weekends, the water is dirty and frigid. My kids won't even go in anymore. And with the kind of money they must be raking in they could at least clean up the seaweed.You can purchase alcohol to take on the beach. Bring a lot of money because at $37 for 2 beers and a red wine you're going to need it. And the wine came in a small bottle - no glass! You can't take cocktails on the beach so if you don't drink beer or wine I guess that's just tough.Someone said something about paying for the ambience. What ambience? You're sitting on plastic chairs, crammed into your table, in the middle of sand and the only shade is a little umbrella. It's just unpleasant.The food is ok. Large portions and large prices. I did finally get a cocktail with dinner. Usually i like my mojitos with alcohol. This one seemed to missing that essential ingredient.Id rather not line the greedy owners pockets with my cash and can safely say I won't be back to this pretensious place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917sharonr
30,A complete tourist trap,It costs $40.00 to park or $20.00 to walk in!! We saw a woman walking down the road from PCH wearing 6 inch heals. Had to laugh.

It was pretty private with not many people there but it was so close to the homes that well maybe it wasn't so private. I tend to like my space from homes so didn't really think too much of the beach. Plus I paid $25 to park for 4 hours when I could have parked for free at zuma beach. But again, this was a friend's idea so we ate at the restaurant which was crowded and noisy. The food was good but I don't think I'll go out of my way to return.

30,WARNING: Do not pay $30 for PARKING!,"This is a financial warning to other out-of-towners who come for a visit to the Malibu area. If you wish to visit the recommended Paradise Cove, I HIGHLY recommend tha you go hungry, thirsty, ready to chill with a beverage because we made the mistake of not reading the signs closely.What do I mean?I am embarassed to report that our parking for 22 minutes was $30.$30 will allow one to park for UP TO 4 HOURS access a cute(read: small) a beach area for a few hours of hanging out.A visit to the cozy beach restaurant/bar will asuage the minimum cost for Paradise Cove. Spend $25 in the restaurant (which smelled pretty good) or, (I assume) bar and parking magically reduced to $3.There's no getting around overpaying for a peek; walking in is $10 pp.They justify their pricing as: ""... because we are privately owned.""THIS IS INSULTING (READ: WE WANTED A KISS AND RECEIVED AN UNWANTED REAMING WITHOUT LUBRICATION) TO WE TOURISTS!We hope this will educate other tourists who come after us.The beach is pretty... but it is like many California beaches.I suggest checking out the Mugu Point State Beach/Park... You can even bring your puppies for 1/3 the price!I don't like to post any negative/harsh reviews, but these folks are rediculous in both pricing and justification.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrownIdCat
40,A classic beach front resturant,"The food was terrific, the prices reasonable, the ocean views to die for! Plus, just getting here, it's at the end of a narrow road servicing a manufactured home community, is an adventure. A must stop for lunch or dinner if you are touring the Malibu area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davecm329
50,A lucky find,"Came across this place by accident as I was looking for lunch whilst I was travelling up highway 1 for a glimpse of the views.This is the most idyllic of places. Calm, quiet and peaceful. To top it off the food in the restaurant is amazing.Car parking is pricey unless you eat in the restaurant and can park for free (sorry I can't remember how long the maximum stay is for free)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adenash
40,Excellent!!,"I really appreciated this place. Secluded, not crowded and you can bring your own beer on the beach. After paying the 4 hour parking you can choose to eat at their restaurant or enjoy the beach with cooler in hand. Just no hard alcohol.We ate lunch then wife and I walked the beach by the cliffs. Awesome.Lunch was good but not excellent. Their mixed drinks were fun (many served in coconut or mini watermelons).The drive from Santa Monica to Malibu was fantastic. Worth the visit def would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meh2424
50,Wonderful Gem! Shhh...,"After a day at the Santa Monica Pier CIRCUS, this was a WELCOME piece of quiet PARADISE! Nestled in a hidden little nook of beach in Malibu, this beach and restaurant is not to be missed! The seafood is amazing, the beach is pristine and the views are spectacular. There is not a better place to relax and unwind after a day of...whatever! Parking was not a problem for us (we were there on a Thursday) and if you are there less than 4 hours (perfect amount of time at the end of the day) it is really inexpensive to park, eat and explore the beach a bit. The cliffs are lovely and the beach are spectacular. Don't miss this place.... But shhhhhhh.......don't share it either!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loves2ski
40,loved the place....,"Went there on Sunday afternoon, as expected the parking was full so parked the car in another place as directed by the staff there, which was little far. After waling for around a mile, we reached at the beach.I found the beach better than Santa Monica as it was less crowded and you can sit, relax and enjoy your beer. The cafe at the beach serves some great food.The beach is very beautiful and if you go further in you could find some trails up the hill..Overall, It was a good, relaxing experience :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anirudh83
40,Ocean front property,"The sense of being on water's edge is real at this property. You can walk outside after having a nice, relaxing lunch and meander up the beach! The ambiance is fun; the food is good; and, the service was great! Very attentive wait staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfitzgibbons
30,What is the big attraction?,With all of the free beaches along PCH why pay $30.00 to park and enjoy a so-so beach? Even if you are forced to purchase a meal at the restaurant it feels like a shake down. Very limited parking and a closed pier. Having said that I did take some nice pictures but stayed only long enough to see that it was not worth the value and headed for Muro. They give you a free 10 minutes to look around and decide. Can't figure how they expect repeat customers...bit it is Malibu and tourists flock here. My advice keep going unless you want a meal at Paradise Cove.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
50,Pristine beach,"We found Paradise Cove by accident, but loved its pristine sand, relaxed ambience and lovely view of the Malibu coast. get there before noon on sunny days or the parking bays fill up.The snacks available are great but not too cheap.

10,Terrible service....food not up to par.....,"Tonight was my 47th birthday. Party of 7. The restaurant could not fit us unless we sat by a table which was near an open door to the outside and the draft was horrendous for my 80 year old father. They would not close the door. So our party had no other option but to sit at 2 separate tables at another end of the restaurant.I ordered the lobster...supposedly a 3 lb lobster...and if you believe that, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you..@$&?! I ordered a shrimp cocktail before the main course and was a little scared because the lobsters at this restaurant are usually so big that I can't finish the lobster...so I wasn't sure if ordering an appetizer was a good idea. Well thank God I did because I would have starved had I not. I ate this lobster in 5 bites and was so hungry that I ordered another lobster! And I'm a FEMALE! My dad called a manager to complain and the manager said ""sorry but we stand by our 3 lb lobsters"" but I'll comp you dessert if that will make you happy! My response was that I came to this restaurant for dinner and not dessert and that if they weren't going to take ownership of this, I was going to have to order another lobster. They said fine and came back to my table 10 minutes later and told me that it would be a 30 minute wait for this lobster! I told them to forget it....just send me the bill...Well they felt bad and instead sent me a 5 story chocolate cake....but I don't make meals out of chocolate cake....This was probably one of the WORST experiences I have ever had...and I can't believe it was at Paridise Cove! Not a great place to celebrate my 47th. Wish I had gone somewhere else...will think twice next time...So sad.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lap465
40,Paradise cove...a hidden gem..,"We were driving through Malibu,looking for a beach to pass an hour or 2,when we came across a sign for Paradise Cove...We didn't know to expect and at first the $30 parking fee was like...""whoa..turn round""...but we parked up and walked down to the beach and the ""whoa"" became a ""Wow""...very nice beach against a cliff backdrop ..had a lovely walk while the kids explored the rock pools, much prettier than some of the boring surfer beaches and that $30 fee reduces down to $3 when you spend $25 in beach cafe and that was easy with 4 of us.So go down ..kick off your shoes..then grab a bite to eat and it's a great way to spend an afternoon/evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaz21uk
40,Fun place to go for cocktails,"My husband and I enjoyed going to Paradise Cove. We ordered a dinner which was okay, but while there we noticed must people ordered appetizers and drinks. We will do the same next time. Extraordinary looking appetizers. Calamari comes in a gigantic martini glass filled with fries and topped with tons of fried calamari. Yummy!Just wished they didn't have to charge for parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222KatherineS
50,Best of both worlds!,"Very busy, happening place to eat and for relaxing and playing on beach!

50,Fun for everyone!,I was a little skeptical of this place after reading the reviews of the beach and the restaurant. The breakfast here was great! The service was good and more than what I expected. I love having breakfast on the beach. The beach was nice and big. I cannot wait until I go back.Breakfast was very good and everyone's food looked good too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832SarahN

40,"Paradise California Style,","A stop along the way with a big family group, that started off with Bloody Mary's! Some of us ordered from the breakfast menu and some from the lunch, but we were all very satisfied. Check the website for the parking fees, it could get confusing, but should not deter you from enjoying this little piece of California coast. Our visit was in winter, and the place was nice and cozy. A Cabana rental would be a great way to entertain, for those of us who don't own beach front property! The staff was friendly, so be sure to ask them about the arrangments for outdoor dining and drinking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peetsheets
50,Shades of Beach Blanket Bingo,"Setting is beach used in surfer movies of years ago-- situated on beach with indoor and outdoor seating, their menu will leave you wondering which delicious item to choose. Service, food, ambience amazing, also kid friendly. If you have opportunity, take Pacific Coast Hwy short distance out of Malibu and enjoy the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mimiclaire
40,Great Brunch,"Loved the traditional food, the portions were generous and the service friendly. Once you are done eating the restaurant sits on a spectacular beach and a long walk after all those calories is in order. One of the most beautiful beach walks I had in the area and I had many.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielg416
10,Ruined my New Years!,"Ok, the website of this place is amazing.. And it draws you in.. The ocean and the cliffs are cool, but do NOT get sucked into the restaurant! My partner was disgusted by the tacos.. and the service was slow. Even though I enjoyed my steak sandwich, I think it poisoned me.. Threw up and could NOT enjoy the NYE party!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATL_guy_7
40,Food with a view,"The place is ideally located. Went there for a nice lunch after a hike. Parking can be dicey but overall good. They told us the wait was 30 minutes but sat us in 10. NOT a place for nut allergy sufferers. They offer free peanuts and people discard the shells freely on the floor. Service was friendly. Unlike other reviews, their clam chowder was really poor, too creamy and flavorless. Their filet mignon sandwich was very tasty and the burgers are decent-sized. If you are seated outside, watch out for the seagulls. They can actually dive in for a taste of your calamari. Deserts are humongous ($12 for one desert that can probably feed 4-6 - if you still have room for it at the end). Good variety of drinks. But the best part is the view - absolutely astounding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetravel1996
40,Must dine here!,"We do not come to Southern California without driving to Malibu and having brunch here! My 12 year old loves it! Our family favorite is the Rosarito Burrito. Seafood omelet is also a favorite. We have never ordered the waffles, but they look and smell amazing. One has macadamia nuts! The breakfast cocktails are all very good. The location and service are great! Take a walk on the beach!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/las803
50,Yum food - awesome location!,Theres something to be said about having a beautiful breakfast with your feet in the sand watching the surf roll in and feeling the Californian sun on your skin! The location of this place is second to none and the food and location are just awesome! Its great to enjoy a yum breakfast - a cheeky award winning bloody mary then a nice stroll along the beach with the water washing through your legs! Love it and will be back next time we are in the States! There is a charge to park here but parking is validated so all good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharneC
40,Wonderful Wedding Breakfast,"Accomidating and delicious!We were a part of 10-people for breakfast. Their salad bar doesn't start until 11 am (bummer), but everything was great! Some fav's: coconut pancakes! Salmon Benedict! Kobe Benedict.Validation allows you to park for 4-hours at the rate of $3.(i thought it was four hours free--not the case).Wonderful location. Always enjoy a stroll on the beach after a meal here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ej805
50,We never miss an opportunity to visit,"Ever since discovering this place by accident we never pass up an opportunity to stop here for lunch on our trips between our son’s home in southern California and ours in the Bay Area. On this particular day, a sunny and atypically-warm day in early November, we knew it would be jammed but went anyway. We lounged on their beach chairs while waiting for our outside table. As always, the service was friendly and helpful and food both plentiful and delicious. There are few settings comparable to this and it is worth every penny to us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterBuster
40,What you need to know...,"I looked over the other reviews, and I can identify with the best to the worst. This is a case of ""Buyer Beware"". If you understand the parking, drinking and sunning issues, you can enjoy a wonderful day at the beach, with many benefits. This is a great spot to introduce people, from out of the area, to a clean beach with food, drink and beach chairs available. We took our 6 year old grandson to his first beach experience, after we picked him up from the airport. Fantastic - the weather was perfect and we ate outside with our chairs (and toes) in the sand. The parking is an issue and you need to pay close attention to the rules - the $3 price is only if you are validated for $25 or more in the restaurant, and only for 4 hours - they mean it - not one minute more. So, if you are close to your time, and there is a line up getting out (and there often is) they charge the full price of $30. Forewarned is forearmed. The beach chairs and cabanas are for rent - they are really nice, but you should know going in that they aren't free. (see their website for fees, before you go). AND, no dogs, or drinking or BBQ's on the beach. So, after saying all that, what's left? We really enjoyed the food, and we were aware of the negatives, so we went with the right attitude. They do take reservations, so you can make arrangements to hit it at sunset and the walk along the beach is beathtaking. If you have dogs, and want a great beach restaurant where they are welcome on the beach, try the Boathouse Restaurant in Santa Barbara.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afser66
20,too expensive,"Don't waste your money and time here. Place is too pricey, $10/person entry or pay for entry for you vehicle. They allow you in for 10 minutes free, so I just went in to take a few pictures since I'm a Rockford files fan. But mostly it doesn't look much like it did on the show. The pier is almost destroyed and the restaurant is covered over with vines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DieselSyndrome

40,Fun spot for a meal,we greatly enjoyed our dinner on the beach. We were there after dark and know we missed the sun and fun that must go on during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendis
10,Rip-off merchants should be jailed,We drove into this god awful place just to take a few photos and stretch the legs after a long drive south. We noticed a sign at the barrier which said up to four hours parking would be $3. Like lambs to the slaughter in we went. 30 minutes later drove up to the exit and handed over our $3. $30 says the Neanderthal at the gate. WHAT!!! Seems you have to spend $25 in the cafe to qualify for the $3 rate. We saw no signs to this effect on the way down the driveway which is probably these crooks' intention. Mugged on our first visit to L.A!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dddave186518
40,"This was actully paradise, atleast for me.","I regret that we didn't find this place until the last day of our vacation.Really nice beach with sunbeds, good food at the nearby restaurant, free WiFi.If you come here : Try the breakfast (Before 11AM), it's awesome. Eating breakfast on the beach while dolphins are swimming in the ocean right of the beach, seeing pelicans catching fish just 20meters out in the water was just epic.However you should be aware that the parking is quite expensive ($30). Your parking ticket can be validated if you make a purchase of more than $25 in the restaurant, but that is only for 4 hours, if you happen to stay past just 5minutes over your validated 4hours you get slapped with $30 for the parking... (Would have given the place a 5star review if it wasn't for the parking issue)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiklasP_11
30,Great Lunch Experience Augmented by the View and Atmosphere,"My 25 year old daughter and I visited Paradise Cove in early June this year for lunch, drinks, and to chillax on the beach - we got to enjoy all three! What really worked out well for us was timing. We went in late afternoon, so the June gloom had a chance to burn off before we arrived. We opted for basic lunch - burgers and beachy appetizers - with a couple fancy tropical drinks. The food and the drinks were a little pricey for the fare; however, we would definitely come back for both, as it was all pretty tasty. That said, the food was only part of Paradise Cove's appeal. The nicest part of our visit was after lunch. Because we arrived in late afternoon, the ""beach beds"" outside the restaurant had emptied, but they were not yet out of service. We were able to lounge around after our meal, enjoying the pretty day and fantastic ocean view while reclining on the beds - what a nice way to chill out. This was my daughter's first visit to California, and I was so grateful to be able to spend a few hours at Paradise Cove with her. Even the extra fee to visit Paradise Cove was worth a lovely California coast memory! Food quality and value: 3 stars. Beautiful views and Pacific Coast atomostphere: priceless!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJ470
50,Lovely restaurant on the beach!,"We enjoyed our evening meal here in the outside eating area, excellent food and seafood range, large portions. Nice cocktails. 3 bucks to park car. Defiantly worth a visit. Popular with locals and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LewisP155

20,Disappointed,"Having lived in LA for over 10 years, we had been to Paradise Cove for special occasions or just to sit out by the beach and have a drink or dessert.When my family came all the way from south Florida to see us, we took them here right after picking them up at LAX.We had reservations, still had to wait a bit, but we got a table quickly. Our waiter was nice and we ordered Clam Chowder. Some of us had the bread bowl and we were quite shocked about how hard the bread was. It was not fresh. Then we ordered the Hot Seafood Sampler which we had ordered quite a few times in the past. We were so disappointed when we got the order. It was basically a tower of french fries! A few calamari, 2 very small pieces of fish a small bit of ribs and the rest was fries! If I wanted a bucket of fries I would have taken them to In n Out burger.We just ate and went out by the beach. The parking was a nightmare, but the main thing is that the food quality is not there anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garfieldnp
50,"Great ""California"" experience! What you should know...","You will love it here. i'm local but highly encourage you to visit if you are from out of town for a great Malibu experience. Quick tips on visiting. The parking is $30. yes, I said $30 but if you order something from the restaurant the parking is reduced. While this seems crazy it does keep your beach experience rather calm and private, however, if you go on the weekend you must get there early otherwise you'll have to park at an outer lot and be shuttled over. They have great bathrooms and lifeguards on the cove. One of the most spectacular walks you'll ever take in Malibu. Great for teens, babies, toddlers! Very family friendly. You can bring your own blankets and beach stuff but here's a hint about the SUN. If you park yourself along the far end of the beach close to the cliffs...it's beautiful BUT you'll be the first people to lose the sun. Starting at about 3:30 in the summer. Then it gets cool fast. Also, they have beach showers. I think it's the perfect place to bring young kids because everything you could possibly want is there. Also, great place to bring out of town guests! Enjoy! OHHH, I almost forgot. Go to the website and read thoroughly. That's where you can really get all the info. worth the time spent i promise.'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowsunfish61
40,Paradise in Malibu,"I've been to Paradise Cove, (but I've never been to ""me"" ... okay bad joke .. let's move on). Like I was saying, I've been to Paradise Cove, a few times actually, and I will definitely be back. I'm surprised there aren't more places like this in Malibu. Maybe there are and I just haven't found them yet (cause I keep stopping there!) I typically have my laptop with me, as I am usually in LA on business. Paradise Cove is a great place to chill and enjoy the food, drinks and view. I always sit at a table outside with my toes in the sand and a view of the beach. Not a bad way to spend your lunch hour(s). It's nothing fancy, though. Very laid back and beachy. The birds do like to harass the customers, but the employees shoo them away and it all makes for an interesting experience. Alfred Hitchcock would love it. The burgers were good and once I had an amazing baked potato, which was served inside a sourdough roll. It was the size of a small football. Everyone near me noticed it, which was kind of fun. I also think people might have thought I was Guy Fiery. I was wearing my fake hair-hat at the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750johna750
40,A beach-club type with a private beach,"This is one of the few places close to LA-metro area that feels different and apart from the rest. It feels like a beach club with chairs, beach beds and areas to lay in te beach. Very family oriented with a lot of youn crowd scene as well. Prices are high and this is expected since you're in a ""private beach"" kind of thing, the restaurants has an indoor and outdoor area, the outdoor area floor is alla sand which you're literally eating in the beach with a table on the sand with its umbrella an friendly service. The ambiance is very laid- back Malibu style, menu has an international variety, from Mexican to Italian to burgers and seafood. We sat inside cause it was faster. I will personally recommend you to start with the amazing guacamole appetizer they have, one of the best gaucs I've EVER tried, seafood is very fresh try their seafood fountain and pastas are all great, great flavors and consistency. Service is not the best but apparently our waiter was just tired because all the busboys were extremely friendly and helpful, that made it up for the 20 minute waiting on our server to clean the water we spilled on our table, we had to ask him otherwise he would have never realize we spilled an entire big glass of water and when we did he sent a busboy to clean, busboy was very attentive, kind and smiling all the time he really seem to be enjoying his work.Drinks in the outside bar were $7 for a beer and up to $12 for a drink you can drink them around the beach which is fantastic.We spent $120ish in the restaurant for 4 people with no drinks.The pictures and historical objects are a great thing, I'm personally fascinated with old pictures and history so this is one of the attractions of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raveonpragha
30,Toes in the Sand,"I love this location. I am a huge fan of the 70's show, ""The Rockford Files"" and this is where my buddy Jim kept his trailer. The little pier is fixed up and the gimmick of being able to sit with your toes in the sand is a big treat. The only problem? The food is just not that great for the price. Come for the view, the sand, the free peanuts, but not really the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateKlo
30,"Lovely beach, but parking, food & drinks expensive!","We recently spent the day here- lovely cove - no large waves so ideal for children.On the day we visited the car park by the beach/ restaurant was full, so we dropped off and parked in the car park 10 min walk up the hill- this was surprisingly free, we were expecting to pay at least 20 dollars to park for the day. If you don't park in the allocated car park there is a 10 dollar 'walk in ' charge - perhaps this keeps the crowds down slightly?What really shocked us was the price of the snacks from the beach bar, 13 dollars for a mediocre ham/ salad roll ?! 8 dollars for a regular hotdog?!If you don't mind the prices then it's a nice cove to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jzeee

40,Paradise Cove,"We try to go to Paradise Cove at least once a year. When the grandchildren were younger we would take them every few weeks. There is a charge to use the beach, around $20/day but it is worth it as it controls the size of the crowd making for a more pleasurable beach experience. There is also an excellent restaurant at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayeF252

We arrived a little early for our reservation and they took us right in, seated us at our choice of outside with our feet in the sand! The servings are huge, food is good, but service could be improved. We were disappointed that our variety platter only included 1 BBQ shrimp. Next time I will order the BBQ shrimp only.

40,Very Pretty Beach,"Paradise Cove, is a very beautiful private beach. Access with a car is $30, however if you spend $25 at the cafe, you get 4 hours of parking for $4. The one complaint I have is the beach is very weedy and at least when we were there a lot of jellyfish were in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoomBoom967
40,"Location, Location, Location.","Pricey? A bit, yes. Crowded? That, too. But if it's pricey and it still draws a crowd then the obvious conclusion is that a whole lot of people must think it's worthwhile. We do. We visit the area every July and we always make it a point to visit the Beach Cafe while we are in LA. The calamari is very good, as is the clam chowder and taco combo. We would also recommend the salad bar and especially the fresh seafood sampler. A comparable sampler served at a restaurant just down the road cost $10 more and it was nowhere near as good -- not even close. The BBQ ribs are so-so, at best, as are some other non-seafood items. Presentation of some of the meals could be a little more eye appealing. Parking is validated, so that is hardly an issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/501MikeM
40,Rockford was here,"Stopped in for a cocktail and appetizer and to check out the location where Rockford was shot. Drinks were tall and tasty. Had the calimari and fries in a huge glass. Decent.

50,What a relaxing day!,"This little gem is where James Garner's character, Jim Rockford, lived in his trailer on ""The Rockford Files."" I took this little trip just to check it out, 'cuz I'm a HUG Rockford fan. Back in the day, the restaurant there was called the Sand Castle. It's now something different.First off, parking is $30. If you eat at the restaurant for more than $25, AND get validated AND *you don't spend MORE than 4 hours total there*, it will still be $30. Here's a hint: park out on the 101 and walk in. You can bring your own alcohol and food in. They will charge you $10, but you can get it validated (go to the ""to-go"" food area/gift shop outside in the back), and you can get your $10 back when you leave. There is a shuttle that takes you down to the beach once you walk in, but it's like 1/2 way down in, so you may as well walk the rest of the way. I did. When you arrive, get your parking ticket and drop off your passengers and/or beach stuff, cooler, etc. in the loading/unloading zone near the beach area. Everyone's cool there and won't take anything (but I don't suggest leaving anything valuable...) Then drive back out and pay nothing, and go park on the 101. I must warn you though, Sundays are worse than Saturdays to find parking on the 101. If you want to pay the $30 to park at the Cove, go ahead, but good luck finding anything unless it's a week day. I thought I was going burn out my clutch driving around the VERY small parking lot. Beers are about $8 each, so way more cost effective to bring your own. You can sit on the beach chairs for free. Available for rental are beds w/ umbrellas and towels and cabanas, but they aren't cheap. The staff that work on the outside of the restaurant are very friendly (Guest Relations). My server in the restaurant was non-chalant, as I noticed most of them to be. Not all, most. One of the ladies I asked a question to, she was very helpful and funny. It's the only beach in California you can drink on LEGALLY due to the restaurant's liquor license.I walked down past the showers and walked on the beach where I actually saw James Garner walk in many episodes, and it was like totally nostalgic for me. I saw something for the first time ever--lobster tails washed up on the beach! The sand is a bit grainy right by the main part of the beach but once you keep walking it gets a lot softer. Sunset was beautiful. You'd be surprised how many people leave NICE towels on the beach when they leave. Have a great time. See ya there soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasJavaKnight
50,Fantastic beach for families,Great food at restaurant! Really enjoyed the stay! Good service.Fun waves for the kids. Have to pay for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bjohe
20,Okay Food,"Food is okay (a little better than average), and parking is expensive! CRAZY traffic and parking if you go on weekend or during the summer. No exaggeration - you and hundreds of local home owners share 1 VERY tiny road to and from the restaurant area. Takes forever to get in or out. And please if you're going to park on that part of PCH, be very careful. Casualties are way too frequent. Booze and vehicles driving 50+ mph are not a good mix!!If you do go, take a walk on the beach going north to Point Dume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/in_da_bu
40,Paradise Cove expensive but enjoyable.,"As an avid fan of 'The Rockford Files' for the past third of a century, I vowed that if I ever returned to the west coast, I would visit the spot where his trailer was parked, have a meal at the diner where Rocky promised to buy him breakfast, and enjoy the scenic views that Jim enjoyed when he wasn't hiding (from hit men) on the roof of his trailer or stealing 'Pizza Dan's' car to go meet Aaron Ironwood.After making the long trek along the scenic pacific coast highway, taking the requisite photos, and parking, we headed into the Paradise Cove Cafe. We weren't concerned about the parking fee, since it was waived for anyone spending more than $25 in the cafe. This being Malibu, we (correctly) assumed that went with the territory.While the prices were high, the fried shrimp and onion rings were delicious, the beer ($6 a pop) cold, and the servers extremely friendly and informative. Although the place was nearly full, they were never to busy to provide some history on the cafe/beach or to attend to our needs.We followed dinner with a brief stroll along the beach, taking some cliffside pictures along the way.The only disappointment was that there was only ONE picture of James Garner, and it was from the remake of 'Maverick.' Seriously ? I'm sure that, after he reads this review, James will send them a picture of him fishing with Rocky or ready to punch Angel.In conclusion, I would recommend the Paradise Cove Cafe as a place to have fun at the beach. It is not a place to dine out on a budget, nor to expect a variety of desserts, but for television buffs / midwesteners who rarely get to see the coast, it was a most enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burgerboy55
30,Mostly hype,"I don't understand a beach along a coastline of hundreds of miles of beach that you have pay to be on. The beach is small and surrounded by cliffs so by late afternoon you can guarantee you'll be in the shade. It's nice to have a restaurant near by, but it's so expensive it's hard to justify buying even an appetizer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CignoNero
30,OVER RATED!,"NIce enough beach. Not as vast and expansive as many, which is a good thing. However, the parking charge is OUTRAGEOUS! When I went about a year ago it was $25/car.

10,One of the worst meals ever,"My daughter and I ""dined"" at Paradise Cove in May 2012 on our way back to Long Beach after a full day of hiking. While the service was very pleasant the meal was not. The Clam Chowder was the only enjoyable part of the meal. She had the Combo Tacos which were just ""OK"" at $17.95 but the Chopped Seafood Salad I ordered was nothing but a plate of chopped iceberg lettuce with microscopic pieces of what I suppose was seafood for $18.95! Oh yeah and you have to pay to park. I'd keep driving. Kathie S.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathieS99
10,"Rip-off parking fees, poor service","A fantastic location but don't bother - drive on to the state beach just a mile further north. The parking fees are extortionate and are masked by a vague and deliberately confusing scale of fees. On our exit we were charged $30 for a 45min stay, protests to the surly and extremely unprofessional parking lot manager were met with disdain, ""it's not my job to explain the parking fees"". From the restaurant we bought two cold, insipid coffees for $6.50 (plus tip). I can't imagine the food is any better. A stunning natural beauty spot spoilt by a business that has no interest in customer satisfaction and only one obvious goal: crass profiteering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitac500

30,Pretty but expensive parking,"Paradise cove is a pretty little cove with a good vibe. If you are having a meal at the restaurant they will validate which gives you free parking for awhile. If you then go for a walk on the beach and overstay the allotted time,it is very pricey. More and more people are parking on PCH and walking in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katlak

30,Cove on a budget,"It is possible to do the cove on a budget, you just have to plan ahead. For a great day at this beach, rent a bed($50) it seems like a lot , but it will make the trip. Bring a couple chairs of your own and you have comfort for 4 or more. Parking...remember if you go over 4 hours it will cost you $25. If you are getting close to 4 hours, move the car out pay your $3 and drive back in. You will need to spend another $20, so my suggestion is a bottle of white wine from the take away bar ($30) they will put it in a bucket on ice for you to take back to your spot on the beach. Food.... Bring and ice chest full of all the things you need, the food and drinks are veryexpensive. You can spring for a ice cream bars at the end of the day ($4). Following these instructions you have a full day at a the beach, beds, shade, wine and ice-cream all for under$100.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwimmomBakersfield

Very romantic. We even sat at the bar one time where there are only 3 chairs and still had a good time. We sat outside once. A little hard to walk in the sand but was still nice.

You can also go outside and walk around before or after eating-and get a feel for the old time beach colony that was here. Wouldn't you love to have one of those trailers right there on the beach?

50,A great semi-private beach,"You can almost imagine the ""Beach movies"" being made on the sand outside. Parking is expensive, but it keeps the beach fairly private. It's a beach with great sand, vista, and somewhat private. A piece of history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prosen2217
50,Lots of fun for the kids and the adults!,"When you pay for parking you are thinking I cannot believe I am paying this much $25.00 for parking outrageous.... BUT once you find a spot on the beach and settle in you will think I am not going to any other local beach with the kids!!! WHY? It is privately owned, safe, relaxing, like a hotel. We had 3 boys 2, 4, & 7 with no fear. They went in the water, played in the sand, we went on an adventure walk collecting shells, rocks, and checking out sand crabs. There were about 4 lifeguards on this small beach. They were never sitting, they were watching the kids, picking them up if they got knocked down, overall they were very attentive to the kids, we were actually able to relax! There is also a small pier right there that is part of the complex. They also have some more private areas with beach beds and cabanas, they also rent chairs and umbrellas. These were pricey so bring your own chairs, towels, ice chest with drinks and munchies, umbrella, and sunscreen! They have a restaurant for sit down or take out. The prices are reasonable and food is average. They also serve alcohol and you can take them out and drink openly on the beach. Yes, that is legal at this beach because it is private. There were no sketchy or really rowdy loud people swearing or being obnoxious, probably due to the parking cost. Most of the people there were families with kids under 12. People were friendly. We spent $20.00 for about 4 beers and stayed about 4 hours so parking was just under $5.00. Had a great time and definitely will make this the local beach choice when we have the little kids with us. They never once said there was nothing to do, they were bored or what is next. Highly recommended fun for us and the kids!!! Check out the Point Dume web cam and you will see what the weather is like. Go Early the parking lot fills up fast. Highly recommended fun for us and the kids!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaCA

30,"Great beach, mediocre restaurant","Paradise Cove is all about location, and it’s a beauty.Situated directly on the beach, this is the only place around where you can have your toes in the sand while you enjoy your delicious clam chowder with that yummy, crusty La Brea bakery bread.I don’t waste my time with the other menu options due to the big gap between quality and price.Aside from the chowder, nothing about this place is cheap from the $11 cocktails to the seafood entrees, and even the salad bar. Service is spotty depending on the size of the crowd – I’ve had both excellent and terrible service in the last 10 years, but such is the case with moist tourist oriented places.As long as you spend $25 in the restaurant your parking is $3 for 4 hours ($25 without eating at the restaurant). This allows adequate time for a meal (or 2 drinks) followed by a beautiful walk on the beach. If the tide is right you can walk underneath the homes you wish you could afford all the way to Point Dume. This stretch of beach is far more secluded than neighboring Zuma, and is much preferable to the area just outside the restaurant.Warning – the pagers they give to those who don’t make reservations will not work very far from the restaurant, so turn back when you hear the thing start chirping.Make reservations – this place gets insanely crowded in the summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zack_in_CA

50,Fantastic breakfast hangout,We stumbled upon this place on our drive from LA to Santa Barbara. As we were happy to sit outside we didn't have to wait for a table and were seated next to a heater which made it feel like the sun was beating down. Everything on their menu sounded delicious from home made granola through to thick cut French toast. The food didn't disappoint and was served promptly even though they were full to the brim. Would love to have this breakfast joint around the corner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dowthwaites
30,Used to be so good,This was a place we'd go to escape from reality for a relaxing lunch at the beach. Not any more. Food has gone downhill (which you can ignore looking out at the view!) but the killer is charging for parking. That's ridiculous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraJ48
40,Tasty!,This place is in an ideal location right on the beach and has a very relaxed and casual feel to it. The food and service is always good and has many delicious options.

20,Sorry won't be back,"My wife and I brought our three daughters last month for the first time. The beach was a lot of fun for them as they are ages 1 to 5 and then we went to dinner. The food was pretty expensive, spent well over $100. However, I was extremely disappointed when the food came. It was not worth the price I paid, not at all! To top it off, we got stuck paying $25 for parking and I am not talking about valet with a tip. We were told that we did not need to pay for parking if we ate at the restaurant, but since we had parked a half hour past the 4 hour mark due to the time at the beach, they charged us anyway. This was not something they shared with us when we came. As a result we will not be back, I know of many other places where the food is worth the price and they don't charge $25 to park in their parking lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomW86
50,Quintessential relaxing beachside restaurant - beautiful spot and the food was just fine,"I visited Malibu for the second time in Sept 2011 and made my third visit to the Paradise Cove Beachfront Restaurant. (Went there twice during last year's visit)I guess the septic tanks weren't acting up on the day I was there for lunch, because I didn't smell anything. It was on a Friday afternoon, my friend and I drove right in and parked close to the building. We requested the outdoor seating, wanting to enjoy the beautiful day and the spectacularly beautiful view. We got a drink at the bar, were told it might be 15 minutes to be seated outside, were given a ""buzzer"" and proceed with our drinks outside to the Adirondack chairs located in the sand on the beach. We only had around 10 minutes to enjoy the sun and the beach when the buzzer told us our table was ready.I had the coconut shrimp rplatter and my friend had the cold seafood sampler platterr. We shared and each was delicious. She was particularly happy with the selection of seafood in the platter. Both of us had so much food we had to ask for boxes to take almost half of it with us. We also had two glasses of wine each. The tab came to a little less that $70 without tip. I do not consider that to be overpricing.This was my friend's first visit to Paradise Cove and she really, really liked it. I think it is a beautiful and unique spot, unlike any other I've encountered in the area. And yes, I will return during my next visit.Practical: The service is fine and ours was friendly and efficient. It is a relaxed, outdoor atmosphere. One MUST slow down a little in life......and enjoy! I did observe a couple who started their meal outdoors and ended up moving indoors due to some pesky seagulls that were walking up too close for the young lady's comfort. I've encountered the seagull problem at other outdoor shore-side restaurants. They didn't bother me and they weren't overhead.Parking prices are as described. Don't go over the allowed 4 hour limit or you will have to pay the $25 parking fee. My advice: Don't pass up this unique Malibu experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaofPgh
10,Horrible 2nd trip!,"I have been to Paradise Cove once before last year and had a pretty nice time. Not this time! We went on a Tuesday, hoping to relax in the quiet of the cove. FORGET IT!We grabbed a spot about a third of the way down the cove and things started out pretty good. Then a group of about 7 showed up next to us and the first thing I heard was, ""what kind of music do you want to hear? Uh oh. Sure enough out came the speaker hooked up to the iphone. So we packed up and moved a little further up the beach. Wasn't to bad. That's when I spotted a couple of guys making there way up the beach and park themselves and there BOOM BOX about 20 yards from us. On went the heavy base techno, out came the beers, and the quiet peaceful cove experience was over! You know, when people are getting up and moving away from you, you might want to take a hint.Next was the group of 4 followed by a group of 5, not teenagers, where every other word out of there mouth started with F and ended with K. Not a place to take the kids! The water was great and the only thing the cove has going for it. Much cleaner than Santa Monica beaches. I wish I could say the same for the beach itself. Wear shoes! Way to many bottle caps and trash for such a small beach.How can they make it better for everyone? Granted, you are always going to have selfish A-holes that don't care about anyone but themselves but you can make it a little harder for them to ruin the day for everyone, by taking there toys away. Don't allow alcohol on the beach as well as the Boom boxes. You could also do a little better job at cleaning the beach at the end of the day after the A-holes, that don't have enough brains to find a trash can, leave.As far as the $25.00 parking goes. You know that going in and if you spend $20.00 at the restaurant it's only $3.00. I don't mind paying the extra money to park but not for this sorry cove.I bought a rack of ribs to go. They were good but not worth $27.00. But it was that or $25.00 down the drain in parking. I wanted to get something for my money. The staff at the restaurants were quite friendly. No complaints there.I go to the beach quite often, all year round. Will I go to Paradise Cove again. Never! I suggest if you are a tourist, go to the Northern end of Santa Monica, spend 8.00 to park and enjoy your day on a bigger, quieter and much cleaner beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachdude444
40,"Nice place to walk the beach, but ...","We ate here too, so the parking was only $3. The food was average at best, and pricey, but that's because you're paying for tbe setting, right? That said, the restaurant was way too crowded and chaotic for my taste; like dinner at an amusement park.Anyway, the beach itself is nice, especially if you walk north away from the crowds. Amazing cliffs above you. So, was it worth $25 if we hadn't eaten there? Not unless you brought your beach gear (we just took a stroll and took some photos).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/commercialloanbroker
10,IS THIS THE WORST RESTAURANT IN MALIBU?,"READ THE REVIEWS, I WISH I HAD.Admittedly it was a Saturday, and although we did make a reservation, it wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference. We bagged the last space in the top cap park near the stinking septic tanks (I assume thats what they were) and walked down to the restaurant.Great decor, good vibe, unreal view.The staff at the check in were surprisingly a little rude and we were told it would be 20 minutes for our table... (possibly not the greatest thing when you have two small kids with you but dealable with ) half an hour later we were sat at a fantastic table with unbelievable view, what a shame our server was utterly miserable, non communicative, rude and idle. I'll refer to her as ""The Misery"".The food was unbelievably greasy and this is possibly the only restaurant in LA where my kids didn't eat the fries. The guacamole was bland and utterly tasteless, the calamari was greasy, the caesar salad was passable (just). Our caesar salad and guacamole arrived, to be followed by the sharing appetizer calamari 40 minutes later, we mentioned this to ""The misery"" and she rudely barked it would be out.""The misery"" parked the cheque on our table before I had time to order any ice cream for the kids or asked if I wanted a coffee, another glass of wine etc and she was really annoyed when I asked her to explain what there was for the kids to eat for dessert. I ordered them an ice cream each. ""The misery"" re-parked the cheque on the table and said""Did I want Change"". I never dont tip, but my goodness this woman was so rude. I did leave her $4, a dreadful tip but the view was great.We left on the golf buggy beach shuttle (great idea) back to the car park with the stink of the septic tanks being carried along by the sea breeze. The grease mixed with the stink and the rudeness really made my husband and I both remark that we would never, ever, ever be back, and then the parking attendant topped the experience off, he was unbelievable rude and wouldnt even look at my husband as he handed the ticket and barked ""$3"".The bottom line is this place doesn't need to be better than it is. The staff dont need to be charming, The food doesnt need to be great, they have a fabulous location on the beach and they know it, but it would be amazing if they picked it up and had some pride in their service and dropped the contempt for their patrons, for they after all keep the place open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LABeachgal_11

They have cabanas and small areas to rent out. Or you can just park it on the beach like we did for free. Clean and stocked restrooms which is a plus. You may bring alcoholic drinks (except for hard liquor) onto the beach, another plus. Beach is clean but small but nice. They have a cafe on the beach, just a little to pricey for me but seem to draw in crowds. Lots of families and people of all ages. Not rowdy, but pretty full. Second trip here now, and really coming to enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanise1978
10,Absolute ripoff and ridiculous car parking scam,"We visited Paradise Cove for a beer by the sea. We had 2 small fat tires that cost $17!!!!We then left and realised we had to spend $20 to get our parking validated, otherwise we had to pay $25 parking fee!!! You even have to pay $3 just to walk in to the car park to go to the restaurant!!We managed to get our ticket stamped by pleading ignorance, but it put us off the place for good.I imagine you'll have a great time there if you're loaded with cash, but $30 for basically, fish and chips, seems a bit much.You can sit outside on the beach with your own beer, but you would have to pay the $25 to park. Basically, they've got a great scam going where they know they'll take everyone for at least $20 as soon as they arrive. Though when a SMALL beer is nearly $9, spending $20 isn't that hard.I'm presuming the beach is privately owned, otherwise it seems a disgrace to limit access to the people with more money than sense, of whom there are clearly a lot of here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d_jay16

She also recommended Wolfgang Pucks place, both were yummy choices. You can't go to Paradise Cove expecting gourmet food. But if you lower your expectations slightly you can have a great time at this place. The sour dough bread was deliciously warm. The Clam Chowder was good as well. I had the Shrimp Tacos, they were new on the menu and I can't say I would order them again. Hubby had a terrific salad with Asian Dressing and Ahi Tuna. We ordered the Chocolate Cake for dessert....the cake is 12 inches high! We shared the cake between 4 of us and still left some behind!

I called the restaurant to let them know, and they were really nice to move our reservation down a half hour...half hour later, we were STILL stuck in traffic. we arrived to Paradise Cove an hour late after our original reservation time. the place was PACKED, (it was a sunday). Went up to the booth, and explained to them our traffic situation and how i had called earlier...the staff was super nice and told us the wait would only be 10 minutes. Standby time was 70 minutes for those who didn't make a reservation (so make sure you MAKE A RESERVATION!). we were seated within less then 10 min inside the restaurant. our waiter was super friendly. I ordered a mai-tai (DELICIOUS) and my b/f ordered a pina colada (just as good). we're not sea food lovers, but the menu had enough variety to cater to our tastes. we ordered the bbq wings as an appetizer (HUGE!), boyfriend ordered the paradise burger, and i ordered the steak sandwich. both which were delicious. note: after 5pm, a lot of sandwiches on the menu are not available. ALSO- if you order an appetizer & a sandwich, make sure to order a different side w/ your sandwich b/c your appetizer will come with a HUGEEEEE portion of fries!!!!!! our bill came out to about $70 bucks for the both of us. a bit pricier, but the food was delicious, the view was great...we walked out to the private beach and sat and watched the sun go down. it was BEAUTIFUL. parking was only $3 bucks with restaurant validation. (also- you can just sit out on the private beach and order your food at their ""TO-GO"" bar..highly recommend this place for couples or a group of friends. will def go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sillyjess
50,Great spot and good day trip for families with young kids and good food,"I came here the other day with my family and we had a great day. I'd recommend going earlier if you want to get a good spot on the beach if you're going to rent chairs/umbrella. We are staying in Santa Monica and it took a while to get there as traffic was horrible on Saturday.They have a parking lot below near the restaurant but it was already packed by 11 AM so we parked in the upper lot. The prices for the parking are $25 if you are staying over 4 hours. If you stay less than 4 hours and are eating in the restaurant, they will validate your ticket and then you only pay $3.They have an indoor restaurant, an outdoor patio on the right and then they have a to-go section where you can order food and take it to your chairs. They don't have employees that bring them to your chairs.The restaurant stays VERY full so I'd recommend only going having reservations. We make a reservation as we arrived and then got in 2 hours later. We hung out on the beach all day so we also used the to go part and ordered some fruit and drinks and some other food.The food was fairly good....nothing to complain about but nothing that was going to win any top chef competitions either. It's all about location, location, location which was great.We rented some nice chairs and umbrella. The chairs are $25 each and are right near the ocean. You can bring your own chair and umbrella if you don't want to pay for them. We rented 3 chairs and had plenty of room and the chairs were the long adjustable lounge chairs which were really comfortable. They also have a few cabanas to rent but they were all full when we got there. They were $400.All in all a really nice spot. By the end of the day it was very crowded and people kept coming past 6 PM. It's a great spot and we might come back before we head to La Jolla in a few weeks. This is a perfect place if you have young children.The only thing I want to point out is the sand is EXTREMELY hot here. Not sure if it was just the day I was there as it was very hot but the sand was extremely unbearably hot. Even walking with sandals you would burn your feet. Been here the past week and hitting the beaches in Santa Monica and Venice Beach and haven't run into this...not sure why but the sand was really hot!Also, I read a few of the other reviews saying this place was too expensive, etc. I wouldn't call it budget but the food was good. A hamburger was $16 but was good. Others called it a tourist trap but I'd disagree. It's a really nice spot and I'd recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintba
10,Bring alot of money!,"Yes it is beautiful, didn't taste the food but it looked good. After a beautiful ride up the coast we thought this would be a perfect place to have a beer before venturing on up the Highway. 2 beers were $16.00 1 can of BL and 1 bottle of Pacifico. We stayed 40 min. and had our parking ticket validated. I did not read the fine print: with a purchase of $20.00 or more the cost of parking is $3.00. Without Validation it is $25.00. Anyway since I did not spend $20.00 I owed $25.00 for parking! When the parking attendant said $25.00 and took one look at my face! he said that's ok I'll charge you $3.00. Definiately for the rich and famous !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxgirls4
10,Anti-pet tourist rip-off,This place is ridiculous. I had to take some photographs of the coast for some book covers and a friend pointed me towards Paradise Cove. I drove over there with my dog in the car but they wouldnt let me even park my car in their lot with him in the car. What's my dog going to do to the place from the comfort of my car?Turns out they did me a favour though because although parking is $3 with validation... the validation required is a minimum of $20 spent on lunch. If you dont get validated then parking is $25. This is the most over-priced scam i've ever heard of to park your car at a tourist trap.Never go here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jawatron
50,Sshhhh!!!! Don't tell anyone else!,"I was ready to buy one of the mobile homes on the road into this place, that's how much we loved this most PERFECT slice of California. Scenery- STUNNING! Clientele- beautiful! FOOD- FRESH, simple, fantastic. Service- Friendly, efficient but never rushed.If you're upset because you're waiting in an atmosphere this gorgeous, this relaxing, this perfect, then you don't need a vacation, you need intensive therapy. Have the cold seafood selection- Crab, jumbo wild Mexican shrimp, smoked musseld, scallop ceviche, PERFECT. Have you noticed the number of times the word ""perfect"" is in this review? Yes, turn down Paradise Cove Road and eat at the cafe. But leave the trailers alone- there'e on with my name on it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GilmoreGirlz
50,I almost don't want to spotlight this great getaway..,"I am going somewhat against my own instinct as I am quite happy to not have hordes of impatient tourists jamming this wonderful spot and demanding instant service. However.....why would you go to kick back at the beach and then complain that you had to, gasp, wait? This a lovely, laid back spot to get something to eat and sit back and enjoy the sun and sand. There are many ways to enjoy the Cove--eat inside or out, sit in the Adirondack chairs, get takeout and go to one of the many umbrella tables. Plenty of clean restrooms, inside and out and lots of beautiful beach.The key is enjoy.....a hint on how to really get the best out of your day: Park in the lot, enjoy a leisurely meal, and then head to the beach for some sun. You have four hours and the cost for parking is only 3 bucks (better than parking on PCH and walking a mile or two like other spots). If three dollars bothers you, use the pool at your hotel. This place is too good to spoil with cranky visitors---leave it, please, to those of us who appreciate a great spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FundogsBurbank
10,2nd visit stripped the shine off,"Hi beach cafe lovers,If you are like me, desiring to sit at a thatch-roofed table, overlooking the ocean, with your bare feet free to dig in the sand beneath your table, then the Paradise Cafe does look like, well, Paradise. Which is what led me back there for the 2nd visit in a year for an early morning breakfast today, May 30, 2009. However, as they say, reality sucks, and in this case the reality of the place came through loud and clear. Don't get me wrong, if you are ok with slow service and poor food, but just want to enjoy the view or get smashed on the expensive drinks, then this is the place for you (and many kindred souls it seems, since they do get jammed during the summer months). But as for food quality, forget it. I had the seafood omelette for breakfast, which promised ""dungeness crab and shrimp"" as its primary ingredients. Eggs were dry and flat-tasting, shrmp were those little canned variety (flavorless) and what crab meat was in there was visible only with a magnifying glass (ok, maybe not that small, but definitely no more than a large crab-claw of meat. Very disappointing. Plus the coffee (at 9am) arrived colder than the sea water termperature (about 60) and when the server did bring a warm replacement cup, the coffee was weak and bland. I will say the sourdough bread was toasted to pefection and the jellies and butter were top drawer, but hey, it would have been nice if the omelette and potatoes had been in the same category. To add insult to injury, although we did have our parking stamp validated, we got socked $3 to get out the exit after staying less than an hour and only to choke down our meals. On a scale of 1(low) to 10 (high), I'd give it a 1/2. But young kids will love it and they are notoriously unpicky eaters, so if you'd like to give them a treat, just write the food off as the cost of keeping your kids happy.Beach Baron",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KauaiKurt
10,"Paradise Cove is a waste of time, money, peace of mind.","We drove doen from Laguna Beach and had some time to kill before our Getty Villa reservation and needed lunch. We had no reservation, but were advised it would be 20 minutes or so for a table.We were seated at 30 minutes. Loud, loud, loud. We could not converse. After a considerable wait we were given menus. Prices ranges from $13 appetizers to $30 meals. We ordered burgers/iced teas so that we would not have to wait further. Food took awhile. No drink refills. Had to wave down a waitress for check (having never seen our original waiter again). She slapped down a cash register tape and disappeared. Went to the front desk to attempt to pay. No go. Had to fight the tide back and flag down someone else to pay. Sheesh.Plus, paying to park (even after validation from eating their food) was an unexpected trial.Would never go there again.Glad I'm back in Laguna where we're not sheep!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellysmom92651
10,NEVER AGAIN,Even with a reservation we had to wait two hours for our table!!!. The service was terrible. I would never tell anybody to go here. There are plenty of other restaurants that would appreciate your business and treat you much better. Just a tourist trap. Don't waste your time or money!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arizonatumbelweed
40,Perfect Malibu Experience!,"I had lunch here while visiting my friend in los angeles. It was a beautiful drive, and the lunch was just as great! We were taken right to a table on the beach and got to eat with our feet in the sand. The service was surprisingly slow seeing as the place was not too crowded, but it was lunch time...We all got salads, and I had ""bob's Cobb"" which was absolutely huge, but delicious and I was able to get the leftovers to go, so it was more than one meal for the price.The highlight was when a seagull started dining at the table next to us after the customers who were eating there left. Everyone was amused by him!Beyond the slow service (we waited quite awhile for drinks and then after we ordered it was another lengthy period before our food actually came...) it was a gorgeous place to eat, with wonderful food. The perfect beach lunch! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone to try at least once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malphaba
50,Absolutely a great place!,We just happened to turn at the right place off of Hwy 1 and this was the place that we ended up at.This was a great place to stop and have a bite to eat. The food was great and the portions were huge.I had the Big Kahuna nachos the name itself will tell you how big it is. This was an appetizer and thank goodness I had it as my meal.My husband had the steak sandwich. He enjoyed every bit of it.I wished I would have seen the salad bar before I had ordered because it is fantastic.Go here if you get the chance - the drinks are extra cold!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmgoode
50,One of my favorite places during my last visit,"The Beach Restaurant at Paradise Cove was one of my favorite places during my trip in April 2008.I loved the relaxed atmosphere. I just went there to sit out on in the sun, I didn't have to eat or drink anything, but of cause I did. The beach wasn't too crowed, the waiters were nice and helpful and the prices were ok if you consider you can sit outside in the sun all day and enjoy the view. I am coming back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elkisch
50,"Great food, generous portions, pretty pier and beach, great ambiance","My friend from Riverside drove us to lunch at this old, traditional, beach restaurant with superb ""fish and chips"", guacamole, and salads... not a lot of choices for a vegetarian, but he had a good salad... the portions are huge, enough for 2-3 people... the ambiance is great, it is noisy and busy but a fun vibe, with great photos all around of the Malibu Movie Colony from the '30s to '60s... prices were very reasonable... good bar/beer selection.. a pretty beach with calm waves and clean sand, lots of umbrella-shaded chairs to sit and chat outdoors, not very crowded when I was there (which was around 2 in the afternoon, maybe good idea to come at an off-hour?)... it costs $8 for 4 hours to park if you are having a meal (get your ticket validated), but $25 to park if you are just there for the beach. I loved it, wish we could have stayed longer just sitting on the beach, drinking in the salt sea air, and people-watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GammaQuadrant
20,Tourist Trap,"I heard alot about this place and was excited to go there. I went for the dining experience first then the beach. The restaurant was SO NOISY and crowded, it was not relaxing. It was just the opposite. I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. The food was good tho. The cole slaw was exceptionally good. The beach was so crowded that I didn't even venture out there. After eating, I got my parking ticket validated, hiked back up the steep hill to the dirt parking lot and left. NEVER AGAIN !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/culmomio
