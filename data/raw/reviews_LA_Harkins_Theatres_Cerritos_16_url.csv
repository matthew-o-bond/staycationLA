40,Good place to watch a Movie,I love the reclining chairs and the space you have to watch a movie without having people all over you.,Phillip H
40,Nice Movie going.,We went to see a movie at this place and it was really relaxing and fun. By doing the online reservation everything was easy and fast. Inside the theater seats were very comfortable and adjustable to our comfort level.,Geo K
40,Comfortable Seating Great Experience,"By far my favorite theater for the MCU (Marvel) movies. Power reclining seats, wide selection of snacks, great sound. Thoroughly enjoy my visits. Highly recommended.",StevenC
50,Awesome Theater with comfy seats,"I'm really into movies and this place is great! From the moment you walk in with the large selection of (of course overpriced) snacks and food, to the full bar, to the very comfortable and EXTRA reclining PRE-SELECTED/ Reserved seats. High five.",Fernando J
50,Nice place,We went on a very quiet day so we got lucky. Comfortable seating and employees were really nice.As with the theaters in today's world the assigned seating is something I really don't care for.,Grayhairgma
50,Amazing staff,Visited while in town after our cruise. The staff was amazing and very friendly. The place was clean and popcorn hot and fresh. Drinks were perfect. The chairs were amazing being recliners in a stadium setting. Lots of leg room. Would go back,Jeff A
30,Always Crowded,No matter when we go parking is hard to find. Seems like it is busy all of the time. Once you find a place to park the theater is right inside. Good to purchase tickets online ahead of time. Bar on site. Comfortable seating.,createandcapturelife
50,Reclining Seats!,Great family theatre. You can pick you seats and will have plenty of room when you sit down. The seats recline and gives you plentey of space to kick your feet up! They even have a bar where you can order alcohol and take into your movie. I like cider so was happy to find they had it on tap. They also offer one free refill on the Extra Large popcorn. Thumbs up!,Jennifer M.
50,Great Theatre,"This movie theatre is great, all seats have mechanism that the movie goer can recline similar to a LazyBoy chair. All seats are numbered, you choose the seat you want at time of purchasing the tickets and you can walk in at the last minute not worrying about not having a seat. Sound system and screen technology are up to date, good service and very clean.",semanticvision
