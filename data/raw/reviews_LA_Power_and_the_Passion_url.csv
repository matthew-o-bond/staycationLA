50,Superb sculpture monument to a city founder,"This is one of the most iconic monuments in Glendale, presented in 1993 by artist J Michael Wilson. The majestic horses, meticulously represented larger than life, would have been a favorite of one of the city's most prominent and influential historic figures, developer Leslie Coombs Brand (hence Brand Blvd and Brand Library, etc.). Brand loved horses and it is therefore, an appropriate monument to take such a prominent position at the downtown gateway on Brand Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
