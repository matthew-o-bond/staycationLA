40,"Overpriced, but gorgeous location.","This is a very expensive spa. I came here for a bachelorette party, and they were nice enough to comp us a bottle of sparkling wine since there were so many of us getting spa treatments. But, the cost of the spa treatments was exorbitant. I feel like the quality was no better than Burke Williams, for nearly twice the cost. Yes, you get a gorgeous ocean view from the pool and the quiet room. But the price tag and forced 20% gratuity seem excessive for the limited spa offerings. I would come back for a special occasion, but I would rather go elsewhere for massages.",Kristen R
40,Great Valentines Day buffet!,"We usually avoid the buffet on Valentine’s Day the past 2-3 years & settle with the sit-down menu. This past Valentines Day, we did the buffet after finding out that they have a new chef and we were pleasantly surprised with the obvious improvements in the quality of food & service. The Peruvian scallops were delicious!!!",JUDEN V
50,Welcome Respite,"Enjoyed a wonderful Spa afternoon during my stay. The full body massage was very relaxing along with the numerous other spa amenities ie: Hot Tub, Pool, Restaurant etc... A well deserved and very welcomed afternoon.",O2654FJmiket
50,Special Occasion Spa Day,"The is a great place for a special occasion spa day. The staff is friendly. The locker room facilities are nice. There is a quiet lounge where you can wait for your provider that has beverages and light snacks. There is an outdoor patio area that includes a plunge pool and canopied seating. I had a deep tissue massage that was great. I had an early morning appointment, so it was nice and quiet and I could hear the sound of the ocean from my treatment room.Afterwards my husband and I enjoyed lounging in the area overlooking the ocean and eating lunch poolside. A true getaway in LA that really isn't that far away!",MayaD888
20,The Spa at Terranea,"I have been going to the spa here since it opened. My wrap service this time was ok not great as in the past.More important the Spa was not clean and tired. Cushions were torn. The outside had spider and cow webs everywhere. The jacuzzi jets were not working. It was busy and they seemed short staffed. So towels were left in the floor. The dirty towel bins were overflowing.Many times there was no attendant in the locker room.If this Spa is going to charge 5 star prices. They need to get it together. Managers where are you? Take a lesson from Sonoma Mission Inn, Two Bunch Palms or La Quinta. They know how to run and keep up their spas.",Rmcaptor
40,Very good except no follow through from the resort staff,"The spa here is lovely. It includes complimentary parking validation. My sister and I came here for massages for a belated mother's day - I got the deep tissue/sports massage from Akiko. It was awesome. We also had a lovely lunch at the spa - solviva. It was healthy and great. Staff here were wonderful.My only complaint is that we told them we were in a rush to leave to pick up my kids from school and were assured that we could tell them to have the valet call up my car so that by the time we got to the valet from the spa, the car would be there. We notified them when we left and asked them to have the valet pull our car up. But when we got there, it wasn't waiting as promised. So I gave my valet ticket to the desk and said that I needed my car as soon as possible. She promised to get it soon. 10 minutes later, my sister and i were the only ones standing waiting for my car still. I had to ask them again where my car was and I'm still not sure what happened. Needless to say, I was very late to pick them up. It's disappointing that after a lovely treatment, this is the last thing I'm left with as far as impressions go.",Rx-art
50,Perfect for a relaxing time with the girls,"I came to Terranea during a girls weekend for massages and pool time. I received a spectacular relaxing 60-minute massage.The facilities are very nice, the staff are friendly and professional. This spa sets the scene for a relaxing day. We enjoyed the sauna and the eucalyptus steam room (which really helps clear up your lungs) and then gathered at the pool to enjoy snacks and drinks.I would absolutely return to this spa for a relaxing day with my friends or by myself.",Candace O
20,"Cheated me on length of massage, spa not very large, very expensive","Two members of our party had a good massage, but mine was far from good. A few minutes before the 3:00 appointment time I went to the lounge and sat there until the masseuse cam to retrieve me at 3:13. A good period of the remain 77 minutes was spent smelling various massage oils, folding blankets, placing items in drawers, etc. When all was said and done I had an approximately 50 minute massage of the quality of which was on par with Massage Envy. Had I paid Massage Envy prices I would not be complaining, but sadly I paid 4-5 times more.",KELLIE G
50,Best place on earth,We stayed in LA and drove to the spa it was extremely scenic.The resort is beautiful.We had a couples massage in their ocean view room. The sun was beaming in the room and we listened to the waves crashing during our massages. Best view ever !!!We also had lunch at Nelson’s (burgers and soup) and it was decent.We utilized the trails and the pool.Next time we will definitely stay here!!It’s velvet parking if you use the spa.They provided tea w lemon and honey with snacks. Had that laying on their deck. Beautiful.,nycbaby2012
40,Relaxing luxury spa within the sound of crashing waves at Terranea Resort,"The Spa at Terranea is a very good luxury spa with an extensive menu of treatments. The reception is quick and professional from a desk set among small collection of spa shopping items and central access to the locker rooms, salon, café, and the fantastic spa pool area. The locker rooms were fully appointed with lockers, comfy robes, slippers, grooming area, bathroom, shower, sauna, hot tub, plunge tub, outdoor/private lounge area, and indoor lounge—all really top of the line. I especially appreciated one of the best multi-head showers I’ve experienced in a spa locker room. The attendants were sharp and professional in moving guests through the facility. The co-ed treatment lounge included a comforting fireplace, sweeping views of the ocean (including sights of dolphins, seals, etc.), and the sounds of the waves breaking against the rocks below. The therapists were great healing professionals in well-appointed treatment rooms. The spa pool area is a special gem with plenty of seating/laying options including umbrella-shaded two-person beds with ocean views and poolside food/drink service. The costs are fairly high for luxury level facilities and treatments, and I’d rate the value as good. Overall, I’d rate this among one of the better spa facilities I’ve experienced; highly recommended especially if you’re a guest at Terranea.",raharrington85
50,Heavenly!,"The relaxation starts just outside the front doors of the spa, where the scents of the oils and products waft into the air. From the moment I stepped though the doors, every single staff member I encountered seemed genuinely happy that I was there. The staff walk you through every step of the experience, so you never feel lost in the massive spa. The locker rooms are beautifully appointed, and the relaxation area has ice water, tea, nuts, and fruit to satiate you while waiting for your therapist - so get there early! I had an absolutely heavenly massage with Melinda, she was fantastic! It was difficult to choose which oil I wanted for my treatment because they all smelled amazing! You also get to keep the rest of the bottle. Overall an excellent experience in a beautiful setting. I can’t wait to return!",Stephanie B
30,Loudest spa I've ever been to,"I came with my husband for a peaceful getaway, but the patrons in the spa were the loudest I've ever experienced in that type of setting. I was shocked that both staff and patrons were speaking at full volume in the locker rooms and in the meditative spaces. I found it impossible to relax having to listen to other people's conversations.Also, every meal we ordered from the spa restaurant came with moldy berries!",T2023TQpaulh
