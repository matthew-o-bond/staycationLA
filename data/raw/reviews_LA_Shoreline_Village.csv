30,Very Sad,Years ago we took our children down to Shoreline Village every Sunday afternoon...They would ride on the Carousel (no longer there) and walk through many of the fun shops...most are no longer there...Parking was free and we had a fun family outing...So much has changed...We took our grand kids down there and I was so unhappy at what this quaint place has turned into. The saddest is that the beautiful carousel is gone...We will never go back again....,Susan B

We were able to walk down to the Shoreline and enjoy the waterfront boardwalk, scenic views, and walk through shops and dine at restaurants. The area is safe and clean and provided hours of enjoyment the day before our cruise. There is also a shopping mall within walking distance. The next morning I got up very early and went back to the area and watched the cruise ships dock and unload. Cool to see your ship come in that you will be on in a few hours.

50,Fun place,"We spent our last day in California here and loved it. The boat tour of the harbor was only $15, and was very informative. We practically had the boat to ourselves. The captain wasn't friendly but he gave a great tour. We had dinner at Yard House, it was packed but good food and drinks. The parking charge was outrageous, so park off site if possible. The shops were fun to explore and buy some trinkets.",Diane G
50,Fun night,"Had a business trip to the Queen Mary. Wondered over here several nights. Fun atmosphere, lots of food and shopping options. Had a great glass of wine and sushi one afternoon.

30,Family Visit,"This quaint village has been around for a long time and it‚Äôs showing its age. However it is clean and on the weekday we visited was not crowded. Although there is adequate street signage, driving there was a bit challenging with many tourist attractions vying for attention and patronage. The village on this quiet day was quite charming surrounded by marine motif of boats and lighthouse, and the majestic Queen Mary glimmering in the distance. There are many shops selling souvenirs and knickknacks. And there are many eateries to choose from in this space. For young families the Fun House with its merry-go-round and arcade games is a main draw. Make sure to get your parking validation before you leave. The attendant is inflexible and curt.",LnS2004
50,Staycation by the Sea,"I've been a resident of beautiful Long Beach most of my life. Through out the years I've witnessed Downtown Long Beach develop into a major tourist attraction particularly Shoreline Village as well as The Pike area.

After you've filled your belly Take a walk check out the unique shops with assorted trinkets and yaghts to see though I never left my city Shoreline Village gave a feel of A wonderfilled Vacation in my city. Us residents forget the beauty of our attractions but once you visit Shoreline you feel the warmth of the people,the ambiance of the place only thing didn't get to do is get on the magical Carousel it was closed but it was still a worderful time so hats off to you Shoreline never lost it's beauty.Its a must visit place even if you're a longtime resident. Check it out you'll never want to leave.",Felebe
50,Good shopping area,"Great little place to go wander through the shops. Due to the Grand Prix fencing it was a little out of the way to walk to from my hotel but was worth it once I got down there. Small roses for kids, shopping and plenty of great places to grab food or a drink",Foreman212
50,Great Day,"We are spending one day in Long Beach before a cruise and asked for suggestions to pass the time and again and again we were told Shoreline Village. Now there is too much to do in one day but plenty of choices. Shop, eat, drink, walk, bike, pedal carts, cruise, whalewatch, harbor cruise, Queen Mary tour or nothing at all. We walked all around, stopped here and there and before you knew it the day had passed. Great sights and fun times. Check local calendar for special events like marathons and car races.

50,Spring Break Favorite Place To Visit,"Spring Break ... the sun is out, clear blue sky, breezy and beautiful California weather ... what a better way to spend a day in Shoreline Village. First, we went to the Aquarium of the Pacific and spent about 4-hours at the museum. Then, we walked over to the Shoreline Village. Along the way, we walked along the shoreline and saw the Parker Lighthouse, Rainbow Harbor Marina, the Queen Mary, and took pictures along the way. Then, we headed to the Shoreline Village. This place is amazing! Lots of restaurants, shops and thing to do at this village. Across the street, there are more shops, theaters, and restaurants to go to. We always go back and enjoy our visits here in Long Beach!",Melissa405oc

30,Safe and clean,"Was in town for a meeting at the convention center, staying at the Hyatt. Long Beach is very spread out and according to many people we spoke with, you should not venture too far from the waterfront area. Shoreline Village is just a quick walk over the footbridge. It‚Äôs a big manufactured and chain feeling to me but it‚Äôs safe, clean and has reliable restaurants. We probably walked the are a half dozen times in my 7 night stay. Couple of chain restaurants but a handful of other shops and beautiful views.",ALil'Irish!
50,A fun place to stroll,"Great bars and restaurants and novelty shops. I love the merry-go-round! The queens steakhouse at the top of Parker‚Äôs lighthouse is excellent. Have time, rent a boat and take a tour of the harbor.",lmatteson

20,Mainly food,The shoreline village has a movie set feel about it. The marina is a nice back drop but I would only recommend going to the area with intention to eat at one of the restaurants and/or in summer. It‚Äôs pretty exposed and cold in the winter wind.It‚Äôs a place I‚Äôm happy to walk through but I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to get there.,sarahtravelled3
40,Small shopping center on the wharf,"I was expecting the shopping center to have more stores and restaurants. However, there were several restaurants that were enticing us with their smells of steak, seafood and barbecue. This is situated on the wharf so you can see many boats ‚õµ. You can even rent pedal bicycles and pedal carts. üõ¥",USN_Seabee_Wife
50,Quaint village,"This was a lovely, quaint village which was only one if the attractions in the harbour area of Long Beach. Unfortunately my visit was at the start of February and the weather wasn‚Äôt great so there were very few people about. But I‚Äôm sure in different conditions this would be an amazing place to visit.",Sunnygardendoll
40,"Waterfront dining, shopping and entertainment","Shoreline Village on Long Beach‚Äôs Rainbow Harbour is a waterfront dining, shopping and entertainment area. The atmosphere is casual, friendly, relaxed ‚Äì bright and sunny by day, it becomes mellow and romantic when night falls and the lights come on.Shoreline Village offers a choice of dining options ‚Äì fine dining, casual dining or just snacks and light eats. The place also has an antique carousel in the Pelican Pier Pavilion, bike rentals, sail and powerboat rentals, charters including fishing boats and catamarans, harbor cruises and an eclectic choice of shopping.If you‚Äôre looking for quality family time, you couldn‚Äôt choose better. If on the other hand you want a romantic sunset walk, that too is here. If you want to bicycle down the coastal bike path, you could do that too.It is within walking distance from the Aquarium of the Pacific and is just across the harbor from the Queen Mary berthed here.One of the iconic restaurants here is the wonderfully well located Parker‚Äôs Lighthouse famous for mesquite-grilled sea food, that offers spectacular views of the harbor especially from the waterfront patio.Parker‚Äôs Lighthouse also has the Queensview Steakhouse on the third floor. An upscale supper club, it has live jazz by local artists, prime steaks, fresh sea food, craft cocktails and a 360 degree view ‚Äì what more could you ask for?! It is open Tuesday-Saturday between 5pm and 10pm and on Sundays between 4pm and 9pm. Either of these restaurants make a great choice for dinner though one would perhaps be slightly more partial to the Queensview Steakhouse.If you are here during the day and worked up an appetite for some light eats, you couldn‚Äôt do better than head to The Funnel House ‚Äì fresh, baked-to-order funnel cake. You can assemble your own Funnel Sundae with your choice of ice cream, whipped cream and assorted fruit toppings. Wash that down with good old fashioned lemonade. We enjoyed ourselves here.Another wonderful casual dining place we recommend is Twisters and Coffee ‚Äì located next to the carousel pavilion, they‚Äôll give you pretzels, buns and biscotti, rolls, cinnamon twisters plus a choice of smoothies, cold coffee and juices, cappuccino, latte, espressos. Just a terrific pep up place.The shops here offer such a huge variety of unique merchandise that it is difficult to name just a few. However, top of our list was:Istanbul Home ‚Äì handicrafts, silk and cotton bedcovers, handbags, towels and robes, jewellery, glass mosaic lamps, hand painted ceramics, even ‚Äònazars‚Äô to ward off the evil eye! You‚Äôd be excused for falling in love with pretty much all that is in store ‚Äì the only thing that stops you from buying up the store is of course your wallet! A little pricey for sure, but what an exquisite range!Pirate‚Äôs Cove was our choice for souvenirs to take back for the folks at home ‚Äì both children and adults. Pirate clothing, plenty of endearingly ghoulish stuff, nautical gear, memorabilia, collectibles. This is one fun store and if you don‚Äôt keep looking at the time, you‚Äôll possibly land up spending much of the day here!Raindance just has to be your choice if you‚Äôd like to have Native American handicrafts, jewellery, pottery, dream catchers, blankets, drums, flutes. This is an exotic collection which you will find hard to resist.The stores at Shoreline Village are open daily between 10am and 9pm. Between June through August, summer retail hours are 10am-10pm. Restaurants‚Äô business hours vary.",TMenon

50,I loved it here!,"So many places to shop. Especially loved Pirates Cove and the foot place. There were great shirts and shot glasses and other souveniers.

You can walk the whole entire area, which is great, and then walk across the bridge that is pedestrian,and bicycle friendly as well back to your hotel. We really enjoyed this area.",10Karen15
30,Just ok,A few shops and eateries that are quite average. The biggest draw here is renting a family size bike or scooter for a cruise around the harbor. Nice place to take a pic of the Queen Mary from afar. Be sure to validate parking as we missed that on the sign and had to pay more money than expected.,Donna D
50,Many years have passed since we visited Shoreline Village,"We planed to visit Shoreline Village as they opened up and prepared for the mid day crowds. Wandering around the Village enjoying getting acquainted all over again looking at beautiful downtown Long Beach to the North and the Queen Mary on the West, then stopping for coffee and Pecan Pie lowered our blood pressure to below normal. It pays to come early if you want a close parking space.",Wally K

Louisiana Charlie‚Äôs if you like Cajun and seafood. Q Smokehouse for barbecue. Tequila Jack‚Äôs unique Spanish dishes and Outback Steakhouse has great cocktails.

50,Super Cute Shops and rent a boat for a few hours!,"There are some really cute shops. We loved the Jerky Store! Who Knew? They have some really unusual types of jerky here. If you are a fan like my husband it's a must see! Really nice on a sunny winter Day when it's too cold for the beach but you want to be by the water and the view is beautiful. Really fun to rent a pontoon boat for a few hours too. We packed a lunch, brought blankets, beer and lots of sunscreen and hats! Even though it was a bit chilly we were prepared so it was awesome!",Kelly Peyton
50,Trip down memory lane,"I absolutely love this place. Took my fianc√©e here for his first time. I remembered the carousel and the games area...great to occupy kids (or grown ups) for a little while.The Hat Shop where you can find just about any kind of hat imaginable from a 1920 cloche hat, cowboy hat to a modern day fascinator (or something that might be worn at the Royal Ascot). We tried on lots of hats thankfully I didn‚Äôt end up with one... this time. üòä They have them in various sizes so it‚Äôs great for all ages.And not to be forgotten my all time favorite...THE HOT SAUCE SHOP! Drool! For lovers of chili peppers and all things spicy...this is your new haven! They stock everything from ghost pepper hot sauce, jalape√±o jelly (or jam as my fianc√©e says) to spicy jelly beans! The woman working that day said she was relatively new which was surprising as she knew everything about all their products! She was really kind and gave us some cooking tips on what might pair well and how to turn the heat down a bit but keep the gorgeous flavors. Ended up with a three pack of the locally made Hot Licks sauce.Nice place for a walk around and a relaxing day. There are a few different bars and restaurants if you wanted and a candy store as well as the famous candy and Carmel Apple store when you‚Äôre ready for dessert. Not sure how long the kids would last if it was an all day thing. Especially after a Carmel Apple. üòú but there is a walking path nearby and some park benches along the way and someGrass patches. You could always post yourself there on the grass with a picnic.",Jade A

There is one good restaurant The Yard House and others that some people like. Another plus is you are near the discount Pike outlets which is small but has good stores like H&M, Nike, Forever 21.

20,Meh. There are better choices for seaside dining and shopping,"A few pretty views, but the shopping and dining were disappointing. Couldn‚Äôt find much re good selections for dining (especially if you are vegetarian/vegan), and the shops seemed like mostly tourist traps. It was ridiculously hot the day we were there, and the lack of usual cool sea breeze may have negatively affected my mood and perceptions that day. The friends who took us there like this place, and another friend used to live in the condos here and liked it. To each his own, I guess.",Dreamer1999

30,"A Bit Dated... Not Amazing, but fine for a Tourist Minute.","It's a aging tourist stop with a bunch of mediocre restaurants... a small arcade with an indoor Ferris wheel... a handful of completely random shops from an event/ticket sales shop to a comic book store and places with trinkets and funnel cake.It's fine to have a drink and watch cover bands play through pretty low quality and somewhat loud sound systems.The boat rental is actually pretty great and probably the most worthwhile thing to do in the area, aside from walking down to the aquarium.The best thing to do to get a sense of how strangely pretty the harbor actually is, is... walk out of the parking lot towards the ocean... not the small harbor enclosed within Shoreline, but the open ocean harbor towards the Queen Mary.There is a beautiful green grass walking path that takes you out along the bay with small piers and benches, and an exercise path for jogging and bikes.It's actually really pretty once you get out on the water.",Let's Make Life Good

Our boat was a nice little in-board with a sun shelter and comfortable seats. Once out on the open water, we had a nice breeze and calm water. We were out on the water for about an hour.

40,Make your own tourist attraction !,"What is a tourist attraction? From those I've been to it can be almost anything. The growing trend seems to be build some shops and call them an attraction. To me Shoreline village at Long-beach falls into that class.The climates good and the water has led to a large port. There are also oil wells and good beaches in the area. How then do you make it into a tourist attraction?First of all you hide the oil wells by creating islands covered in trees on them then you build a marina for small boats. The kind of boats that cost as much as the houses your expected tourist live in. That will start to bring the tourists in.They will need places to eat. Only one or two of them need to serve good food the others can serve all types of ethnic fast food. Some tourists will need to buy items bearing the name of your tourist attraction so build shops to sell pens,balls,shirts,hats and whatever you can think of for them to spend their money on. Add a couple of expensive jewellery and cloths shops and there you have your very own tourist attraction. A bit brash but enjoyable.",Manchester11

The small boats looked well equipped with good sized outboard motors. It seemed like a unique way to just have some fun for the afternoon.While walking around you have the great views of all the moored sailboats and cruisers.Across the street is Pike Outlets and the Edward Cinema.

Lots of parking nearby. Things stayed open until about 6pm - 9pm depending on the type of business. I highly recommend the whale watching boat tour! I will review that next. It was wonderful and we did see gray whales, sea lions and dolphins, plus we learned about the gray whale and Long Beach history! Very interesting. There are public restrooms in the village near the boat docks but they are minimal. This used to be the naval harbor but it has been moved north and this very pleasant village was created.",Heidi g

50,Something for Everyone at Shoreline Village,"I have been visiting here for many years, way before the cruise ships started coming in to berth and Shoreline Village has just gotten better over the years. There really is something for everybody here. The arcade has been very popular over the years with the kids who are now young adults and still go there to play games. Love the Yard House restaurant and Tequila Jacks for Mexican food. Both have outdoor patio's facing the marina that can't be missed. For fish, Parkers Lighthouse is delicious and for steaks, upstairs is Queensview which is very nice and offers spectacular views. Love the Village Hat shop! It is huge and has a big variety of hats. I shop at Saga and love their fashions. I ride my bike here with friends to have lunch and look at downtown Long Beach. A weekend stay can be booked on one of the boats berthed in the Harbour here through Dockside Boat & Bed. Don't agree with ""limited appeal"" as I think there is a lot of fun things to do here and to enjoy!",Beth C

50,Hard to say enough about Shoreline Village and the general Long Beach Area,"As a part time resident, I admit to being biased about the general Long Beach area, but if you love the ocean and breathtaking scenery, plentiful, top-notch restaurants, exciting attractions, beautiful old homes, strolls through lovely uptown areas (Bixby Knolls and Belmont Shore) and have a day, week or month to relax and enjoy, you can be a lavish spender or budget wise and still have a great time. The views of the peninsula, the port and the city from the upper deck of the Queen Mary are nothing short of MAHVELOUS, and there are several ways to go aboard other craft to see the port, the commercial cargo loading activities, and even Santa Catalina Island. The Aquarium is worth a day in itself and the Convention Center has a variety shows and exhibits. There are several beaches along the ocean or inland waterways and because of the breakwater, the ocean (accessible from the Place streets east of the Villa Riviera) is a very safe place to let your kids entertain themselves in the water. A concrete path through the sand and along the ocean is popular with walkers, joggers, bicyclers and skateboarders and extends for a couple miles. You can use the quaint Shoreline Village and nearby hotels as the hub for your adventures BTW, you'll find local folks to be very friendly and full of tips about having your best time in Long Beach.",TraveLee073

30,Dinner and a walk,"Went to Gladstones with granddaughter then walked over to Shoreline Village. It's an ok place to walk around with some restaurants such as Parkers Lighthouse, Yardhouse and a few smaller ones. They have an ice cream store and a few souvenir type shops along with a fun hat store. There are places to sit and enjoy the view and people watch. It's close to Long Beach Aquarium as well. Could be fixed up a bit but a nice little outing and good place to watch the sunset.",packy2
40,Colorful area to enjoy a day,"This is one of the more picturesque ""shoreline"" shopping areas in CA.

If you're in Long Beach certainly pop by.",Hazeangel64
30,Vacation lady,Nice little area to putter in. Shopping and lunch at the lighthouse. Again the parking fees were ridiculous although they would validate for 2 free hours if you bought. After 2 hours they charge $2. Every twenty minutes! Not a lot of time for leisurely strolling. The hat shop is awesome. We found every kind of hat and the staff was very knowledgable. We were there to pick up some gifts but they don't make it easy to spend money when you are worried about parking.,Eric A

30,Shoreline Village,"Shoreline Village is in a beautiful location, but not conducive to a leisurely stroll since it has become so crowded.

50,Great views with many dining options!,My family was staying at a hotel at The Pike. Shoreline Village was an easy stroll away with lots of activities to take part in. We enjoyed the paths and boardwalk along the water. There were several restaurants and souvenir shops as well as opportunities to take a boat excursion. Also fun to walk up to the lighthouse and read all of the historical information about the area.,CraftyChick063
30,A good place for tourist,Shoreline Village is really not my thing. It's kind of stuck in the 90''s. The food is average. A majority of the places need a face lift. If your a local I would recommend going to 4th St. or 2nd St. Seem like Shoreline is mainly visited by tourist.,SteveFawley

While I did not go in any of the shops, I did visit 2 of the restaurants and I did enjoy the walk around the marina. Great setting.

20,Seaport Village it's not.,"If you've been to San Diego's Seaport Village, this is a poor substitute. It is a much smaller group of restaurants and shops -- mostly low end (i.e. inexpensive).We did eat at a nice seafood restaurant that was much more upscale than most of the other restaurants. (I can't remember it's name but it has indoor and outdoor seating and good views of the water and the Queen Mary.)There were no performers or attempts at entertainment as there are at Seaport Village.",LuckyGuyC

It is not what we call a great place to spend an entire day but it is nice to walk & check out some specialty shops, extend down to the lighthouse, & down to the point to checkout boats in the marina. You have to enjoy walking/strolling. In the evening, it is a nice dating spot. We like the fact that it is more than a touristy spot, It is where to enjoy the sunset and people watching.",seekers38

It is a little more dressy at night.The Yard House has excellent food and service also, plus, you can sit outside which is always enjoyable!After your meal, you can walk through the shops....and there are some unique ones which makes it interesting.

I loved walking around seeing all the boats in their slips and the weather was gorgeous but the ""village"" was just ok.BEWARE we parked in the lot thinking it was $2 for two hours. When we left they charged $8! I asked why and they said the $2 rate is only if you got validated by one of the restaurants. I'm sure it said that somewhere on the sign I just didn't see that.

We loved the feeling and overall it was a good family venue with room for the adult crowds to have their fun as well. Our only complaint was while in one of the shops buying churros, there was loud, vulgar music over the PA and no one seemed to bat an eye over it. I am all for following your own taste, but when the F bomb is being screamed repeatedly in an establishment that families are visiting, I think management needs to re-evaluate. Overall the Village is a great place to be.",Heather W

Offering a little more than your standard T-shirts and souvenir cups, including gourmet jerky, candy and other local specialties.

Don't expect high-end shopping experience here, though pleasant and clean, it is a wonderful way to see the city of Long Beach as well as the Queen Mary in the distance. Especially attractive at night, with the harbor lights glowing the two dollar parking with any purchase validation makes it worth it!",LlittleEddie

40,"Old memories, and a cool little stroll","Ok, so I said old memories because I have been coming here since I was a kid, no, a baby. Fortunately and unfortunately this place has not changed. Good if you like seeing the same familiar shops, and bad if you like to see new shops. First time visitors will likely enjoy it. It's a good place to take a stroll with family or a loved one. Grab a candy apple from the chocolate shop, support the mom and pop shops by buying a unique gift, take a ride on the carousel, grab a beer on the patio of The Yardhouse, and make friends with the seagulls. Just good clean fun in Long Beach.",Ivan M

It has a boardwalk theme with the bridge lit up with lights, as if it were a rollercoaster, and a Farris wheel. There were quite a few unique shops on the strip. We would definitely recommend checking it out.",Scrappypower1
40,Hanging out on the Pier!,Shoreline Village is one of the best pier experiences I have had in the USA. It has some very good restaurants: Parker's Lighthouse is the best!

Big parking lot or use the City ""Passport"" bus to get around a designated route with many hop and stops. Great evening destination for a drink and sunset over the Marina. Brightly colored shops...great for visitors and locals alike. Recommend Tequila Jacks, Yard House...down the way is a PF Changs, Outback Steakhouse, Bubba Gumps...and many more. You can also check out the unique Boat and Breakfast boats (located in front of PF Changs) that you can stay overnight in...never leaving the dockside. Really fun!",Dayz3

40,Cute marina village,"It's a nice walk to Shoreline Village or there is a Passport bus stop right in front. There is also paid parking spots. Cute little village with quaint stores, restaurants and snacks. There is an area where you can rent bicycles and also a games arcade. The boardwalk area has plenty of seating to enjoy a coffee or ice cream and admire the docked boats. We first went there on a weekday which was enjoyable. We went back on a Saturday to bring the kids and it was definitely much busier. Nice place to get a bite to eat.",DinaMBS
30,Nice but brief,"I grew up with the Atlantic City boardwalk as essentially my backyard. So, when comparing boardwalks, that tends to be used as my standard bearer.The Shoreline Village, from what I read, is a boardwalk. I was a bit disappointed. It's really just a small strip of I would say 1200 feet on each side. The shops are nice and do the job of getting a California summery feel. But, there really isn't much to do except take pictures of the nearby boats, some places to eat, and shops to buy. There is a bike rental place located in the premise as well.Although I stayed about 60 minutes meandering around and people watching, if you're looking to walk, it will only take you maybe 20 minutes max around the entire village area.It is a cute place to take a break but I wouldn't be begging to come back. It's one of those places where if you walked by it you'd pop your head in but wouldn't stay long.It's safe and connects to the beach and Ocean Boulevard. An easy wall with family and kids.",Don M
50,A must see!,come take a stroll through here... grab a bite to eat... walk through the piers and towards aquariam... walk towards lighthouse and take a rest under a shady tree while looking across the water at the Queen Mary.,mizeryztool
40,Nice place to hang around!,A very good place to hang around. There are a bunch of restaurants next to the sea and the views are very pretty.

If you can't bear to tear yourself away from all the quaint shops, there are a variety of restaurants for even the most selective palates.The views are quite lovely with the boats, water, boardwalk and lighthouse in the distance.

40,Great place to browse and people watch,"this is a quaint little place to walk around and see some unique shops, several restaruants and bars to chose from along with several places to find a treat. We went on a weekday and it was quiet and peaceful. you have great views of the Queen Mary and can take a stroll along several paved paths along the beach or the bay and look at all the boats docked in the harbor. we had fun reading the different names on them. parking was easy and for our stay of a few hours cost us $10.00. there may have been places farther away to park but we were not familiar with the area. we took a short walk up a spiral staircase out doors which had great views and we even spotted rays in the water below. walking over the street to come to the Long Beach Convention center and a comedy club and The Pike shopping center which appears to mostly be under construction. there was also a ferris wheel across the street and gondola rides at the hotel nearby. you can rent bikes and that would have been a good option. we were a bit limited on our time that day. when we left we took a short drive to long beach and parked in metered parking and relaxed. very nice place",Nancy O
50,"Great spot to hang, visit and eat","If you are in the area, Shoreline Village is the place to go. there are plenty of shops to browse, and great places to eat, of all sorts. If it's lunch, dinner or desert, there is something for everyone, and fun too. In the summertime, there is also live entertainment. the other day they had a 3 chick band. They were awesome. We ate in Tequila Jacks, for killer mexican food. My friend kept raving over his shrimp cooked mexican style. We later had ice cream and frozen yogurt, then back to the Queen Mary via our $1.00 boat shuttle. Came in the the village, on the free bus shuttle from the QM",taminica
40,Touristy but Nice,"Extremely crowded on a summer weekend. Rental bike riders should not attempt this boardwalk, especially with children riders--it was just too crowded and I heard too many parents yelling at their kids to ""watch out"" and ""look where you're going."" It was just too crowded for inexperienced riders and even for experienced. They have normal width boardwalks that are packed shoulder-to-shoulder. I didn't even make it through the crowd into a store or restaurant but it is very touristy so if that's what you're looking for, it's great!",AzBkey
50,Fun place to visit,"Lots of cute shops, restaurants, beachfront location. Can stroll leisurely, rent bikes or Segways, go on the Carousel, get an ice cream and listen to great music played live on the boardwalk.",DJL21
30,"Cute Village, but lacking good stores","We went to this village to shop, and found good restaurants, but lacked good stores to shop in. Some were just too pricey for the merchandise they had, others, just had boring items. Almost zero fun clothing items.. my teen girls were hoping to buy a few cute shirts with California flair‚Ä¶ and found one store with very high prices, and another with very strange apparel.. so the choices were very limited. A bit of a disappointment for all of us. And on a final note.. there was a charge for parking in the mall lot.. :(",Shannon411
30,Cute area with good restaurants,Loved the bright colors of the buildings and the nice selection of restaurants. Great place to get an ice cream and walk from shop to shop exploring the goodies to be purchased.,Lazrlady
40,still has the old charm but with more modern restaurants,At first I was disappointed that there was a Yardhouse chain restaurant located here but then it seemed to fit. The old carousel is still there and operational which was nice. This used to be a quaint little seaside area and it still retains some of that appeal. It is a very good location for watching small boats and the harbor.,Littlegto67
50,Beautiful Waterfront Location,"Looking for something to do on a beautiful sunny day? Check out Shoreline Village for a beautiful walk, a nice lunch at the Yardhouse, Tequila Jacks, or Parker's Lighthouse, and enjoy the gorgeous view. You can view the Queen Mary from here, or walk over to the rest of the restaurants located on the beautiful Long Beach Waterfront. And during the summer, take a ride on the Aqualink. For us locals, it's a great way to feel like we've been away without leaving home. There is a fee for parking but many shops and restaurants will validate.",ljinbs
50,Summertime fun,It was very enjoyable spending the day at SHORELINE Village....especially since we took the FREE Long Beach shuttle. We didn't need to move our car from the Queen Mary's parking lot. It was very convenient to enjoy our day. We enjoyed our lunch at Tequila Jack's. Lunch was so fun from the outside pier.,gone2teatyme
50,Beautiful setting for a visit,"Visit Shoreline Village just because it is such a lovely setting on the harbor. The colorful buildings mimic a New England fishing village. It's such a fun setting. It has the normal array of touristy shops and food places. The Mexican restaurant Tequilla Jack's had a huge waiting list on a Friday Night. Shoreline Village has an indoor carousel surrounded by fun amusement games. Obviously, this is not the most important tourist destination in Long Beach. It's just simple fun.",Jackbear
50,Super Fantastic Village,"Super boats and Fantastic food throughout the Shoreline Village. Shopping for the entire family. Also, boats and romantic water front view. It's a summer time full of fun and adventure",CQ S

I relaxed here after a seminar day and really liked it. Charged my plug in electric car in the parking lot at the same time.,Skinmeister
40,Shoreline Village - Touristy Time Killer. Worth Taking A Stroll.,"Shoreline Village is an attractive shopping center located along the pier in Long Beach. If you are grabbing dinner, you can get your parking validated and pay one dollar rather than the eight dollars it would otherwise cost to park while you are eating.I strolled along the shops, finding them to be a typical assortment of specialty clothing, food and restaurants. The restaurants are primarily chain restaurants, although there are a few originals in the mix.This is more of a time-killer than a destination. It is a good place to grab a meal if you are downtown and hungry. The shops are a bit pricey, but it is a fun place to hang out. There was a live blues band playing during my visit. I popped in and listened for a little while.",John S

40,Great Food and Great Souvenits (at Pirates Cove),"The packed Yard House, Tequila Jack's, music venue Shenanigan's, classy Parker's Light House and newcomer Louisiana Charlie's - all have great food and service; pricing is comparable to other restaurants throughout the city...They schedule open door free concerts on the wooden boardwalk concerts during summer. Kids LOVE the ice cream, fudge, funnel cakes, etc. located near the Public Bathrooms They have an arcade (Parents, watch for violent video games).The BEST souvenirs in Long Beach are located inside Pirates Cove..You can pay for a boat excursion and walk beyond the ""spaceship"" stairwell I call it (hold your nose!) to get to the Pike. (Up the stairs is the Convention Center) and walkway parallel with Pine Ave that will get you to Ocean Boulevard.There is a new art/music/poetry venue located just above the Irish place (Shenanigan's, yellow building) before you reach Parker's called CALB - Cultural Alliance - They also validate parking.Of course there is room for improvement in the parking arena - just plan on spending $8 tops and remember to get validation wherever you go. ($1 for 2 hours but if you are 3 minutes over the stamped time, you will be firmly charged a total of $3).",theprimespotcom

We walked around the shops that are very touristy - alot of junk in my opinion. There was an ice cream store and restaurants (we didn't eat there). It was ok for about an hour. I wouldn't bother going back in the evening. Maybe during the day when you can enjoy the views.,lisa9962

The restaurants can have a long wait at peak times of the day. Many places to sit and rest, little single-person rides for the toddlers, bicycle rentals, lots of parking - if you eat at a restaurant, they will validate your parking.",lhwashere
30,Average Tourist Attraction,"I venture that the reason this is the #1 Shopping attraction in Long Beach is because it is in fact the only Shopping area being that ""The Pike"" is basically a ghost town. Shoreline Village has a few shops, a carousel with arcade, a bicycle rental shop and a couple of restaurants. It has all the qualities of an average tourist attraction. Parking will cost you about $8.",TheTravelingKitchen
40,A few quick hours,"I brought my kids to Long Beach and spent a few short hours. We had lunch, rose the Ferris wheel, rented bikes & rode along the beach, and went shopping at their very few stores. We didn't need to invest an entire day unless we had gone whale watching. It was not the best time but we made the most out of our stay.",agapilexi
20,Quaint,Quaint little area with a few restaurants and a few shops. We stayed two hours (including 30 minutes watching a sea lion on the docks of the marina here) and paid $8 for parking. There was an arcade for the kids as well.,TheodensQueen

40,"Iconic, but touristy, Shopping Village in Long Beach",Shoreline Village has been in Long Beach for decades. Its somewhat touristy with some good restaurants. There is also a good ice cream store to go to. Its an iconic type place to stop at if visiting Long Beach so I usually include a visit when in the area.,mini
30,"Good for food, sighseeing and picnic, watch out hungry birds","I go shoreline village very often, mostly for food. Parking by the restaurants is reasonable priced if you can get validation from one of the restaurants or vendors. There are good restaurants you can get food: American, Mexican, Middle-Eastern, ice-cream, tea/coffee. There is also a small funfair room inside. I also really enjoy walking on the boardwalk where several ships offer ocean tour or whale-watching. At night, view of lighthouse is amazing, it changes color every 10 minutes. You can also see Queen Mary ship, especially from the tip where Lighthouse restaurant is. Recently, I had picnic experience by the light house. Lighthouse parking was little pricy, paid $4.50 for 2 hours. They have limited picnic tables around the lighthouse, somehow some of the was ponded with water, and some of the were invaded by birds. Rest was already taken so we had picnic on the green part. It took 10 minutes for birds to smell food and invade our side. So we finished quickly. We also walked around the lighthouse, which has amazing view. There were two bathrooms, they were lack of soup and toilet paper. Overall, great view, watch for birds if you are having food, bring your own toilet-paper and soup.",Mert51
50,Wonderful!,"Shoreline village is a must stop in the Long Beach area. As a child, I went here often, visiting the hat store, the kite store and the merry-go-round. Now, as an adult, I find new things to see, browsing the shops, looking at the ocean views and meandering along the boardwalks to various eateries. The parking does have a fee, but its minimal for a day of old Long Beach!",Shannon G
40,"So pretty at night, with all the lights...","I was at the Hyatt Regency for Ed Parker Jr.'s Martial Arts Hall of Fame Master's Ceremony. I was with a world-renown martial artist, and as he was leaving, we walked outside and I saw this place across from the hotel. I went on and on about how ""cool"" it was and started walking aimlessly towards the lights, as if mesmerized. He immediately told me to get back inside the building, as he felt my being out there was ""dangerous"". He added ""This is LA!!!"". Yes, even if you're with a world champion martial artist, it's not a good idea to go here late at night. See it during the daytime.",dbrgdmn
40,What a great place,"This was our second visit here we had been a number of years before.It is really good either during the day or at night.There is lots to see and do great places to eat, drink or snack. Often there is entertainment on and it great to be at the water with plenty so seats for a rest.",DrinaG
40,Lots of variety at the Shoreline,"The Shoreline has a good number of food and beverage outlets - mostly pub style - but good servings t the right price, We saw these as an alternative to Hotel and Restaurant eating. The atmosphere is more relaxing and if you are into sports - TV screen everywhere with every imaginable game being screened. Not loud or distracting as the view of the bay soaks up any stress you may have. Plenty of gifts and souvenirs as well. There is a free bus that does the round trip of downtown and the village.",Neil1941

40,The Purple House,"Wonderful shopping experience in a village shop I believe was called the Purple House.

50,Night time,"We were spending the night on a yacht and didnt know about this place.. its so fun! Walk around the shops, grab a coffee or go out for dinner. The shops are so cute and just having a nice surrounding by the water was beautiful.Both day and night is wonderful.. you can see queen mary across the water and you can also walk to the light house. Looks like a lot of people also use the area for exercise, running, bike riding ..its well lit and a lot of people so I think its safe at night.I would like to come back again and walk around more.. enjoy the view.",Shirin T

40,Food options are to perfection the view from every restaurant is excellent,Shoreline village is a peaceful oppurtunity for good seafood and wont kill your pocketbook. I personally love the yardhouse which is huge with good drinks and the food is very good also tequilla jacks is very good restaurant but not if youre craving seafood,robbase75
50,Great shopping and views!,"We went a little late in the day to see the lighthouse, but we went for the shopping and it was a great value for the stuff we got. There are a lot of your average touristy stuff, but if you're on vacation it's neat to look around. My favorites were the purple store and the pirate theme store. Also, the harbor is really pretty at night from there.",minimacaz
50,The Blue Line to Shoreline,"Shoreline is a great destination for a quick day trip. It's a typical tourist ""seaport village"" with its shops and restaurants but a bit more polished. Views are great, good restaurants and friendly people. If your a bit more adventurist take the Blue Line train which leaves from downtown LA. It drops you off a couple blocks from the village then just head down Pine St.",Michael G
50,Shore Line Village,"I spend a lot of time on the water. We have two boats and as if that is not enough, I belong to Marina Sailing (so I can get my regular sailing fix). Marina Sailing is just one of several very cool attractions in Shore Line Village. This place is a bit touristy. It has the usual nick-nack shops and delicous junk food, there is an arcade and a bike rental, and there are several good restaurants. My favorite restaurant is Parker's Light House which provides a great 360 view of the area and has great food. The Aquarium of the Pacific is close, as is Pine Street, Sport Fishing Charters, and harbor tours by boat. I will often ride my bike from east Long Beach (or take my boat to the free public dock) to visit friends at Shore Line, people watch, get a bite to eat. Parking can be tight on the weekends, but it is definitely worth the effort.",Eric_Jacobs
40,Great place to take the grand kids,"The small indoor amusement park which includes a merry- go- round, makes this a good stop when traveling with young children. The bathrooms are a bit of a distance from the play center and I can see how this would pose a problem for parents of toddlers. Our granddaughter loved posing in the cut-outs in front of The Pirates Cove. We did not see much else.",Angel1217
50,Good For All,"I have lived in this general area most of my life and have seen this place has changed dramatically. Shoreline Village has numerous restaurants and attractions for all. There are plenty of places for couples, families, friends and for business meetings. There is plenty of things to do on both sides of Shoreline Dr.",Richard R
50,Nice place for strolling and eating,"I live here and have been to shoreline more times than I can count. Both for events and also just to stroll and get a bite to eat. A nice selection of restaraunts and a few shops. The shops remind me of amusement type shops, but they're fun. The scenery is gorgeous.",speck103
40,Serenity,If you want a peaceful place to visit and take a walk Shoreline Village is the place. Village is not that big but worthwhile. It is a must to take a picture of the village but you have to be further away. Neighboring place is the famous Aquarium of the Pacific and further down is Queen Mary. There is a fee for parking inside Shoreline Village. If walking a bit is not a problem you could find free parking further down the Village.,SCT0356
50,Shoreline Village,"Beautiful place to go for a walk and eat. We're locals and when we're out on our boat, we dock at Shoreline Village and eat at the restaurants there. It's very pretty and fun and the food is good and reasonably priced.",Pam C
50,Beautiful scenery,"The Shoreline is great for any age weather your sight seeing, cycling, eating at a restaurant, or heading to Catalina Island there is always something to do.

20,Overpriced,"This is a cute little village at the end of Long Beach boardwalk. The place has some chain restaurants that are always packed and some local sweets' shops which are really not worth visiting. We tried ice cream and funnel cake places, waited in lines for 15-20 minutes to get beyond dissapointed. Shoreline village is nice to walk around in the morning when it's not busy but has nothing else to offer.",ninamelie07
50,Beautiful,"Awesome place to go for a walk. Places to eat, shop, rent bikes, people watch. You can see the Queen Mary from there. And the Light House. If you purchase something there they will validate your parking slip. We went there walked around, ate a picnic lunch.",Garageninja1

This is not good for the businesses.",norcalhummingbirds
50,Fun Village by the sea,"Shoreline vilalge can be a little crowded in the summer but the ocean air and abundance of bars, shops and restaurants can keep you busy.

40,Pure relaxation,"What a fun place to visit. Variety of restaurants, unique shops and entertainment. Great view of Queen Mary. I really enjoy the pleasant atmosphere there. My favorite restaurant is Parkers' Light House. I always like to sit outside and look at the ocean, boats, and of course, Quin Mary, I also like to watch pelicans diving for fish. Their menu is very good, a lot of variety. Great salads, and clam chowder soup is very tasty. The stuff is very friendly. Shoreline is a great place for families to enjoy their vacation in South California.",Mila K

40,Something For Everyone,"There's shopping, eating, exploring, sightseeing and photo ops at Shoreline Villiage. Been here a few times both with just the Ol' Man and also with the whole fam. Plenty of chain restaurants with a few smaller shops sprinkled in. It's all reletively new commercial development that's been built in he last ten years so don't expect much great historical beauty, but if you want a nice place to have dinner and take pics with family or guests, it's a nice place to visit.",LovesOfJuneBug
40,An afternoon's outing,There is a few quaint looking shops around the marina and a few eating places. We came here 4 years ago and came back just because of 'The Village Hat Shop'. It is worth a visit if you like hats. There is a fantastic selection of gents and ladies headgear. Casual/dressy - they have it! The other place we visited was the Parker's Lighthouse for a yummy lunch. You could spend ages here watching the marina and the visitors and enjoying the sunshine.,Nette_11
50,one of my favorite places to be,Love the Pirate Cove shop and miss several of the shops and cafes that were once here.

20,"Eat, don't shop!","Only a few shops, definitely not geared toward 20-30 age range. Nice view of harbor, peaceful and quiet on a Sunday afternoon. Will not come back even to kill some time shopping. Eat at Yard House then leave!",TwinBkp
30,Expected More,"O.K. for a place to walk around when you find yourself with a little time on your hands. A few restuarants and a few shops, but not really as many as we were expecting. I would return for the restuarants (Tequila Jacks was very good), but not for the shopping, it left a lot to be desired.",Ttoopel
30,"""Ok"" But Needs More Public Dock Space","We've been to Shoreline Village on our boat a number of times as a place to take guests for a little cruise and a bite to eat. There are a good number of restaurants to choose from and so far have had good service at all of them (Yard House, Tequila Jacks, and an Irish place). The shops are touristy and a little on the weak side, but there's an awesome hat shop with all kinds of good everyday hats (from caps to fedoras) and then funky comical hats. The only bad thing is right now the whole public dock outside of Peter's Landing is out of commission, so the only public docks are back in the marina area against the sea wall and there's really only 3 to 4 spaces, depending on the size of the boats already docked there. It's tight maneuvering there and if there's no space you can't tell until you are already wedged back there and then have to maneuver your way back out. There's all kinds of areas that are empty that says ""No Public Docking"", seems like the City should make some more space temporarily available until the other dock is repaired.",AlohaShan
20,Parking Ripoff,Visited Shoreline Village at 6pm on New Years Eve to stroll through the shops with family from out of town. We were charged $10 to park our car. When we got into the little mall of shops we found 8/10 of the shops closed and then the maintenance person lock us in the inside of the strip mall. Apparently they gave the shop owners permission to close their shops at 6pm but did not bother to tell the people they were charging to park this information (normally the shops close at 9pm). I was directed to the director of Shoreline Village to talk about why they were charging to park at a shopping area where the shops were closed and was pretty much blown off. Wont be brining my family or friends down there anymore. Very disappointed.,astainbr
40,Long Beach did it right with this place.,"Practically Perfect. The long smooth walk ways views and plenty of food choices made this place so enjoyable. The restaurants however were only average; either chains or expensive for the quality. On a warm, clear, smog-free day, this is a real treat to stroll with the family or just relax and enjoy the water all around.Long Beach has come quite a ways from its look and feel from the '70s.

Prices in the shops seem much less expensive than other tourist areas. A really cute beaded necklace for $3.50!!! Darn, wish I'd bought more. Easy walk ability, but the free Red buses make a continuous loop should you wish to ride back to your hotel or head downtown.

Would return here without a doubt.,kelly m
30,Cute/small place to visit,"its pretty small, and not really too much to do other than go to the small arcade. Its still picturesque and a nice place to visit especially if you're a tourist.

30,Mostly food,"Very typical of other shoreline villages along the California coast, but pleasant walk from the Aquarium of the Pacific on one end to Parker's Lighthouse on the other. It's similar to the shoreline village in San Diego, but not as interesting and with fewer shops to browse. We've been to several of these developments and they seem somewhat familiar yet tired: San Diego, Dana Point, Monterey and Marina Del Rey (although Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey is a a true wharf). Curiously, Monterey and Long Beach both have ""melodrama"" theaters, which apparently are part of a national group. We didn't pay for parking; there's plenty just offsite and you can walk. It's also across from the Rainbow Lagoon, which in itself is a nice visit.",Blahblahb

50,A nice start to the day,My likes: the beef jerky shop had a bunch of different flavors of jerky. We finally got a chance to taste buffalo jerky..so good! and the salt water taffy from the Rocky Mtn. chocolate factory was a perfect sweet treat. We had fun at the Hat store and bought a lot of cool pirate stuff from Pirate store. The clerks were super friendly.My dislikes: the clerk at the store right between the chocolate shop and the beef jerky shop was RUDE..RUDE...RUDE!!! she acted as if she had a personal relationship with all of her merchandise. She is obviously is not hurting for business. she reminded me of the witch from Hansel and Gretel because she had a barking toy dog in the front of her store but she scowled at the kids that came by to see it....My tip: park in the shoreline village parking lot so that you can get your parking validated.

10,"This place has potential, but The Management of it is clueless!","This place has potential to be a cool spot, but as many others has stated, the parking is a rip off, especially if you have a meal or drinks etc down there, your parking should be covered or no more than 2 bucks!We and our friends like to hear and dance to good live music etc, so we were excited about the Shoreline Village Summer concerts, but they do not post on schedule what type of music or genre it is, some can be quite boring, we wished they would have more good live dance music etc, like Latin, reggae or Top 40 etc,so to know what type of music is playing, would be good to know on schedule. Also In the evenings it gets pretty cold and chilly down there, especially for the women, wish they would add at least a few outdoor heaters etc.A friend of mine, emailed Shoreline V. managemnt email contact a couple of times re: these great improvements needed. He said The Clueless Managemnt did not even bother to respond or anything, showing they do not even care, so we will take our business elsewhere, until they make some improvements at least, currently , this place just not worth the hassle.",Coolvibe

30,A pleasant walk but..,mostly a bunch of tourist-junk shops. There's a restaurant out at the far end: we asked to see a menu in mid-afternoon but no-one ever returned to show us one so didn't consider it for dinner. Probably good for a family walk with kids except you can't go anywhere else once you are out there (except for an even longer walk at the marina areea) so plan accordingly on a full long round-trip.,andrew02459

There are plenty of restaurants (many with outdoor seating), and small (and unique!) shops. There is also an arcade with a carousel. You can rent bikes (or surreys for something different). But if you are looking for really unique entertainment be sure to check out the All American Melodrama Theater. They usually have shows Friday through Sunday and they are a blast. Very family-friendly and lots of laughs. Their shows are usually satires of popular TV shows or movies and there is lots of interaction with the audience.More entertainment, food and shops are walking distance at ""The Pike"".",familytravellers4
30,Reproduction of a New England Marina,"Fun, but overpriced shops and restaurants, exhorbitant (and inadequate) parking.

30,"Fake Indian Store, Nice Pirate store","I am attending a convention in Long Beach this week, at the convention center. I strolled down to Shoreline Village. I did not expect a New England style village in Southern Ca. I think they would have done much better if they had given it a Spanish flavor. I ate some Pizza, it was fine except the lady working there kept calling me, a 50 year old ....DEAR...she overdid it. I went into the Native American store and was turned off. It's mostly Chinese imports with just a few Native things. The women working there were not very friendly, especially the younger one. The one with her hair in a bun was fairly nice. The prices on this junk were outragous too. I did like the Pirate store although it was a bit overpowering with SO MUCH there. Anyway, I won't ever go back to the Raindance Fake Indian store but I will go get a Pizza down the street. Loved the Rocky Mtn Chocolate place and the little shop next door. Great buys on Mexican Blankets.",Conventioneer89
40,"Your basic tourist shopping village, plus a fun arcade","I live in Florida and travel near water a lot, so Shoreline Village is a pretty typcial place for me to visit. The shops have a little more personality than the average junky toursit shops ... the hat shop and clothing stores were nicer than average. There were also watersport rentals, boat rentals and bicycle rentals for the shoreline bike path.There is a great variety of restaurants to choose from, for meals or for just sitting outside and having a drink with a nice view of Long Beach.The most unique feature is the arcade. It contains the usual kids electronics, skee ball, etc., but it is bright and airy, not too loud, and has a really cool merry-go-round in the middle. It reminds me of the old shorefront arcades from when I was a kids in the 70's ... it's not like the dark, tunnel-like mall arcades of today.",kleetampa
50,Great finds at Shoreline village waterfront,"I did not know what to expect here but there are a mix of locals and tourists mingling here. Boats are docked here and there's some good restaurants, such as Parker's lighthouse and Tequlia jacks for mexican. These restaurants have indoor and outdoor seatings and heat lamps when the sun goes down. The Rocky Mountain chocolate factory is very dangerous because of all the chocolates and sweets that they sell. Stefanos pizza is good for slices and a quick bite. Saga clothing has good quality clothes for reasonable prices. I was told the water ferry only runs during the summer. Gets very crowded on Friday and saturday nights. Carousels and bike rentals for families to enjoy, reasonable fees.",LBConcierge
40,"Shopping, Food, and Arcades","If you are looking for a Long Beach souvenir, Shoreline Village is the place to go. There are many shops with different kinds of souvenirs. If you are like my boyfriend, you will love the pirate gift shop (though most of the items in that store didn't say Long Beach or California on them). There are many different items to choose from for food, and you can just sit and watch the Pacific Ocean as you eat. There was also an arcade, which had a regular-sized merry-go-round. It's a good place to go to spend some time shopping and eating, and playing games if you want.",pilotgirl21

Each time I enter, it is adorned with new items and packed with a wonderful and creative display of wonderful Native American art and jewelery. The employees are always pleasant and helpful; making anyone feel comfortable to browse around or to simply being educated on any of the unique artifacts one might be curious about. It is both a lovely experience of discovery, learning and shopping!",CitrusLover13
50,Raindance Native American Indian Festival - March 20,"I was thrilled to return to my roots as a youth, to smell the fragrance of ocean and to travel through the village where I spent so much time when I would go a shore as it were back in the lazy daze of youth. I found I was in for a treat when I happened upon a Native American Indian Festival - as many of my time I fell equally in love with the rhythm of the flute players, the dancers extravaganza in full garb dignified and regal. To think this was a free event was mind boggling as I would of paid to see well known actor and respected member of the Sak and Fox Nation, Saginaw Grant Dancer Rodney Howard for the Maricopa Nation of Arizona, Elaine Meyers from the Pima Nation who performed various traditional dances. Plus many more performers and artists, arts andcrafts demonstration and traditional Navajo cooking.I was equally impressed by the ease it was to find parking , and the wonderful atmosphere which I enjoyed. The friendly environment of the people working in Raindance all so willing to answer all my questions and validated my parking ticket . A great place to take the family. Thank you Raindance for putting on such a memorable experience that was enchanting and took me back to the days I enjoyed not that long ago ! A MUST IF YOUR IN THE AREA.",Universallady
20,Get Parking Validation or You'll Be Screwed,"This is not a historic place as advertised. We found it schlock filled and overpriced. We ate at The Yard, which was fine. When we tried to leave, we produced the $100 receipt from the restaurant but the toll booth cashier would not accept anything but a validation of our parking ticket. She made a long line of cars BACK UP so we could go back to the Yard. Make sure you read the fine print when entering the parking lots- it is expensive to park here if you don't buy something and the stuff for sale is not stuff you want.",flies2vacay

It's clean, vibrant and has a nice array of specialty boutiques like the native american store raindance, perfect store for the location. Raindance is fun and interesting and the help was good and friendly (i read the previous review, i'm not sure what this was about). The mix of their product is appropriate for the location.The pirate store is also another interesting store, not exactly my type of shopping but it adds to the place and makes it fun and esoteric. Enjoy!",worldshopperBoston
50,"Great setting, nice restaurants, tourist prices.","Visit Long Beach from the UK several times a year, with a group of eighteen (I'm airline crew). We always eat and drink at Shoreline Village - it's a favourite. Have just had a weekend there with my wife, and had a very pleasant first evening watching the sunset from the Yard House patio. Spent the following day around the waterfront, with lunch at Parker's Lighthouse. Food and drink excellent in both, very friendly service despite it being very busy, and fun, quirky shops. Great view of Queen Mary.Clean, friendly, safe, with live entertainment on the Sunday - a great day out, and great 'people watching'. Ideal for kids of all ages, and lots of families having fun.Prices slightly higher than the norm, but it's a tourist attraction, so that's to be expected. Still good value and highly recommended.",Del747
50,A beautiful place,"(regarding post above) It is not dirty in any sense, and there is no obscene clothing... It was a great place to dine and admire the beautiful pacific ocean. There is a beautiful lighthouse with a great modern changing light display. I would see this as a great place to have dinner with the wife or on a date if you are single and dating.The service was great, and I had a great time admiring the atmosphere and wonderful people. My kids loved the arcade and all the candy/ ice cream stores. It is right next to the aquarium of the pacific (also a great pace). Great place! I will reccomend it to anyone.",joeyschmoey
20,A bit dirty,"The place was filthy - rubbish everywhere perhaps because of the wind. R-rated clothing stores that hang their wares outside of the shoppes. Not a place for the little ones however close they are to the arcade. My children had fun and gorged themselves on cotton candy and ice cream. The place is pricey and the restrooms are located opposite the ""fun zones"" on the other end of the Village which is a bit of a walk when you have 5 year olds begging to go potty. There is delightful place to buy shave ice (rare on the mainland) and wicked pirate shoppe. I recommend Springbok's grill for ono grub. Parking is steep - bring cash.",SydneySalai
50,Great time walking along here during sun set!,"This place really is a tourist trap, but i had a great time walking around people watching at sun set. Wound up under the lighthouse when darkness set in. Nice time was had, would like to take one of the boat tours next time out!G Man",GMan5431
