40,Love the space,"We attended a play reading at the gallery. We had been there before in the upstairs theater but this time we were in the downstairs space. It was a wonderful place to showcase rising artists. It felt like New York, walking through a neighborhood of shuttered for the night businesses to reach our the gallery. There were one or two restaurant/bars open which just added to the ambience. The big drawback is parking. We parked three long blocks away. But if it had been easier with parking int he back or valet, it wouldn't have been that same 'theater discovery' experience that is always so much fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaForster
30,Small gallery,"First floor is used to display art work/painting. It is considered a very small gallery. 2nd floor is The Road Theater. Very small theater about 50+ seats. Usually performing plays. Since it is a small theater, you can see the actors very up front.The Parking: Street parking (metered), tough to find a spot. No public parking structure nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
