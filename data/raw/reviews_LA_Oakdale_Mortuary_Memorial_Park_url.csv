30,Very friendly staff.,They were very nice and understanding at my Grandmother-in-law's service. The facilities are well kept. Flowers are available both outside the memorial park at a local flower shop as well as at the gift shop/office inside. Kids seem to like watching the geese and ducks near the fountain in the north-east corner of the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5150darrenh

50,Local Memorial Park,"Oakdale offers mortuary, chapel, cemetery services. The staff was personal, professional & caring, My first experience with planning upon the death of a parent, I came away feeling like my family had been given the best service after the staff listened to what we wanted. The cost was less they I had expected considering stories I have read about in the paper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glendoratraveller
