20,A ki of hype over very little,"Read about this Thursday evening farmer's market in old, downtown Lancaster so decided to check it out. Online says it is open from 3 till 7. Got there to find signs saying from 4 till 9...They close off to traffic a few blocks of the main street and there is plenty of room for stalls in the center of the boulevard where cars usually park. In season naybe irmt us lively. There was canned music and some leftover holiday lights but very few stalls. Some of the quaint little shops along the street were still open when we got there.All in all, a bit of a bummer and certainly a great disappointment for both the children and adults in our party.Went elsewhere in town to eat suoper.",bfindysz
40,Nice Farmers Market for a Nice Outing,"You can find everything you want at this Farmers Market, but you'll find most of what you came to get. There are a variety of vendors. I like the nuts, vegetables and honey vendors. There's also often live entertainment that makes it even more ""entertaining."" Don't park anywhere near the blocked off sections before they market begins or your car will be towed!",EllieRKay
