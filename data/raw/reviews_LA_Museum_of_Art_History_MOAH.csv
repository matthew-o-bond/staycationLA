50,The Elyze Clifford Interpretive Center,"MOAH has cooperated with this unique little gem of a museum to prepare a large educational display that explains the flora and fauna of the high desert woodland preserve in which it is located. Open only on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday it is worth making a point to visit.",bfindysz
50,What a nice surprise!,"We were in the Antelope Vally to see the poppies and googled things to do in the area. I love all things art and was pleasantly surprised by this museum. Friendly staff and really high quality art. The current exhibit is ""Peace on Earth"" and showcases artists' animal themed work. Plan to spend about an hour. It would be good to read up on a few artists before you go - can be found on the museum's website. Very interesting. Thank you MOAH staff!!",traveler21132655
40,Small but Interesting Exhibits,"While this museum is small, it is also free and has interesting changing exhibits. The one thing I thought was odd was how we were constantly watched by staff like we were going to touch or do something to the exhibits. That was a little irksome. We did enjoy it and paid the suggested donation fees for our family.",LeslieinTN
30,Unique Museum,Much of the artwork on display was of a very high technical standard. The exhibit on the history of Latino community in the LA county area was excellent. Excellent photography on show as well. I did avoid certain exhibits which had paintings that were visually disturbing to me.,NesbugTraveler
50,They get things right,"Outstanding staff- friendly, available, and not intrusive in any way. Helpful, too. The exhibits were very well done and explained enough to grasp without taking a long time to get through (for those who don't like to see lines and lines of print to read).In pulling up this page to write my review, I now regret that I didn't use the bathroom with the button to open the door nor go on the roof.Right in the middle of Lancaster's main street. I was told that it's right by Metrolink, so there's no excuse to avoid the trek if one is down in Los Angeles but uninterested in a long drive.",JJKFETP
40,Small but Worthwhile Art Museum,"We really enjoyed this small-ish museum. The exhibit that was on display was modern and entertained not only our sensibilities but our 9 year old's as well. You also can't beat the price (it's free! [donation suggested]). There is no permanent collection (on display anyway) so your enjoyment of the place will depend on whether you like the artists currently on display. Also the gift shop was cool...small but lots of interesting and clever items you'd expect in a larger museum gift shop. Definitely worth a stop in if you're an art lover and in Lancaster.(bonus...press a button and the bathroom door magically slides open...welcome to the future ladies and gentlemen!)We were wondering about the ""and history"" part of the museum though as we didn't see much of that beyond the art on display.",rickpoet
50,This has a beautiful view of Lancaster,I had heard about the Museum of Art and History on Lancaster Boulevard. However it does not compare to what Iâ€™ve heard. This place is beautiful we even went up to the rooftop and had a beautiful view Lancaster. I will return.,A_V_Wedding_Lady
50,Interesting and provocative art exhibits in an unexpected location,"I'm far from an art expert, but the rotating exhibits that I've seen at the art museum in downtown Lancaster have all impressed me a great deal. The gallery space is appealing, and the variety of styles included in each exhibition is impressive. A highlight for me is the rooftop open-air space, which, even when not being used to display art, provides a unique vantage point for observing the BLVD area of Lancaster.",Ed_from_LA_County
50,White Party (you wear white clothes),"This was an event given by the African American Chamber of Commerce. It was on the top floor. The music, food, and evening was very nice. I love the top of this museum.",Barbara M
40,establishing culture in the high desert,"quirky little shows, a little bit of everything. Open to school groups and people willing to volunteer time to give the community a place to experience art and history",Leslie H
50,Beautiful instalments and wonderful space for events.,"I love the local museum. My wife and I frequent MOAH. It is a wonderful place situated in the middle of town. The art is great and the staff very helpful. They also rent the gallery for event. My wife and I actually rented the roof for our wedding, it was fantastic.",Joseph Vanlon
50,Top-Notch Art Museum Where You Might Not Expect It,"High culture in the high desert: MOAH boasts some amazing, trendy modern artists in their exhibits, along with somewhat lesser-known people and locals. Lately we've seen work by ""desert queen"" Kim Stringfellow, Jeffrey Vallance (love!) and others. Free admission (donations accepted), lots of free parking right outside and around the corner, dining in the same block. Recommend also visiting the Western Hotel Museum a block east on days when it's open. Also recommend taking the Metrolink ($10 day pass on a Saturday) to save driving if you're coming from LA; the station is a couple of long blocks from the museums.",SoCalRambler
50,Excellent surprise!,"We caught the museum at a great time....it was celebrating the Mojave desert and it featured several artists working in very different media. I think this show runs until mid-August and is definitely worth the visit. If all of the shows are as well curated as this one, I'll wish that we lived closer! Worth the 1-2 hours we spent there.",Cathy B
50,Took the kids .,"Was just walking on the Blvd and decided to stop in really appreciate all the beautiful art work they have we enjoyed every floor we went to, it's a great place to visit for children and adults.",Milagros O
50,a fabulous art museum.......in the middle of a small town...,"MOAH as it is known has an active interest in Modern Art and a curator or Curatorswho Must really know their art: they have an exhibit of Chris Francis shoes thatis extraordinary=the building is very well lit, easy to move about and free parkinginthe back! A gem in the middle of the desert .",RKZ90027
50,MOVERS & MAKERS @ MOAH,Great way to spend a cold and wet afternoon in Lancaster. Enjoyed the museum and plan to introduce to my nieces who are just beginning to appreciate art ~ lovely show,Radcliffer
50,Very Nice Museum,"I was very impressed with the Lancaster Museum of Art and History. They had a great exhibit of British Artists. The museum is a good size for a stop in while strolling the wonderfully designed pedestrian friendly downtown. The City of Lancaster planned their downtown very well, integrating music along the sidewalks, visually appealing center median parking, a farmers market, and many thriving shops and restaurants.",NJTravelerNj
30,It's worth popping into at least once,"It's obvious that the city of Lancaster invested a lot of money into this place. Hopefully, they feature a lot more artwork on display. The native American display is worth popping your head in to visit. However, it's not something you'd want to come back to see again.",Saerwen V
50,Beautidul facility,We were there for a private event. The view from the rooftop party space was fantastic. The catering was great and perfect for our cocktail party.,karonc752
50,A Pleasant Surprise,"I've been to art museums all around LA, and even though this one is small, it definitely holds its own. The museum regularly changes out its exhibits and it's free (with a suggested donation). I'd recommend going on a Thursday so you can hit the farmer's market on the BLVD at the same time.",Erica F
50,"In the AV, this is fantastic!",MOAH is such a treat both in the museum and out. They offer a trunk program where they bring art off-site to do school presentations and there's a gorgeous event space on the roof. Free to visit and the exhibit are always enjoyable.,CynJ22
50,Sightseeing Trip,"Unique presentation of Art. I loved the ""Canned Peaches"" but don't think I will eat any of them. Worth the stop and I'm not even an art lover.",JeffConline
50,A Hidden Gem!!,"This is one of my favorite local hide outs... Whenever I don't feel like driving to LA and need a taste of culture and sophisticate... I stop by MOAH for an opportunity to explore the diversity of EXHITBITION featured at MOAH.I am able to experience some of the local artistic talent, as well as journey around the world with other featured artist from aboard.Please take the opportunity to visit and support MOAH and make a donation of at least $5.00.",MBrown28
50,Free and Always Interesting,"This is one of my favorite places to take people when they come to visit. It is FREE (donations accepted) and there are always at least a few exhibits that make me stop and take them in. The range, topics and mediums of art vary throughout the year. It's a great place to stop in for an hour and enjoy.",Crystal P
40,"Yes, visit this museum","Free--I will always contribute a donation to a museumAlways try to see local museums whether large or smallMOAH is small but well worth a visitGreat staffs hat are relaxed and knowledgableExhibits are currently focused on water, wind and environmentYes, visit this museum",Summerasalifestyle
50,World class museum in the desert...,A great museum bringing world class art to the northern regions of the county. It is actually two museums that features local artist as well with programs for younger student artist..!,sergio h
40,Culture in Lancaster? Who Knew...,I am from Palm Springs and have to say that I never expected there to be a culturally diverse art museum in Lancaster. This place has incredible potential as the boulevard grows over time. The experience is not to be enjoyed once but on a regular basis.,RLDrPH
50,For the art enthusiasts,"I've had my work showcased at this museum, and the building is beautiful. Every so often the exhibitions change, and it's always a great time to see the many different art pieces and paintings. If you are in Lancaster, check this place out I promise you will have a great time.",Max A
50,Small but Worth the Visit,It is a small museum but definitely worth looking around. It is free and interesting. It has a small gift shop too.,Khattykathy
50,World class exhibitions previously unknown in our area,"I live in the Antelope Valley and travel frequently to LA to visit galleries and museums, and I love having MOAH in my own backyard, for its cutting edge, inventive exhibitions.",CaliforniaStevie
40,Nice Museum,Went to the BLVD and i came across this museum. Nice variation of artwork and it was bigger than I expected (2 levels).,Lawrence T
40,A gem tucked into downtown,This modern 3-story building sits among shops in downtown Lancaster. Displays change often; the ones we saw were local artists' work including juried exhibits that were outstanding. We enjoyed all the displays and will return.,Carolyn S
40,Good but I thought there would be more things to see',Liked the place and the pictures even if I thought there would be more things to see because on the roof there were only two things ;) but the view from the roof was beautiful :D I really like Lancaster and Rosamond,Kay B
30,Neil Armstrong display AWESOMEâ€¦.. the Poppies not so much!,"The MOHA is a very nice facility located in the heart of old down town Lancaster. The entire street is a worthwhile visit especially when they have the farmer's market on Thursdays. The displays from the Neil Armstrong (first man on the moon) museum at MOHA were simply awe inspiring to see. There was also a celebration of the poppy flower being shown. It was just OK, and nothing really special by my assessment. While in Lancaster, be sure to drive over the ""musical road""â€¦â€¦ google it! It is well worth while, as well.",Retsof1949
50,First class art museum in Lancaster,Delighted by the professionalism of this museum; excellent lighting for displays. The exhibit we saw was equal to any large city in California.,Bionicwoman
20,No history....art is in the eye of the...,"Nice facility. Pushy donation on entry. Several rooms with ""art"" we spent about 20 minutes in total, much of that looking for where the rest of the exhipits were hiding! This is not a HIstory Museum!!!!!!",ranles76
50,Classy and cool,I love this place. Very needed around here. Actually a cultural experience close to home. I had low expectations and they far exceeded them.,Ed E
50,A great art museum in Lancaster,"Great place to see some excellent art! A wide and varied collection in all types of mediums. And now that the admission is free, it is all that much better for everyone to visit",Cuub55
50,Love the new building!,"It now feels like a real, bona-fide museum and art gallery. The building is gorgeous with the most beautiful views of downtown. As always, I love the curator's choices and the shows that come through there.",HSwan
40,It's a Real Art Gallery,"Right on the newly refurbished Lancaster Blvd, ""The BLVD"" is a real Art Gallery. Each exhibit is smallish but good. The curator has done an excellent job to put together fairly-family-friendly but still provocative works of art and, reportedly, the exhibits change often enough that there will always be something to drop-by and talk about, which is the point of having an art gallery.Right now, there is an interesting exhibit of artifacts and photos by a Native American man from this area, which appears to be the History part of MOAH.As a museum, this is not meant to be another Getty or LACMA - those things take hours to see. Instead, by design I think, MOAH is a wonderful conversation piece and an easy, short, stop-over for those strolling down the BLVD.My family dropped by for 15 minutes on a Thursday evening which is the one night of the week MOAH is open late. While there, we saw a lecture being conducted by a world-famous LA art critic. Just one of the perks of living close to LA: famous people sometimes take a jaunt up here to be admired by us Valley folk. :)",Michael P
