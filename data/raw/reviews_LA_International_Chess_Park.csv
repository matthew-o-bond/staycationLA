20,"Beware of crazed addicts, use caution","The International Chess Park is in a wonderful location near the Pier and Muscle Beach, with a long history of hosting Chess games. Sadly, crazed drug addicts are allowed free reign in Santa Monica, and Chess Park is a favorite spot for their activities. Be prepared to witness IV drug use, wild delusional rantings, indecent exposure, fighting, etc.",HappySurfer
10,Should rename it Druggie Park,"Every time my husband and I try to visit Chess Park to enjoy a game of chess, it is overrun with druggies who are shooting up and smoking marijuana out in the open. These individuals also yell and attack each other while we residents try to enjoy our taxpayer-funded park.",Jessica Y
50,A unique chess park,"This is a very well known chess park right on the beach in Santa Monica. It has bee shown in many movies and tv shows. If you are on the beach, you might want to stop by just to see it :)",Samuel M
50,Chess and sun... and on the beach!,Great place to sit and play some games while enjoying the sun. Sadly there are no enough shade but... girls passing by!!,Jorge S
20,No chess pieces,We had a little time to fill and searched for this place because a game of chess is always good. Arrived to find a large area of tables with chessboards available but no pieces to play with.,thimdog
50,Entertainment,"Quite the place. Lots to see and do. The outdoor, life size chess board was neat to see and play. The street entertainment was fun to enjoy as well.",luttig7
50,Just like you see in the movies.,Chess masters and chess students gather to learn from one another. Their concentration is as intense as the vibe.,writerjoseponce
40,Fun to watch,"Right by the pier, it is fun to stop by and watch different people out playing chess. Not something you can just stop and do, unless you happen to carry your chess set with you. There were a few homeless people sleeping on the benches in the morning.",SherriLR
40,Very Interesting,On the Santa Monica beach next to the Pier is the Chess Park. It is fascinating. The chess boards are laid out on tables with chairs and there is a huge board laid out on the ground. There are elevated walkways and viewing place all around with a great ocean view. Watch all sorts of matches. Be sure to see it when going to the Pier. Free.,Jim K
50,So much fun in and around LA,Our Granddaughter loves to play chess. So when I told her Santa Monica had a chess park and that should could play with the big chess pieces she was super excited..She won the first match and lost the second but had so much fun.. It's a great place to visit..,scubaldy
30,Lots of tables but...,Lots of tables but no players except the one homeless looking dude. I stopped here on a chilly overcast morning around 11:00am.I suspect later in the day or on a weekend day there will be playersClean and well kept its just south of the pier and across from the sand and muscle beach.,Summerasalifestyle
40,A Santa Monica classic,I enjoy watching veteran chess players of all ages enjoy the matches & teach newer chess players about the game.,SMOgal
20,WOW ! The excitement and suspense will leave you ready for a nap.,I was expecting scantily clad women at the CHEST PARK. Imagine my surprise when I discovered a bunch of people sitting around benches actually playing CHESS.I really misunderstood the front desk clerk at the hotel.Stop on by... the suspense and action will leave you SLEEPY !,TiredWorldTraveler
50,There's always a chess game!,"If you are into chess or just learning there is almost always a chess game in progress, or someone to talk chess with.",Leah B
40,Checkerboard Park ...,Santa Monica's International Chess Park is a great idea which gained civic blessing and now a nice dedicated playing area with permanent tables is right by the pier up on the palisades. Busy on weekends but not so other times. Free and you can't beat the views. ...,David B L
10,OUR EXPERIENCE WAS NOT SO PLEASANT,"Came here since my son is an avid chess player. Granted it was Friday morning and I was not expecting this place to be packed with chess players, but there were only two players and a bunch of homeless people.The two players got into a spat and started yelling and cursing at each other. This kind of freaked my 11 year old out a bit since they were getting very animated.I am sure this is a great local resource to have at appropriate times and for events. Our experience was not very good.",mark g
30,Hahahahaha,"I don't know why they call this the international chess park, it a few tables set out near the pier, whit a few folks playing chess. The only international part about it, are the foreign tourists who stop by to look not play.",AARDVARKKILLER
40,Husband Daycare for FREE,"Searching for things that my partner could enjoy when we were visiting Santa Monica, I came across this little gem !!!! It is free, there is shade, close to toilets and best of all, you can drop your better half off here knowing he will stay put whilst you roam the shops of Santa Monica, cycle the boardwalk or head to the beach. The group is friendly and the skill level goes from beginner to craftsman !!! Bring your own pieces (the boards are embedded in the tables), set them up and wait for a game to happen.",Judi K
40,"Diversity with a capital ""D""","Chess park in Santa Monica, California is, in a word, amazing. First, it is free (parking excluded) which is hard to find these days. Next, it is fascinating. Where else can you see suburban soccer moms playing chess with knights of the open road. Anyone can play. Any age, any color, and any socio-economic status is allowed. English is not required or even necessary and smoking is not allowed. You do have to bring your own pieces, however, boards are built into the tables. I recommend packing a lunch and sunscreen and staying a while. If you do not know how to play chess, you can likely find someone willing to teach you. Don't count on a great deal of patience as these folks come to play. Paid lessons may even be available.",jeffreysv
