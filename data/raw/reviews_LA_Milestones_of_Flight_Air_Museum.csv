50,Free.,"I came here a couple years ago and I remember it being free, or at least when I went. We were the only ones inside and it was really cool. One of the workers told us many things about the different planes. I can't wait to go back and take my son, he loves aircrafts.",Graice C

40,Interesting artifacts and displays cared for by dedicated volunteers,"We were in the area to support a hiker on the Pacific Crest Trail. We had some time, so decided to check out some local attractions. We were the only guests at the time of our visit. Our guide turned out to be a retired Air Force pilot and aerospace industry veteran who was also the owner/president of the non-profit that ran the museum. This is a small museum kept viable by dedicated volunteers.There were two hangars filled with both vintage and modern aircraft, along with various artifacts, model airplanes, drawings, paintings and posters covering flight from WWII to the conquest of space flight. The displays were interesting and our guide was friendly, with information and stories about the items we were seeing.Admission was free, but there was an opportunity to leave a contribution at the end of the tour. We were glad we visited and appreciated the time and effort the volunteers were putting into this endeavor.Plan to also check our the Civic Musical Road on the way to the museum.",GoBeavs09
50,Cool Way to Share History,"Signs honoring special people that have contributed to aerospace projects in the area are placed along Lancaster Blvd.You can read as many as you like, depending on your time. Weather is usually great here, so outside is very doable.This is an area of the US that has contributed a lot to the aerospace industry, including Plant 42 where the Space Shuttle was built and maintained for years. If space pursuits interest you, this is the place to come. Other sites in the area as well.",Katy0701
50,Fantastic Museum for any Aircraft Fan,"I was visiting Lancaster on my way to Vegas from Paso Robles in June 2013. Being a bit of an aviation fan this was on my to do list. Mid June is hot in Lancaster and it was hot when I visited. Basically a couple of Hangars on Fox Field. Parked out the front and left my car running so my wife and daughter were comfortable. Had only about 40 minutes but well worth it. I was the only one in the Museum. Was given a guided Tour by a Gentleman who was ex Korean War Veteran with USAF. Cannot remember his name but a great guy and very informative. Had a look at the historical displays and aircraft both older and newer. This is not a Pima Air & Space Quality Museum but anyone interested in aircraft should come have a look. There are bathrooms (I think), no stair but the yard is not ashphalt. You need enclosed shoes. The aircraft outside are great and you cannot feel anything other than dismayed to see them rotting away under the California sun. Its a pity Corporate America does not throw some money their way for hangars. A nice addition driving to the Museum is the Musical Road, look it up on Google.",Gmert
