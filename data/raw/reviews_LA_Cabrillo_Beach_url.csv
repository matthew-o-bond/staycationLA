40,Large and clean beach,"Cabrillo Beach is adjacent to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and an outdoor playground. Bring children to this area for education (sea creatures in the aquarium), for expelling excess energy on the playground equipment and for running on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
50,Sunrise,"When I wake up early enough, I love to visit at sunrise; the early exercise walking out to the pier, and photos of the sunrise over the harbor are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmanlarry
40,Quick evening visit,"We stopped here to walk on the pier to get pictures of the Los Angeles Harbor lighthouse. Parking was easy. We found port-a-potties, but no women’s rest rooms. The walk on the pier was good. We had good views of the lighthouse. Lots of people were fishing. Most local venues don’t allow people to walk in to use the bathroom. We weren’t able to stay at the beach, but it looked like it would have been nice to stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5453RXmichelles
40,nice,"it is not sugar white beaches, but the beaches are nice a varied. From full sand to rocky shore this is a fun free experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61JamesW
50,Great location,Wonderful beach but it gets really crowded on the weekends. Best to go during the week if you can. The only downside is the pay for parking meters. They are hard to figure out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/compcrzy
40,Lovely beaches and a break from the touristy crowds,"Found this by looking at the map after visiting the USS Iowa. Our kids were begging for more beach time. We were really happy we found this beach.It's basically two types of beach right across from each other. One side is on the ocean and has surf, while the other is on the bay and is calm. Both sides have large sandy beaches.It wasn't touristy at all (which was a refreshing change) and was full of families enjoying the sunshine and swimming.Changing facility a little dirty but nice to have. Parking did cost but not expensive at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsymamma
30,Definitely a locals beach,Our hotel has this beach listed as a “place to see”. They might want to rethink that for tourists. It is very much a locals hangout. It’s probably not the best image that the tourist industry wants to put out. We quickly took pictures and left.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruisinmama06
30,Average beach,"Very much a locals hang out park or picnic gathering. The water is not great, I did not swim in it. The beach was ok to catch a few rays. Good play area for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raroboy
40,Surprisingly lovely beach,"We stayed in San Pedro for an event and were under the impression that it was a pretty industrial area (which usually means ugly and dirty). We decided to have a post-breakfast walk to the sea front before leaving 'just because', and I'm so glad we did, it's lovely. We walked along the beach and met a lovely young boy who was volunteering in some way or another and trying to identify what we think was a sea slug. There's a picnic area, volley ball nets, shaded area under the trees, it really is lovely. We also walked along the pier and watched the fishermen (and women). I love that there are rod holes built into the pier walls, fish identification charts, and public sinks for washing your catch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natflash
30,OK Spot to Learn to Windsurf & Paddleboard,"Hi,Wouldn't recommend this beach at all for sunbathing or swimming as both the sand and water are not clean. Additionally as a warning to people with little kids who might play in the shallow water, I was there a few weeks ago and was bitten numerous times on my legs by something tiny (fish?) in the water, that actually drew blood. Does anyone local know? I think it's a big issue for swimmers.As other reviewers have noted, from a purely ""beach"" perspective this beach can't compete with the many spectacular CA coast beaches. That being said, this is a great spot to learn to wind surf on the inside. There are also a lot of more experienced wind surfers having fun on the outside. Parking is inexpensive and convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zumanbabe
50,Great Spot!,"Seemingly a local hangout, we wandered upon it and loved it! Parking is the best we found, $1 per hour. Not too crowded. But oh my, was it cold!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480beckin
40,Simply Beautiful.,"As a first time visitor of Cali, I had high expectations for the beaches and Cabrillo exceeded them! I was there at night, and even then, it was pretty serene and beautiful. The water was glistening and the sand was cool. All you needed was a light hoodie and maybe a fire. I'd love to go during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATho1
30,"Cold water, less people","Not exactly what I'd call a swimmer beach, or a shell collector, or a sun bathing...but it is less crowded than most and it's convenient if you dont want to travel far. Nice place to watch the shipping and enjoy a picnic. Pack it with you, not much nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
20,Not what I expected,"I went with a few friends had no idea there was a parking meter, a little hidden. Beach is a little dirty not many people kind of quiet. Would recommend on taking food as there aren't many options or places to get something! Kind of cold, not many sea shells!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyG3543
30,Just as I remember,This is one of the beaches I went to as a child. Didn't find any sea shells or starfish. We went just to edge of water and it was cold. There were a few surfers and Buggie boards having fun with the high surf. The beach is small in the west side with nice waves. The other side is very nice and had lots of youth groups having fun. There was still plenty of beach. If in area stop by and make day of it. The marine aquarium just feet from beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870eileens
20,Not a food beach for grunions,Beach parking meter is a joke and it closes at 12 midnight so if you are here for grunions don't bother you are wasting your time. Go to another beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daikin
50,FREE Wifi!,First visit to this beach! It's small but there enough room between parking and the water to set up shop. I would recommend it to any families with young children only because the waves are minimal and won't slam your young ones down and beat them. Very CLEAN! On set restrooms and parking is literally feet away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AleshaAmber
40,Great location close to Fort Macarthur,Just below the post this is a great stop if you don't want to fight the traffic to get to the more popular areas. Plenty of room to swim and the sea walls are awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
40,Potentially a Nice Beach ...,"If you know about the limitations beforehand you can have a good time at Cabrillo beach. For me, it's not a beach for swimming since the harbor is next door and ships ply the waters there. Rather it's a beach for seeing ships, sea life, the harbor activity across on Terminal Island and picnicking. Do it right & you'll have a fun time. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,A favorite walk in the morning.,They groom this beach in the mornings and it has beautiful views. You can have the waves or be inside the breakwater for a calmer swim. When you look the opposite direction you know you are in the 2nd largest port on the planet. Also you can fish off the pier here. I enjoy this neighborhood in the mornings and early afternoons. I have not been here late. There is also a children's center here called the Bath house which is quite unique. I will continue to walk and hang out here. It is also home to the aquarium which I have not visited yet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sailing_Sweetie
40,Nice little beach,"A little crowded at times but not so bad. Even this warm Southern California beach has some cold water in the winter, so be guided by the crowd or lack thereof.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oranutan1
40,Hidden Gem,"Cabrillo Beach is definitely one of my favorite to visit with my kids. Parking is not as crowded. There is no traffic jam to get here (like in Santa Monica or Venice where you're in a gridlock from the freeway). Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is on site with many exhibits to watch. My kids can literally spend entire day at the Aquarium. There is playground on the beach. Shaded picnic area with BBQ grills. There's wifi (you can't get the signal by the water but by picnic area which right next to playground signal is good). Water stay shallow and waves are non existent. If you go on right time and date, you can see cruise boat.Other things - There's boat launch pad on site for people who like to boat. It's minutes away from San Pedro fish market. Watch out for seagulls if you're picnicking. If you can find parking on the street it's free and very close to the beach. If not paid parking isn't too expensive. On the bay side, there is a paved walkway almost all the way to the water for strollers and wheelchair access.Cons - dirty restroom. It's in San Pedro which is one of major shipping area with cargo ships, cruise ships and every other ships coming and going. I don't know how clean the water is but I can guess not very clean. There is no restaurants or food stand on site. (On weekend that I've seen taco vendors) Plan ahead and grab food from tons of places on the way to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBoyA77
40,Nice view,"This beach is very nice and clean. Adequate parking was available and the entrance fee is $1.00 per hour, well worth it. The day was windy but many people were having a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132angelaj
30,Beach & boat launch,"There aren't too many beaches in the area and this is a great one set aside in its own little space. I'm a little biased because I've seen some phenomenal beaches, but this beach is perfectly adequate with a boat launch ramp that is very convenient. I've seen it get quite crowded on some days and it can be sad to see trash in the ocean - just use a trash can people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennadah
40,Horrible beach for family,The garbage and stench on the ocean side was horrible. We left without wanting to touch anything. The bay side was good for the kids. This is not a tourist beach that you want to visit. May be worst beach in ca.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark2965
40,A lot to offer,"Great family location, small beach with fire pits, a nice bathhouse with warm water open showers. Lifeguard stations are plentiful. Park patrols are visible. No fish cleaning stations",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbiezken
50,Nice Beach,"Did not spend very much time at the beach, but from what I saw, I will definitely be back. The water was clean and the beach was clean. Had a nice grassy area to have a picnic or just to relax without having to hang out in the sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustMe123170
50,Crowded yet fun,"Went there during the 4th of July holiday to watch the firework show. We arrived at 1pm and the parking was already full/closed and ended up parking at the neighborhood some 30 minutes later. A family member arrived at 3:30 and took them over 1hr to find a parking spot!But once there we settled near the water (less people as) as most are in the grass area with their tents and bbq's set up already.The firework show will be from a barge towed by a tug boat, so the closer you are in the water the better (imo).Also parking outside is a plus, you don't have to wait in line to get out of the park after.Parking (inside): $9 flat.Park hours (4th of July): 5am-10pmWill definitely go back next year, but much earlier this time =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0mardc
40,Most beautiful at Low Tide!,I've been to Cabrillo beach many times and the kids always enjoy walking along the rocks to the right side of the beach. Here you'll find tide pools galore especially at low tide. About a mile out there are a few sandy parts to the beach and small pieces of sea glass can be found all around. My kids and I love looking for the small rounded pieces of glass and we have found a few rare colors here. I'd definitely recommend water shoes or sneakers for this beach to make walking over the rocks comfortable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Good place to come for bonfires at night,"Parking is $9 but plentyfull, nice place to bring some wood & starr a bonfire on the pits available on the beach. But of course there may be a fire going on already there so come early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yael47
