10,Generations of family members here - What a poorly operated facility,"I have six relatives here dating back to 1962 and over the past few years this place is poorly maintained and getting worse. If I could, I would move all the bodies to a nicer place to visit.Grass is overgrown or missing with dirt patches throughout, grave markers have weeds covering the headstones, others are shifting and exposed. Prices are outrageous and after not paying triple price for a new marker, I was charged $1400 to install it. Went to see it today and the neighbors two headstones were covered in dirt from placing our marker.Nobody cares and requests/phone calls go unanswered. I was told the facility was sold a few years back to Dignity - however there is no Dignity or respect for the deceased here. I told my kids to stop the cycle and put me at peace in another facility.This place is no more than a dirty back yard, especially in the older sections as the grass is gone and dirt covers most of the grave sites.

50,An interesting cemetery,Near Burbank Airport is this cemetery which has a beautiful monument to aviation flyers who lost their lives. There is also a large fountain. It is well worth it to walk around and see the beauty here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc
