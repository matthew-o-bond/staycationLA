Notice the detail on the rod iron for the inner cemetery for family. Craftsmanship on the Grecian Mausoleum is superb.Paul R. Spitzzeri (Museum Director) is an Award of Merit winner for his book on the Workman & Temple Families---enjoyed reviewing. An arbor of trees is gone and strolls under the trees (for many) will be missed. Health of the trees? I can only imagine the garden plans in progess for this area. Feel free to invite me to this future blessed event. Grateful for the visits and hospitatlity. Must visit this California treasure!",India C
30,Walk with mom,Mom and I walked around the outside of the museum grounds. There is a nice walking path that leads around a small cemetery and a pretty pond area. Very shady and is a good place to enjoy your lunch if you work in the area. Nice big parking lot and lots of shady spots to park in.,Yvonne J
40,Free Tour & Admission,What a great gem of local history! Came here with my husband while visiting family during the holiday season. Loved learning about local history.

50,1920's Picnic,"Once a year they hold a 1920's themed picnic with music, dancing, and fashion show featuring clothing of the era put on by the Art Deco Society. The grounds are always immaculate with lots of places to spread out your picnic meal. There were two options for music one in the court yard area and one band stand set up for in the shade with a dance floor. Many attending wore clothing typical of the era which adds to the feel of the 1920's afternoon. If you forgot your ""glad rags"", there were merchants with some nice vintage items for sale. A vintage car group had eight or ten ""tin Lizzies"" on display. This is a family friendly event. Plenty of parking on both sides of the grounds.",CaliGal2013
50,Wonderful,"The local museum for Rowland Heights and City of Industry. There are two houses, gift shop, Koi Pond and family cemetery. Well worth the visit. The docents are knowledgeable, friendly and enjoy telling stories. We go here often to just enjoy the pond.",Pburns2007

50,A wonderful local heritage site,I have visited the Workman-temple Homestaed for many years. I was a 4th grade teacher in Hacienda Heights and each year we would study the La Puente Valley and the early settlers. The students would enjoy our visits to the Homestead to learn about and see what a home was like in the early days of our community. I recently took friends on one of their special days and enjoyed seeing folks dressed up in period clothing as well as the docents speaking about the olden days. I enjoyed taking a tour of the homes once again and sharing this with our friends. I think it's wonderful how this property has been restored and is open to the public.,Ginny E
50,Great find,I've learned a lot today that I might not have discovered in a lifetime. What a significant part of Southern California history. I was flabbergasted and conspicuously impressed.,Jose C
40,PIECE OF LA HISTORY,The Homestead Museum is a real treat and a piece of local LA history. This covers the early American part of LA history and the families homes and gardens after the Spanish Land Grants and huge Ranchos. The house tours are fantastic (late 1890's to 1920's). Do plan to go during one of their special events so you get to take in additional displays and talk to more people. We visited during the Homestead Festivel and they had lots of extra stuff for the kids to do. A complete tour of the houses and grounds will take 2 - 3 hours so plan on an afternoon. Everything was free to see.,707clayg
40,local history and fascinating family story,"The museum, which is surprising to find in Industry, tells a fascinating story of early LA history, complete with rags to riches to rags to riches to ?? stories of the former owners.",BEIreland
50,Sharing History with grandkids,Great displays of local history. From the time that this area was part of Mexico to the 1930s.Very interesting and small enough for 6 year olds to appreciate.,piba
40,Victorian Day Picnic,"Once a year they hold a Victorian Day Picnic which is great fun for those who enjoy dance, and music of that era. There are educational displays of lace making, a fashion show showing how Victorians dressed, games, and merchants selling interesting items. Watch for the bicycles from that period.This is a very family friendly event with lots to do and see. There is plenty of parking.",CaliGal2013
50,Wonderful museum in the City of Industry,"The homes are behind a wall and you have to take a guided tour. It starts at the workman house which is a wonderful adobe structure. The guide was very knowledgeable. But after the workman house you are led to La Casa Nueva. This was a real treat, the interesting thing is over the years the family lost then regained the property a few times. Today it is run by the city. In 1917 Walter P. Temple used wealth from an oil discovery to repurchase 75 acres of the original family rancho. On this property he had the new house built. By the early 1930s, the Temple family lost the house and it became a boys' military school and a convalescent hospital before it was acquired by the City of Industry in the mid 1960s.There is no entrance fee but they do accept donations.",sdiffen
50,Unexpected treasure in the heart of the City of Industry,"I spent a most enjoyable afternoon touring the historic homes, gardens and cemetery that make up this museum. The Spanish-Colonial style home is truly a hidden gem of Southern California. It was absolutely lovely, superbly maintained and beautifully decorated. My tour guide, Mr. Eldon Dunn, knew everything there was to know about its history and was also very entertaining! I give this museum my highest recommendation.(And the price is right....free admission!)",Itzi B
