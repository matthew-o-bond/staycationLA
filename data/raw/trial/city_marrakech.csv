30,“A average journey”,"While it marrackech, it would only be fitting to have a look at the Atlas mountains, and take a carmel ride in to the desert?Personally dont waste yr money? If you have back problems or any other similar probs, this is not the trip for you, yr taken by jeep over very rough terrain, obviously, its the atlas mountains, the village stop is staged, they are not the traddional marrocans living there, if you wont to see local tradional life, take a local bus to essouria, beautifulCamel ride is very uncomfortable, they walk like yr on a ship and be careful they rise back end up first, so hold on tight.To see this beautiful country, do it yrself, local bus is very cheap, and so is the trainDont be afraid to do the adventure yrself, you have more fun and learn more.And its very safe"
10,“An open sewer”,Don't go. It's dangerous. It's threatening. It smells like a sewer. Every one is on rhe take and looking to screw every penny out of you. The traffic is mental. When they get sick of the roads the scooters just go on the footpath. The Medina is especially dangerous. Once you get in they will do their best to keep you there. Trust no one as their favourite trick is to ask money to show you the way out and then lead you further in.
10,“I hate everything about Marrakesh”,"horrible, horrible, horrible ! may I say something more ? monkeys, snakes, people trying to bribe money in everyway !"
40,“Half and Half”,"Although we did in part enjoy our holiday and are glad we went we will not be returning. Marrakech its a beautiful and crazy city, but can sometimes be quite intimidating. Everybody will do anything to get some money, even pointing something out to you!!! Do slighty cover up when you go out, I did see some people in short dresses and I just feel it to be disrespectful. Well worth a visit, but maybe for 1 week rather than 2."
20,“Nice city with not so nice people”,"The city is quite nice, especially the old town. Visitors should be prepared for no access to mosques however. The old town is very difficult to keep the proper direction in its narrow streets.Majority of people seems to try to get as much money from any tourist as possible so be aware and try not to be offered what you do not like to buy.Lot of locals require getting tips for any favor.Also be aware of pickpockets, my new mobile has been stolen just from my hand by a robber on a moped on the pavement."
30,"“Marrakech,morrocco”","Only tip is that do your sums right otherwise in all emotions you may have to fork out excessiveamount for hire of 4xx4,guide etc, .Negotiate hardDo not visit during fasting months as people have different life style than westSelect hotels nearby supermarketsBeware of Market stall traders and do not buy their description of goods and services at face value"
10,“Never again!”,"My bag with money, credit cards, phone etc, was dragged from my arm by a passing motorcyclist within minutes of arrival, so I guess I am prejudiced. Even so, I thought this was the most hostile and unpleasant town I ever visited in a lifetime of travel. Garbage and rubble line the alleyways. At every moment you are dodging a rider with no lights at night or car pushing its way through pedestrians. Maps don't help, as they are generally too vague, and the streets either have no visible names or they are in Arabic, rarely in French. Nearly everyone is trying to rip you off, whether salesmen, taxidrivers or the legions of young men in the streets who seem to have nothing else to do. Ugly by day and scary by night. Yes, there are a couple of mosques, palaces and gardens, but nothing compared to the Black Sea towns or Spain."
30,“marvelous Morocco”,We flew by Ryanair to Marrakesh and stayed at the Rise Andalla overlooking the main square. Christophe our host had arranged our transfer from the airport and I would say this is essential. The old Marrakesh is just as you would imagine - very hard to get your bearings due to thecoverednature of some of the souks. Our riad was excellent! We couldn't have wished for a better location or more attentive hosts. The food was great - everything home made and delicious. We found 3 days in Marrakesh enough. ... the constant attention from local traders gets a little wearing........it is a fantastic place and well worth a visit. We went from here to Essaouira by coach. We stayed at the Riad. Baoussala with Dominique who built it herself. To say this place is magical is selling it short. .... its truly fabulous! Essaouira is quaint and blessing your face than Marrakesh. A great trip!
30,“Visiting the souk”,Could not look at anything without being put upon by the traders.
40,“An experience not to be missed!”,"We stayed in a riad for 7 nights and this was plenty of time to see Marrakech itself, but you would need more time to pick up on the many tours that can be taken from a range of the towns expedition offices taking you outside Marrakech.It took us a couple of days to orientate on the town and the open top hop on hop off bus tour really helped. One day for about £13 including a good free map..We wished we had done the guided walk that we did at the end of the week on the second day. There are official guides and the Riads seem to have lists. The 5 hour guided tour cost us 50euros and we shared this cost across 6 of us. Great value but we would not have wanted more than 6 in such a busy environment.Food was excellent and reasonably priced depending on where you went but was mainly tangines, cous cous or kebab skewers. There were vegetarian dishes available with the usual limitations. There were very few restaurants serving alcohol unless you looked for them.The town was in our experience incredibly safe. We saw not one police car with blue lights or in a rush in the whole week of walking round the town at all hours. We were warned of pick pockets but heard of no problems.Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. Initially we were pestered by shop and market sellers but they were never hard sell and merely wanted you to look and chat and to of course to buy. They were always gracious when we said no and walked away even after hard haggling.The warnings in the guide books about being led to places on foot when asking directions were valid. We were advised by our guide that the infamous Berber market is a myth for some to lead you to stalls or other places and then ask for money for their escort. Directions from stall holders were always reliable and helpful, and frequently in English.In summary, a fabulous, friendly town well worth a visit.."
10,“Health in Marrakech”,"HealthBeware of your health when visiting Marrakech from the filth and fumes from traffic, it is so bad that you can see the fumes in the atmosphere.The main thing to be concerned about is crossing the roads, there are mopeds, bikes, cars, horse carriages and mules all competing. Apart from that there is the continual sounding of the horns. Each time you cross the road it is like taking your complete life in your hands. Although there are traffic police on very nearly all major road junctions on the main road they do not assist and simply stand and watch. Certainly none of the drivers will give you any right of way even when crossing on their so called 'crossing'.With regard to mopeds who drive in the medina and souks choking you with the overpowering fumes. It is necessary to cover your mouth to avoid choking but they appear to be tolerated. They are driven slalom-like at speed along narrow lanes with millimetres to spare. The 'rule' is to walk on the right hand side of the narrow streets and let them avoid you rather than you trying to get out of their way. If crossing a busy road follow a Moroccan and let them lead. Keep an ear open for the beep of the moped approaching behind you and keep to the right side to let it pass. Bicycles are a bit of a pest too but the same rules apply.When wandering in and around the souks you will find animals caged and abused by their keepers. (not the place for animal lovers especially) The sight and smell of meat hanging in stalls for sale is overpowering.The smell and filth of the streets is overpowering and refuse left on every corner even in the supposedly upmarket area of Gueliz.If you are unfortunate to want to use a toilet when out and about, not only will you have great difficulty in finding one but if you do the state is very much a lot to be desired and you will certainly need to carry antibacterial wipes with you.The area of Marrakech was a complete cultural shock to my family and I certainly would not recommend visiting especially with young children. You only have to listen to the locals with their very chesty coughs and breathing difficulties to know that your health could suffer."
50,“Beldi Country Club”,"If you don’t have time to visit Essaouira for bit of sunbathing I would recommend Beldi Country Club for a relaxing day out. It’s located few km outside of Marrakech thus you don’t have to make specific plans to go there but can make up your mind in the morning depending on weather. It has a pool, sun loungers + towels are included in fee. It is also surrounded by beautiful rose gardens and if you wish you can eat your lunch there. The use of pool area is 200DH or use of pool + lunch is 350DH excluding drinks. The meal there is well worth the money. Kids are welcome...as long as they are not making too much noise ;)"
40,“Make sure its fresh!”,"Loads of street food and it looks great. beware though and only buy if you are confident that it is freshly cooked and you can watch its preparation.The cafes are generally very good and safe , despite the recent bombing in the square."
20,“very bad location”,"6 of us stayed at the naila,we are all young guys,but the location of this villa is really bad.the walk from the naila to marrakech square is approx 3 kilometres 1 way,also the villa is right at the end of some narrow winding streets,just to get out of these winding streets you need to leave a trail of breadcrumbs otherwise your guaranteed to get lost.also dont go by the professional photos,the villa defo needs a refurb.another point,if you dont like stairs this villa is not for you,it has a really narrow staircase to top floors and the ceiling is low so you tend to bang your head everytime going upstairs.the good point is it has wifi connection for internet.also there are neighbours surrounding this villa and any noise has to be kept to minimum,not much of a holiday if you have to sit there like your in church."
50,“Great shopping”,Stayed at a nice Riad and had a wonderful shopping experience in the souks.
50,“A feast for the Senses!”,"Marrakesh was a delightful destination- I highly recommend it for a Winters break. I escaped the dull dreary and cold weather of Northern Europe and found myself in 25 degree heat after only a three hour flight. Morocco is really like another world. I felt like I went back in time straight into a scene from Disney's Aladdin. The snake charmers, the musicians, the gorgeous clothes and home decor, the mint tea, the delicious food- all at fantastic prices- I couldn't recommend this place enough! Think outside the box and discover Morocco- it's a feast for the senses and you'll dream about this place the minute you leave!"
50,“My favourite place”,"I would strongly recommend Marrakech as a unique and amazing experience. I have now been six times in three years and just love it. Each time I go, I discover new places and most of all new friends. The Moroccans are wonderful people who except you for what you are with no reservations and will remember you each time you return.I need to make a special mention about 'Brahim' who runs IDASTOURS Excursions ([--]) in and around Marrakech. Camel rides, quadbiking and evenings in the dessert are just a few trips available. He goes out of his way to make every experience good for his customers and always with an enormous smile!I cannot wait to return later in the year for some more trips and of course, some amazing shopping!"
40,"“Marrakech, after the terrorist Blast”","Here I was satisfied with my 3-star hotel, about to leave the city of Marrakech; I tried and I tried to delay or postpone the 9-day trip, but in vain. There is no sea front, but the city was charming and lively. You sleep or stay in doors during the day, and goout in the night: perfect temperatures for going around. If you decide to walk in the streets, no problem; they told me to watch out from pickpockets and theifs: nothing of the like. everyone was friendly, maybe after that terrorist attack they need to re-attract tourists. I witnessed some street fights, but it was controlled. Everything is painted with the same red color, characteristic of the earth; no other color exists, no white building or anything of the like. that was so harmonious but leads to some direction misintrepertations. I foudn prices really reasonable, a bargainer myself, I could shop for anything... there is of course and I was surprised very well-off individuals and their market share is quite big. I beleive every French citizen of honnor or of rank, has a house in Marrakesh to which he comes back to. So many tourists everywhere, you can initiate contact in seconds inc roweded areas like the place des arts. pubs and clubs have also some unique chic but not as developped as Lebanese... Moroccans still need to be taught how to develop that area, maybe with some help... Lovely scenery of grenery everywhere the landscape is that of an African country especialy those palm trees and those large birds flying low over our heads everytime ...it is a recommended place to visit and re-visit, really.JP"
30,“Marrakech madness”,"Went to Marrakech on a 4 night offer in 5 star Albatross Gardens Hotel - which is not as the star rating suggests - luxurious, but it is clean, and comfortable with nice pool area - all you really need when you are going to be out and about exploring !If you are due to head off there then I recommend you look at this website:http://www.marrakech-riad.co.ukI found it just before heading over and it is invaluable for offering advice on haggling and lots more info besides! Sadly we never found either of their riads to visit and say hello - which brings me to next handy hint. If you are only there for a few days - then just pay for an official guide (hotels etc can sort out) to navigate you around the souks. Otherwise, you'll spend a lot of time wandering round and round and round and round...!!Marrakech is a true assault on your senses - be prepared for noise and hustle and bustle but keep your sense of humour when the haggling gets a bit much and you will enjoy the huge variety of sights and sounds.....Have fun !!!"
50,“Marrakech Mystique”,"To venture into Marrakech is an assault on the senses. One is immediately thrust into a dizzying scene where medieval meets contemporary. Donkey laden carts whose drivers are texting their friends, are honked on by truckers getting goods to the market. One gets good at dodging motor bikes that speed past you by mere inches. The smells of spice and rendered leather mix with garbage in a maze of back allies and yet to it all there is a sense of reason to the madness.For the average western tourist it can be too much to take in on a singe day or week for that matter. But give it time. Allow yourself to become lost, leave the guidebook at home, and venture into the main square. After two days we were learning the back ways and how to haggle for a bargain. Granted we were still being ripped off, but getting better.When night comes the city is transformed. Gentle alley lights come alive and people take a much more relaxed feel. That is until one gets to the main square again, which is packed. However, surrounding the central square are restaurants with roof top terraces - a highly recommended retreat from the insanity below.Go to Marrakech, but spend the time to get adjusted and leave the western chip off one's shoulder.http://silandco.blogspot.com/"
20,“Not a place to go to if your English”,"As the title suggests do not visit if your english, the city is nice enough, plenty of historic buildings and culture to absorb, albeit a little chaotic espiecially in the main square, be aware of henna tatto ladys,snake charmers ect who's only ambition is to charm your money away from you. Don't allow yourselves to be led into the narrow market streets by locals trying to befriend you and take you to their friends shops where you will be offered mint tea by friendly shop keepers who won't let you go until you buy something. Our friends got led away and were stuck in various shops for 4hrs unable to leave as it needs a guide to lead you out of the narrow streets.The hotel was very nice ""The Domaine Tarik"" set in 20 acres of orange groves but the manager and staff were so obviosly anti english, even though we could speak French the French guests took preference. Taxi rides into the city are very expensive so be wary"
10,“Sickly Exotic City !!”,"Just returned back from a holiday to Morocco. The first impressions seemed fine for a day or two - felt the place was very much locked up in time and exotic but not for too long...The place is dirty with sub standard hotels ( except for 5 stars I suppose and some riads ) with endless haggling at every step and nothing much to see around except for a few silly day tours which are over priced. The people seemed friendly and poor and almost 8 out of 10 people ready to rip you off in every way possible. On my trip I encountered some families with similar feelings & experiences and would never return back. So if you really want to have a stress free, fun filled holiday - alone or with family, you'd be better off in places like Portugal,Spain, Greece, etc which are great and better value for money."
40,“An experience I'm not in a rush to get again lol”,Went to Marakech in 2009 whilst staying in Morocco (elsewhere) It was just day trip... for starters it was VERY hot and I got quite ill and nearly passed out. I have to admit I enjoyed the visits to the Gardens and the School. We also visited a chemist that told us all about herbs etc for make-up and cures for scars. There were monkey handlers and snake charmers all of which would try and get money out of you by sneakily putting the pet on your shoulder and letting you take a photo and then demanding money!I did not enjoy being hassled by locals trying to sell leather! and I did not enjoy the high prices and the shop keepers strongest efforts to not let you leave without buying something! I was also sad to see children trying to pickpocket tourists and steal handbags etc.... :(The culture is definetly something to experience but I would only recommend this for people that enjoy travelling in a less luxurious style to a typical beach holiday you really have to have you wits about you.... not to mention a strong stomach for the food!! But overall entertainment and the once in a lifetime experience it was worth it!
10,“Marrakech”,"Will never go back to marrakech. The people will go to arms length to rip you off and get money out of you. Making a deal with the taxi drivers was ok before you get into the taxi and half way into your journey they say ""Oh sir am doing you a very good price charging you 150 its a very cheap price"" knowing fine well we agreed on 130 . That was every taxi we got in not just 1 of them. It was constant hard work to get a fair price from any of these people from the markets, cafe's, and taxi's. The people in marrakech are rude and abrupt. Worst holiday ive ever had and will never consider going back."
40,“The well established tourism destination that is Marrakesh”,"Have you ever been to a city where every building is a terra cotta color? I have. The desert city of Marrakech. It is so different than anything I had previously seen. As a trade point for European, African, and Islamic goods, the whole city made it clear to me that cities such as where I come from (Thunder Bay) are maybe 300 years behind as far as making a city the kind of tourism location that a person will remember forever after visiting. But I digress. Here's a quick summary of my visit to Marrakech. After a week of experiencing Morocco through Rabat, Fes, Casablanca, my group, which was lead by Sultana Tours, stayed in Marrakech for a few days at the hotel Agdal. The hotel is located right in the middle of the city, a 20 minute walk away from Jaheed al fna, a large market place complete with snake charmers, shops and restaurants in the middle of the medina. From there, you could spend all day going through the maze of 'souks' there which are, what i think, the origin of the shopping malls we have today. Beware though. Salesmen can be aggressive in their pursuit to get you to buy something. Afterwards, take a horse drawn carriage back to the hotel so that from there you can experience the beautiful downtown that Marrakech has to offer, with its endless orange trees and palm trees. Many of the restaurants were quite good. We ate at several of them including eating at the hotel,which at first realized that the earlier meals offered to us were quite too foreign for us, and adapted its menu to please us more. Hotel Agdal also had a pool and a bar which was nice. Overall, great trip. I would go back there."
20,“Hard to find any positives”,"I spent 10 days in and around Marrakech in March 2011 with my girlfriend. The local children would throw stones at us in the street. On one occaision my girlfriend had a local man walk up to her, and punch hard into his own hand right in front of her (and we were dressed very respectfully). It was very upsetting. The only people we met who were nice were the people who worked in the Riads. Everyone else would quite happily wipe their feet on you if it meant they could get a few quid of out you. I know what you might think, I'm being too precious, however I have travelled to a lot of places and backpacked through similar countries. I expect to come across inflated prices and desperate people. I am happy to pay these inflated prices provided they are not astromincally out of proportion. I 'travel far and spread the wealth' etc. However I have never come away from a place with such a low opinion of the locals.Save your money and go somewhere else."
50,“A dream come true!”,"Just returned from 4 days in Marrakech. It was an amazing experience. We stayed in Riad Merstane which was in the medina about 20 minutes walk from the main square Jemaa el Fna. As I have mobility problems we used the Petit Taxis a lot to and from our Riad and they were very reasonable. In the main square 'La Place' as it is also known there were very many wonderful places to eat, some we really liked were Les Premices, Cafe Arabe and Cafe de France for coffees and the most wonderful mint tea. The souks are amazing and yes you do get pestered but its all done in the very best humour and we did not feel threatened. We haggled and laughed with the people and had a great time getting some amazing bargains. We also took a local Grand Taxi to the Atlas mountains and had him drop us in the new town Gueiliz for a mooch around.I cannot fault a single thing, I would return tomorrow and enjoy the people, food, atmosphere and colours of this wonderful place."
40,“Great Place for Culture”,"Marrakesch is a magical city. It is loud and charming at the same time. The main square is where everything takes place day and night. At night, it is more interesting. Eating on the square at night can be interesting experience. Stay away for stands where Westerners hang out. Hang out with the locals. The Souks is worth a trip or two. It does get a bit tiring bargaining for everything. You need to do it. Don't forget to get out of the Medina to explore the green parks and bigger streets outside the city walls. All and all, the city is fairly interesting for a few days. Highly recommended"
50,“Interesting place!”,"Visited Marakech in Feb 10 and this was my first insight into the Arab World.Only there for three days but I would recommend Djemaa El - Fna; the main sqaure. A crazy place! Dancing monkeys, snake charmers, it's all true! With a curious combination of sites and smells!If you like peace and quiet I would not remommend it, as continuious snake charming oboes coupled with bongo drums are constant.Plenty of food stalls offering a variety of exotic cuisine, anything from snail soup to sheep's head stew but constatnly busy so I assume this is good sign.The Souks (markets) are also interesting, hundreds of indoor stalls that are never ending; selling traditional crafts together with the usual tourist fodder but be ready to haggle, whatever you buy and whoever you by from. Beware of mopeds though, as locals think nothing of riding these noisy little machines all through the markets so imagine a combination of petrol fumes mixed with incense, plus the odd ""toiletry odour,"" with hordes of people; tourists with locals and you are someway close to getting the picture.I would recommend having tea on one of the main sqaure cafe balconies at dusk (as this is when the place really comes to life) and they offer a super panoramic views with the Koutoubia Minaret in the distance.Well worth a visit and although a little intimidating at first, generally I felt pretty safe. Just be vigillant and be firm if offered directions (not always where you want to go!) saying non merci as everyone is a tour guide! It's also written in some travel guides that people will demand payment after leading you through endless narrow streets and we were told that a particular tourist attraction we wanted to visit was ""closed"" but on our arrival we discovered it was open, so I can only assume that this was a diversionary tactic in order to lure us back to markets to spend more money.Worth visiting the Ali Ben Yousseff Merdersa - Quaranic School for superb intricate architecture, painstakingly hand carved and a stark contrast to western baroque and classical styles.One last tip; beware of snake charmers in Djemaa El - Fna as payment will be demanded to take a photo and they can be pretty aggresive if people don't wish to make a contribution! And, if you are a passionate animal welfare campaigner I wouldn't recommend it!"
50,“Five Top Tips from recent visit”,"My top 5 Marrakesh TipsTip 1 - Don't but spice from stalls. Go to a modern supermarket where they are 35-60 Dm a kilo instead of 120 Dm. There are two I can suggest. (1) Turn left out of the Cyber Park and continue until you see the petrol station. The supermarket is opposit the petrol station. (Avenue Moulay El Hassan). (2) Opposite Jardin Majorelle on the junction with Boulevarde Prince Moulay Abdellah. (This one also sell beers, wines and spirits)Tip 2 - Much of the saffron sold in the stalls if made from coloured hairs from corn on the cob that have been dyed. Genuine saffron should have three prongs to it and the jar should have pieces of safron in varying colours (some will be slightly golden) Pay around 30 Dm a gram. See this picture below.Tip 3 - When using a Petit Taxi insist on them using the meter. If not just get out. There will another along soon. Our usual trip from the centre to our hotel (2.5 km) always cost less than 10 DM.Tip 4 - Don't be afraid to use the bus. It's easy and they are reasonably frequent. The 18 and 11 go to the airport and cost 3.5 Dm per journey.Tip 5 - Take a compass!Enjoy your stay. We had 8 days and loved it!Happy to advise anyone who wants to contact me.Matthew"
50,“my favorite place in Morocco”,"I have been to Marrakech twice and would highly recommend it as a travel destination. It is a very friendly place, even though at first glance it might be a bit imposing. If you go I'd recommend:1. Stay at a riad - while you could stay at a regular hotel you will gain a lot more of the Moroccan cultural experience if you stay at one of the small riads in the medina. There are lots to chose from. They are great places to stay and you are right in the midst of the core of the city.2. Visit the main square (Jemma el Fna). What a great place to wander around and see all sorts of food stalls and enertainment. Watch out for the snake charmers!3. Check out the Saadian tombs - another site worth seeing that is easy to walk to if you are in the souk area.3. Take the time (at least one day) to visit the Atlas Mountains. You can take a cab to the Ourika Valley and see how the Berbers live. You can also see local potters and other craftspeople. It is a great place to do some hiking even if only for a few hours."
20,“consider carefully”,"Ahhhh.... that need for Winter sun, to escape the cold, and the frost. Marrakech has welcomed many a traveller hoping for some out of season warmth.And so, I found myself in the city for a week in February 2011, with a romantic notion that i would find Sunshine and a chance to immerse myself in the city's culture...I stayed in a Riad, not a Western hotel, as I wanted the authentic Moroccan experience. It was perhaps asking too much of myself.....I expected poverty, of course i did. However expectation and experience are two very different things.To witness at close quarters, the desperation of daily life for the masses is harrowing. Nothing can prepare you for the shock.Begging is rife, and unavoidable.The Souks, are filthy, filled with stuff that you could buy for much less back home. Rugs, candle holders, ornaments...... haven't these vendors ever heard of Ikea? Its not a comfortable shopping experience. Try to leave a shop empty handed, and they become very aggressive... it can be harrowing. And frankly - it's all very, very overpriced. Bartering isn't for everyone, and even the bottom line price is extortionate.Careful with photographs- people demand money for accidentally being in photographs. Don't ask for directions or trust anyone other than policemen. I was advised that i could trust shopkeepers, however this wasn't my experience.The new town is more Westerner friendly, and provided me with the best food i had during my stay. Eating out is disproportionately expensive- Morroccan food consisted of pastilles (pasties) and tagines (stews)......Let's face it a pasty from Greggs costs £1.... a pastille here nearly £12!!! No wonder the locals are so desperate.The city has a open top tourist bus, it's good value. However it's only after this trip, you realise there isn't that much to see or do:The Kotoubia mosque, is poor, the surrounding gardens are pretty but all the fountains are crumbling and dry.The city walls, are just walls.The Menara, dull and ruined by walk ways - but best seen at dusk.The marjorelle gardens are the exception and well worth a visit.So if you do plan to visit marrakech, do so only for a day or two.... visit the Atlas, Casablanca or the Sahara, that way you're not clock watching waiting for you flight back home."
40,"“Marrakech, Moroocco”","What an interesting place, great food, great sights, friendly locals.Don't be afraid to try something a little bit different! P.S.Not advisable to drive in the town centre. Taxis cheap."
20,“Morocco experience”,"Just returned from a 2 week trip to Morocco. We are a mature couple (retired) and we backpacked our way from Fes to Marrakech, taking in Agadir and Essaouira. We'd been looking forward to the trip but found disappointment mounting with each day. Firstly, we knew we would be hasseled a lot but not by how much. It became impossible to do your own thing without being approached every couple of mins. The young men on a few occasions got quite aggressive if you decided not to given them money for showing you 50 mtrs down the road and this happened so frequently we got really tired of it in the end. A lot of the sites were interesting and the architecture stunning but there was not that much to see in Fes or Marrakech. A lot of the religious buildings you cant go into. The medinas are fascinating with a most amazing array of goods to see and buy if you want, if only they would leave you alone to actually look at things and ponder over them, this doesnt happen you are grabbed the second you pause. The Riads are one of the best things in Morocco, they are stunning and lovely to stay in because you also get really friendly staff who care about you, but the drawback is they are not sound proofed any every whisper can almost be heard due to the echoey way the riads are built. But my main complaint was the eyesore of rubbish in the streets and the incredible noise and pollution in the streets, the streets are jam packed with every vehicle, and mad kids on scooters who drive straight at you. Dont think zebra crossings help, they are ignored by all drivers. The exhaust fumes were so toxic, my husband caught an infection which resulted in sinus problems, and I also had sore throat and eye infection. \I can only assume it was from the extreme pollution. Morocco in my view has a long way to go to become environmentally friendly, plus seeing us as just tourist to exploit to the extreme was also not welcomed. This is gloomy review I know as lots of people seem, to love it or dont mind the dirt and smells of bad sanitation. So maybe its an age thing,. at 64 I suppose I just dont want to have to put up with it. Agadir is just purely a tourist town with lots of smart hotels, and a wonderful beach and if all you want is winter sun and a nice hotel then head for Agadir which is just touristy with nice hotels, but my preference would be Essaouira, wonderful beach and a small town and fishing port which still has its originality about it and hasnt hit the big tourist trail."
20,“Marrakech - Worst Airport”,"We have just returned from a weekend in Marrakesh.The people generally seem very unhelpful and anything is too much trouble.The worst of all is the Passport Control on arrival.We joined a queue with no more than 25 people in it and it took us 1hr 45mins to get through. Totally unacceptable and our first visit will be our last. we have better things to do than to pander to the pathetic ""services"" of Marrakech airport.They had better sort it out quickly or their Tourist Trade will disappear before their eyes, mind I don't know if they will be able to wake up before it is too late!B Flynn , Edinburgh"
40,“1st taste of Morocco.”,"We decided on Marrakech for a few days of Winter sun late January to beat the mid-winter blues. Although the weather wasn't as warm as we expected we found Marrakech to be a fantastic new world of colour and spice and the people warm and welcoming.The souks of the Medina offer great shopping once you tune into bargaining, and paying only what you think is a good deal. Many of the beautiful items are made locally by Artisans for very reasonable costs and a great place to go & shop if you are decorating a home.Its a place you either love or hate, but we can't wait to go back again with empty suitcases very soon. The atmosphere at night, and eating in the square is a must, you can eat well for under a fiver!"
20,“Marrakesh warning”,"After reading reviews about Marrakesh and the Amine hotel I wondered if we had made a rash mistake.True to form we arrived to find taxis wanting to take us to the hotel amine for 300 dirhams. but I walked to the bus stop quoting 100 only and they agreed, but when the driver dropped us off he still wanted more.The hotel I found delightful and the staff very nice yes its dated and getting old but aren't we all!I cannot think why people would go to Marrakesh again! after the Medina there is nothing there....and to be honest after 2 days the Medina has lost its appealThe weather was wonderful but if you like to sit and watch the world go by whilst having a beer this is the wrong country.The taxi rides are a nightmare from haggling before you get in to doing river dance in the back only to find out they don't put brakes in the rear. These are not journeys for the faint hearted.Think before you book as this isn't a adventure its a dogfight where you cant walk the street without being approached to buy hats sunglasses etc.Over 1 cup of coffee I was asked 6 times if I wanted my shoes cleaning............I was wearing flip flops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I was tempted to buy a Burkha and stick to Cleethorpes next time"
20,“visiting Marrakesh Beware”,Please Beware when visiting Marrakech !!!!!!!! Almost everyone we spoke to in the hotel had had a similar experience they called it being 'Marrakeched'. On the first day armed wih a map we got lost around the souks area. A local man came up and said he was a student and interested to talk and asked where we where from. Dont make conversation with anyone who approaches you in the street !!!. He said he was heading for he main market square and as we were lost we followed him. After taking us past his shop (i said i hadnt any money on me at all just to warn him i wasnt interested) he seemed to lead us more into the alleyways and i suspected not nearer the square. As we turned to walk away in another direction he demanded 'PAY ME NOW'. Refusing he was very aggressive and even threatened go to the hotel to fetch money. He eventually left but the experience was very frightening. Please beware and although advised otherwise it is best not to talk to anyone unless in a shop etc.
50,“Fandabadozeeeeeeee Marrakech”,"What a wonderful, vibrant, slightly edgy, fun, thrilling and interesting place! Getting the idea that we were charmed by Marrakech? Too right! Just back from four days there and still smiling about it. It was my first trip to Africa; as a 'blonde' female I had some concerns about the hassle that some of my friends had alluded to in North African countries- no problems at all, and while people watching from places like the Cafe de France I didn't see any females getting hassle there either.We did get up front offers of a 'guide' here and there, which seemed on both occasions to lead directly to a friend's stall within the souks but there was no problems when politely declined.The el fna square was incredible- as we approached in the dark at about 8pm the noise of drummers, pipes, chants with the blazing lights and smoke above the food stalls, with the exotic mixture of smells, colourful and varied clothing, was something we'll never forget.Poverty couldn't be ignored, and its worth accepting/planning that there will be times you will want to put your hand in your pocket to make a donation here and there. An old woman came up to me and my husband asking for the remainder of our coke bottle for ""la sucre"". We handed it over- she was so delighted she pumped both our hands vigorously before marching off. There were sad things like women begging late at night with young children. The moroccan humour - unknown to me - was very evident and very funny- in the food stalls we were entreated to visit stalls with statements such as ""owned by Heston Blumenthal"", ""delia smith is my sister in law"" and ""lovely jubbly!""The souks were amazing- I like to think I've got a good sense of direction- but after half an hour of twisting narrow alleys we popped out into a bustling market, completely clueless as to where we were- didn't matter- just had a cup of moroccan tea and plunged back in again- we always made sure our review of a map/ guide book coincided with a cuppa so we could look gormlessly at a map and take stock for a bit without making it obvious we were lost.Quiet places too all over, and it was great to see moroccan families relaxing with picnics in the school holidays.Each night we walked back to our hotel, the kenzi farah which was about a 15 minute walk from the centre. It was situated in quite a 'well to do' area of the Hivernage- we felt very safe all the time- the lack of alcohol fuelled nights as per some city centres meant no change in atmosphere later on and I saw a lot of young kids out late at night.Anyway Marrakech- my first experience of an Islamic, and an African city- wonderful wonderful, we'll be back"
40,"“Fantastic, magical city!!”","Having just returned from a brilliant, eye opening 4 day break in Marrakesh I can only reflect on what a great time I had. We stayed in the Riad Olema which I will say was a very good choice. It was decorated to a very high standard without being over the top and located in an ideal area for easy access to all the tourist attractions.For people who are going there for the first time like I did, I will stress that expect the unexpected and dont be worried by your first impressions. Your senses take a battering when you leave the airport, the sheer nature of the hustle and bustle (even in janaury when we went) is evident immediately. You will find it intimidating and probably a bit scarey but honestly you will realise your worries were short lived.You WILL get lost in the Souk (market) within the Medina and I do advise you try and draw a map for you to know how to get out. We did get lost on our way to our Riad late one evening not realising the entrance and exits get locked!! Dont try and get back through the Souk at night as you could find yourself being locked in. Also never walk around at night alone, some shadey looking young men in the Souk do look out for vulnerable people so try and stay within sight of tourists or shop keepers.Il get all the warnings out the way first, there isnt many. Dont let any young men give you directions, they will follow you and insist on you paying them for their trouble, no matter how useful, just ignore them and keep walking, they soon get the picture. Always Always Always confirm a price on anything you are buying. The Moroccans will try every trick known to man to make you cough up more. My fiance got a henna tattoo that was priced up for 30dh in the ladies book only to be asked for 200dh on completion. Just be firm but polite, they are just trying thier luck so be savvy to it. Always confirm taxi prices too before getting in.Be sure to try the restaurants in the Souk, absoloutly gorgeous food for not much money. If you fancy a pint with your tajine forget it, no alcohol anywhere in the gaze of the general public but your Riad and hotel will cater for you in that area. Some of the local Moroccan wines were very nice, especially Sahara. If you like shopping try Gueliz and Hivernage areas (New town) as there are some good shops there. We heard there were some bars and clubs there but to be fair we never bothered.All in all we had a great time and I will challenge anyone not to fall a little bit in love with the City. Get a good Riad (essential), this will make your trip. Dont think it will be like your normal holidays to Majorca because it wont, simple. It was something way different to what I call a typical holiday but I can gurantee I will go back. I love the place!!Enjoy,"
40,“Marrakch in January.....ideal get away!”,"In January we went for 4 days to Marrakech. The weather was lovely and warm 24'C. The evenings were cooler. it is a beautiful city with lots ot do. It is very easy to travel round, the people are very friendly and helpful. The bazzaars for shopping are lovely but we never got the hang of bargaining so I am sure we ended up paying too much for everthing!!!!It is ideal for a few days away came back relaxed and felt we had had a porper long holiday rather han a few days!"
50,“My favourite bolt-hole”,"I have just booked my 4th trip to Marrakech and this time I plan to go it alone. I've stayed in both the old and new towns, and each has their merits, depending upon your needs. New town offers big rooms, pools and access to additional restaurants and facilities outside of the old town (such as the splendid Grand Cafe de la Poste, which I always frequent). A riad in the old town offers a more traditional experience, and they really do feel like your own home. This time I'm staying in Riad ChiChi again, lovely food, beautiful rooms and the kindest staff - I never want to leave! A trip to the 'best spa in the world', Les Bains de Marrakech is a must. You will emerge feeling a new person. I've not made it to the Atlas mountains yet, Im always too busy relaxing, but do visit this beautiful country. The food, the people, the spas, not to mention the shopping, make it well worth the short flight from London."
20,“short trip to marrakesh”,"we made the mistake of taking sterling Travellers Cheques as advised in many of the guide books.No-one would change them,Neither banks or change bureu's.we eventually found one Hotel in the centre of the old City, who would do it, with commision.The ATM's are readily available, but charge commision.Take Sterling, it's easier, but keep it close to your person and use a Hotel safe."
30,“Interesting but won't return”,"The problem with Marrakech is that so many people have been writing about its wonderfulness for so long, so many books published, so many films made, there is nothing unexpected once one arrives except the unpleasant. The unpleasant starts at the airport where the taxi drivers operate a closed shop demanding an extortionate fixed fare into town, 20 to 30 euros for a 3km drive. This practice is very obviously condoned by the airport authorities and the government. This is perpetuated by taxi drivers within the town to the extent where it becomes easier to walk everywhere rather than waste precious life moments arguing. Then there is the main square where all the magical and wondrous things happen in ""Hideous Kinky"" except not any more. There is sometimes one snake charmer with a few limp snakes and a few 'magicians' wondering about, but mostly predatory stall holders waiting to charge foreigners 3 euros for a bottle of water. The food stalls serve what is arguably the most delicious and reasonably priced food in Marrakech, but at a possible price to one's health as dishes are washed in a bowl of water changed only once or twice in an evening. None of the stalls have running water. The souks are fascinating until one wishes to purchase an item when stall holders can become overenthusiastic with their pricing and reluctant with the bargaining. The hop on hop off tourist bus is good value, it is fixed price and runs to time. It goes everwhere worth visiting in Marrakech so if visiting for long enough it is advisable to consider purchasing a 48 hour ticket. The museums are worth visiting, some of the palaces are stunningly beautiful, entrance charges are reasonable, but don't be lulled into a false sense of calm. Once in the museum you will be coralled by attendants providing possibly false repetitive information in poor English then requesting payment for this dubious priviledge thereby shattering any enjoyment or sense of pleasure. There appear to be hundreds of riads all looking much the same and providing much the same services, the better ones are very expensive. The much vaunted subtle cuisine of Morocco is difficult to find in the restaurants of Marrakesh which offer a limited selection of harshly spiced unattractive dishes at prices which would not be out of place in Paris. The Majorelle Gardens are striking and unusual, again prices at the souvenir shop and cafe aimed at the super rich. The cafe just outside the Majorelle managed to return change short of 10 euros and only very, very reluctantly agreed to make good the difference. One was given the impression that this is their normal practice and one that is not usually questioned. Marrakech is still an interesting tourist destination but the population has set up barriers to enjoying its charms which are impossible to overcome without possessing extremely deep pockets. Perhaps this is deliberate, aimed at exclusion. This is very much a rich man's holiday destination."
40,“A place of many cultures”,"A brilliant safe place to be , friendly locals good food, shops and of course many many little alley ways . Must see the square Jemaa el Fna before 1600hrs and after when it all changes. Remember even the worst photogragh will cost 2-3 Dirrahms.French and Arabic speaking with a touch of Jamie Oliver English. DON'T forget to notify your Card company or your card will be refused and have a back up system in place."
50,“Crazy city”,"Marrakech is really crazy. When you see Jemaa el Fna (the main square) you feel like being in the heart of Maghreb. The place changes during the day. In the morning is quite quiet, you start with coffee at the terrace, watching men in juice-selling stalls. Later appear guys with snakes and monkeys and also local musicians. In the afternoon the local restaurants start to serve dinners. Mixture of scents and sounds slowly gets you in the right mood. You go for a walk in souks - local bazaars hidden in narrow streets. But walk carefully, because motorbikes and cars are ewerywhere!When you want to rest for a while go to the Ville Nouvelle - New District. It is European like, you can even have a beer in a nice pub. It is also the best place to rent a care, car rentals are everywhere :)"
40,“Easy to get lost”,"We stayed in Marrakech for four days, but two to three would have been enough ( not a big shopping fan). Enjoyed walking around town and getting lost ( much easier to do than in other cities because of all the small alleys). Did not go wild over the Majorelle gardens- nice colors, but very small. Loved the food stalls at Jamaa el-Fna and the afternoon stop at Patisserie des Princes. The city would benefit from better signage, especially in the Mellah neighborhood and for the various Riads around the city. Compass comes really handy :)"
40,"“Marrakesh: a GREAT place but please ""READ ME!""”","Hi folks, I have just returned from Marrakesh - my husband booked it as a surprise for my 40th and it was great.The weather was excellent and it never rained - hoorah!The people are friendly but I cannot express enough that you really do 'need humour' with some of the folk especially when haggling. This is the name of the game but a good bargain can be had, so please don't let this put you off.However, I am writing this review for several reasons and I feel I must put them here for caution reasons:1. Do 'not' take Euro travellers cheques. I was advised to and it took us an hour to find a hotel that would cash them in (that was the Grand Hotel Tazi in the Medina)- there was a 15 dh charge per cheque!2. There are loads of ATMs (use Nationwide current account as they do not charge for overseas withdrawals).3. Be very aware of the locals saying 'here this gift is for free'... a lady took my arm and drew a henna tattoo on and then demanded money for her children....4. Whatever you do, this is the best advice, please ask the price for any item before purchasing it because the transaction will change before your eyes. ""Agree the price before committing"" or having any work done or going into the taxi etc.5. If your hotel offers excursions - use these as they are trusted and reliable sources who guarantee your safety.6. I stress the last point because we were walking through the souks and a local asked if we were tourists, it was obvious. He said do you want to see the 'tanneries' (where the leather is made) and we said yes. Before we knew it we had walked outside of the souks and into an unknown area 1.5 hours from hour hotel. We were taken to a shop - all the time being reassured the tour was for free - and the owner was very hospitable and showed us the finished products. After 30 minutes he just assumed we wanted to buy a rug and demanded 7800 dh and we said no. He became quite unpleasant and we left the shop quite shaken. The chap who had led us to the shop was waiting outside and he too demanded 100 dh for the tour..... we gave him 50 dh and just left. We did not know where we were going but with luck we managed to get back to the square. We reported it to the hotel and who confirmed it was a gang from the outskirts who scam tourists like this. The morale of the story is: please do not trust anyone to take you for a tour or even show you where something is unless he is a policeman or an official guide. During our incident, there was no police insight.7. When we were leaving Marrakech airport - it states at the gate you are allowed to have a maximum 1000 dh to take when checking in for your flight home.8. When you arrive in Marrakech and to save time at departure later - pick up the landing cards at arrival and complete before departure.On the whole we were there for 2 1/2 days and it was great if you stay in the area that is crowded etc. Do not walk to areas outside of the souks. But the people are friendly despite the odd folks being pushy and in your face.Go to Marrakech and have a great time but please pack your humour as well. Enjoy and have a good trip, NW"
30,“Marrakech Souks & Red Square - Hagglers dream..”,"Had some pretty awful experiences of traders in the souks even though I accept they are not all the same. I would suggest that anyone who likes fixed prices considers very carefully if they want to experience haggling the Moroccan way before venturing out. The problem is that many sellers do not like you to window shop. Any eye contact made is an opportunity for a trader to try and sell (rip) you off. On 2 separate occasions I had traders threatening me physically because I did not want to buy. On another where I spoke to 2 american tourists who were being charged extortionate prices the seller went ballistic. Suffice to say he had a good selection of english foul language...so overall these are the memories I left Morocco with. But as mentioned people are not all the same and there are some really nice people, just how do you find them..! Also be aware in the souks and near the Tanneries of kids leading you astray to earn a few dirhams...Just ask a senior citizen or a local instead..!Also be aware of the uncontrolled food sellers in Jamma al Fena who will charge you crazy prices after you have sat down. rather eat in a restaurant on the side of the square.Recommend you book trips with good organisations and you'll enjoy Morocco..."
20,“So so Marrakesh”,"Booked a week in Marrakesh but came back after five days.Stayed thirty minutes out of town on the Fez road, hotel was fine but was like staying in a five star prison behind high walls, steel gates and security. Unable to leave the compound which in any case was in an area not unlike a massive dirty construction site, dozens of uncompleted projects and an unmade road.The town itself was interesting for about an hour, after that it only appeals if you like being nagged by people trying the hard sell of poor quality goods at inflated prices.One very serious point however which caused us to return early was the widespread mistreatment of animals, mainly donkeys. We saw injured animals being overloaded and beaten, another with severe leg injuries left (to die?) against the side of the main road, no food or water provided.Traffic (no pollution controls) fumes were dreadful as was the complete disregard for basic safety.I can think of many other places more worthy of tourist revenues, but if it is last on the list, ok."
40,“1st time to Morocco - what an experience!”,"Have just come back from Marrakesh. It was my first time to Morocco and found it the most interesting and exciting place. If you go, just embrace it. Try the food, try haggling in the souks, try staying in a riad in the medina, try quadbiking through the desert up to the mountains, try a few words of Arabic out, - just make sure you try it all and you are bound to have an amazing time."
40,“Marrakech - Embrace the madness!”,"Marrakech is a great location for all year round sun. It was still 28 degrees when we went in November. Make sure you get a hotel that is within walking distance of the attractions so you don't have to get a taxi as the taxi drivers will rip you off. Short journeys should cost 10-20dh but they will often ask for up to 50dh. The night market at the Jemaa El Fna was brilliant. The colours and smells were an experience. Be careful of the snakes and monkeys! Prepare youself for the souks and take a deep breath. Its like a big maze and appears never ending. The sellers will try and massively over charge you. At least halve what they ask for. They may get a bit aggressive if you take up their time looking at something and then don't buy it. We got chased out of the souks by a man from a stall and then he recognised us the next day and chased us again! I didn't like that experience at all. I would recommend Cafe Arabe on Rue Moussaine near the souks. The food was amazing and the restaurant was a haven. It had a lovely shaded court yard downstairs and a roof terrace above. The majorelle gardens were worth a visit and were on the tour bus route. Again this was a nice haven and had a lovely cafe within it. It cost 30dh to get in. The tour bus wasn't that impressive as you couldn't always see the sights from the bus, but its was good to get around and hop on and off. I would recommend a trip to Marrakech for the sun and the experience. A 3 night stay is long enough. Embrace the madness!"
30,“Once in a lifetime (I hope)”,"Ok I'll admit I'm not a really seasoned traveller and I do like my comfort so please take that into account in what follows...Most people I spoke to who had been to Marrakech loved it and some had returned for a few visits. I won't return. The main reason was the pollution - traffic mainly. Clearly no emission controls. Taxis, and their drivers, are a real pain - who wants to haggle about a fare every time and who really wants to travel in a car, with their family, with no seat belts? They tell you they are not required in taxis but guide books say different. And if you like a little adrenalin then crossing a road as pedestrian is worth a try.Souhks are worth seeing but the famous square left me cold - a few amateurish entertainers and plenty of smoke. Ah yes, smoking - virtually everywhere, ruined the cafe & bar experience but that's not unique to Marrakech I suppose.Being born a donkey or horse in Marrakesh is to draw the reincarnation short straw - we just tried to ignore their lot.Still we are glad we went and saw it for ourselves but we all enjoyed a trip to the Atlas Mountains more."
40,“A strange but magical place”,"My husband and I travelled to Morocco after watching Jamie Oliver's TV programme. What excited us was the food stalls in the Medina as we both love our exotic foods. Our first experience of Marrakech was not a bad one at all. We travelled end of September, being glad not to have kids around. It was very hot at this time of the year, expecting it to get hotter, but a nice way to top up the tan.Marrakech was a magical place with a lot of culture to see, and Agadir is for the beach lovers, a beautiful coastal resort...two completely different cities but worth visiting.Because the Moroccan Dirham is a closed currency, you assume you will only get the currency at the airport, but fear not there are plenty of exchange bureaus in the old town Jema Al Fna. So our advice is to exchange enough to get you to the hotel and food when you first arrive.Marrakech is NOT cheap. For some reason they think it is ok to pay £4 for a small bottle of coca-cola in the hotels (something which costs 75p back in the UK) The market places in Jema Al Fna (old town) seem to think you will pay silly prices. The leather bags are very nice there, and we were asked to pay 950DH = £95! Definitely not worth it, especially as the leather is untreated, so we haggled down to 550DH BARGAIN! You must haggle with the taxis also, towards the end of the holiday we found out that a taxi from Golden Tulip hotel to the new town was only 6DH, and we had been paying 30DH or more. There is a lot of haggling to do, otherwise you will get ripped off!During the day, the square at Jema Al Fna is very nosiy with snake charming flutes. Don't be obliged to donate your money if you look at one of the street acts, donate your change and start walking away quickly. If you don't mind exploring, it's nice to see the little streets and the houses behind the markets via alleyways.You must go the square at night, what an amazing place. Food stalls galore, fresh food and very good value for money. The new town is also worth a visit. This is a complete contrast to Jema Al Fna. Not much of a drinking culture but there are nice cafe/bars where you get alcoholic drinks, and not badly priced either. We dined at Queen Mags, a trendy cafe/bar. The food was very nice and traditional.Other than the prices and hassle from the entertainers, we really enjoyed Marrakech. It has a very strange vibe to it, and does draw you in...something magical.Our hotel was the Golden Tulip hotel, which is located perfectly in the middle of both the old town and new town, we walked to both areas. The service was slow, you have to have a lot of patience in Marrakech altogether. When dining at 11pm we were welcomed by a belly dancer (the first and last time we had seen one). The rooms are big and clean with a nice view (unfortunately they all have twin beds, a bit awkward for a loving couple). The pool area was very clean, but not many beds around so it was first come first served during breakfast. The food at this hotel was average, we tended to go out and eat in Jema Al Fna, where it was a lot cheaper and fresh.We do advise to take a bottle of water if you do walk to the towns as there are no shops on the way and it does get very hot.We then travelled to Agadir, via SupraTours coaches. This coach service was good value for money, about £20 for a 3.5hour journey from Marrakech to Agadir. They are organised and have a ticket inspector who will advise if you are getting on to the right coach. Lovely air conditioned coaches, extremely clean. There are no lifts when you get to Agadir coach station, you have to carry your suitcases up 2 flights of stairs to the exit, but I had a strong husband who carried ours.We stopped at the RIU Tikada Beach hotel in Agadir, a Thomsons hotel, and must admit it was beautiful. The reception lounge area was huge and clean, with a Moroccan theme throughout. You are welcomed with a nice cup of Moroccan tea. Our room was even bigger than that in Marrakech, no complaints at all. We had toiletries and bath robes in our bathroom. This was an all inclusive hotel and there was a nice variety of foods available. The service was very good also, always someone happy to help. The resort has beautiful sunbeds, and the beach location is amazing. We have no complaints about this hotel, except for the twin beds again."
40,“Mixed but interesting experience”,"Our week in Marrakech turned out to be better than I expected based on reading reviews and hearing from friends who had been there. I was in fact apprehensive because the negative accounts recalled serious harrassment from vendors who wouldn't give up pestering them to buy or acknowledge the words 'No thank you' in any language.The colour, sounds and images of Marrakech will remain with us there is no doubt. We chose to stay very close to the main 'square' Djemaa el Fna so that we didn't waste time and money travelling into the centre. That was a good plan. On arrival in Morrocco we fended off the taxi drivers fairly easily and found the airport bus 19 stop just outside the airport building.Once in the main square, and using the excellent Rough Guide map, walked to our Riad. The address wasn't easy to find but the AA Essential Marrakech travel guide advice to ask shopkeepers for directions rather than take them from young boys who approached us was sound. As it turned out the Riad had two entrances and the 'other' one would have been easier to locate! Our Riad was a small 3star Easyjet one and lovely. The range of types and sizes of Riads is endless but we loved the old original family one we had selected with its tranquillity and serenity from the outside hubub.The old city centre is busy with daily life making and selling all manner of goods. We enjoyed the 'square' both during the day when dancers, snake charmers and drummers etc vie for tourists' attention and in the evening when the activities change. Around 6pm the carts arrive which carry the many 'camp kitchen/restaurants' serving food well into the night. It's a marvel to see the staff construct their workplace- and even more entertaining to hear their very clever ideas for persuading customers to eat at their particular stall. They switch between languages with ease and have everyone laughing in seconds. We soon learned after the first night eating there that sitting at the front tables we were the target for all of the women and children begging. We found that very difficult as some of the children on their own are little more than 4 or 5 we guessed. One solution was to give them some of our food rather than coins, so that we felt they themselves would benefit rather than whoever was 'managing' them!We learned later on a trip to the Berber villages and the Atlas mountains that children are hired out for 100dhm to beg; that gives some indication of the activity being deemed worthwhile.The tourist bus has two routes: we did both on the same (our first) day to orientate ourselves with the city. It was one of the better ones we've been on. At the Number 1 stop you alight from the old town route and wait for the 'other' route which goes through the palm areas and more open parts of the city where tourists can alight and take rides on dromedaries. The time spent between buses gave us the opportunity to visit the tourist information across the road where we gained an excellent (hopefully independent) recommendation of a travel agency (IMZI) which ""Is reliable, trustworthy and you won't have any problems afterwards"" they said. We guessed there was more to be read there 'between the lines' about other agencies and guides judging by some of the reviews we had read! We booked for a day , the four of us in an air-conditioned car, for 32 euros each, to the Atlas mountains visiting two valleys and Berber villages with a stop for lunch included in a truly Berber home. We cannot overexaggerate what a wonderful trip that was, not only because our driver/guide was so willing to answer all of our searching questions about the culture and society throughout the day, but also to be fed in a real Berber home was an amazing privilege. We learned that day too that recently the police have cracked down on guides who used to take tourists to their favourite shops etc and get back-handers. That I suspect was where the negative reports about hassling emanated from. We had demands for money from performers etc. if we took photographs in the square; and given that many Moroccans' religion deters them from having photographs of themselves taken, we soon learned to be more subtle and considerate about it. I hate not being able to browse in shops but when we discovered the Artesanal Ensemble in the Mohammed V Avenue our prayers were answered by having somewhere which supports local artesans and with fixed prices allows browsing freely and gave us an idea of what we might be prepared to pay when we did haggle in the souks.The one aspect of our week which surprised us was that although spices are prevalent everywhere in the shops, we didn't find much evidence of it in the food, nor was there a great variety on the menus. Two of us who eat fish and veg but not meat were struggling to find anything other than couscous and vegetables quite often.We spent most of our time walking or occasionally on local buses visiting notable buildings and gardens etc. The most memorable experiences for me were the times we ventured into buildings which sometimes had ancient crumbling doors on the street but which were palacial inside! Not only the internal decor was always utterly stunning but they are labyrinthine inside and completely unpredictable from outside. I would recommend anyone to step inside- once you have of course learned how to look your 'guide' in the eye and remind them you don't want to buy!! Its certainly wonderful to stay in a traditional Riad; some are so big that they have swimming pools within. There are plenty to suit everyone and as close or distant from the centre as you wish."
50,“Want to step out of your comfort zone? This is the place for you!”,"Be prepared to let Marrakesh amaze you. It is a city of contradictions and contrasts, colour, noise, smells and above all people. The Medina is unbelievably busy with people, animals and motor bikes. Imagine tiny alley ways teeming with traders selling everything from sheeps heads to tourist goods. Imagine getting lost and paying someone to walk you to where you want to be. ( we called them walking Taxis). Imagine a way of life that is both ancient and yet in step with the world today. Imagine spending far more money than you expected to. Imagine stunning beauty in the buildings and the unbelievable grimness of the tannery. Be prepared to go with an open mind and let it all wash over you. Be prepared to be exhausted too, so stay somewhere where you can really relax. We stayed at the Riad Karmela and I think it is absolutely perfect in every way."
10,“Marrakech Airport (RAK)”,"Absolute chaos reigns supreme so give yourself LOTS of time to get checked in etc........and I mean LOTS!You must pre complete a carte d'embarquement so its best to make sure you get one beforehand (your hotel will probably have them)On-line check-in is not allowed in Morocco so If you are a Ryanair passenger and have checked in on-line be aware that YOU HAVE'NT... you MUST go to the ordinary check-in desk stand in line for 20 mins or so until you reach the desk where they will shuffle some papers and then put a small red stamp on your on-line boarding pass. Then go to departures. At the first gate a man will check that you have the red stamp!!The ordeal is just beginning. Now comes the screening section. This comprises two queues in which you will stand for ages. BE AWARE THE QUEUES ARE SEGREGATED BY SEX SO GET IN THE CORRECT LINE OR YOU WILL BE TURNED BACK.Now for Border Control. This hall has about 15 lines wide enough for 4 people and will be crammed with people many convinced that they have missed or will miss their flight! If there are 20 people ahead of you expect a 40-50 minute wait.Sadly Mr Ryan doesn't alert you to any of this and it is typical of his low esteem for his clients. It is a pity because frankly his airline is good, he runs to time and his prices are fine.And what does all this do for security. Nothing.... it is a paper chase. Security was lax. My own fellow traveller put his perfectly legal insulin needles in his hand baggage and they were not spotted (he has a Docs cert which they should ask for). Liquids were not checked separately...shoes and belts were never removed......."
30,“Give yourself plenty of time to check in at Marrakesh Airport”,"Recently been to Marrakesh flew with Ryanair you are not told that even if you have checked in online you still have to go to check in to get your boarding pass stamped, also give yoursel plent of time to get through passport control many people nearly missed their flight get there early !"
50,"“Truly Arab, truly Berber”","I've visited a dozen towns and cities in Morocco but this one is definitely a leader when it comes to conveying the atmosphere of Morocco. It's both Berber and Arabic. It's a pot combining all Moroccan cultures and everything this country has to offer. During daytime it's best to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the medina, which is old town. Its narrow streets making up a large maze really difficult to navigate around have undeniable charm and are as exotic as you can imagine. After dusk head back to the main sqare, which is Jemma el Fna, that at this time of the day turns into the largest open-air restaurant not only in Morocco but probably in the whole Africa. It's time to feast, savour all the delights the just-appeared stall have to offer."
50,“Go there.......”,"Dirty, hot, noisy, smelly.Totaly different to anywhere I've ever been in Europe or Africa.An amazing mix of people and cultures.Go there. - but don't stay in a smart, luxury, out of town hotel.Stay in a riad, in the old part of Marrakech. Which will give you a true (but still luxurious) taste of Marrakech Morocco."
40,"“Hustle, bustle, and a bit of hassle!”","My wife and I have just returned from our second visit to Marrakech, the first being three years ago. Overall we had a great time but there were the odd few niggles that disappointed us.On the first evening, we decided to wander to the Jemaa el Fna, through the souks from the top end as this was close to where we were staying at Riad Mur Akush (separate review). The majority of the shops were closed due to it being Ramadan but we were happily making our way along. A guy came up to us and pointed us towards ""the place"", the direction we were already going in. We were very non-committal with him and continued on our way. A little while later he came back to us and again pointed us towards ""the place"". After ""following him"", he demanded a present, getting quite aggressive. Only when this was reciprocated did he back down and go on his way, swearing at us.We gave this guy no encouragement that we needed his services but he decided he was going to give them anyway. In hindsight, perhaps we should have stopped or told him we were not going that way, but then again, why should we have to?A similar occurrence happened again to us when we were trying to find an old carpet seller, depicted in a previous Lonely Planet guide, who we had bought some rugs from previously. We took our picture of him but nobody was willing to help, insisting that their carpets were better. Eventually, one shop owner was kind enough to give us directions before grabbing a passer by who obviously knew this man. Furthermore, he claimed to be his son. Whether he was or not, we are unsure albeit there was a striking similarity. After buying a further two rugs from the old man, his ""son"" also wanted a present!On the way along one of the busier roads into town one night, my wife had her bum touched up by a young lad of about 12 or 13. Unfortunately too young to be shown the error of his ways so a sound telling off had to suffice.We have travelled to many different places around the World, considering ourselves to be pretty switched on travellers and have never previously suffered these experiences. It did seem that more people were after something for nothing than on our last visit.That said, we had many positives too. Our Riad and staff were lovely. We had some excellent meals out, particularly at Dar Belkabir at the top right corner of the Jemaa el Fna, whose staff were also excellent. We ate at the food stalls in the Jemaa el Fna one night and although not overly traditional, had a lot of fun. We did plenty of shopping in the souks and were very happy with the prices we paid for our goods (never over half the stated price). Came away with some lovely metalwork and coloured glass lamp shades that survived the trip home! Enjoyed the special atmosphere of Ramadan and then Eid-ul-Fitr.We finished our trip with a nigh on 4 hour spa (traditional hammam, followed by relaxation, 1 hour massage, followed by a 1 hour hot stones massage) at the sumptous Les Bains de Marrakech, well worth a visit, it is like something out of the Arabian Nights, or Prince of Persia for our younger readers!We would still recommend Marrakech as a great short break destination, but with a few words of warning!"
50,“The Myth of the red city!”,"The Red City continue to attract travellers from all over the world. A city open to modern life and the futur but managed to keep with its history, its culture and its colors. The red color is a dominating color as all buildings keep with the same terracota color. The green is everywhere as the old gardends were protected and new gardens were planted everywhere as the city is expanding in the four directions. all the streets are decorated with different fruit trees. Finally the Magie of Marrakech is allways here. A city of one thousand wonder. Come and see!"
40,“A crazy place but worth a visit”,"We arrived in Marrakesh in the evening, so the main square was buzzing with snake charmers, food stalls and various acts. The place is very hetic both day and night.I would advise to stay in a Raid as this was our get away from the madness.We went on a camel trip which was a great experience, you can either catch a taxi to the place (which is cheaper) or have an organised trip.Tips I would give :Becareful when asking for directions, most locals will become your 'guide' they will expect money and they will take you to shops where they are expecting you to buy.If anyone offers to take a photo of you, they are doing it for money.They want to be tipped for everything, even if you are paying for a service, ie. camel ride, the guide will expect a tip.If you want to go to a spa and have an hamman research your spa online first.They dont use loo-paper, so carry some with you, or you can buy it off the children in the main square.Restaurants are cheap to eat in around the square but dont serve alcohol, if you want alcohol, you can get it in restaurants by the Kasba, but you do pay about 3x as much for your meal and alcohol is expensive.If you want a bargain, you have to be tough and haggle in the souks, but they do drive a hard bargain. Have a fixed price in your head before you go there. Do some research first. Items are colourful and beautiful so leave room in your suitcase.In the airport on the way home, duty free does not except dirhams, so dont think you can spend any left over money there."
20,“One Day Horse Treking - Foothills of the Atlas Mountains”,"A 'once in a lifetime' expensive horse treking (6 hours) in the Atlas Mountains looked amazing in the photos. As an experienced rider it looked challenging enough from the images for both me and a partner who is a novice. The cost was about £140 each - for 6 hours riding (the horses looked top notch with english tack) and a lazy lunch prepared by a 'man with a mule' at lunchtime it seemed like a really great unique opportunity and the facts and images stacked up to make it a worthwhile, value for money day..given we were in marrakech for only 3 days in the August heat.I have ranked this expedition purchased online through a reputable website as 2 stars. It deserves a nil star rating in so far as the product is concerned, but out of respect for the people who we met on the day who were kind, courteous, efficient and helpful it has a higher rating.The collection and transfer was on time and good. There were two people who met us. It turned out one was our 'guide' the other was simply driving us to the venue.Rather than arriving at a stables we stopped at a lay-by at a local tourist spot about 50 km from Marrakech where people could pay to have a photo on a horse or camel carrying decorative traditional ceremonial tack. Each had a step ladder to enable people to climb off and on for a photo.Our 'guide' then told us he would find our horses. We were shown to 2 of the horses that'd been working all morning for photos. We mounted and I was suprised to find the horse owner staying along side the horse. Explaining that I was able to ride the guide said the horse belonged to the gentleman and he would be staying along side throughout the ride.This made me feel awful - 2 horses tired and aged horses moving at a sedate walk and 3 people on foot in the august heat. This was not the kind of trek I had in mind.The horses were suitable for complete novices and did not break out of a walk. Indeed, my 20 year old arab simply puffed his way at a snails pace which was fine because we ended up treking in the mid day heat. Again, this made me concerned for everyone's welfare. The horse owner used a stick to encourage my partners horse to move because he was a novice rider - which upset me because it wasn't the horses fault.Our stallions didn't get on so me and my partner spent 4 hours riding separately with a good distance about 20 metres between us. The ceremonial decorative tack was uncomfortable and with no stirrup leathers you had to twist ropes to shorten them which were uncomfortable on your legs if you rode properly.I was relieved to stop for lunch. The mule and his cook making traditional food for us was no where to be seen. However, the guide had brought boiled egg, coke, water, orange, laughing cow cheese, bread and cake which was adequate and very welcome.I transfered onto the horse that was getting hit regularly and he was forward going and enjoyabe to ride. More importantly he was spared the stick on the return leg of the journey.The day was well organised by the guide. He was slick, helpful and good to talk to about anything and happy to answer questions about the area and culture. I admired his entrepreneurial spirit and he was a good link for the local villagers and tourists. The horse men who walked with their horses were courteous and have a good raport with them. They derive income from their horses and are clearly proud about them. It felt like a privilege to ride their horses and I hope the guide reimbursed them well.The riding was not what the website offered. However, we rode for a while in the foot hills via the river bed and village tracks. We saw the apple harvesting and digging the fiver bed for housing material..ambling along like a procession of people and a couple of riders. We saw a glimpse of village life and the new builds springing up - detached, taller and wider than traditional houses.It was a relief to see our taxi waiting in the layby. I hope our expensive 'once in a lifetime' trip paid for in dollars had made it into the pockets of the taxi driver and two horse owners. They were wonderful. Our guide was more like an agent and big respect to him bringing everything together.I didn't get the opportunity to ride fit arab horses at variable speeds and the 3 course cooked lunch for 2 whilst our horses relaxed under the shade. The reality was horses with a doubious work history and scars to prove it and a thrown together picnic. I felt awful having 3 people walking at our slow pace in the heat - it was not what I'd booked; it felt morally wrong. However, at the end of the day the horse men jumped on their horses and galloped in the middle of the road overtaking our taxi - legs kicking, rope swirling, sticks and hats flapping. The horses would finish work early today thank goodness. The look of relief on eveyone's face was good. We were all happy it was over and, thinking about it, it was an opportunity of a lifetime - just for different reasons.."
50,"“Marrakech: The New ""In""”","Marrakech is where used fridges and baby carriages go to live a second life. It’s a city of endless haggling and hustling. A true place of commerce, where one can buy anything from leather goods to tin lamps, from knock-off flip flops to camel-bone decorated knives. Almost defying the law of offer and demand, goods and services are mostly concentrated in certain streets and markets (souks), and more on offer does not mean lower prices, on the contrary. The real showstopper is sheer number and quality of Marrakech’s artists and artisans, from one-man carvers and weavers to mini-factories producing wrought-iron or carved wood pieces by hand and machine. Marrakech is also the city of more hotel rooms than tourists or inhabitants—or so it seemed to me. About ten years ago, foreigners and Moroccans abroad started buying and renovating old town center palaces, called riads, and turning them into stunning B&Bs. The peaceful and traditional medina riads contrast the huge and ubiquitous hotel complexes outside the old town walls, where cosmopolitan Moroccans and nouveau riche live, and where a new scene is taking form, with self-consciously upscale restaurants with trendy décor and serving alcohol. Here, almost empty, wide roads lined with blooming roses contrast the crowded medina streets, jammed with people, bikes, ever-honking mopeds, donkeys pulling carts, and the occasional horse carriage.Marrakech, rumor has it, is the new “in”, rivaling perhaps Fes—another Moroccan imperial city, described in this week’s Time magazine as “an overnight tourist sensation.” The new Sex in the City movie was filmed here recently and it seems that Marrakech is on everyone’s mouth these days. When the Moroccan government opened its airspace in 2006, low-cost European carriers jumped at the opportunity, resulting in French, Italian, Spanish, and British tourists visiting in flocks. But even though flights may be cheap, Marrakech isn’t necessarily so—not if you expect a minimum comfort (such as a clean bathroom) and factor in that you will be overcharged no matter how hard you bargain. That’s part of the fun, though. Everywhere you go in Marrakech, you end up chatting and haggling. And even if you don’t agree on a price and end up walking away, the most important thing—Moroccans say—is to leave avec un sourir. To enjoy Marrakech, you definitely need to keep a sense of humor, otherwise the endlessly creative “friends” and “guides” will only annoy you, and the constant attention and haggling of the medina will become tiring. Be prepared for an overload of sensory experiences: the smell of mint mixed with saffron, oils, and perfumes, tanned leader, tagines cooking on the street, de-blooding chickens, buckets full of escargots, exhaust fumes, and the occasional donkey dung. Merchants trying to attract your attention, men young and old selling hashish, mopeds honking incessantly, people approaching you offering their services or simply asking where you’re from and welcoming you to Morocco. Women hidden behind the Islamic veil offering henna tattoos administered through plastic syringes, snake enchanters, storytellers, and men with trained monkeys happy to climb all over you for a picture and a few dirham. The fine dust that by evening has covered every pore of your skin, the blisters from all the walking, the inevitable dehydration, the heat of the Saharan sun—and much more. This is the beauty and vitality of Marrakech. For more travel reviews, check out my ""view da la lòbbia"" blog (www.ndb-agency.ch/blog)."
40,"“Marrakech, exciting city”","Just returned from Marrakech, prior to travelling i had heard lots of negative stories. You can 't wear shorts, my wife couldnt wear any 'western ' clothing, you will have stomach upset.As long as you are sensible all the scare stories are rubbish. A lot of Moroccan youngsters both male and female wear modern clothing and do not always have shoulders covered, as long as woman/girls do not go over the top with what they wear they will not get any 'unwelcome' attention.Be prepared to get lost in and around the medina as the layout is very compact and there are few or no road signs. When you get lost ask one of the locals to shoe you wear to go, they will expect a small tip. Do not believe a lot of what the local tradesman say with regards to when various locations and businesses are open /closed. I found that they where willing to lie about this in order to convince you to buy items there and then.Male sure you visit to Jewish market area, you can get some bargains and a lot of the prices are fixed if you cant be bothered to haggle.One of the things that i was pleasantly suprised with about Marrakech was the very high standard of the restaurants. If you ask the staff in your riad/hotel of some recommendations or get a guide.You can expect to pay around £80 pounds for 3 courses with wine at the very top end restaurants. which is great value as i am sure you would pay at least double the money for the standard you recieve in a eurpean city such as London, Madrid or Rome. In my opinion The Marrakeshi, Le Foundouk and La Trattoria De Giancarlo ware among the best."
10,“Truly awful”,"I still try to repress my memories of this place but I think I have to warn everyone who plans to go there.The place where we stayed was an excellent Riad (see there), but apart from that - this is the worst place I've ever been in my life.It is loud, cramped, everyone tries to rip you off, you will get severe health problems, you will be ran over by mopeds in tiny streets and you will be punished by moroccan bureaucracy (be at least 3 hours before takeoff at the airport, and believe me: you will want to get off there).While this can be said about many - still very interesting - regions on earth, here you get in return: Nothing.Well almost. The few sights will be done in a day (if you do not believe the taxidriver that the place is closed) and the rest of the time you have to stay in a hot, smelling, rotten place without any entertainment at all. No buildings, landscape, parks, bars, no culture, no shopping, just annoyance.If you like to experience a taste of ""The dark ages"": stay for day. If you know that life has become better in the last 400 years and you appreciate the benefits of human civilisation: Stay away."
20,“Visit to Marrakech June 2010”,"Generally had a good time, saw a few interesting sites, Koutoubia Mosque, Marjorelle Gardens, Sadian Tombs, Bahia and Baadi palace, very little info is provided on them though, the tombs, Bahia & Baadi are really just ruins to wander around. We thought we’d prepared ourselves for Marrakech having visited several cities in Egypt in previous years but nothing prepared us for the hassle we got. Nothing to do with the shopkeepers in the souks who were persistant but nice on the whole. The real problem was the incessant scams in the street in order to trick you into parting with cash (&lots of it), eg getting you you lost & then “showing you the way” (if you’re lucky), mostly kids so not too painful to deal with, however we had one unpleasant experience with a couple of men in their 20’s & 40’s who were intimidating and threatening & whom we had to pay off with about £20 in order to get past them to get to our Riad which was located down a very dark tunnel/alleyway, it was our last afternoon thankfully but the miserable experience stopped us leaving the Riad that evening to go out to eat & we couldn’t wait to leave Marrakech. We didn’t have anything stolen but out of the other couples in our Riad, one had her camera stolen out of her bag and the other sunglasses pulled off the top of her head. If I was to give anyone tips about visiting Marrakech I’d suggest checking the location of your accommodation within the medina very carefully, I don’t think there’d be many Riad’s where a taxi could pull up alongside, but a Riad as close as possible (within viewing distance preferably) to a road that a taxi can stop in is far better than one where you have to navigate your way through unnamed unlit alleyways. Alternatively later on in our holiday (in Essaouira) we met several people who’d stayed in the Gueliz (new town) of Marrakech and gone back and forth to the medina by taxi during the day, but in the evening dined out in the new town which had good restaurants serving alcohol. We had one excellent meal in the medina at a restaurant called Fendouk near the Musee de Marrakech, which does serve alcohol, definitely worth a visit. I wouldn’t say don’t go to Marrakech but I would say don’t let your guard down for a second & be prepared for a lot of arguing and standing your ground, it won’t be a relaxing trip but it’ll be an experience, we followed it with 8 days in Essaouira which was wonderful, chilled-out, relaxed & no hassle."
40,“truly exotic”,"nice city, i suggest a 4-5 day holiday only before you get bored. Nice clubs, decent restaurants and a few good hotels. Mingle with the locals, use taxis and even public transport to get a real feel for the place. the city is very safe, but.. be aware of anyone being too nice and inviting you to a shop, you won't be robbed, but... they will be keen on pushing anything over-priced for you to take home."
40,“The most exciting place in Marrakech!”,"The Djmaa el Fnaa is worth a visit, it is an amazing place but be careful. The food stalls are overpriced and they will try and scam you, better off and cheaper to sit in a cafe near by. The Henna ladies will not take no for an answer and will grab you and start painting and then charge you a fortune, turning nasty if you dont agree their price. Watch the road that goes around the edge, its not marked and traffic whizzes by. Dont pay money to have your picture taken with a poor monkey or snake! Aside from all that, it is an amazing, exciting place with music and craziness all around, just keep all of your wits about you!Watch out for ""guides"" as well, they will offer to take you round the Mellah, the Jewish quarter, and it is like a maze in there so you will probably need one! Agree a price, and expect to end up in uncles/brothers/cousins shop where you will be hassled into buying spices/carpets/shoes.Get your camera out and expect to pay a donation!Nearest beer to the square, Hotel Tazi!"
30,“Changing Times”,"Returned to Marrakech after three years for an eleven day break, Larger a lot bigger but saddly not better, I was disapointed in the quality of the restaurants (with a few exceptions, listed below)and the unexcusable hike on the price of beer and wine. Marrakech has I feel turned it's self into a European city and as such three days will surfice, lounging around has become an expensive option. They should in fact give notice as in HIPPIE TRAIL DIVERTION. Place is still worth a short visit.(Le Charlie Cabana, Le Table Mona, Muraille d'Asia[a chinese restaurant with no chinese people inside])"
10,“Tourist destination? Give me a break...”,"We spent 4 days in Marrakech in June and are baffled - we still can't figure out why it is so popular as a tourist destination. The weather was excellent, but almost everything else about the place turned out to be pure hype. And what's even more baffling is why so many of the tourist guides seem to have bought into the myth (both the books we took described the place as unmissable). Top of the list of overhyped places is the medina, which has impressive ramparts, but once inside, is just a vast collection of boring dusty lanes where it's impossible to relax thanks to the hundreds of teenagers on motorbikes weaving in and out of the pedestrians. We made the mistake of staying after dark one evening, and were alarmed at how threatening the place became. There were many groups of teenage boys, hanging around, or following us from a distance. No sign of any police. Not pleasant.Also disappointing was Gueliz, a 'chic French-style area' (according to the guide books) but actually not at all attractive, just desperately run-down and seedy, and ruined by busy main roads that have too many mad motorbikers and hardly any pedestrian crossings.The one place we actually quite liked was Hivernage, which isn't bad, but there isn't much there apart from hotels. We stayed at the Suitehotel (next to the Sofitel), which was OK. Not brilliant, but not bad by western standards, and a million times better than those hellish riads that have no air conditioning or sound insulation, so you can lie awake at night listening to your neighbours, while drowning in your own sweat - but at least the furniture's authentic!I could write a whole book about why Marrakech is, from a tourist's point of view, the worst city I've been to, but in the interests of keeping things short, here are just some ""highlights"":-Sights - there aren't any. Really. We spent 4 days looking for something nice to take a picture of, before we gave up in despair.Jemaa el fna - to get an idea of how pointless this place is, try to imagine the atmosphere of a supermarket car park filled with burger vans. When we were there, there was a huge crowd of bemused tourists asking each other 'is this it?' A word of warning - the people who work in Jemaa el fna are some of the lowest forms of scum I've ever come across.Koutoubia mosque - totally nondescript; beware any tourist guide that describes it as in any way pretty. Some English mosques are genuinely attractive - Morden for example - but Koutoubia isn't.Food - it's not tasty, it's just dull, dull, dull. Anyone used to a curry in England is going to find Marrakech food incredibly insipid. I love French food, and can't believe that an old French colony has such boring food, or that the two best meals - by far - we had were at KFC and McDonalds. Quite astonishing when I think about it. KFC was actually the highlight of our holiday! It actually tasted as though it had been made by someone who knew something about food. And that brings me on to the piles of spices that seem to feature quite a lot in guide books. We never saw anyone actually buying any of these spices, and they were all arranged in neat little mountains with no signs of anyone ever having removed any. This, plus the blandness of Marrakech food, made us wonder if the spices are just there for show - they are certainly a nice little earner for the shopkeepers who charge tourists for photgraphs.Haggling - we didn't see any locals doing it, so we came to the conclusion that it's just for the tourists. And a pretty pointless exercise anyway, because -Souvenirs - there's nothing much for tourists! The things that are probably worth buying, like furniture and metalwork, are far too heavy to take on the plane, and everything else either looks ridiculous (e.g. the stupid Andy Pandy suits) or is cheaper in England.Religion - a city full of pious Muslims? Yeah, right! Alcohol is available for anyone who wants it, most of the teenage girls wear skintight denims and masses of tarty make-up, the cafes are full of gays at night, the most impressive building is the casino, and the only god we saw being worshipped was money.Essaouira - we didn't go, so can't really comment, except to say that including it as a Marrakech 'sight' looks like a sign of desperation from an attractionless city - it's 2 and a half hours train ride away - a bit like advertising Bournemouth beach as a reason to come to London!In summary, nothing much worth seeing, doing or buying - a pointless destination for a city break. If you must go, my advice would be to buy the best street map you can find, as there are very few street signs. And don't believe all the people who tell you the best shops are in the medina or Gueliz tourist traps - go to the Marjane hypermarket, which is, after all, what the locals do!"
10,“Open Toilet de Marrakech”,"My first piece of advice if you are planning to visit the 'magical' city of Marrakech.... dont bother, you will be disappointed.I HAVE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT A HOLIDAY BEFORE. PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE 5 mins TO READ THIS AND SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY!!The city is dirty, smells awful and we saw men, and women, openly using bushes and the old city walls as a toilet every day of our visit. (7 days).Of course you will need to haggle for everything, you expect this, but when you are being asked to pay 3 Euros for a bottle of water in a shop and you have to argue the price for food and water, everyday, it does get a bit annoying.THE FOOD IS VERY POOR and judging by the queue for the toilets on the flight home, I would say the hygiene is very poor also.WHAT TO DO Marrakech... there isnt much to do. You can visit the 'world famous PALACE El BADI' but you will have to use your imagination as the palace was DEMOLISHED 60 years ago.... there is nothing there!! And they expect you to pay to see it!MUSEE de MARRAKECH is poorly maintained. Dirty floors, rubbish in the corners, broken glass and frames stuck back together and re-hung. A primary school would present art better. Very POOR.MARRAKECHI's have a POOR REPUTATION FOR HONESTY and they will try to cheat you everywhere, agree a taxi fare and they will double it upon arrival at your destination. They will re-fill empty water bottles in restaurants (notice the caps are never sealed).If you want to go to Marrakech, stay in a 5* all inclusive hotel and dont leave the pool, but then why go to Morrocco? The king only spends 3 weeks a year in his country's capital city so what does that tell you?To sum it up, during our week long visit we were NEVER asked how our stay was, how our excursion went, how our food was..... I suspect because Marrakechi's already know the answer.If you really want to see that all the fuss is about, go to Marrakech but you will be disappointed.Nick from London."
30,“What A Place”,"We have just returned from the city which is Marrakech. We stayed in the old city which is absolutely amazing!!The hasslers are a bit scary as first, but once you realise what you should and should'nt do, it doesnt seem so bad.This is the main place of happening and is very busy. It is full of alley ways and the souks are totally madness, you definetley have to visit these.The new town which is not far away consists of the bigger hotels with pools which is a nice area but you dont get to experience the full Marrakech.The reason I have only rated this an average is I am only a teenager and this didnt appeal to me as much as other countriesI have visited. Personally I dint think the old town Marrakech is suitable for children and I dont think younger teenagers will appreciate it either but the new city may be more suitable.However, my mum and her friend adored the whole city, so I think that the old city may be one for the older generations.Definetely a city worth a visit!"
40,"“Marrakesh, food?”","After a few days of sampling all the various Tagine dishes in the Medina, we started to crave for some good french food and maybe even a bottle of wine. We found solace in the new town area at one of many good restaurants in the area.Le Charlys Cabana at 39 Bd Zerktounie. Great food and service and a welcome escape from the Medina."
10,“Terrible service at airport”,"The airport in Marrakech is relatively modern , but the service is terrible. Some of the airport staff ,particularly those at the immigration and customs are rude. Be aware. The Customs officer demanded that I show them how much money I was carrying and tried to extort my money.. Royal Air Maroc is one of the most unreliable airlines in the world. Absolutely no concept about time. All my flights were delayed. The staff are lackadaisical and more engrossed with chit chatting amongst themselves rather than serving passengers. My flight to Casablanca was delayed by almost two hours and the staff had no clue as to the departure time. The display boards at the airport was showing the wrong departure time and gates ! Airport signages are pathetic.The staff at the enquiry desks are rude and one of the customer service staff at Casablanca Airport had the gall to say that she was too busy and had no time to serve customers. I travel extensively in Asia and should say that Asian airports and airlines are way way better than those in Morocco. It is high time airport and airline staff in Morocco learn from the Asians on customer service."
10,“Qariya Assiyhia”,"I stayed in an apartment complex here, in Marrakech. It was miles away from the centre of town and the taxi drivers wouldn't use the meter so charged treble the amount. (And that was after haggling!) Just outside the complex was a dry riverbed which was used as a rubbish dump. The tennis court was turned into a football pitch. The worst thing of all was the fact that in April, despite 3 pools being advertised, NONE HAD ANY WATER IN! I wouldn't advise staying here."
50,“Honeymoon in Marrakesh”,"My wife and I just returned from our honeymoon in Morocco. We visited six cities and Marrakesh made the highlight of our trip. We loved our luxurious accommodations and the food was sumptuous! Marrakesh is so beautiful and the various dining places were so ecletic. We had lots of fun and took a trip to the beautiful Ourika Valley nestled in the mid-Atlas mountains, a peaceful Berber site where we did a 3-hour hike. We used www.gateway2discovery.com and their staff was top notch. Our driver was very professional. They deserve all praise! Adam"
20,“Things to watch out for in Marrakech”,"A few things to be careful about when in Marrakech:You may get recommended a restaurant called Le Tobsil... be warned it is very expensive, I wouldn't even pay that much in London!! 600 moroccon dirham per person for a lot of food that gets wasted, there are small portions but many of them, La Fondouk is more reasonable with a wonderful ambience. If you like Indian food, Delhi Palace in Royal Mirage Hotel opposite the Meridien N'fis is good, reasonably priced with wonderful homecooked food.The taxi drivers will overcharge, so negotiate your price before you get in... towards the end of the trip when I became more aware of the prices, I would just get in without negotiating a price and pay them as I exited the taxi, only do this if you are confident enough travelling on your own and handling a situation where it could lead to an argument. One thing to note is that the taxi drivers are very scared of the police, so politely mentioning that they are overcharging you, could be enough.Be careful buying spices, we bought a lot and they just have no flavour. If you take an excursion, the tourist company will no doubt take you to a few venues to buy local produce... be careful... we bought saffron, sandalwood and herbal creams... the herbal cream just ended up being petroluem jelly, the sandalwood didn't smell and the saffron colour and smell was very different to what they initially showed us. Argan oil bought from the women's organisation is probably your best bet and worth buying, I have been using it in my hair and have noticed that my hair is in much better condition.As usual be careful in the souks, prices vary, the shopkeepers expect you to negotiate but if they start with ridiculous prices it doesnt give you much to work with.. one shopkeeper was trying to sell me a bedcover for £120.. I got the same thing from another store for £20. So look around and if they start with crazy prices just walk away you will get it cheaper elsewhere.Apart from these things to watch out for, you will love the people who are very friendly,it is very safe, great weather and a good experience overall, I would def recommend staying in a Riad for a few nights, its a real experience. We stayed at Talaa 12 , perfect locaton with great staff."
40,"“wonderful long weekend away, spoilt only by the trip home”","fantastic weekend away to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, lovely hotel, ( see separate review) lots of atmosphere, ideal mixture of luxury romance and local culture. good food at all ends of spectrum from the night market to some of the best restaurants in Marrakech. budgets to suit all."
50,“Planning trips out from Marrakech”,"We had an eight-day holiday in and around Marrakech. We really enjoyed everything, and mid-April was just the right time to go in terms of temperatures. You will probably find that Marrakech has little new to offer after two or three days, but it is not straightforward to decide where else to go, so we thought we would share our (positive) experiences.We allocated two days to Marrakech, three to a tour to the Atlas and the desert (all the way to Merzouga, near the Algerian border) and three to day trips in a hired car: South to Ourika and the Atlas, West to Essaouira, East to Ouzoud. Given that these trips are in completely different directions, staying for six of our seven nights at Marrakech did not add to the total distance that we travelled. Parking was no problem, even in the old city: we paid 10 Dirhams per night to the local policeman.Be warned that distances to the out-of-town sights are large, which you should probably consider even before you decide to go to Marrakech. The Imperial Cities in the North of Morocco are much closer together, and also linked by train, but that would be a different sort of holiday, and possibly less varied.In Marrakech, we stayed at the Riad Awa, which we liked a lot.Many tourists never venture outside Marrakech, which is a pity. Even at the gardens at Menara, a short taxi ride from the city, we found few people. Anybody prepared to take tours and/or hire a car will get far more out of their holiday. However, one should see exactly what any tour includes, and how long is allocated to seeing places of genuine interest, as opposed to tourist traps: it will not be fun to spend all day in a bus, especially a hot, uncomfortable one.We would strongly recommend the three-day Atlas/desert tour that we took with Omar from CamelTrekking, although his four-day tour would have been less rushed. There are plenty of favourable posts already, which we endorse.Encouraged by the comments from a couple on the Atlas/desert tour, we decided to hire a car. This worked out well: we could have got to Essaouira equally well on a tour, but I do not think that we would have seen nearly as much on the other two days if we had taken a tour.Hiring a car requires the following: (a) taking a taxi to the new town of Marrakech and finding a suitable company (or booking in advance, using a comparison website); (b) care with donkeys, people and mopeds that pull out in front of you in Marrakech; (c) plenty of time (i.e. stating early and returning late each day), since all the day trips from Marrakech are long; (d) preferably some experience of driving on mountain roads, although in most cases they are actually better than in upland Britain, since they are wider; (e) sticking to the speed limits (booking speeding drivers is a useful source of income). The other drivers generally have average to poor driving skills, but few are aggressive or dangerous, while only a small minority would be troubled by the heights and drops in the mountains.Day 1. The Ourika Valley is pretty and we walked up to the waterfall at Setti-Fatma. Anybody can reach the mini-waterfall and the first main one, but it gets steeper after that, so like most people we then turned back. Setti-Fatma is crowded and there are lots of touts. One is also delayed by people with inappropriate shoes for the rocks, so the return trip to the first main waterfall requires at least an hour.The quiet mountain road to the ski resort of Oukaimeden is very scenic, and similarly from there to Asni. Asni seemed to offer little. We drove to Imlil (right in the mountains) but we did not have time to walk up to the kasbah (probably about 45 minutes’ return).Neither did we have time to visit the Tiz-n-Test Pass, the mosque at Tin Mal or the gorges at Moulay Brahim, or to return via Amizmiz, since we had taken some time in the morning hiring the car.Day 2. Essaouira is a must-visit – a great place, and very different from Marrakech – but the journey from Marrakech takes three hours (maybe two and a half hours when the roadworks are completed). We did briefly go a few kilometers South from Essaouira, but we found nothing of interest.Day 3. We started by exploring the Palmeraie, North-East of Marrakech. Apart from those staying in the expensive hotels there, most tourists miss this pretty, extensive area. Once you get there (15 minutes from the city with a good map), allow 45 minutes to drive round.Being there in the Spring, we saw masses of pretty wild flowers on the way to Ouzoud. We took a good road via Sidi-Rahal, then a short diversion to the South to the Barrage d’Ait-Aadel. It was called something different on the signposts – which were generally good, though.We did not like Denmate, rather a dirty place, but we took a short detour from there to Imi-n-Ifri. There is a pretty view, but we did not have time for the steep walk down to the natural bridge, which might have taken 30 minutes for the round trip. There was actually nothing to see at the dinosaur footprints, a few kilometers from Imi-n-Ifri, and we were really hassled by kids looking for money. Therefore, I would suggest skipping this. The man at the café said that the scenic road towards Ouarzazate is well worth taking for (say) 30 km, but we did not have enough time.The waterfalls at Ouzoud are spectacular and it is very easy to walk down on a paved route, which takes about half an hour return. There were far fewer tourists than at Setti-Fatma. We returned on a windy road through the Oued-el-Abid gorges in the Middle Atlas, and then a good road back to Marrakech.So that was another full day. You will have got the idea that we were always a bit pushed for time, and we did not really waste time along the way.I am not sure what the tour companies provide, but a day tour to Ouzoud should offer more than driving there and back, since it is a long trip, about 200 km each way."
20,“no more what it was”,"marrakech is on the way to become a fake place, a package for tourist attracted from what the town WAS since now it's an attraction selling 10 million tourist nights per year (more than barcelona).its medina is a giant shopping gallery for tourists and not a market for local people.out of the old town you have the kind of landscape of souther spain with hundreds of real estate projects on the way, silent assassins of the green, where moroccans are selling their lands together with their soul.inside the medina there is no peace: thousands of smoky motorbikes race here and there amid total indifference of local police . beware ! since the strets are very narrow you can easily have a dangerous accident, they drive like crazy at full speed leaving behind a fully polluted and unbreatable air."
50,“My top tips”,"1. Stay/shop in the southern medina/kasbah. It's more relaxed and friendly with a minimum of hassle. The streets are wider and it is much easier to find your way around. The local shops have much better prices than in the northern souks. Walk your route to the centre and back rather than take a taxi - you will get to know the locals. We found that nearly everyone who spoke to us was just being friendly. When we were directed to a particular shop it really was a better shop than the one we were looking for and no-one expected a tip and no hard sell. The north was different - some quite aggressive hassling and mickey taking prices.2. Musicians in the Djemaa - it seemed that most tourists just hovered round the edges and didn't get involved - big mistake! When you find a band you like the sound/vibe of, get to the front, throw a few coins down, you will be given a seat. Show that you are really digging the music and they will take you to their hearts. This was the highlight of our trip, dancing, sharing food and drink.3. Go for a local hammam (esp for women). I was going to go for a 'tourist' spa, but the lady at our riad insisted on taking me to a local one. Fantastic experience. The gommager was lovely and did wonders for my tired body. The women were friendly and asked questions - a young girl learning english at school translated for us. There is lots of laughter and this is the only way to take part in the social life of Moroccan women.4. Veggie food. Unfortunately the Earth Cafe was closed for refurbishment. However we found lots of good alternatives -Chez Chegrouni in the Djemaa - very good veggie tajine and couscous with veg, nice omelettes for ovos.Aicha no 1 - stall in the Djemaa. Lots of veg options, food and service doesn't get any faster than this!Cafe Bouganville - good veggie options, good service.Un Dejeuner a Marrakech (lunches) - small menu but 50% veggie, nouvelle cuisine at Marrakech prices and totally delicious. Scrumptious puds and ices. The review saying it is hard to find is wrong - it's just set back slightly from Rue Riad el Jedid, at the start of the music shops (going north).We also had a good pizza in Gueliz but can't remember the name.5. Shopping. As previously, shops in the Kasbah/south medina will give you a much better starting price than the souks and you will find everything there. The Artesanats give a good idea of prices and if you do just want to browse, european style, you can do it here in air conditioned peace. The supermarket near the bus station has food, tea glasses etc for cheap and nice gifts.6. Dress. You will be treated differently if you dress bearing local sensibilities in mind. If you want a tan, this isn't the place to go. Stay in an out of town resort if this is important to you! Cool linen layers will keep you cooler than a strappy top and shorts, too."
20,“Unfortunate Circumstances”,"My sister and I have just got back from 5 days in Marrakech and it was an interesting experience.The city is filled with culture and the most beautiful doorways however there is a definite lack of activities in the city. My advice to anyone would be to plan activities before you go. Most are out of the city so unless you are willing to go on excursions you are limited to wandering the souks, visiting the Jeema el Fna or a trip to the Marjorelle Gardens.Unfortunately as it was just me and my sister, and we are both young, moderately attractive girls, the hassle we received from the local men was indescribable. I have been places before where shop owners are trying to get you into their shops and my sister is widely travelled yet neither of us have known hassle like it. They make personal comments about you and some even grab and grope you and ask you outright for sex. For the first 2 days the comments were quite amusing however after that it is no longer funny and you start to feel 'meat-like'.I can say we never felt unsafe, even on the walk from the main road down 5 minutes of alleyways to our Riad, but we felt constantly on guard and could never relax.The Jeema el Fna at night is an exciting experience. The different stool holders trying to coax you to eat at their stools and the great choice of cheap food. However, Morrocan's seem to have a problem with the word no and at one point I had 3 different stool holders holding onto me trying to drag me in 3 different directions. My sister literally had to fight them off.On the plus side, the food is amazing. I have never eaten so much Tajine and cous cous but it was all superbly cooked. If you are looking to have a particularly good meal out there then I would recommend Le Tobsil which serves a traditional Morrocan set meal. You do not see a menu but the food is Impeccable, the service top class, the included wine tasty and the surroundings beautiful. It is 600 Dirham per head but well worth all the money with seemingly endless courses.I expected Marrakech to be a cheap city, and yes it is possible to stay and eat for little money but it does mean eating in the square where we felt that we needed somewhere more to take refuge from the Men of the city.My advice to anyone visiting Marrakech is these three points:Go for no more than 3 nights. Ideal stay would be friday to Sunday.Stay somewhere with a pool so you can take refuge from the chaotic hussle and bustle of the cityand if you are a woman go with a man. The men were hassling women with men far less than us.Please don't let my experience put you off of going to such an intriguing city but my advice is key.Two other pointers...be sure to try the fresh orange juice in the square, it is amazing. And the Morroccans are tough hagglers but keep going they will break down eventually.Hope this helps"
40,“useful tips to help you enjoy your stay”,"Just returned form Marrakech & thought I would pass this info on.The city is amazing, dusty, dirty, colourful & very interesting. Most people we found were very helpful and friendly.The Souks were a little intimidating as some of the sellers were over zealous & almost forced you inside. Be extra careful if you are a blond female of any age as they make a bee line for you.For excellent hassle free shopping at Souk prices go to Ets Bouchaib in Rue de la Kasbah, just passed the Saadien Tombes, where you can browse for as long as you want in an Aladin's cave of varied goodies of all kinds with helpful staff on hand if/when requiredDo not pay more than 200drhs for a Petite Taxi in or around the medina by day & 300drhs after 8pm at night, and always insist that they drop you where you want to be droped & beware the youth that says he will walk you from the taxi to your destination.For excellent evening food at cheap prices eat at stall 114 in Place Jamaa el Fna, for a delicious dinner for 2 with soft drinks & as much mint tea as you can drink for £10-£12."
40,“A riotous explosion of culture!”,"Marrakech was our first experience of a 'non western' country, having only travelled around Western Europe and America. Therefore it took us a couple of days to adjust to everything before we started to enjoy ourselves! The negatives were the poverty of the area which did take me by suprise; sadly due to lack of social systems to help the citizens, you will find you are hassled continuously by 'faux guides' and shop keepers who are simply trying to earn a living. Therefore one big tip is 'don't believe everything you are told by the locals'!!However once you get used to the hassle and the traffic (which is always close to colliding with you!) you begin to absorb the incredible culture and fascinating buildings. The souks are great fun and the city is filled with hidden treasures in the form of little museums and beautifully ornate interiors. There are numerous wonderful gardens dotted throughout which make a refreshing break from the chaos in the streets. The central square Jmaa El Fna comes even more alive at night as do the souks.I would recommend a trip to the waterfalls in the countryside surrounding Marrakech which takes you into the upper Atlas mountains, another great contrast to the bustle of the medina.Finally, regarding food there is a good (if slightly expensive) restaurant near the Baadi Palace called Kozybar. For the ultimate Marrakech experience go to the Jmaa El Fna for a seat at the open air food stalls and for equally cheap prices but slightly more food (and cleaner and less hectic surroundings), Chez Chegrouni, on the edge of the Jmaa El Fna is fantastic.Overall Marrakech is more an experience than a holiday so if you want relaxation don't go there! But if you want memories that will last forever and exposure to another culture, it may be the place for you!"
40,“something different”,"We wanted something different that would provide some warmth and sunshine and not too far away from the uK. Marrakech offered all of that. We stayed in the lovely Riad Noire d'Ivoire and from stepping out of our taxi just inside the city walls. we were captivated by the sites and sounds around us. Walking through the alley ways to our riad we had a sense of adventure and when the lovely door to our Riad was opened, once gain we were in another and different world. Our riad provided calm, luxury, smiling and efficient service after the hustle and bustle of the Medina.We always felt safe walking about and there was little of the hassle to buy that we had expected. A polite 'Non Merci' was accepted. One word of warning, try to avoid looking lost otherwise sometimes an eager young person will be only too eager to show you the way, [by a circuitous route that ensures you end up at the stall of a friend who will try to hook you in to buy something]..For those who want to experience a more modern environment and non Morrocan cuisne, the New Town offers great variety, but it lacks the charm of the medina.Marrakech is not particularly cheap but it is possible to chose between fine dining and more basic fare. Morrocan wine is also quite good although some of the more basic eating establishments do not serve alcohol.A visit to the Atlas mountains and surounding river valley provides an opportunity to see the surprisingly green and fresh countryside outside Marrakech. We would certainly want to pay another visit"
50,“50th birthday treat”,"travelling to Marrakesh with my family and friends has been an amazing experience. I was a little anxious but did'nt need to be.From arriving at the Riad Jahan to leaving 4 days later we have all been treated like family guests. The food everywhere we ate was brilliant. The smells and haggling in the Souks was exciting and we bought brilliant gifts to take home. We had a great day out with Hameed at 'Marrakesh by Air', the first and so far only Morrocan hot air ballonist that none of us will ever forget.My youngest daughter wants to return for a longer trip because there was so much more to see and do than we thought possible. All I can say is go for a visit you won't be disappointed."
10,“MUGGINGS BEGGERS THIEVES OF MARRAKECH”,"What an experience, went on a stag weekend to Dirty Marrakech 2010, Lucky to come back aliveGroup of us got mugged at knife point in Medina, took money, cards, mobiles and even chewing gum.Taxi drivers charge tourist 4-6 times normal rate. shops are just as bad.If you are looking for a life and death experience then this is for you,on the other hand if you want a enjoyable weekend break don't go to this dive as you may not come back a live.Police are scum, not willing to help.DO NOT GO"
30,"“Nice, busy place....just be careful!!!!”","I along with some friends( all 30'ish males) went for a short trip to Marrakech (23/2/10-28/2/10). Let me start the place could not be any more picturesque than the brochures we originally booked from.Our riad was in the Kennaria area of the Medina based in the old town of Marrakech which I must add was exceptional (see my separate review). The streets are extremely narrow and dusty but in all fairness they are not smelly like I've experienced before in other similar style of cities. The walks through the small bazaars is full of colours, culture and a true experience of Marrakech. All type of food is available, hence you'll never go hungry no matter what your pallet likes.....Alcohol is available but at a very inflated price and in lots of places let me add,,,,,So far, I've focused on the good about the medina....well hear the bad now. Now I know some will say this doesn't apply to me but nevertheless it's worth a read. My friends (3 males) were dropped off by the taxi driver returning from the new town late one night approximately 2am. They were accustomed to the streets and knew their way round let it be known, so what happened is a shock. They were held at knife point by 3 youths who emptied them of money, jewellery and mobile phones. Now my friends are no slouches and are more than capable to take care of themselves but when being stunned and it being late etc, little can be done. Additionally, with a knife touching your chest compliance is of the essence, unless your Bruce Lee!!! We immediately contacted Police on the arrival of my friends to the riad. Let me say that the police were the most uninterested, unhelpful bunch I've ever come across. We were told to report to them as they wouldn't come see us!! Anyway, we did and once again we were passed from one place to the other without getting any definitive from them. Alas, my friends are now having to resort to writing to the Ministry of Tourism to get answers.New town is a lot more safer and lot more modern. Restaurants and bars galore. There is lots to do in terms of entertainment, no leaf is left unturned. We visited Actors Lounge, Paradise Club....mainly. Music is fantastic and eye candy is spot on in these particular joints.Let the bad points mentioned not put you off from travelling to Marrakech. I am hoping that this was an isolated incident. A few recommendations from me would be not to obviously venture out too late in the medina if you're staying there. Carry little in terms of valuables and if in the new town watch you don't get scammed at the bars! It's a common practice."
50,“Fantastic! with NO hassle”,"Just returned from Marrakech, and had to write to say what an absolutely great place for a weekend.The place is dirty,smelly, and totally manic, but one of the most genuinly friendly and welcoming places i have ever visited. The main tourist places are as you would expect and a bit of a rip off. Dont have a drink in the Majorelle gardens! it costs twice as much as the entrance fee.cabs cost £2 to go almost anywhere and you dont need to bargain, you just say thats what you want to pay and its easy. same in the souks. I have no idea why people have a problem. We found if you said no with a smile, and decided what you wanted to pay if you did want to buy, then it was easy (and we were not practiced in the art of haggling)restaurants and cafes are cheap enough average meal is probably £20 for a meal with a drink for 2 people.dont bother with Artisans market, that was a rip off and more hassle there than the souks.we found the people very helpful and kind and did not feel unsafe at all, as 2 lone ladies, this was good. looking forward to going again."
20,“Once visit is enough”,"City center, visit the souqs for shopping, main square at night.Buy local map you can walk from atrraction to attraction. Hop on off bus is ok both routes.Eating out in city center nearly all resteraunts look grotty but reasonable prices. Best place to eat for cleanliness on Mohamed vi Ave also good prices. KFC and MacDonalds same price as UK.Visit main square at night and also in the day good experience.Shopping good fun especially in the souqs. Don't forget to barter.Morroccos second language is French and very little English is spoken. Signs are in Arabic and French also same with menues.Best Hotels close to the city are on Mohamed vi Ave especial the Riad Mogador Hotels."
40,“fantastic expericence”,"fascinating city, beware of anyone 'practicing english' we got caught with this and ended up in a carpet shops in a maze of alleys , very persuassve people, the monkey men now want at least 200 dh for a photo ,uyou get a monkey plonked on you shoulder regardless, like wise with the henna women ..dont hold their books or look in their eyes ..you will be marked !!, the main square is fantatstic at night, friendly with great food ..a must to experience, getting lost in the back streets is great a real experience and less hassle, take time out to relax in the cafes just watching the traffic , sounds mad but its fascinating..we counted a family of 5 on one moped !!! took a bus ride to essourria using a local 'firm' at the bus station, great experience and very cheap. be prepared to tip everyone , they arent shy to ask if you forget ! the souks are fab ..once you get used to the haggling and hassle, would definetly visit again"
40,“Marrakech...Wondeful...Very Mad..Exhausting...a Must See Place....”,"We are late 50's, and just got back from Marrakech last night.We were lucky with the weather... 6 sunny days out of 8...although I would not go this time of year again as the weather is unpredictable.This was our first time in Marrakech, indeed in Morocco.Marrakech is Very Very Mad...wonderful, eye opening and exhausting. Take good shoes this time of year, as the narrow streets can get muddy if it rains.If you are asthmatic, be aware that due to the narrow streets and 1000’s of very badly serviced mopeds, the exhaust pollution levels in the narrow streets is very high, sometimes choking…however, having said that, if you are going across town, just take a taxi which are as cheap as chips and you can avoid that problem completely. (we learned that one too late and I had some breathing problems for a day or so, and I am not asthmatic.)The food is lovely if you seek the nice places out, not necessarily expensive ones either. I recommend taking the following book.. the "" AA Marrakech Spiral Guide.’. It is practical, helpful and accurate, also giving good eating place hints.We took a trip to High Atlas mountains (the 4 x 4 tour is highly recommended) and also to Essaouira. Essaouira is just fab, but do not take the tour as we did , negotiate a ‘Grand Taxi’ for the whole day and enjoy it by yourself. It is opposite the Canaries, and thus has similar weather; it also has beaches and a wonderful walled Medina and fishing harbour. just Google it to have a peek and you will fall in love with the place.2 - 3 days in Marrakech is really enough. If we were doing it again we would go a different time of year (our weather was 90% good, but we were evidently very lucky) and, we would do 2 days Marrakech, 2 days Essaouira and 3 days Agadir…..that would make a just fabulous holiday.Do not drive in Marrakech if you value your sanity…every driver, and I really do mean every driver in Marrakech is mental and the traffic lights, roundabouts and road signs are clearly just there for decoration…!!!!By the way, if you have young children, Marrakech Medina (the old walled city) is not very child friendly in terms of access and anything for them to do, so best book a hotel in the New City and go to the Walled Medina when you choose. If however you are staying in the Old City, I would recommend that you avoid the hotels and book a traditional Riad if you can. We Stayed in Riad Dar Sbihi in Marrakech ( 20 mins walk or 5 mins by taxi from the Main Square and Souks which is what Marrakech is really all about)…it was completely traditionally with fantastic hospitality from the owners in residence Saad and Sybil, and I am going to write a separate review on Riad Dar Sbihi shortly, as it is Very Highly Recommended indeed..and anyone who has written anything else is talking out of their backside and very sad people methinks."
10,“Marrakech - nightmare”,"Just visited Marrakech for a 4 day stay. Be warned the locals will tell you a price and then when you go to pay they will double the price. In the Square women will approach you wanting to paint your hands with Henna, firstly telling you its free or that they are only going to draw a small flower - it turns into a full hand covering. When you walk away they demand payment - often trying to get 800 euros out of the unsuspecting traveller. Beware of going into their shops They will grab your arm and pull you back in- its very difficult to get out without being pressured into buying something - even on the horse and carriage rides they will want to take you to certain shops to browse. . The experience is not a good one. And to all you people who like a drink - dont bother. Not many of the hotels sell alcohol and if they do often charging 100 dirhams a bottle - about £10."
40,“Great city”,"Loved Marrakech - a very different culture to our own, which always makes for an interesting visit.The people were very friendly (especially away from the Jemaa el Fna).In the centre most people wanted to sell you something (or knew someone that did) or were offering their services as a guide. Once you accept that, your visit is a bit more relaxed.The food is not exceptional but is nice enough. The local pastries, bread and salads are usually the best on the menu.The stalls and the souks are quite a spectacle and most are open all day.BUT the place really comes alive at night with food smells and lights, story tellers, boxing, henna tattoo art and the stalls all lit up - the place is bustling and has a real buzz. This can all be viewed from above at one of a few balconies that overlook the main square.What an experience!"
40,“Unexpected”,"Undersold! An experience not to be missed. Will not return but a great experience. Extreme poverty and extreme wealth side by side in a society with no Social Services. Souks not as frightening as led to believe, with confidence we watched people making their wares and selling. Bartering was necessary but people polite and easily told ""no"". Found Ensemble Artisan, government sponsored group of ""cottage industries"" where the same goods are made, you can watch, and are sold with no haggling and very reasonable prices. Poor need to make enough to survive. Berber villages worth visiting - children with absolutely nothing, a real joy. Happy and welcoming, although shy, not begging unnecessarily. Atlas mountains - check the coach out yourself, even if on a good tour. Ours had one headlight, no wipers or heating. Not knowing this until returning across the pass with heavy snow and ice, one headlight, no wipers and a driver going too fast on hairpin bends, using one hand to drive, the other to scrape ice from the inside of his windscreen! Be prepared in winter for any weather, we experienced, snow, ice, fog, floods and a sandstorm! Oasis, underplayed, Jardine Majorelle, the garden of Ives St. Laurent. A calm and peaceful place to walk and relax. Architecture wonderful. People great. Let down - on our trip two groups of British minority cultures. Language and behaviour VERY offensive to us and Moroccans, calling the rest of people on the trip, Dirty Brits and damaging hotel and abusing locals. We were ashamed, even as seasoned travellers. Ups? Almost everything else. Once people overcome the fears of a different culture it's amazing."
30,“An unforgettable city in Morocco”,"Going to Morocco (a Muslim-dominated country) for 2009 Christmas holidays was a complete surprise.I arrived on the 23rd of December in Marrakech early in the morning but it was raining. I settled down in the youth hostel that was about two kilometers away from the center of the famous Medina. The youth hostel managed by the Hostel International was clean, cheap and cozy. The lady at the front desk spoke only Arabic and French, which was hard for someone like me who speaks English and Spanish. I stayed in the youth hostel for five days. It meant that I had to walk to the Medina early in the morning, stayed the whole day in the center and went home very late in the evening.Walking is always part of the travel. In Marrkech, the transportation system can be so unpredictable. Buses would pass by their designated stops leaving possible passengers stranded later in the day. If you decide to take the taxi, you better agree on the price before sitting down and closing the door. I was told that the younger taxi drivers are more meter-users than their older counterparts. I took the taxi from my hostel to the airport and I had to haggle with an older driver for a lower price (20 dirhams) when it could have cost me 10 dirhams in the first place. It was my first and last taxi ride in Marrakech, anyway.Haggling is the name of the game. If the guy selling an umbrella gives a price of 100 dirhams, go as low as 25 dirhams. The last price that you should settle for is half the original price. If they won't give it to you at that amount, then just walk away and the guy will follow you and eventually give it to you at your last price.The Medina is a great place to see, be it day, midday or at night. Moroccans and tourists never seem to get tired as evidenced by the non-stop flow of people passing from all the directions. Be careful though once you're in the Medina, passing cars, taxis, trucks, motorcycles and carriages seem to pop up from nowhere. Always make a 360-degree headturn when crossing a street in the Medina. Buy a freshly-squeezed orange juice after a long day's walk. But make sure that the oranges are squeezed before your very eyes.The Souqs are simply colorful. I got bored after moving around in this labyrinth of shops. The shops were selling the same thing. If you're good at haggling then you're in the right place. If you're the souvenir shopper, just feast your eyes and take out your camera and shoot the colorful textiles, leather bags and jackets, and beautiful and handsome Moroccan vendors. The souqs emit a different smell of herbs, spices, and natural stones burned as incense filling the air with an unusual aroma.Visit the different gardens of Marrakech as they are famous especially the Majorelle Garden."
50,“An Amazing Destinations with some hidden Gems.....”,"We stayed in the ClubHotel Riu Tikida Palmeraie - http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/africa/morocco/morocco-marrakech/marrakech/hotels/clubhotel-riu-tikida-palmeraie.html These links will take you to Thomson pages on the hotel. It is a 5star all inclusive hotel, 25mins form the airport and 10mins from the centre of Marrakech. Its located in the “richer” more picturesque area known as the Palmeraie (Palm Tree Garden). It’s the same neighbourhood as one of the Royal Palaces – The Sultan of Brunei, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Madonna, Elton John, Prince of Kuwait etc etc all have large houses nearby. I would strongly recommend this hotel for the following reasons;Its brand new – only opened at the end of NovemberIts all inclusive but also so reasonable that when you eat elsewhere occasionally you don’t mindThe standard of the hotel, the staff and the facilities (eg amazing pool) are all fantasticThe staff are so friendly and helpfulBecause its new they have opening offers and we only paid £320 each for a week inc flights, all inclusiveThere is a free shuttle bus every hour until 6pm, this like most taxis etc drops off at the Mosquee De La Koutoubia. However you arrive at the centre you will probably get dropped off here. If you walk with your back to the mosque calling tower down the road with Horse and Cart (smells great) to your right then you will walk straight into the main Square.You will get asked to hold monkeys, receive henna tattoos, watch a snake show etc etc, personally I just said no and kept walking – the key is walking off. If you stop and smile, show and interest or get out your camera you will be holding a monkey getting tattoo’d and have a cobra around your neck before you know it.The image of a Moroccan/ Muslim or Arabic person is important to them so if you take a picture of them they will want some money.The main thing about Moroccan people is the old “do onto others as you want them to do onto you”, so if you look friendly, smile and be polite you get the same back – trust me it works – approach looking serious and you will get stared back at. But they are the nicest people you will ever meet.So then, if you have approached the main square from where I have said, keep to the right edge until you reach the far corner and there is a restaurant called something like “Les Premises” - its got an Italian looking sign and seating on many levels – walk inside and head upstairs – help yourself to a table on one of the outside balconies looking over the square – recommended for lunch and also in the evening. The Beef Tagine is to die for – in fact if you can bring me one back that would be great! You won’t get wine here or generally anywhere within the walled city centre (Medina). The Crème Brulee is also fantastic! Cous Cous also recommended, Pizza’s great if you fancy a change. I can guarantee that after eating a few Tagines you will buy one to bring home – they are about £6-12 depending on size and finish instead of £40-80 in the UK!!If you exit this restaurant and walk straight ahead then on your right after about 300-500m there is a road and on the left about 5m down there is a dark doorway to another restaurant called “The Moroccan” – apparently very good and reasonable, daytime or evening.As far as going around the Medina/ market, there’s no good or bad way of doing it, I would suggest to break you in gently, walking past “Les Premises” down the road/ alleyway, keep walking even when it goes a little quiet until you come to a tree and iron railing lined square with a few taxis parked, now turn left and left again around the square, follow the road so you are roughly heading back the way you came in a parallel road, this now takes you further into the busier parts. If you think you know you are going in the right direction, then ignore everyone that tells you the square is another direction as they just want you to go to there shop. Once in the centre of the shops and markets just keep walking around and enjoy it – key thing is not to get stressed if you think you are lost, you always find your way out. The entire centre is probably a straight 20-30min walk wide and tall so if you keep walking and do get completely lost then at some point you come to the old wall and walk around it you will get back to where you started. We did this 2-3days as you see new parts and new things each time. Only barter if you intend to buy, looking around the shops is free and just saying no thanks and walking away politely is fine. If bartering, start at 1/3rd and work up to what you would willingly pay, if you don’t agree then walk off and they will offer you the price or ignore you.At night-time the main square is packed with food stalls, fire-eaters, gymnasts, entertainers etc etc….the atmosphere is amazing…if you are not comfortable with the markets in the day then avoid them at night – but they are safe. During day or night, a strong but friendly “No” is fine.If you see shops full of animals – namely chickens and goats, rabbits etc etc – not a pet shop! It’s a butchers – alive is the best way of storage and keeping things fresh – very reassuring that’s its this way as it means even the street food is fresh as it was still alive 30mins before you eat it.Another thing to do – if you start at the Mosque again and fancy a nice walk, with your back against the tower, looking towards the horses, you want to walk towards 8-9o clock, to the left!. You will see a nice street café, you can sit here to watch the busy road etc and enjoy some Mint Tea – very sweet but nice (especially if hungover). Then keep walking down the main road to the left of this café – it’s the Main Kings road called Mohammed V Avenue. About 10mins down here you will leave the city walls, a further 10mins you will be in the new town or Gueliz, this is where you will find newer shops like Zara etc. Straight on over this large roundabout and to the left you will see a very nice looking “colonial” looking building and home of “Le Grand Café de la Poste” - http://www.grandcafedelaposte.com/ By all means walk in off the street for a spot of lunch or a coffee here but also make sure you prebook via the web and/ or email for an evening meal here – the food is French and fantastic – so is the wine. The building is the old Post Office. It’s a posh meal in the evening and many celebs are spotted here.Fancy Meal Time – If you want a truly unique experience then book yourself (again via the web before you leave) a meal at Riad Kniza http://www.riadkniza.com/ .Riad is a Moroccan House/ Small standing. The list of famous people, celebs, actors, brad pitt, will smith, Marylyn Monroe, Tom Cruise, all American presidents etc etc that have stayed and eaten here is endless. The menu etc is on the website, you have to choose your main when you book as some are slow cooked for hours and email a credit card number (perfectly safe), to secure the booking. Its only €45 per person for 6 courses without wine and well worth every single penny. You sit in a very opulent room with 1-2 other tables and have superb service and excellent food. There are only 9 tables in the whole place in separate rooms and its down as the number one restaurant and most exclusive hotel in Marrakech so you do need to book early. The owner will come and check on you and ask how your holiday is, he is the guy that acts as Marrakech’s official guide when celebs and presidents are in town so if you want to know anything he is the guy to ask. It’s a little tricky to find so - Basically get a cab to the gate infront on the main bus terminus – “Bab Doukkala” – said as you think it is, walk through the wall and you are faced with a darken but very busy street directly across from you with lots of market stalls – walk down here and it’s the small street/ alley 2nd on your right called “Derb l'Hotel” – the sign is on the wall to the right about 10ft up, I think there is a tiled blue or white building on the corner that’s fairly obvious, walk down here and its on the corner about 20m down, the door is closed and locked but knock as reception is just behind the door. If you get lost everyone knows where it is, find a small child or happy person and ask them for Riad Kniza (said – Ree had – ka nee zar), may cost you a 20note (£1.60) but worthwhile. A taxi can’t drop you off outside due to all of the market stalls filling the street. If you fancy a walk you can walk from Grand Café to here fairly directly within 15mins.Once in a lifetime Time! – Check out http://www.marrakechbyair.com/en/ - book online or by emailing them, Hamid (pilot and owner) or Lina his wife both speak many languages and have worked all across Europe. You are collected around 6am, driven into the desert, collect the basket and balloon and then drive to the launch site, you get tea, coffee and pastrys whilst watching the guys prepare and inflate the balloon, you also help. You watch the sun rise over the mountains. Then you take off and float/ fly for an hour, wind depending you go 10-30km at various heights, but don’t worry you don’t get airsick or vertigo at all, read the website FAQ’s if you don’t believe me. There are generally 6 people at any one time but its not crowded – the basket is very comfy and padded. You are offered the chance to fly it too. Then a nice gentle landing. You are taken to a small holding and shown how the locals live, eat a proper Moroccan breakfast (very nice), plenty of interesting things to see and do. Then back to the Palmerie area for a Camel trek – don’t worry these ones are very well looked after and do not hiss, bite or run off, they are incredibly tame and well looked after, then back to your hotel by 12-1pm.Other things to do…which we didn’t but seemed to be enjoyable to others….Walking, trekking, biking in the Atlas Mountains4x4 desert and mountain trekWalking around the Yves Saint Lauren gardens, where he is buried behind his previous home"
10,“very disappointing”,"Stayed in a riad to be close to all attractions, what a waste of time. There are no really interesting attractions. The square is seedy day and night. The souk smells of unhappily fresh leatherwork. The prices are scandalous and goods not very interesting. begging and securing the tourists money is a way of life. It is dirty, smelly and in need of a total overhaul. Food quite uninteresting at best. Really cannot recommend this city to anyone."
20,“Drinking in Marrakech”,Hello folks just a few lines about our holiday in Marrakech. We had read a few revievs but it is always nice to see for yourselves. The weather for this time of year was above average mid to high 20's. We like to have a few drinksof a day and this is where you may have a few problems as not all bars/cafe's or hotels for that do not serve Alcoholic drinks. Our hotel the Meryem was dry and we had to take in our own alcohol. But they were very touchy about taking in soft drinks which they served at a premium (25 Dhirams) for a tin of coke = £2. Most of the bars that do serve drinks range from 30Dhirams to 55 Dhirams for a bottle of beer. Taxi's are also a rip off so do not get in one unless agreed a price. Also from airport to city centre do not pay more than a 100 Dhirams. Also you can only exchange money at the airport when you first arrive but check exchange rate and check that they dont rip you off as the guy at the airport tried to do to me. The city it's self is worth seeing but is also very french. So if you can speak the lingo then you are made. We found a great place for food with drinks and great music called KechMarra which has the best steaks i have ever had and a Ceasar salad which my wife says was fabulous. We also found a great little place with very good cheap meals which we had a lot of meals at different time s of the day and thequality was always top notch. This little place is called WINOO along the road from the Hotel Imperial. Watch out when in the Souks as they are always trying to beg or touching you so keep all monies in a bag that is closed and close to you. My wife also got a fair bit of attention from te Morrocan men as she is blond and very fair. I would definately go back to Marrakech asi now experienced it first hand. Their is also so much to see and the Atlas mountains looked faboulous. I will finish now with the thought that this place is hundreds of years old which you can see first hand very worth while trip for a new years holiday.
20,“A place where things aren't always what they seem”,"We were excited about going to Marrakech for some winter sunshine and to see some cultural sights, but weren't prepared for the hour long wait to get through passport control!Its a fascinating place, completely different to anywhere I've previously visited, which made it both amazing and frightening at the same time.On the first day we were accosted by a ""snake man"" in the Jemma El Fnaa square who wanted money from us for having a photo with his snake and after that we proceeded with caution. Keep your wits about you in this amazing space!For shopping we found a lovely courtyard along the Rue Mohammed V where artisans sold their own products from little shops and workshops, we could see people making the products and we bought several items, preferring this to the battle in the souks!Overall, I would say that you should be aware of who is around and what is happening, but apart from being relieved of our money in more ""legitimate"" ways, we had no other bad experiences when out an about in Marrakech.Definitely worth a visit!"
40,"“Hard work, but worth it”","We went to Morocco planning to spend three days in Marrakesh then go on a 4 day desert tour then back to the city, but it worked out we spent a week in Marrakesh then did the desert tour. In all we were in Morocco for 11 days.For theCityWe found the city, at first, very hard work and stressful! We found ourselves to be a target for what we thought was over zealous selling, especially in the souks- it was like 'shootin' fish in a barrel' as there was no where to escape. HOWEVER, after time, you get it, it works! As we came accustom to it, it was not as much hassle as we first thought!Top survival tips for MarrakeshWhen you first get to the square or the souks, don’t panic! We found if you 'paced' on or looked panicked the shopkeepers will go for you. Keep calm and slow your pace down. That way you look like you are use to it all. At the end of our holiday, even we could tell who was new to Marrakech!!If you get lost, (and you will get lost) simple top tip, follow other tourist! Especially the one who look like they are comfortable, they will take you out of the souks. Watch out for people trying to give you directions with out you knowing!! If your hotel or Riyad is in the old city or near the souks, there is a well rehearsed scam of someone saying your hotel’s name and walking 10 paces in front of you then demanding payment when you get there! This happen to friends we met there, and they had been at their hotel for a couple of days and knew exactly where they where going.If you need to get your map, best off going in somewhere for a tea and sitting down and working our where you wanna go.Also be careful when sitting down to eat at the market stalls with out knowing the prices, you think it will be cheap but they charge the same as a restaurant.I personally found the batering really difficult to handle, but that should not put you off. Shop keepers will give you a price that is a London price (we met a local lad who revealed that they think it is reasonable to set that price if your home country is deemed wealthy). It's hard to work out if your getting ripped off or not. A sound rule of thumb is what YOU think it is worth and what you are willing to pay for it. This verses what the shopkeeper wants to let it go for. Have a price in your head you want to pay i.e. £10 and a limit i.e. £15- this being the price you think it is worth to you.In to the mix of buying goods, is that if you pick something up that is a clear intent that you want it aswell as the pressure to hurry up and buy or make a decision. Just be bullish (but not rude), take your time and walk away if it is not right.My experience there were great! It felt the safest place in the world (a lot more than Leicester is!) We went in Ramadan period and we got lost in the souks at night with no one about, including the police as they we at prayer, except a gang of lads, who proceeded to leads us out with smiles and friendliness.This is not a place where you switch off- you switch on when you are faced with the shopkeepers and people trying to give you henna tattoos! But it is well worth a visit, the people are very friendly and welcome you with open arms (especially the ones who want you to but something!) You will come away glad that you went there and experienced the fact that there is nothing like Marrakesh!!"
20,"“Ok, but not a city I would return to any time soon.”","The city certainly can use tourist business, however it is very difficult to bargain them down and we have lots of practice. They ususally will not go below European prices. The venders are ususally fairly respectful of eachother and usually will not hassle you to much as your walking down the street.The motorbikes are very stinky and there should be some restrictions in the Medina area.We went on a 3 day excursion and I would recommend that you get a driver that speaks the same language as you do. Ours turned out to be a myster tour. The only word he knew was Photo. Where we stopped and to a picture of something. lol."
50,“Marrakech is the real paradise”,"i have spent 15 days in Morocco during my last vacation it was my best one, in the first i heard that Morocco is not recommended for Americans i was a little worried. but i decided to do it alone.then i booked the flight straight to Casablanca, and Marrakesh wow a wonderful pink red city the people very friendly , i went till the desert for a 5 days tour then the imperial cities. several cultures and traditions.i stayed in Riad(hotel) old Moroccan house inside the old town. and i rented a car with driver for all my transportation and day trips.really i cant wait to go back ."
20,“Be on your guard”,"We arrived tired after the early morning Ryan air flight.The first hurdle was to get some money. Then a taxi to the square. We knew we were being ripped off but we were too tired to negotiate we go a couple of dinars off our £20 taxi which should have been quite a bit less.Every turn in Marrakech was a trial .we had gone intending to buy loads of stuff. gave up and spent the time soaking up the sun on the roof terrace of our riad.The attitude is to get as much a possible for nothing and they are experts. Avoid Las Premices on the square the pasta was inedible and the orange juice was off.Suddenly their English failed we paid and left .on the other hand accross the square Chegrouni was cheap and the food was nothing to write home about but good value good service, great orange juice.if you want somewhere beautiful to eat but quite expensive try Dar Zellij hidden away in the medina, but well worth a visit.As you pass Chegrouni and turn right there is a fabulous cake shop which also sells yoghurt with fresh fruit.Along that little strip there are some excellent food stalls.Be alert they use your currency confusion to move the decimal point, I was just standing trying to work out what the price of my yoghurt was thinking it can't be £70 when a man in the queue spoke up and told me to pay 8 dinar for every thing (2 yoghurts 2 cakes which was less that I had been paying all week, But showes there are some good locals who don't want to see tourist ripped off at every turn. I never really worked out what the local prices would be and if any one knows please write it up.I don't think we would go back to the city again but we may well go to Tangier on the Marrakech express and back."
40,“First Trip to Marrakech”,"Interesting place to say the least. Nosiy, frantic but with hidden oases of quiet such as the Majorelle gardens. Can't believe the peacful atmosphere in the midst of chaos. Souks great fun for bargaining and just people watching.Have to be pretty nifty mover to avoid moped riders but I saw no signs of aggression - perhaps because of no alcohol!Jemaa el Fna square is fascinating but I enjoyed the Kasbah just as much. Visit Palace Bahia for gentle stroll. Place de la Ferblantiers is where the lantern makers are. You can pick up small lanterns for as little as 20MAD. I bought loads.The Kosybar, also in the Ferblantiers has great roof terrace with views of storks nesting on the ramparts of the Palace Badjii. We also ate at one of the outside cafes and had brilliant cous cous meal for two very reasonably priced.The Tanjia restaurant also has great roof terrace for pre dinner drinks. Good food too. Le Jardins de la Koutoubia Piano Bar does cocktails in fabulous surroundings."
50,“A fantastic experience!”,"We've travelled to different parts of the African continent and enjoyed both ends of the spectrum. Plush hotels and restaurants, roadside foodshacks and B&Bs, busy cities and empty countryside. Even so, Marrakech was a complete shock. Yes, there are tourists but overall it retains the atmosphere and style of a city that has been in existence far too long to allow tourists to change its nature.The narrow winding alleyways (derbs), the donkeys pulling carts, the noise, smells and hustle of the medina and the people themselves create a fascinating picture of such a different world and just over 3 hours flight from the UK.We travelled there in November for a holiday to what we hoped would be a place with lots to see and do, enjoy some warm weather and not too far to travel. It met and exceeded all of these points. Go there, stay in a Riad in the Medina and allow yourself to be transported back in time whilst enjoying the peace and sanctuary and modern facilities offered by your hosts at the Riad."
50,“marrakech a city from old times”,"Smell the spices in the souks, taste the tagines and mint tea in a café, hear the calls for prayer from the minarets, see the storks on the red ramparts, touch a snake in Jemaa-El-Fna (if you dare)! Most of all – enjoy this enchanting cityMarrakech – the name alone conjures up a 1001 images and you won’t be disappointed when you visit. The Red City at the foot of the Atlas Mountains might only be a relatively short flight away from London (3 ½ hrs), but you find yourself in a completely different world, exotic and mysterious. It is called the Red City in reference to the predominant colour of its mud-brick buildings and the 12km long ramparts that contain the old city. Marrakech is Morocco’s third largest city (1 mio. citizens) and has a long and sometimes bloody history. It was originally the domain of the Berber tribes and an important oasis and trading post. Founded in 1062, it became one of the Islamic world’s most important artistic and cultural centres. It has been Morocco’s capital on several occasions (nowadays it’s Rabat), but it is still a Royal city, the new King Mohammed VI built a brand new palace here recently as the old one was far too big for his needs. Writers and artists have been coming here for decades (Churchill liked to paint here) and in the Sixties it became a firm fixture on the hippy trail. These days, tourism is probably the main trade and I would urge everyone to visit soon, as huge hotel complexes are going up at the fringes of the city and more and more airlines are offering cut price fares to go there. We went for a week in January and it was already quite busy. I dread to think what it will be like in the high season in a few years time. The weather in January was great: only one day of rain and temperatures in the low 20Cs. A few practicalities: You can’t bring any Moroccan money (dirhams) into the country, but there are ATM’s and Euros are widely accepted. The dress code isn’t very strict and you are, as a visitor, not required to cover up from head to toe, but I would still respect the local customs and religion and not wear anything too revealing. Many people speak some English, but it is useful to have a few phrases in Arabic or French at the ready.in next reviws im gonna tell u more about the red city"
40,“marrakech”,"we had 4 nights at the Riad Tichka Salaam in the Semlaliye district. Beautiful Riad. Fantastic beds and bathroom. Got a package deal, so not bad price for us. The normale room rates are £200 and £50 per night - ouch!Fab swimming pool, catering staff all very good and pool crew. Reception staff were remote but not rude. Oh and you have the ""men in black"" on the door. I thought ! of the doormen, or mafia hitmen, was going to search me when I was taking pictures of the Riad. Funny.Do the HOP ON AND OFF BUS. For £10 is a god way to get overview and a first taste of Djema el Fna, the souk.Enjoy browsing and as you wander in, if you dont get run over by the haphazard moped riders. Tourists need a training course.Go to the Cafe Des Epices. A real treat in the middle of the market. Makes you feel like a care free 20 yr old hippy. If you can get back of the stools. Clean loos and good food too. Just watch the market go by.ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BAGS !!!!!!! dont take one, if you dont have to. MONEY DOWN BRA LADIES.Found vendors more relaxed than i Agadir.Then they have more victims so are laid back. Also, they ride mopeds and drive donkey carts down the narrow passages of the souk. Cant imagine how the prolific hash smokers survive here;it is not a country to be stoned in. You become a hazard and they will driver over you.The Djema at night is a must. Watch from a terrace cafe, it's great.My other favourite is the Jardin de Majorelle. It is beautiful, but something that you must feel to understand. Such calm surrounded by so much madness outside."
40,“Just beauiful”,One word will describe Marrkech beauiful. I had a ball the people where very friendly and kind to visitors. I especially had a great time at Jemaa-el square. The night life was wonderful. So many resturants and vendors to choose from. I enjoyed the entertainments especially the dancers and the drumers where excellent. if you love shopping this is the place to visit. So many shops to visits with great deals. I really brought some nice things for my family and co-workers. I highly recommend visiting Marrakech it's a beauiful city.............
40,“Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains”,"Marrakech was a unique city, excellent to visit but needs only a couple of days. Hiking in the Atlas mountains was fantastic! Cooler temperatures in September, good scenery, and a relaxing way to spend several days."
40,“A holiday with a difference”,"Just come back from a week in Marrakech,enjoyed the sights and friendly people. The souks are a worthwhile experience however be prepared to have to hustle our way as traders tend to pry on tourists. Prices asked seemed pretty high as thay tend to intially ask for double the price for articles. Nice cheap restaurants where one can eat, hustle free around the main square. Main tourist sights need investment and renovation. Higlight of the week was a meal at the Yacout Restaurant which is well worth a visit and is top class. Stayed at the Mansour Eddahabi Hotel which enjoys great swimming pools and staff were friendly. Food at the hotel is expensive and rather bland.Overall if you are looking for a break with a difference recommend a visit."
50,“Marrakech Bliss”,"Marrakech is an absolute must for first time travellers to MoroccoA bustling city by day and an exotic mix of cultures by night. A traveller- friendly city boasting some beautiful and enchanting historical sites and well preserved architectural gems. Stunning at any time of the year, especially at the end of July/August period-provided you can handle extreme temperatures!Take a stroll instead of a taxi ride-cheap by most standards- and you will be enthralled by the beauty and culture this city exudes.A city filled with beautiful riads and exceptional gardens, streets lined with palm trees and bordered by fountains and exceptional views of the Atlas mountains- any photographers dream canvas alive!Place Djema El Fna boasts some of the finest market stalls you will have come across- a maze of thousands of souks selling everything the country is proud of.Snake charmers, trained monkeys, story-tellers, potion sellers, fortune tellers, henna decorators, not to mention the hundreds of mouth-watering delicacies available at every corner. Drop by here on an evening horse-cart ride and you will leave Marrakech satisfied of a 'well worth it' pleasant experience and plenty of interesting tales to tell back home. Add to this, the legendary hospitality inherent in Moroccan culture and almost impossible to ignore- a definite must visit destination."
50,“My Travel in Marrakch”,"When she isn't trying to open a hotel or being a professional shopper, Maryam Montague blogs about life in Morocco. We can't think of a better guide to this bewitching—but often rather bewildering—city.'m an American, but for my whole life I've been a nomad. It started in Cairo, where I was born. (My dad, a New Yorker, was on assignment in Egypt.) My travels have continued through more than 70 countries--Cambodia to Colombia, Iran to Italy, Namibia to Nepal--and my work as a specialist in human rights and democracy means the list keeps growing.Every place I've visited has been compelling in its own way, but I never found a city that made me want to settle down until I came to Marrakech. Its appeal comes from so much more than the snake charmers, the fortune-tellers, and the souks--though they help, too. The hospitable people, the delicious food, the mysterious architecture, and the fascinating Moroccan culture all add up to make Marrakech a city like no other. Borrowing the words of little Goldilocks, Marrakech felt ""just right"" somehow.So two years ago, my husband (an American architect), our two children, and I traded in our nomadic existence for a nine-acre olive grove on the outskirts of Marrakech. We then set out to open The Peacock Nest, an online shop selling beautiful Moroccan things, and to design and build a stylish, ecofriendly boutique hotel called Riad Marrakech (riad-marrakech.net); both are named after the peacocks that roam the property. If all goes to plan, the 10-room hotel will be ready by July.Somewhere along the way, I decided to start writing a blog, My Marrakesh, a great big love letter to my new home. I enjoy sharing my passion for Marrakech with anyone who will pay attention. And they do: I'm not exactly sure why, but thousands of people read My Marrakesh every day. Either my mother is paying them all--she always wanted me to be popular in high school--or people are genuinely interested in the enchanting city that I'm lucky enough to call home.Wait, is it Marrakech or Marrakesh?BT's style is to follow Webster's Geographical Dictionary for place-names, so we spell it Marrakech. Montague, however, calls her blog My Marrakesh because that spelling is closer to the way the city's name is pronounced.EatMorocco is famous for its food, and no wonder. It's mouthwatering and eclectic, and there's something for everyone. The best-known dish is the tagine, a filling stew slow cooked in an earthenware pot with a conical lid. In addition to chicken, beef, lamb, fish, or vegetables, tagines often include stewed fruit, olives, onions, or almonds. Many restaurants also serve couscous, particularly as a traditional family lunch on Fridays. The seven-veggie couscous royale, topped with a raisin/onion concoction, is not to be missed.Brochettes (skewers of meat or chicken) are always a safe bet and are especially popular with the junior set. Harira, a soup made with tomatoes and chickpeas and served with bread and dates, is a warming and often vegetarian alternative. If the food strikes you as a touch blah--you chili fiend!--request harissa, a hot sauce that'll send your taste buds into overdrive.There's a wide variety of places to nibble and dine in Marrakech, from street stalls to opulent restaurants out of The Arabian Nights. And café culture is omnipresent--thanks, no doubt, to the country's history as a French colony. I provide a range of food choices below, from the super cheap to the save-up-your-pennies splurge. Also included are some non-Moroccan options for those who want to mix it up a little.Marrakech's bountiful tangerine and orange trees make for fresh juice everywhere. Yay! By day, head to the orange-juice stalls on the Jemaa el-Fna, the city's famous central square. There are dozens of juice stalls, all of which are numbered. I haven't ever really noticed a difference between the juice at No. 1 and the juice at No. 23. So pick the stand with your lucky number and make a beeline. A smile usually gets you a free half refill.By night, the juice stalls are wheeled away and dozens of open-air kitchens are set up in tidy rows, with communal bench seating. I'm partial to the stall where a chef with a handlebar moustache makes harira. Be sure to check out the stands that specialize in exotica like sheep's head or snails (you slurp them from a cup). Sadly, no beer is on offer at any of the stalls.On the sidelines of the Jemaa el-Fna is Ice Legend, an ice cream shop. It's particularly enticing for the little ones in the group, but adults too will appreciate a scoop of one of the 50 homemade flavors. Café des Épices, in the medina's spice market, is a charming and aromatic spot for breakfast or a glass of hot mint tea. Further down the medina's serpentine alleys is La Terrasse des Épices in Souk Cherifia. (It's owned by the same guy who owns Café des Épices.) Salads start at just $6.50, and you can bask in the sun on the huge terrace.There are four upscale restaurants in the Old City that I happily recommend. The stylish Kosybar, on the place des Ferblantiers, has a mix of Moroccan and continental offerings, as well as inventive cocktails. By day, you can watch huge storks in their nests from the upstairs terrace. Swanky Le Tanjia, a restaurant with rose-filled fountains, is nearby. The Sunday brunch is excellent, as is the tender monkfish available at lunch or dinner. Another chic spot in the Mouassine district is Café Arabe. This Italian-owned riad (courtyard home) boasts not only a restaurant serving homemade pastas from $9, but also a hip rooftop bar. And in the Kasbah area is Tatchibana, where you can break out of the norm with sushi and other Japanese delicacies. Tatchibana is open only for dinner except on Sunday, when it offers lunch, too.Some of Marrakech's coolest eating spots are in the newer parts of the city. In Guéliz, Kechmara has mid-century modern decor with ever-changing art, and a sunny terrace that's a good choice for breakfast and lunch; the restaurant does a fine mixed grill for $12. Café du Livre, also in Guéliz, has free Wi-Fi and a selection of English-language books for you to peruse while ordering coffee, lunch, or an early dinner (entrées from $8). Sushi is served during the evening from Thursday to Saturday, but the café is open only until 9 p.m. And the colonial atmosphere at Grand Café de la Poste provides a nice backdrop for excellent salads, starting at $10, as well as hot meals. Enjoy a Casablanca beer on the covered veranda.In the majorly upscale category is Le Bis-Jardin des Arts, a new restaurant with gorgeous decor. The delicious entrées start at $17. For other überglamorous experiences, hop in a car and head to the city's outskirts. Restaurant L'Abbysin is at the stunning Palais Rhoul, a luxurious palace hotel. The sleek, white outdoor venue is photo-shoot worthy, even if the nouvelle cuisine is more passable than memorable. The Crystal Restaurant Lounge, in the trendy Pacha complex, has artful food arrangements almost too pretty to eat. Make reservations for Friday or Saturday night to listen to jazz.* www.restaurant-douirya.com entrées from $19"
50,“It's wild out there!”,"Marrakech is the most amazing fun place to visit but you must be aware of the possible pitfalls!Everyone wants to be your friend, but it's not for nothing. First be wary of guys on the streets who suddenly fall into step with you and say ""Hi, you know me"" I work in you hotel"" with a great smile on their face. This is very plausible and my husband and I fell for it at first but after a few times we said ""what hotel is that?"" and when they could not answer they usually fell away quickly. They all want to lead you to the square but you will find yourself in their family shop on the way being pressurised into buying something.The pressure in shops is something else, they usually start by saying ""we are friends right, whether you buy something or not, we will be friends"" This sadly is not the case we had to get out of several tricky situations and ended up being abused because we found it difficult being rude at the beginning. One man started off quoting a mirror at 5000 Dhirams and when we finally were able to escape he was chasing us down the street shouting ok, 200! Quite a reduction! You see the same stuff in supposedly up market antique shops with pictures of Paul McCartney on the walls, ( I wonder how much they charged him!) and the cheap tourist tat places. The only difference is the price!Dont let me put you off it's mostly great fun and the shopping is wonderful but you have to have your wits about you and watch out for Mr.Friendly on the streets!"
50,"“Marrakech, an amazing experience”","I just have to say how wonderful I found Marrakech, we have just come back from spending 10 days out there and I loved it and can't wait to go back again. We arrived 2 days before Ramadan began but we really weren't affected by it at all. The food was amazing and we found some fantastic places to eat within the medina itself and in the new city of Gueliz. I would definitely recommend marrakech to people for romantic getaways in the evening the night market is breath-taking if not a little intimatiading to start off with but once we found our feet and understood that you have to haggly for everything it was fine - the red bus tour is a great way to see the sights without getting hassled and for taking some amazing photos of the mosque and other places. We stayed at Le Meriden N'Fis just outside of the main square however it was lovely our room was beautiful and huge and the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Siad who worked in the Concierge was great and really helped with advice of the cost of things such as taxis and gifts, all in all an amazing hotel and looking forward to exploring more of Morrocco"
50,“The perfect tranquil retreat!”,"We recently stayed in Riad L'oriantele and had a fantastic time. The Riad is beautiful and a wonderful peaceful haven from the chaos and buzz of the souks and the square (the square is only 3-5 minutes away). We stayed in the suite which was clean, spacious and, well, we don't have a bad word to say - we especially loved the two comfy seats and table outside our door for relaxing.Latifa and the team were great and made us feel very welcome (thank you) and breakfast in the courtyard of the Riad in the morning was idyllic and delicious.With regard to Marrakesh - we had a fantastic time (although the chaos and the heat can make it a bit exhausting after a few days - which is why the calm of the Riad is ideal!). For places to eat suggestions we did a good variety - the market stalls (really tasty and picked a few different dishes - a bit like tapas - not sure if that's what you're meant to do though! no stomach problems afterwards but avoided the tomatoes and salads! Keep an eye on the bill though we were charged 100dh too much and when we pointed it out the price was corrected with a cheeky laugh!), a restaurant overlooking the square called Cherogoui (or something) nothing fancy but tasty and great views if you can get the front row!, Villa Flora ( recommended by the Lonely Planet - couldn't believe we were in Marrakesh, it's a modern art deco riad very tranquil and serves delicious more european-ish food and reasonably priced - £45 two courses and bottle of wine for two) and then Tobsil (pricey but the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in Marrakesh 100 years ago, 5 course meal of authentic Moroccan food (and delicious) inc wine approx £45 each - we would say that it's worth it ... because you're on holiday!)We also spent three days trekking in the Atlas mountains climbing Toubkal which was really good - it was lovely to come back to the tranquility and comfort of the Riad though!"
30,“Worth visiting even if just the once!”,"Marrakech is an amazing place and full of culture and excitement. It was very hot (when we went in June) but hey it's Africa so you'd expect a bit of sunshine!The medina is the place to visit and to stay in a beautiful Riad, (Such as Riad Zolah), but it is intense walking around the souks and markets as you do get hassled constantly to make a purchase. The souks are an amazing experience but you can be easily ripped off if you are not careful and willing to bargain hard. As an example we were looking to buy a typical Moroccan teapot which the starting price for was 600 MAD (Moroccan Dirams). We decided not to purchase and when we asked our Riad manager what we should expect to pay he said around 60 to 75 MAD. So the mark-up was nearly 10x..... Crazy.We also found most of the locals quite rude and aggressive if you were not handing out money. They also seemed to lack respect for each other and their animals (cats, donkey's and horses) all looked half dead and we witnessed several acts of cruelty such as a man hurling a large stick at a teathered donkey to stop it making a noise!!!We also expected eating and drinking out to be cheap but it was in fact quite expensive to eat in a reasonable restaurant and a can of Coke was often 15 MAD+ (£1.20+) even just from a street seller which to me is expensive for a developing country.So all in all a very worthwhile experience with plenty of amazing things to see and smell (such as the poultry market) but after 3 days walking the souks and fighting off enthuiastic salesmen my wife and I were ready to leave."
20,“Rip off Marrakech”,"I have just visited Marrakech for my husbands 40th birthday and have to say how disappointed we were. I have visited the city twice in the past and always enjoyed it. This time we just spent the time feeling like a walking bank. We did stay in a lovely place (Dar Donab) which I would highly recommend, however everything else about the city felt like a complete rip off. From restaurants that charge prices that even we as Londoners nearly choked on to airport taxi transfers that make London cabs seem cheap by comparison (we paid £40 for two airport transfers - both taking about 10 minutes). Even room prices are astoundingly expensive for what you get (breakfast at the Dar Donab didn't really reflect the expensive room price).Whilst as an experienced traveller I realise that we are seen as rich in comparison with a local, I think it leaves a bad taste to be batantly ripped off and I don't think in the long run will do the economy much good in Morrocco which is clearly feeling the tourist down turn. We paid a lot of money for our flights and accommodation and felt that to be charged such high prices when we were there almost makes Marrakech far to expensive to visit. We can't afford to be ripped off like this and will have to travel to cheaper destinations in the future which is a shame for the tourist trade in Marrakech.If Morrocco wants to encourage more visitors perhaps they should have some middle of the road alternatives for those that can't afford the high prices of many restaurants and riads/hotels, but equally don't want to risk food poisoning by eating at the city's cheaper eateries and stay in the dirty one or two star hotels. I would have spent less going to Paris which is unbelievable. I find it shocking that as a tourist you pay well over the odds for everything, even more than most other capitals around the world. I don't feel in the UK we inflate prices to ridiculous levels for tourists and therefore don't believe as a tourist in another country you should be ripped off just because you can afford to travel there. I for sure feel like I never want to step foot in this city again."
40,“Marrakech the right way”,"On arriving Marrakech, we were escorted from the plane, onto the tarmac! It wasn't that hot in May we thought (but this was soon going to change)We got to customs (my god be prepared for the queues of doom) I would suggest pushing your way through to the front if there is gap, as when we arrived there were around a 1000 people there, being individually checked for around about 5 mins each!We were then taken by taxi - pre arranged by our Riad to pick us up from the airport, and were taken to our Riad, (gorgeous by the way) came to 750 for 4 days for 4 people. http://www.info-world.com/self.catering/morocco/marrakesh.house.rental.phpGet directions to Jma El Fna or ""the big square"" as it is otherwise known - and is where all the culinary delights are served up, there are some wonderful places to eat, European dishes if your feeling less adventurous, or you can check out the stalls in the middle of the square in the evening. Some great dishes, I suggest the steak haches tangines, which is basically small meat balls cooked in a tangine - spices, coriander etc, and really yummy! Vegetable tangine is also good, and dinner for one should cost between 40-60dihrams in the food hall area, for one dish roughly 3-5 pounds...and it is delicious. Whilst in the square look up and you will see lots of roof terraced restaurants - great for a summer evening!Shopping - do not get foiled, the souks are riddled with shop owners who will literally drag you in, ""look at my magic box"" ignore the spice sellers completely - I got asked 100's of times, what this spice was, and what is that spice...and it is a ploy to get you into their shop.Whilst in the Jewish souks I got foiled on the first day for spices, amber and henna...I was asked ""you like henna?"" and I said I did so he got a local to come in and she offered me a book with her designs in it...I chose a rather nice one in black henna (which I've since found out is dangerous - but luckily I didn't have a reaction to it.) She went on to explain that if I didn't like it I don't have to pay for it....the design was finished and so she asks "" you like it?"" and I say yes, and I said how much , she said around 300dihrams for this, and went on to say some guy had just got one done for 700dihrams....""for a little one...like this"" *she demonstrates what a tiny morsel is* I' bartered her down to 200dihrams which is about £15 roughly (bit of a rip off) - avoid the henna people in the big square too.There are some great places to buy leather from - but smell it to make sure it's not smelly camel hide, as it will stink when you get home, and also silver is quite expensive and is weighed to the gram - I managed to barter for an onyx ring and received a free gift from the shop keeper, who later became my friend as we passed the shop regularly.You're going to be hungry so check Jma El Fna, and do not what ever you do take the first price they offer you, they will swindle you if they think you can be swindled! Barter your hearts out, don't fall for the limping children behind them, and certainly do not have sympathy - they will take you for all you've got! if you are allergic to cats I don't suggest you go, because there are stray cats everywhere!Here are some useful phrases (typed phonetically)La shokra - no thankyouZouina - beautifulRochella - beautiful personBe saha - bon appetite(These are really useful saying an will get you some kudos!)Happy Tripping :)"
50,“Marrakech with maroc-emotions.com”,"We just come back from the beautiful city of Marrakech!it was just great! perfetc weather, awesome landscapes, very welcoming people! [--XXXXX-XXXXXXXX.XXX--] made everything works for us. we booked with this agency and they took care about everything, restaurants tours, guide etc..i definitely recomend this wonderful city.."
50,"“Great location and a Riad run with a warm personal touch, Riad Orangeraie”","We had our first trip to Marrakech in May 2009 and stayed in a fantastic Riad called Riad Orangeraie which is situated in a perfect location in the Medina behind the old walls, right next to the Souk and only two minutes walk from the place Jemaa el-Fna. We could walk to everything.The Riad was like a sanctuary, like walking into another world from the noisy bustling city.The Riad is owned by two French brothers and run by French woman they all speak fluent English. The whole atmosphere is very friendly and you feel like you are part of the Riad like you are part of the ""family"".We ordered food on a couple of occasions and it was very delicious home cooked and fresh. The breakfast by the pool was magic.We made some day trips and Veronique was very helpful with the planning and it made it all so much easier for us. In general they helped us with everything we needed help for.They organized our pick-up at the airport which was such a nice way to arrive into this exotic city.We can't wait to go back.Charles and Anette Black, France"
50,“Absolutely Amazing!”,"I can't really comment on luxury holidays, since I spent two nights of the week sleeping on public Transport while travelling up North to Melilla and back.However, Marrakech is amazing and definitely worth the visit - but of course it is smelly and dirty and ladies definitely don't walk around without a man with you. Saying that though crime wise it seems pretty safe and I think it has a low crime rate.Its amazing to walk through the Old Medina and Jemaa El Fna both of which are bustling and hot but to be able to see the Snow Topped Atlas Mountains in the background.If you decide to stay in Marrakech then hotels in the Gueliz area would probably be best. A hotel I can recommend is the Moroccan House Hotel which is aimed at British Guests I think (most are aimed at French and Spanish) http://www.moroccanhousehotels.com/Anglais/Marrakech/Presentation/Presentation.htmGueliz is the more upmarket, new part of town, but it's walking distance from the main square Jemaa El Fna - in the Old City where you find the Souks, Snake Charmers and the evening food stalls (All of which are worth a visit - I even enjoyed the food and I'm massively fussy.) The Souks are such a maze we realised the first time we went that a day would have to be put aside just to explore them and we literally did spend a day getting lost in them!Everyone's very helpful - the hotels can arrange most trips you would like to go on. We went Camel riding which was surprisingly good - we went out for two hours, and in the middle they provided us with traditional food, drink and music. If staying in Marrakech an absolute MUST is an evening at Chez Ali... I think all hotels can arrange it, a mini bus will pick you up - it's just outside of Marrakech - won't say too much but its amazing, food (I think 4 or 5 courses..) is included in the cost which I think was about £25 - definitely worth the money. I was slightly concerned about going, because I'm vegetarian - as soon as they found out, they went back to the kitchen and did me seperate servings of vegetarian food without me even asking and the food was brilliant.Taxis are brilliant way of getting round but make sure you use Petit Taxi as the Grande Taxi's cost a bomb.Oh, and slightly confusing is that you can't get Morroccan Dh before you get there and even if you do manage to you are only allowed to take 1000 dh (which is about £83.00) through customs. What's best is to get American Dollars, theres an exchange as soon as you arrive at the airport.The CTM Bus service and the Train Services are very simple to use, and very reliable. We took a trip to Casablanca, although both my friend and I were very disappointed with it, and we thought one day was enough to see what we wanted to see.Marrakech is definitely worth a visit - it's brilliant!"
20,“What an experience”,"What a place, I hated it. Firstly you have to make your way through the Souk which in itself is an experience, The shops sold the same stuff throughtout. It was like a living nightmare, bt the nightmare was yet to come.Once we had made our way to the the town centre, it was early evening and the entertainement was just starting. Now I am not a great animal lover, however I did take offence to the many men who had monkeys with chains around thier necks and the forceful jerks of the chain to encourage the monkey to perform, whilst you are urged to take pictures.As you were trying to dodge the men with the monkeys, there was th snakes, now I know its africa and yes what did I expect, however for me not a good expeereince. That aside you also have to deal with the street beggars asking for money.An overwhelming few hours, that i will never repeatThe best part of the trip was leaving!!!!"
20,“Leave your good manners at the airport”,"If you're British and have never been to a country where street bargaining is the norm, then brace yourself for culture shock. We struggled the first day or so, and lost a lot of money because of it. First, almost getting mugged by an old lady with no teeth and a syringe full of henna, then the 15 year old guide who will cheerfully walk you back to your hotel and demand £10. It turned out to be more expensive than London - we felt constantly fleeced and therefore a little bit bitter towards the place. You're not allowed to take a photograph without paying for it, and don't imagine that this will only cost a few pence - you'll be lucky to get them down to £1, and the debate can get quite heated with them trying to take your camera off you. Not nice.Then there's the mopeds. In the medina, the streets are all very narrow and not paved. People of all ages and with all kinds of cargo hare up and down these alleys at full pelt, with no thought for pollution, safety or apparent care for their cargo, which seemed to regularly get spilt across the street. It's a weird kind of street theatre if you can detach yourself from the wall long enough to relax. You might find that the deisel smoke that hangs around the alleys starts to go for your throat though.And lastly the animals. Don't be squeamish and don't go the Jemaa El Fna if you regularly donate to the RSPCA. The monkeys look terrified. The snakes look drugged. The donkeys all stink to high heaven and many have sores. I'm not sure if there is such a thing as a 'pet' in Morocco.Apart from that, an interesting culture which I would recommend seeing. From a distance. Stay in a nice hotel outside the medina (so that you can return there at night and get out of the madhouse), take tours of the sights (the palaces are amazing), and don't imagine that you can get a glimpse of the Marrakech that has been romanticised - it no longer exists. All those interesting local cultures you may think you are watching, are actually being put on in order to part you from your hard earned cash. And if you really want to stay in a Riad, remember that you get what you pay for..."
40,“Another World”,"I´ve been to Marrakech three times before but this was the best because I stayed at a good hotel ( Le Meridien N´Fis) and was able to relax by the beautiful pool after all the shopping or ask for room service and stay in my room at night. I was lucky to have a newly-renovated room with a king-size bed so it was very pleasant staying in the room. The ""musts"" in Marrakech are the Jemma El Fna Square, the Koutoubia Mosque, the Souk, the Menara, the Bahia Palace and this time I visited the Jardin Marjorelle which was very interesting and I ate a quiet lunch there in the Italian cafe. I can recommend ""Le Comptoir Darna"" for a chic restaurant with 8 pretty belly-dancers who dance round the tables at 10.30 p.m. so you should eat at about 8.45 p.m. The ""Chez Ali"" restaurant and show is well worth a visit as it costs about 40 euros with taxi service and you have a 5-course meal and show. Dozens of singers and dancers from different regions of Morocco come round to all the typical tents where you eat and then there is a show outside where horsemen and acrobats perform galloping and shooting their rifles. The show ends with fireworks. If you have children, they will enjoy a camel-ride at Le Palmerie but you have to barter as everywhere in this exotic place which is another world!"
40,“El Badii Palace”,"Previously there may has been a lot of seeing but now there's only ruins left. Still El Badii palace is very impressive place. The leafy ""mini-gardens"" are beautiful and the storks flying over the palace can inspire many nature photographers. I think El Badii is much more interesting than La Bahia palace for example."
30,“Marrakesh is quite stressfull but well worth a visit!”,"We found Marrakesh very stressful at first! There was too much hassel from people wanting money, and people wanting you to come and look at the stuff in their shops! Also be careful of all the mopeds/scooters that zoom up and down the tiny streets! Mental!!! Having said that we ate in some lovely meals in the main square -- the sausages, liver pate (looks like gruel but is delicious), salads, meat scewers, ginsing tea and orange juice are amazing! We also went to Foundouk Restaurant which was amazing! The location was beautiful, the food delicious and the service attentive whilst allowing you to relax! The Marjorelle gardens are beautiful, and are very peaceful, as is the Medersa Ben Youssef museum which is completely stunning! The main thing about Marrakesh is that everything on the outside is completly different on the inside! What looks like a rough looking building is actually a palace inside! Please don't listen to any of the kids telling you that the square is closed and don't feel forced to give over your cash for someone simply giving you directions - tipping is big in Morroco and everyone thinks they deserve a tip for nothing! It gets cery boring after a while! Enjoy your stay in Marrakesh, stay in a nice riad - it will be your haven!"
40,"“A fascinating, beautiful and sometimes manic city”","Marrakech is beautiful. By mandate, all buildings must be the pink/red color of the local clay, making for a harmonious landscape. The snow-capped Atlas mountains provide a spectacular backdrop. The city is full of gardens and flowers. The souks, medina and Place Jamaa el Fna are hectic and colorful and provide just what you might expect, from snake charmers, to henna tattoo artists to street performers. Take care taking photos as the subject may hit you hit up quite vociferously for compensation--especially in Place Jamaa el Fna. Crossing the street is hair-raising as there are no traffic signals in most places, so you must dodge cars, trucks, buses and motor bikes. We stayed in the lovely and quiet Riad Yasmine. To reach Marrakech from Spain, we took the overnight train from Tangier. You cannot book train tickets online or purchase them outside of Morocco, so we used the services of Said at Tanger Travel Link. He was very cordial and reliable. He met us at the ferry terminal with our tickets and also provided a guide to Tangier. You can contact him at officetanger@travellink.ma or said_zenith@yahoo.es. We moved on from Marrakech to Essaouira and then Agadir and I would be happy to answer questions about ground transportation, which can be sketchy if you take a local bus. I recommend Supratours or hiring a driver (the latter if you value timeliness and cleanliness). None of my group speaks more than basic French, but we managed to get around with few problems."
30,“An experience”,"I recently visited Marrakech with my wife and 3 children (7, 13, 15). A friend from New York City, where we also live, was having a birthday party there, planned by her French husband and his friends and family from Paris.Overall, it was a very good experience, but people planning to travel there should know a few things. First, it really helps to speak at least some French (unless you know Arabic). There were enough places that had someone who could speak a bit of English, but important things can become very difficult and lost in translation. I will explain that a bit later.On the good side, we enjoyed the food, and the streets of old Marrakech (the Medina) are a jolt to the senses, even for people coming from New York City. Just taking a walk around the Medina was a great experience on its own, but it can get a little tiring if you stop for a second and do something like look at a map. You will be swarmed by people ""trying"" to help you, but really just looking to steer you to some shop and expecting some kind of tip. If you don't speak French or Arabic, it becomes very draining after awhile.I would recommend NOT going to the area that is for the Souks - it's really just a tourist trap. BUT, you should definitely visit the small souks on the other side streets - for example, near the mosque Sidi Ben Slimane. They basically have the same things you would find in the Souks, but you just have to wander in more areas. They are not as concentrated as the Souks, but we found this was a much better way to explore and experience the old city.Next, we took a trip through the Atlas Mountains for New Year's Eve and camped at a place called Camp l'Oasis, on an elevated plane south of the Atlas Mts., somewhat near the edge of the Sahara. It was a bit cold, but nevertheless, a memorable trip.Finally, DO NOT TRUST Iberia Airlines for a realistic schedules of flights out of Marrakech. This is where not speaking/understanding well enough became a BIG PROBLEM. Our flight to Madrid was cancelled with basically no notice, and, unbeknowst to us, the employees left as we were waiting in the one long line for all passengers at the airport. Iberia does NOT have an office at the Marrakech Airport, so there was nobody to talk to. They have an office in Casablanca, but the phone line was busy for FOUR HOURS, and we only got through at 5 pm to get a recording that the office was now closed. (Trying to make a phone call was itself a huge headache, due to the lack of speaking French well enough.) Some people at the airport said Iberia cancels their flights out of Marrakech all the time.A woman from Air Maroc tried to help, and she suggested we get a cab to Casablanca since it was a bigger airport with more flights. We did, but, once we got to the Casablanca Airport, we found the Iberia booth was closed with no contact information.After spending hours trying to contact ORBITZ, since we had made all our travel arrangements through them (tyring to contact them internationally was ANOTHER huge headache), we finally were told AT MIDNIGHT!!! that we were on a flight the next afternoon. We had to find a close hotel - no small ordeal itself - and get something to eat.Not trusting the flight ""reservation,"" I went to airport early next morning to, once again, find an empty Iberia counter and info booth. Three hours later, a small group of Iberia employees opened one of the counters, and, after waiting in a slow-moving line, I found that we were on Stand-by. When I explained our whole situation, the attendant told me I would have to speak with a supervisor, who was nearby, chatting endlessly with a friend. After patiently standing in front of her, obviously looking to speak with her, she started walking away, still chatting, without acknowledging me at all. I asked when she would be able to help me, and she told me to go to the info booth - the one that had not been open for 6 hours the evening before, and still was not open at 12 noon that day. I yelled at the top of my lungs that this airline was a joke. It completely startled her, but she still told me to go to the booth. I suggested she accompany me, and she did, only to find an empty info booth with a LONG LINE OF VERY UNHAPPY PASSENGERS WAITING!It was only then that Iberia finally took action, and half an hour later, a woman showed up to open the booth. I don't know what happened with the other people in line, however, I calmly, but very forcefully told this woman that she was putting us on the afternoon flight to Madrid AND she was guaranteeing us seats from Madrid to New York. We got home a day and half late - the New York flight was delayed for more than 6 hours - and our kids had to miss the first day of school after the Christmas Break.Overall, I would recommend Marrakech at least once in your life, just NEVER on Iberia; try Air Maroc instead."
30,“Marrakesh and Moroccan cooking course”,"Marakesh was the last spot on my moroccan tour ... compared to the rest of the country it was a bit fake and sad to be honest (in the touristy areas).HOWEVER,I did do a cooking course there... exe... had to drop 500 dirham. But it was a good day. Set outside marrakesh where you can here birds twittering and beautiful gardens it was a nice getaway. We learnt about moroccan cuisine and cooked tagine and a moroccan salad. It was great to do the cooking and meet fellow travellers who had seen the country a different way (from the classy marrakesh perspective as opposed to the not so classy backpacker perspective). If you love your food, need a getaway and have cash to burn, I recommend it."
50,“marrakech a wonderful city”,"what a fantastic city it turned out to be, after much worring about what it would be like we cant wait to return. Our hotel the El Andalous was fantastic and Hassan on the desk booked us a brilliant guide to take us to the medina etc which was real value for money. The city is wonderful the people charming and the weather wasnt bad either. Try it you may like it."
10,“My Holiday From Hell”,"READ THIS!!! This is all FACT.Okay, where do I start. Days off from work and hard earned money are both prescious when you work hard all year you want to be selective about where you go, after all there are an infinite number of locations and resorts and you want to get the most out of your cash. I dont gush over mediocrity. Ive ready some people saying how lovely it was to walk down the streets in Marrakech past the Orange trees...well if orange trees excite you... sheeesh! It must be me. The Eiffel Tower at night, Yosemite National Park, Grand Canyon...thats what you get excited about. ANYWAY...A friend of mine was mugged at knife point in Morocco in 1999 so I already knew from what he had said and from other reports that it sure wasnt the Italian Riviera but I thought nearly 10 years on it must be very different.Got a taxi that drove us at break-neck speed to the slums ...sorry did I say slums, I meant Souks where the Riad Amssafah is and was wondering where the hell I was. The taxis have no seat belts and they all overtake at every single given opportunity which isnt a good thing since we later ended up in a head on collision with a van which smashed up my leg and me my girlfriend got very badly knocked about but thats another story!) and you dont want to end up in a Moroccon hospital...trust me.Im no stranger to roughing it as a climber & I work in the tough iron and steel industry. The taxi stopped in a filthy, muddy, narrow alley at the Northern end of the Souk. Locals eyes light up when you get out. Beady eyes all side glancing you as you walk towards the Riad. I personally found it very much a baptism with fire. The 1st and foremost thing I realised was, you need to walk around with more change in your pockets than a Vegas Gambling Machine! Money is the oil that lubricates the interest of everyone (nothing else) and they all expect to be tipped which becomes very monotonous especially when you don’t have any left and they mutter in Arabic in disgust.The Riad Amssafah itself is a nice place. (However, the Hotel Atlas Asni which we got for about £35 per night per room was an Oasis. 4 Star accommodation away from the slums.) But the Riad was very tranquil inside only meters away from the nightmare location in the Souks. We dropped our bags in our room and then asked the staff in the Riad how to get around. I think they are accutely aware of the location and its inherent problems from the opportunist filled alley ways that lie waiting for you on the other side of that entrance. We had been in Morocco 2 hours and we had the Riad Staff warning us DO NOT stop to speak to anyone and ONLY go the way we tell you to go . Do not listen to anyone that approaches you and if you get lost (which we did) ask a shop owner or policeman. Okay, with that knowledge we headed out.Motorbikes, bicycles, donkeys pulling loaded carts, young lads loitering around approach you being VERY VERY insistent you are going the wrong way, people calling ''Hey! English? Hey you!!'' These people make looking around in the Souks for potential souvenir purchases an absolute nightmare/ impossible even! One lad was almost shouting in my face telling me to ''look at Berber market...last day!'' I had to glare this kid in the eye and say ''Look! We are NOT interested!'' ...and still he kept hovering around us at which point Im thinking should I have my fists clenched here because this kid is unerving me and more importantly my girlfriend. We made it to the Main Square and breathed a sigh of relief. Im sorry, but that IS NOT a holiday. Neither is it one of those colourful experiences that enlightens your life in someway.We were so fed up with it we cut our stay in Marrakech short and got the 3.5 hr Supratour Coach Journey to Agadir where our hotel, Flat Hotel. The room had money stolen from it, ended up in crash in a taxi, got an electric shock off the Electirc Cooker which was 'Live' when we switched it on and had 2 lads booting our apartment door on the last night to which I had to leap out of the bed and go roaring at them to warn them off. Flat Hotel states its 200m from the beach. I think they mean miles! Its about 1500+m to the beach and it is quite isolated which isnt a good thing at night. There are no proper footpaths that lead to the main strip untill you get on to the main road half a mile away.Ive been. There were good bits...tiny, tiny bits. Italian Riveira, Iceland, Yosemite National Park maybe but certainly not Marrakech or Morocco ever, ever again."
20,“Things to be aware off...”,"Ok, so it's a muslim country during the holiest month of the year, so what do you expect...?Well, firstly, the country itself does nothing to advertise the fundamental changes that happen during Ramadan, it's very much 'buisiness as usual' as far as tourists go, or so we're led to believe....1: most of the hotels which normally might have 3 or 4 bars / restaurants will close all but 1 during Ramadan, and often outwith aswell. Some reastaurants do open during the day, and most open in the evening, however as for the bars, most shut up shop for the duration.2: Doing the most basic of things during Ramadan is generally - though not always - harder than usual. Hotel staff seem generally more pre-occupied than normal, and will often dissappear 'on mass' at the end of the fasting day to eat. Nothing wrong with that, except it's not beyond the bounds of common sense to not have everyone go at the same time!3: Barterring is a great idea, however in practice it doesn't usually work outside of the souks, and whatever you've heard about 'walking away with a firm ""no"" getting a speedy reduction in price is generally not the case, especially with taxi drivers.4: There are 2 casinos in Marrakech - give both a wide berth, as the machines are only in French (staff are uninterested in providing a translation), and even if you do work it out, they are rigged majorly in the houses' favour. Taxi's will also treble their price from casinos too.5: Drinks are not cheap in Marrakech. True, a small (240ml) beer will only set you back 25 or 30 dirham (about £2 / $3.90), but in most of the restaurants, nightclubs, bars, etc a spirit and mixer will set you back around 65 - 85 dirham (£6 / $10).6: You'd be forgiven for thinking the price you paid over the internet for your hotel was the final price - not always the case. Some hotels charge an additional 'tax' on bookings. There's no legal basis for this, and it's not by any means universal, but it's worth checking with your agent / website as to whether there MIGHT be any extra charges.Finally, if you're coming to Marrakech thinking it's another version of Ibiza / Thailand (i'll leave the rest up to your imaginations), then please don't - like most countries and cities in the world Marrakech can and does cater to all tastes, however 'niche', but it's not abundant or obvious and it's not something they're really comfortable with, so all in all it's best to go elsewhere.All of the above excepted, Marrakech and Morocco in general have much to offer the traveller, and it's 1 of those places that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime..."
20,“Moroccan Magic?”,"I had heard a lot about Marrakech, most of it good. However the reality was quite different. Culturally it was an interesting departure but once you got past the initial surprise all that might remind you was fairly negative.Perhaps I expected the hustle, bustle and general chaos, but the stench of many areas, the constant problems with getting change from a payment for a transaction and the almost universal ""the machine is broken"" for credit cards were not offset by a the positives.The positives were; the Ryad (Jardines de la Medina), most of the food (although pricey) and..... no thats it!Go if you feel so inclined but I for one won't be returning."
50,“Brillant Holiday to Marrakech June 23-29 2008”,"We (Me & my Wife) went to Marrakech for a week, stayed at the Ryad Magador Marrakech hotel, it was a 3 star hotel, and though I must say it was very clean. It has a small swimming pool, which was handy when coming back from roaming around in the hot sun. Marrakech has a lot to offer in terms of tourist attractions. Below I have listed some of the must see places in order of my preference:1. Majorelle Jardins (gardens) - it is a botanic garden, a real beauty, romantic, calming and eye catching, birds singing, many varieties of plant.2. Jamee-al-Fanaa - a large square which is busy all day and well into the night usually around 12-1am. during the you’ll find snake charmers, and people with small monkeys who are trained - not the kind of scene for animal rights activists, however no cruelty to the animals was displayed, merely an attraction. It has many stalls selling merchandise, my favourite was the fresh orange juice, cold and 100% pure juice which is squeezed in front of you. It costs 3dhm (dirham) which is 21p for an approx 300ml glass.At night they have the locals playing different types of music.3. The medina and souks (the market place), located right next to the Jamee-al-fanaa. a must see, but very careful, there are so many lovely things to buy, with many sellers trying to lure you into there smalls shops and then trying to charge you 3 to 4 times the real selling price, if your loaded and don’t like the hassle of haggling then you’ll probably wont mind paying the price, I would suggest starting at roughly a quarter of the price and then settle between a third and half of the asking price.4. You should also see the city during the day on a horse and carriage a good price to pay for this is around 100-120 dirham (£7-8) the more people you have the better it is.5. Masjid-e-Koutabia Mineret – A place of worship for the Muslims, built over 900 ago, the stone used to built the most is amazing, it changes colour the temperature changes throughout the day. it is a beautiful place to see from the outside though is would not be pleasing to the locals to see tourists inside the Masjid, as there are strict guidelines which would need to be adhered to present inside a Masjid, these include dress code, cleanliness/purity, attitude/behaviour.to check to the current currency check outwww.xe.comi'd upload more photo's but tripadvisor have a policy of upto 5mb worth of photos, what a shame, if you want me to email you em, email me [--]"
30,“Impossible to rate”,"Marrakech is a must see destination but the general consensus was that we wouldn't go back.If there was a way to charge for air it would be done, and you would definitely not be getting a good deal on it.Sunglasses are a must in the medina as eye contact can result in money leaving your pocket.The most annoying was the constant calls of ""big square this way"" (which was often the wrong way) if you change direction on this advise or merely acknowledge it ,you have accepted information and there for be charged and refusal to pay will result in an aggressive confrontation. The same goes for the advise ""its closed"" which is usually untrue also.I found taxis incredibly annoying, a fare could be agreed than half way through the journey there would be mumblings about a price in euros than back in to dirhams and the price would double from being ripped off to just plain theft.But by far the worst are the Henna women in Jemaa l-Fna, armed with syringes of Henna, they follow unsuspecting people offering their services when repeatedly being told no would grab your hand and start applying ""a flower for good luck"" 2 minutes later you will be in a row over the 200 dhm she she believes is owed.Its all a bit of a shame as it made us reluctant to spend money as the famous Marrakech ""haggling"" really does get a bit tiresome.All the restaurants and cafes we went to were all good and the standard of service was very high.Its worth a couple of days.PS get to the airport early for the return flight, as most flights leave at around the same times the queues for the passport check are huge which resulted in many people missing their flights."
10,“we were warned but went anyway”,"We live in Southern Spain and our friends from Los Angeles were over to see us and wanted to see Morrocco.We were told that Tangiers and Casablance should be avoided as they were just ports and a bit rough, but Marrakech is ""wonderful"".So we drove our two Spanish cars down to Tarifa as it is the quickest crossing (40mins) and sailed over.Tarifa port is a lovely town and very efficient staff on FRS ferries with reasonable prices.Mistake 1.We should have got Dirhams on the boat as you need money immediately for a taxi if you have no car and although our cars were perfectly legal with all the papers we were ushered off to one side and our passports and car papers taken away. They had us filling in lots of papers and nothing seemed right until a port ""official"" with an ID tag said we needed to give him a tip to make sure the papers went thru.We realised the scam and offered 10 € but he held out for 40€. which we paid just to get away. This was nothing to do with the police/customs people who were very polite and helpful.The new road ro Marrakech is very good but you must stick to any speed limits as there were 10 moblie speed traps in the 6 hrs drive.Our hotel ""Riad Zahir"" was excellent but we needed the help of a ""guide"" on a moped to find it in the Medina.He immediately employed himself to show us around the next day.Mistake 2 We should have thanked him firmly and nicely and gone our own way as his ""brother"" replaced him the next day and was very bossy hurrying us thru the medina to places he wanted us to shop where he got a commision.We kept trying to pay him and it was always ""no you pay tomorrow""So when he was outside our Riad the next day we reluctantly went with him until he took us to a Special palace that turned out to be a carpet warehouse.Here we were given a sales pitch until we spoke up and said we were not interested and left.We then paid the guide what he's asked for for 3 days when he'd only done a day and a half just to get rid. We had noticed tourists without guides peacefully sauntering around shopping where they wanted and coping quite easily. After he'd gone we shopped in relative peace.Secret is not to converse with ANYONE as they're all after your money, even a kid who asked my wife if she wanted a taxi and stuck his hand in the air demanded payment as we'd decided not to risk driving in the totally chaotic traffic and used the rough little taxis that are quite cheap.We agreed on a parking price for the 3 days and were not able to get our cars out until we paid double.Food compared with Spain was very average except at the riad Zahir where we spent a nice night having local dishes and enjoyed that.A bus tour of the new Marrakech was just a tour of hotels and government buildings with a few tatty gardens thrown in.We did find a good restaurant in the new part but nothing that compares to Spanish quality and service.We drove back to Tangier and had to pay an official 40 € to get out of the country.We kissed tyhe ground in Tarifa and breathed a sigh of relief.We are well travelled and not wimps but got sick of being treated as ""Cash Cows"" by the locals.I think we'll avoid third world trips next time."
50,“A brilliant long weekend”,"We have just come back from a 3 day trip to Marrakech which was sensational. We stayed at Dar Musique a 4 bedroom riad in the Medina with a stunning roof terrace and pool. We ate out each evening and all the restaurants exceeded our expectations. Le Tobsil is very romantic, great set menu including wine (600d) with fantastic service. Le Foundouk was more French in style with an amazing roof terrace. Cafe de la Poste is in the Guerliz area and good for lunch. If you visit the Souk then pop into Kosybar and sit up on the roof terrace and enjoy the views.Its a great city with so much to offer-highly recommended for a long weekend."
20,“Void of Integrity”,"Marrakesh is in many ways a wonderful place and you don't need to read many reviews to get the idea. There is however one problem which is worth highlighting. Everybody in this place is out to rip you off and come after your wallet. Even if you guard yourself against the obvious (e.g. accept free tours of the Souks), it quickly wears you out that you have to haggle over everything or knowingly accept that you are ripped off.To make one point upfront: Marrakesh is very cheap by Western standards especially if you come from London. The issue is not the absolute amount of money one spends but that people cheat and steal and that there is little you can do about it unless you have constant arguments which is not my idea of a good holiday.To give you some examples: Getting around the place other than by foot is taking caleches (horse-drawn carriages) or taxis. The government introduced fixed prices for caleches (to stop ripping off tourists) and taxis should be metered. Since I traveled with my two young children and my 5-months pregnant wife (all experienced travelers) we did frequently require transport . The full Marrakesh tour by caleche officially costs 120 MAD and most one way destinations are MAD 30-60. Each time we tried to take a caleche the opening price was in the range of MAD 250-350 no matter how short the distance. If you don't want to pay this you get passed around from one carriage to another until someone lowers himself to accept you as a passenger. We never paid less than MAD 150 and rarely managed to get going within 10 minutes. Metered taxis don't exist and you have the same sort of argument every time.We (me and my 1+4 year old children) shared one camel for a 15 min ride and negotiated the price down to MAD 150 (almost certainly an outrageous price for local standards); although it was crystal clear that this was for the three of us, we nevertheless then had an argument (and were not given change on a MAD 200 bill) because he claimed this was per person. You can't argue in a foreign language and when the argument gets heated with people yelling at you, it is not my idea of a holiday.A shoe shine guy offered to clean my shoes for MAD 5 (he specifically said 5 dirham), but then claimed it was 5 Euro and started yelling at me. He had 50 MAD written on his box so I eventually paid 50 MAD and later found out that 5 dirham is the standard price.The hotel charges us for an extra bed although the reservation confirmation clearly stated that we are 4 people sharing one suite with two extra beds. The hotel also kindly arranged a guide for us. The guide spoke English and was able to show us the way, but did not know anything about any place we visited. We left him behind after 2h and were nevertheless charged MAD 450 for the honor. Otherwise, the hotel was absolutely wonderful, but it shows that this problem doesn't stop at ""institutions"".There are many more examples gathered during our one week trip and I have to say that while Marrakesh is a magical place, this was an issue that really put a damper on the trip."
40,“riad quenza”,"Excellent riad in the heart of the medina.a quiet bolt hole away from the hustle and bustle of the souks .the staff were both polite and helpfuljust a 10 minute stroll through the alleys of the old town. most locals spoke to us on our walk to and from the riadwe did manage to find one hotel within the medina that sold alcohol,the Grand hotel,nice beer.the main square is an incredible experience,by day full of snake charmers and story tellers,at night it turns in to a vast catering extravaganza.the food is very good,especially the lamb,and lots of variety.Allin all a very different city break.if you are at all adventurous it is well worth a visit.the onlyfault relates to traffic,motor bikes abound,with no strict rules ,so they come at you from all angles,and there is a polution problem,the smell of petrol at times is quite nauseating"
50,“Riyadh Blanc”,"If you've seen ""Indiana Jones...."" type movies and enjoyed the market place scenes then you'll love the central market here.The souks spread out from here.They're where the specialised artesan workshops are(vicinitee Musee de Maroc).Stay in Riyadh Blanc.Excellent value"
10,“Been there done that won't ever go back.”,"From the moment you step off the plane it is a constant battle of wits making sure you are not over charged by the locals. Never have I ever been is the price for anything is ten times more than the locals pay. I would advise anyone to arrange a pick up from the airport to your hotel rather then be at the mercy of the waiting taxi drivers, getting them to put their meter on is almost impossible so you just have to take there word that the price there give is fair, which it never is. We stayed in the Kasbah in a very nice hotel Les Borjs de la Kasbah which I can recommend the only problem is it is to far away from the main attractions so a long walk running the gaunlet of market traders or people offering to show you the way even if you know where you are going and wanting payment some getting quite aggresive if you refuse to pay. If you are a nervous type it is best to go in a group for I knew some people would not leave their hotel after venturing out. Jemaa el Fna the huge square has a lot of entertainment but be prepared to put your hand in your pocket if you stop and watch there is plenty of cafes where you can sit and watch the action. When buying in the souks don't except the first price usually a third of that is fair. A good way of getting your bearings is to use the hop on bus it is good value at 110 dirhams and the ticket lasts 24 hours it gives you a good idea of the layout of the city. Be careful when crossing roads pedestrians have no right of way what we did was cross when a local did and taking our life in our hands.There are plenty of trendy western bars and restaurants but there are expensive where a beer costs 80 dirhams but the Kozy bar is worth a visist, you should try a restaurant in the Medina we found one where a 3 course meal cost 50 dirhams and it was not bad. To sum up glad I seen Marrakech but it is not for the faint hearted and no way would we go back."
20,“pollution pollution pollution!!!”,"I have just returned from Marrakech - and have never been more pleased to be back - for some fresh air!!! The traffic in the city is terrible - having lived in a major city for many years I expect there to be some traffic and car pollution but it seems that every car in Morocco is in Marrakech - at the same time - there appears to be no road laws so very hazardrous to cross and if the car itself does not kill you - then the fumes it is giving off will!!! The smog is that bad, that you cant even see the Atlas mountains - only a few miles away! I have visited many medinas worldwide and never seen one like in Marrakech - ruined by all the cars and fumes. You can actually see all that Marrakech has to offer in a day!!! The best place to visit was Yves St Laurent Jardin marjorelle - the only place in the city where you can have a breath of fresh air!!!"
10,“Hellhole”,"I have wanted to visit Marrakech for some time. Everything I read said what a interesting place it was with lots going on and plenty to see and do. Not true. You cannot walk anywhere feeling safe or welcome. You cannot take a picture without a local trying to charge you for it (even if they weren't in the photo). The Square is full of intimidating people, boring entertainers and Morrocan storytellers (speaking in Morrocan). We counted about 15 stalls that all sold oranges/orange juice and the same amount of stalls selling nuts and dried food. If you are brave enough to go into the Souks you will find shoes (all the same), leatherware (all the same) and Morrocan lamps..and you will feel intimated the whole time. The fumes are the worst I've experienced so walking anywhere is awful. The cabs, either local or at the airport, will all overcharge you immensely unless you know how much it should be and you won't until it's time to go home. Everything is overpriced at The Square. Alcohol is incredibly difficult to find, and if you do it will be very overpriced. We changed our flights and came home three days early. What a huge disappointment."
20,“Never Again”,"My husband and I were looking forward to a romantic week in Marrakech to celebrate our anniversary. The whole experience was anything but.I have travelled to many places in the world but this was something else.........It all started with the official airline of Morocco 'Royal Air Maroc' a three hour delay in Casablanca for our connecting flight, whilst we waited for other connecting flights, I spoke to 3 other people who flew on different days with RAM and they were all delayed or simply cancelled, its a common occurance according to our host.The staff were surly and at times rude, there were mobile phones going off during the flight, one was from a steward, and a cigarette was smoked by one of the stewards too...unbelievable!Flight delayed coming back due to incompetent checking in staff and connecting flight delayed due to lack of interest. To cap it all our baggage had the locks cut off and one bag sliced into and things stolen by the baggage handlers....beware.Our Riad was lovely, we had a pleasant time relaxing and eating here, there were also some really good french restaurants, particularly Le Pavillion and Le Foundouk. But the Morroccan restaurants on the whole were filthy dirty, unpleasant staff, and the food.....uuuuugh.The single most disappointing thing about the whole experience for us was the morroccan food, we had imagined it to be tasty and spicy, how wrong can you be? Its a horrid unpleasant mix of sweet with savoury, sloppy tasteless cous cous and when you have had one tagine, you've pretty much had them all. All the menus are the same everywhere you go, and very little choice, stick to the french restaurants, at least here you can get a good steak! The best meal I had in Morrocco I kid you not was one I cooked for myself. In one of the hotels they do a days cookery course which I did and made a beautiful lamb tagine and side dishes....so it can be done!!Toilets around the place are only for the stout hearted, take plenty of tissues, there is never any toilet paper, one restaurant was charging for it! Close your eyes and pray the flush works.Ask the price of everything! Never assume the Morroccans are honest people, we were trusting and it backfired several times on us.Had 2 orange juices from a stall in the Medina, handed over 50 D (about 5 euros) was gived back 20. Later we saw the OJ should have been 3D a glass so were overcharged X6.Had a taxi for the same trip 3 times, guide book price 15D, they by law have to have the meter on, never saw it once. Taxi cost us 30, 40 and 50D??Barterring in the Medina is fun, here you are fair game for the rip off merchants but its fun trying to get one over on them, just when you think you have a bargain you will see it cheaper somewhere else!! Remember.....they will never ever sell at a loss, so they will always make money out of you. Always walk away at least once, never show you like something a lot, its best to act with indifference. Sometimes the stall holders would become aggressive if you tried to walk past their stalls and try and drag you in.I was surprised we were not hassled by beggars much, maybe 2 or 3 times at most, I was led to belive it was much worse, there are a lot ot police around (non of them doing anything) so maybe this is the reason.Streets in the Medina are truley horrible, to get back from the main square to the Riad through windy streets with cockroaches, rubbish in the street, butchers shops with fly ridden meat hanging in the sun, the constant spitting in the streeet, live chicken shops with scrawny filthy birds, the smell from which you would not believe in the heat of the sun.It was all I could do not to have a scarf wrapped around my face.All around the town is a real east meets west feeling- youngsters racing around the town on Mopeds past the hundreds of donkey drawn carts, most of which are on their last legs (the donkeys) are skin and bone and I could have wept at the men beating them to carry loads way too heavy.Forget the horse drawn carriage ride, one hour of sightseeing as promised by the guide, well one hour of dodging traffic, staring at walls and past the municipal rubbish tip was what we had.the best thing we did in Marrakech was to spend the morning in the 'Bain de Marrakesh' Hammam, being pampered and rubbed down with a variety of disturbing looking potions and being served mint tea all the while was very relaxing indeed.I think I have covered everything, I am reading this back and it sounds awful, and for me it really was. In short..Do not fly RAMTake plenty of tissuesBe prepared to fight for a bargain.Do go to the HammamAvoid Morrocan and eat frenchIf you are adventurous and are not too concerned about hygiene and love the sights and sounds of the city then Marrakech might be for you. If you like clean toilets, a decent night life, a beer that doesnt cost the earth and is easy to find then dont go here, take my advice save your money and try a romantic weekend in rome instead....I really wish I had!!!"
20,“Marrakech Mini Break”,"We have just come back from a mini break (FOUR NIGHTS) in Marrakech. Our hotel ""Sofitel Marrakech"" was beter than I expected as I had read a few mixed reviews previously. The staff on the whole were helpful and pleasant, the service good although a little lacking from what I would expect in a Five Star establishment.Marrakech it self was a little disappointing considering it had been billed as the trendiest hotspot for city breaks. Although the city is clean and civilised, we found the tourist attractions such as the monuments, museums etc very disappointg both in their content, and the way they were presented. There were no suitable signs and directions for visitors wishing to explore (if they didnt speak French or Arabic) by themselves. This gives ample opputunity for fake ""guides"" to take advantage of tourists.The best day of our trip was on a properly organized tour to the ""Ouriaka Valley"" showing the magnificient country side and terrain of the Atlas Mountan region. But a word of warning to those expecting a pleasant scenic trip to the mountains, part of the tour involved taking a hike up a very treacherous and physically demanding trail to the waterfalls at the top.Also part of the trip involved visiting a local Berbar family's home to see their way of life, it was a very humbling experience.On the whole I would say yes Marrakech is worth a visit for European visitors to experience a North African culture, but it isnt so fantastic that you would want to visit again and again."
50,“How to do Marrakech the chic way...”,"Me and my boyfriend are a young couple (22 & 29) and just spent a romantic and highly chic week in MarrakechAugust is apparently low season but I would say it was a brilliant time to go. A couple of the restaurants and bars are closed, but places that were open were full up and the main square had an almost overwhelming buzz of people. We wondered if at high season it would be too much to handle with more people.The weather was perfect, not too hot, but hot enough to come away with a healthy tan.If you want to experience the chic Marrakech and hang out at the posh socialite haunts you should get this really cool book called ‘A Hedonist’s Guide To’. My bro gave it to me last minute and I don’t think we would have enjoyed the holiday half as much without it.It reviews all the cool celebrity places to hang out, eat, sleep and drink.To experience a little choice we booked two different riads in the Medina (old town).Riad Saba was the first place we stayed. It is a beautifully refurbished newly built riad and is a five-minute walk from the main square.The riad has everything you would expect and more- from a trendy courtyard with water feature and leopard print cushions, to the traditional flower-potted sun drenched roof terrace where breakfast is served.What made it for us was the charm and kindness of Jebrane, the riad’s owner. He welcomed us with green tea and a lovely personal chat. He then walked us through the maze of streets to the Jemaa el Fna and gave us a few words of advice before leaving us to explore the souks (markets).Although we were only at the Riad for a couple of days, Jebrane became a friend and felt like a father figure, really taking care of us- He booked us a table at Bo Zin, a trendy restaurant we saw in our book, and arranged us to get free entry into Nikki Beach- a huge pool with swim-up bar, double beds and DJ…. (feels like a scene in a James Bond film.)We love to sleep late on holiday and woke up two hours after we arranged to have breakfast-ooops! This was no problem for Jebrane who arranged food for us on the roof terrace within minutes.Riad Saba really felt like home-we were told to help ourselves to the fridge and Jebrane’s right hand woman was always around if we needed anything.We will defiantly be back when the Jacuzzi arrives on the roof terrace.The second place we stayed was Riad Tiwaline, also in the Medina. This Riad was slightly more expensive and equally as amazing as Riad Saba.The French owner was lovely and was happy to do anything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. She gave me a massage for 35Euro’s, which was relaxing but more of a stroke than a deep tissue massage.Riad Tiwaline was stunning, very intricately decorated and much attention to detail.Both Riads where fantastic, I would definitely advise you to book more than one riad to test out."
50,"“Marrakech - riads, dars, discos and restaurants”","We have lived in and visited Morocco sporadically since 1964. Our most recent visit was to Marrakech where we split our stay between Riad Kniza [--] -- exquisite and incomparable -- and Dar Safia [--] on the Rte. d'Amizmiz, about 4 kms beyond the ramparts.These completely different types of accommodation, one a perfectly restored riad in the medina, the other a maison d'hôte villa with lovely gardens and a large pool, located on the outskirts of the city, together represent a wonderful contrast and highlight two of the many different ways one can live (or stay) in Marrakech.Close to Dar Safia is the Oasiria for those with children. Water slides for all ages, many pools including wave pools, 2 snack bars. Close to Riad Kniza in the medina is all that Marrakech is known for: sights, sounds, smells and fantastic food. For those seeking quiet, luxury and elegance, try Dar Djena, about 4km out of town on the route to Ourika.For entertainment, Chez Ali offers an excellent, fairly authentic and enjoyable nightly folklore performance complete with a traditional Moroccan dinner under a tent. For the disco dancers, there is Pasha where the action starts around 11:30pm.We did not find the restaurants in Marrakech up to our expectations of excellent cuisine (as compared to excellent home cooking). However, for those who want a 4-star meal, we can recommend two restaurants: Le Touggana (French - out of town) and Yacout (fantastic riad, superb night views over the medina, 2 Gnoua musicians on the roof bar, traditional Moroccan dishes)."
10,“Why go to Marrakesh / Morocco?”,"My girlfriend & I have just got back from Marrakesh (July 07) and felt like kissing the ground on return. We don't know what possessed us to go & feel incredibly grateful & relieved to have come back unscathed.If you are of European origin let alone British (or easily mistaken for) then we strongly recommend that you find somewhere less conspicuous and more comfortable to go to given the 'culture' of the place and the current political climate.You will be plagued by people hassling you and you will almost certainly feel vulnerable wherever you go. There's nothing to buy without an incredible struggle, unbelievable pressure and hassle and the whole experience (including the food) is thoroughly unpleasant (so pack some immodium even if staying in a 5* like ourselves).If you are British and intent on going we recommend that you avoid mentioning your origin as you will almost certainly be asked & it will attract inevitable comments about Tony Bliar, the war and Islam.Avoid letting any cab driver take you anywhere on a tour as you'll be 'traded' (it felt like being kidnapped) between two others en-route & get dumped in their friends shop (the 'government shop') along with other bemused captive Europeans. If as we did you chose to leave you will be followed & harrangued down the street for 1/2mile even after you manage to escape. On rejection you will be told in no uncertain terms what they would like to see happen to your country.Marrakesh seems to attract plummy & naive middle class British students & Guardian-reader types whose parents probably went their on the hippy/hash trail in the 60's and 70's. We were amazed by their complete lack of street-wiseness, incredibly inappropriate & conspicuous attire and the obvious attention that they attracted from the worst street parasites and criminals which in turn didn't do the rest of us any favours. The departure lounge seemed to be filled with stories of thefts, rip-offs, intimidation and bad service.Fundamentally avoid Morocco - get a book on it & go somewhere else that's warm and genuinely welcoming & comfortable unless your idea of a cultural or relaxing break consists of being on-guard at all times and having to defend yourself from people who for the most part seem to despise you."
50,“A fun Place to be”,"I returned to Marrakech for the first time in about 5 years - and i loved it. It still has an edge of excitment and colour , whilst still being civilised and full of good restaurants, great shopping and a real cafe (mint tea) culture. I think it is an amazing cultural get away for only being 3 or so hours from central europe....much colour, excitment and spice.My advice is stay in a riad (a traditional moroccan house) rather that a hotel chain unless you want to stay in a kasba outwith the city - which is also fun"
30,“Marrakesh Holiday”,"We stayed in Marrakesh from Friday 30th March until Saturday 5th May. Our accommodation was split between Hotel Ryad Mogador Menara, Riad de L'Orangeraie and Riad Samarkand. There are three 'Mogador' hotels in Marrakesh, this one is situated on Mohammed VI and about 20 mins walk from the central area of Gueliz which is the 'new city' and perhaps a 25 minute walk to the Medina, the old city, in the other direction. The Hotel was fine, nice entrance, clean and relatively good sized bedroom. The location was good for us to explore Gueliz for the first few days of our holiday plus the red tour bus (that you get in many European cities including UK ones) stops right next to the hotel at the conference centre next door. The bus is good for hopping on and off at different sites of interest around the city and there are two routes, the red and blue route. The blue one takes you out of the city and was slightly disappointing. The red route covers all main tourist attractions in and around the main city. I was disappointed with the breakfasts at the hotel however it depends what you are expecting. Whilst we stayed there we ate dinner at the brasserie next door (part of the Atlas hotel) which was quite nice (nice decor but food pretty average although they do serve alcohol after dark which they do not serve in the hotel). Other good places to eat include the Jacaranda Restaurant in Gueliz lejacaranda.ma (elegant French restaurant) and a pub/restaurant (I forget the name) which is about a 3 minute walk from the hotel if you come out of the hotel and turn right down Mohammed VI you will see it on the other side of the road (nice but simple food, pizza's etc plus beer and wine). Nights 5 and 6 were spent at Riad de L'Orangeraie riadorangeraie.com/index-gb.htm which was really good. Cyril organised a taxi to collect us from our hotel to take us to the Riad and we had help with our luggage through the winding alleys off the main road which is where the Riad is located. We were given a key to the front door come and go as we pleased however please note that none of the rooms have locks however you can store your passports and other important documents in the office safe. Our room was the 'Cinnamon' Room and it was lovely although the bathroom is situated on a different level, accessed via your bedroom up some stairs. The staff were very accommodating and friendly and breakfasts were lovely (hot Moroccan pancakes, french bread, jams, cakes, tea and coffee). The Riad is located very close to the Djemaa el Fna (5 mins walk or so) however is very quiet inside. You have to walk through part of the Souks to get to Djemaa el Fna however it is easy to find your way. We ate in the square at cafe's and restaurants plus from some of the food vendors in the centre and all the food we sampled was delicious (spicy sausages, couscous with chicken and vegetable, Kefta, Tagine's etc...). Our final Riad, Riad Samarkand was about a 20 minute walk from the Djemaa el Fna and through the souks, so if you had a late night you could find walking through the souks at night a little intimidating. The Riad was gorgeous, very relaxing with the most gorgeous room and bathroom. The breakfasts were not as good as the previous Riad however we did eat at the Riad on the last night and both ordered a tagine (traditional dish). The owner had one of the lounges set up for us with tablecloth, proper silver wear, candles and a fire so it was very private and very romantic. The only problem however was that both my husband and I were ill (he more than I) the next day for travelling home so not sure if it was the food (we think it was unfortunately). All in all we enjoyed Marrakesh but the constant harassment for money whether it be for fresh orange juice, watching snake charmers or being pestered for a henna tattoo (don't get one with black henna btw it has a dyes that can cause serious allergic reaction) was very draining."
40,“Few days in Marrakech”,"Marrakech is a crazy place, but if you're willing to leave your expectations behind you and go with the flow, it's a colourful city, bursting with life.There are beautiful riads to stay in and some wonderful food to try. Just take things easy and try not to get overwhelmed by the bustle and maze-like streets!"
10,“My terrible holiday in Marrakech”,"Visited Ma.rch 2007 - Stayed in Riad in the Medina.Our first mistake was to accept the recommendation of the travel advisor to stay in a Riad for 14 nights. Riads are town houses built to keep cool, consequently the rooms are exceptionally dark with tiny windows. Our Riad in the old town was situated up a narrow alleyway, vehicular access is very limited to these properties and the alleyways are frequented by large numbers of 'pop, pop' motor bikes giving of lots of fumes. One needs to be nimble and able to move quickly to avoid being run down. Additionally, beggars are everywhere, and the alleyways are very dirty.The Riad itself was fine, once inside, it was the negotiating to get there. The delightful lady who ran it told us she did not take her dog out to walk in the Medina since 'it was too dirty', that said it all.The golf courses which we had planned to play turned out to be expensive and very poor, The Royal was reasonable, very pretty,but short. Amelkis, was rather like a poor municipal course in the uk and certainly to be avoided.Getting about was difficult, since the taxis were on strike on several days, they were much more expensive than we were lead to believe (£19.75) return for a ten minute trip to Golf Club.The food was pretty awful, so basic, we used Italian Restaurants and they were better. Finding a good eating house was not easy, they are in short supply.A visit to the Marjorelle gardens owned by Ives St Laurent was magnificent and should not be missed.On arrival at the airport for the home trip we were deposited on the road by the taxi and had to get our luggage and golf clubs to check in which was not easy and would be very difficult for individuals with children or people unable to walk far or the elderly. The Airport was total chaos once inside, no clear instructions where to check in. Finally, we discovered we could not use up our currency at duty free, they only take major currencies, be warned, get rid of yours before you get to the airport. If you must go to Marrakeck my advice is to stay in a five star hotel on the outskirts with all the facilities, at least youy can stay and use the hotel. Only go for max of 4 nights, there is not enough to do for longer and do not consider it as a golf destination.I am now looking for a civilsed destination to recover from my worst holiday ever.Marianne, Cirencester, Glos"
10,“Marrakech after the sun goes down...”,"I recently travelled with 2 of my friends for a weekend break in Marrackech. We stopped at the Meridian Hotel, which had reasonable facilities, tennis courts, swimming pools and gym\sauna.Having travelled to numourous cities across Europe, we were led to believe that Marrackech was similar, so we were looking forward to going to a nice restaurant, have some drinks and then hit a club!I won't name club names etc. (but we didn't find one that was any different) but after eating at a half decent restaurant, nothing spectacular, we were astonished at the price of the drinks, £5 for a shot of bacardi (and the measure looked less than a single!), and then the biggest surprise of all.....Every single club we went to, there were 3 times of women ....1] Tourists 2] Waitresses 3]Ladies of the night!!!!! We were absolutely stunned at the level of prostitution within Marrakech, after 8.00 you could not talk to a Moroccan woman who wasn't on the game. This sounds like an exaggeration, but it really isn't. And I do feel that this needs to be highlighted as it is not a place where you can go to a club and enjoy some harmless flirting, etc., as all the women have only one thing on their mind .... to get clients.It was really disappointing and saddening to see the level of exploitation of these young Moroccan women that the increase in tourism has led to."
40,“Nice interesting place”,"We flew on 10th March with Easyjet for 4 days, me (male) with girlfriend and another two women, all ranging 24 to 30 yo, difficult task in Marrakech...Arrival: we changed the money at the airport and took a cab (4 people, we were asked for 150dirhams, ended up paying 100) to hotel Agdal.Hotel Agdal: nice lobby, basic rooms with TV and bathroom, not luxury and cheap, safe place, good location with cafes and restaurants nearby,very important for Morocco: they sell alcohol.Being 4 we walked the first day to the Medina (30 minutes) and we moved around in petty cabs (3 people maximum), expect to pay 20 dirhams altought they used meters in some cases but we ended up tipping them at the end of the journey.The Medina, Mosque, zouks and the Square are great places, day and night is worthy to be visited, obviously you have to haggle for everything, we bought pottery, silver stuff, wooden crafts, fakes....the square is great at night and I personally felt safe despite the amount of people in there looking at you and offering all sort of things.Careful with the ladies jumping on you/offering henna tatoos, some of them do not use the proper ""ink"" if you know what I mean and once you wash it you can find different colours and the look is not nice.Lot of stalls selling food at night in the square, we found it expensive if you compare with other restaurants we went to but we had a lot of fun with the waiters (they can speak any language!!!), restaurants around the square (not the night stalls) are quite cheap and do even offer a set menu for something like £3.50, real bargain.Don't you miss cous cous and tagines, it's all about that and at the end of the day you are supossed to try local stuff!!Nightlife: Pacha' on a Sunday night was empty (6-8 people) and moved to another club called Teatro or similar, expensive (London prices) but much more people.Smoking Shisha (the local pipe) was a funny experience, good time, we went to a place called Lebanon, a cafe situated in the same area than Majorelle Gardens (worthy visit).Day trip (if you go more than three days you must do a day trip, Marrakech can be seen in two days easily) to the Atlas, ""Bere-bere"" village and the waterfalls (it's more than one hour walking, not 30 minutes like they say to you) and we paid 500 dirhams for the four of us to hire a taxi from 10:00-17:00, you are stopped in different shops as the driver gets a commission in case you buy anything, we didn't buy as we had done it in Marakech already, you are supossed to eat in the restaurant that the driver tells you (very touristic place, we didn't like it and driver got upset as he lost his commission, we ended up eating the best tagine of the four days in one of the restaurants by the river at around 5-6 miles form the waterfalls area with stunning views, we paid 80dirhams per person, more than worthy).Ah! no food sickness at all and get used to the way they look at women (if you are shy it can be a bit uncomfortable).Don't you forget to change your money before crossing the passport check area (we were given euros instead of pounds, no problem we'll use it in our next trip:).J"
40,“Prepare yourself for an experience!!”,"Marrakech is a fantastic place with many different offerings, from the bustling chaos of the souks and the medina to the beauty and splendour of the Atlas mountains. After spending a week there my advice would be as follows -Make sure you have a pen in your hand luggage to fill out the little card when you arrive in the airport confirming the length and nature of your stay. The primary language acknowledged there is French.Make sure that you experience the market at night time, at least once. It can be an initimidating prospect to immerse yourself in such a busy environment, alien to the unseasoned traveller, under the cover of darkness. However if you keep a firm eye/hand on your wallet and your eyes open it is an experience that cannot be parralleled. I will say no more and let you discover for yourself!Food-wise; Morrocan dishes tend to consist of meat, chick peas and then sweet potato, courgette and carrott. All the veg is slow cooked with the meat and so if you do not want to run the considerable risk of having a salad you may find yourself craving nutrients a few days into your stay, especially since the other dietary staple is bread. Lots and lots of bread!! The best thing to do is to take some fresh fruit that will last a day or two and enough dried fruit to get you through.Trips - do not miss the opportunity to go up the Atlas mountains. Our holiday organiser had a chap that wanted over 500 dirhams (approx £30) to take us - we managed to get a trip offering the same highlights for 220 dirhams per person. The key to Marrakech every time is to ensure you shop around! When you do go up the mountains you will be greeted by the Berber (native Morrocan) people and their children. They are beautiful and very sweet - and love treats! Some people may feel strongly against this, but they have very little - to take them some lollipops, felt pens, crayons, colouring books will absolutely make their day - just make sure you take a good 15 + lollipops - you can get them in the town for a few pence each.There isnt a great deal of nightlife - there a Pascha slightly out of town but if that sort of night is for you perhaps its best to go elsewhere. Being a Muslim faith country means that drinking is best left to your hotel or meal at a restaurant, and dont expect much life in the city after about 10:30pm (off-season)"
20,“Culture shock”,"My husband & I recently stayed 3 nights at the Ryad Mogador in Marrakech. The hotel was fine - rooms small & basic, but clean. The breakfast was a continental style buffet - good & plenty of it. We didn't use the restuarant for any other meals, as wanted to eat in the local restaurants. The restaurant & bar staff were friendly, the check-in desk not so much - only spoke french & very fast at that! There is no alcohol served in the hotel. It's location is its strongest point, as being just outside the medina walls meant we could walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.Marrakech itself was a huge culture shock. Very crowded (not with tourists), very busy, often smelly (corners used as toilets etc). The 'sights' that we visited were well worth it - The Bahia palace; Ben Alli Yusaf Medersa; the Jardin Majorelle; the Musee de Marrakech, and others. However, wherever we went we were hassled - people wanting to 'help us'. We were overcharged 100dirham at least for our taxi from the airport, and within an hour of arrival had been 'helped' to a spice shop & a berber carpet market, by a friendly local who turned out to be on commission. The famous souqs could be seen as fascinating; or as dirty, smelly & intimidating, depending on how stout-hearted you are!! Whichever way you see them , you inevitably get lost in them, and can pay anything between 20 to 150 dirham to be guided back out. Also, beware of taxi or carriage drivers making polite conversation about where you are from & where you are staying - they will pass this on when you stop, and lo & behold 2 minutes later, someone who 'works in your hotel' will appear to help you out, or lead you somewhere.We ate in different restaurants each lunchtime & evening, and had some beautiful meals, especially the lamb tagines. We didn't eat in the square (Djemma el Fna) as it was so crowded with the local people, who just wanted our money! Stoppping to watch the entertainments in the square was also a costly business - 150dirham to take a picture of a snake charmer!The petit taxis were old but seemed reliable, & the ones we used stuck to what was on the meter. We were glad we took the advice of our guidebook and wore long sleeved/legged clothes - there was no-one wearing shorts or t-shirts. We also followed the advice not to hold hands or show public affection, as again it seemed appropriate to follow the local custom in that respect.Crossing the road is an extreme sport - traffic lights & zebra crossings seem to be more of a suggestion than an actual rule, and the traffic is absolutely mad!! Cars,buses, horse&carriages,scooters, donkeys & bicycles: all weaving in & out of pedestrians & each other, horns blaring as they go!!Overall, I'm glad we went, and even more glad to be back! Also, I'm extremely thankful we didn't take our teenaged sons, and that we only stayed 3 nights."
40,"“Pampering, Pollution and Poverty”","We took the ferry from Algeciras,Spain to Tangiers, Morocco with the car.(180e car,2 adults one way) . Crossing the Straits of Gibralter is magnificent. The big rock looms up at the side of the ferry and the tourists are click happy with the views of the Med.Within 2 hours we could see the coast of Africa, the hills of Tangiers, how splendid!Having negotiated the port we took off for the 7 hour drive south, (partial itinerary of the Dakar Rally) on the relatively new fab road system.We watched (what i would describe as likened to biblical scenes) the shepherds tend their few sheep in the fields attired in long gowns, the donkeys and carts ploughing through the mud, the 4 boys walking in unison seeding the fields, the children playing football outside all sorts of humble dwellings, the cow pulling the plough... it is fascinating,like an innocent past. When we stopped at a lovely roadside AIRE de REPOS, the friendly owner brought me out a fish that had been just caught in the river for my lunch.It was cooked with African spices (8e). Scrumptious.My Other Half opted for the chicken tagine, one of the national dishes. He had no complaints.We arrived in Marrakesh that night and it was quite smoggy from serious car fumes.However, we always opt to stay in Hivernage, the French area. Half board in the Mansour Eddhabi, a former Kempinski is a semi gourmet experience.The service is impeccable. (and a small tip works wonders in a country where the basic wage is 180e per month and there is no welfare!)Also they have a beautiful pool area. The best about Marrakesh is the wellness centres.The hammam (turkish bath and body scrub) is a terrific way to relax. I found the best value was to take a package in the Riad Mogador Hotel for Hammam, rose petal wrap and a facial that went on for ever for 50e!!!I A visit to Place Jmaa al Fnaa at sunset is a must if not a culture shock to say the least.Fires are lit on the square as people get on with cooking all sorts of meat and unidentifiable thingsStaying near here is not for the faint hearted!We headed on then to the Souks without a guide and found all the people very friendly. Start your bargaining at half the quoted price, handbags etc.We visited fabric (tissu)souks and got some real bargains.Eating out in good restuarants is relatively reasonable if not cheap. We had a lovely meal in the Katansaru off Mohammed v, very casual, cheap and cheerful and full of French ex-pats.Le Six on Mohammed VI is good for coffee or an evening drink. |However, eating in Le Yacout or the famous old Hotel Le Mamounia are experiences I will never forget. The atmospheres cannot be described, the sense of being so special, while only fleeting was amazing. My only disappointment was La Trattoria as the food was miserably mean with the smallest servings. A week in Marrakesh and you will see it all.The friendly people of Marrakesh, the Hammam and the necessity of tourism is what draws me back there."
50,“Marrakech Trip Report”,"Morroco TripJanuary 20thWe flew Royal Air Morroco to Marrakech in 2 ½ hours. As we were crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, leaving one continent for another, I could see how narrow it was-about 14 miles.. It was thrilling to see it from a bird’s eye view after reading about it all of my life. We passed over groves of orange trees growing in orderly rows and landed at a simple airport which reminded me of Mexico-simple architecture, pink walls, marble floors but, of course, there was a moorish look. We had a taxi driver waiting for us and it was a short drive to our riad in the medina, the old walled 11th century ancient city. We parked by a mosque and he walked us up a narrow, dead end street called a Dreb, and we came to a wide wooden studded door which enclosed the Riad Sahara Nour. After ringing the door bell, the door opened into a typical small foyer which is all outsiders can see from the street. We were lead into one of those great central courtyards open to the sky, full of plants with a center water fountain in which marigolds floated. All of the rest of the rooms ranged around this courtyard. The owners are French, very nice people who often offer art classes here. They have really lovely art work and rugs around the place, mostly from Pakistan. After some mint tea-a tradition here-we took a walk through some of the souk-market-dodging dangerous motor cycles and bikes-there is no room for cars in the narrow streets of the medina-and came into the large square, the Place Jemaa el Fna, where there were many food stalls with lit up covered places to eat serving all sorts of food. We never did eat there as the owner of our riad said that there was a one in four chance of getting sick there. There was music and entertainment and it was a very lively and fun place.We returned to the riad for dinner. We had a starter of eggplant, tomatoes and zuchinni in a vinagar, then a tangine with lamb and an apple sort of fruit, all baked in a tasty sauce for hours in one of those neat covered dishes. The dessert was sliced oranges from their own trees in the courtyard dusted with cinnamon. We also drank a gris rose from Morroco, very delicious.I really like Marrakech-such a difference from western civilization. We heard the calls to worship twice from the towers of the mosques in the evening and probably will again during the night.January 21stWe were, indeed, awakened before dawn by the chanting of the mosques, calling the faithful to worship. I guess in ancient times they must have used the voice of a man high in a tower to call men to prayer instead of the bells of the western world. We did see many men in the long robes with hoods walking around but all of the young people were dressed western in style. And, of course, there were many women in the long dresses, head covering and some veils. There seem to be many similarities between the religions of the world with the beautiful buildings constructed for worshipping God, the calls to prayer/worship/mass, the long robes of the holy men/priests and the rather eastern looking garb of nuns. Plus, all of those rules, traditions, beliefs, prejudices.After breakfast in the really lovely dining room-very high painted ceilings, carved decorations all along the walls of the narrow room, gorgeous tile behind the red couches which follow the walls-the owner, Francoise, told us about Morrocan architecture.. A ryad, means Eden or paradise, and always has a center courtyard opened to the sky with four beds for plants and trees and a central fountain. A Dar, another type of house, usually doesn’t have a fountain or four garden beds. This riad was one level to start with and then a second one was added. They did two years worth of work with “1000 donkey trips” for supplies, to renovate and stabilize the top floor. HIs wife went to a lot of trouble to get it all authentic as possible.We walked around the medina in another direction to what is called a cyber garden built by various computer companies and it was fairly lush and well maintained. There is a little internet cafe there along with wifi access. It was closed because today is the New Year Day for Muslims. In fact, there was more than usual calling last night from the mosques because of it. We looked at an artisan place and priced some carpets with no pressure from the salesman at all. We were headed in the direction of a palace when a very nice man stopped to help us with directions. He was very pleasnat and fun to talk to. He said he would take us there but, despite all I read read on Trip Advisor, we ended up at a carpet shop (probably owned by a relative of his) sitting down, drinking mint tea while they laid out carpet after carpet in front of us. The salesman wouldn’t tell us the cost of them until he had finished his presentation and we had narrowed down the rugs to the few we liked. The one we liked the best was, we were told, 12,000 DH. We were told by Francoise to offer back ¾ of the first amount we were told which we did. It was like being with an American car salesman. He looked offended and said it was rare to get this kind of carpet and that only a few came in each year as it took a woman years to make one. Maurice stood firm. By the time we were walking out they were agreeing to our offer but Maurice doesn’t like to be pushed or hurried so we left and never did get a carpet there or anywhere else.We went through another interesting part of the souk and ended up back the the main square where we had lunch up on a second story balcony over-looking the busy square. Afterwards we found a snake charmer with a cobra which I thought at first was rubber. A man tried to drape another ordinary snake around Maurice’s neck but didn’t succeed. After getting lost and wandering all over the souk, we found the Marrakech Museum, with nothing much in it but a lovely ceiling with a huge center courtyard. After a little rest, we walked to the modern part of the city, full of zooming cars, wide sidewalks, modern shops and fashionable young people. We had an early dinner of pannini and got a taxi back to our riad for about two euros.Francoise and his wife were now out of town but a nice cook or houseboy were there to help. Maurice was told that a neighbor across the way died last night. We saw a group of men outside the house. Part of tradition when someone dies, is born or is married is to bring a huge container of sugar as a gift. A big cart pulled up with three huge boxes of sugar. There are many of these carts in the medina pulling loads around the narrow streets, sometimes pulled by a man, sometimes a donkey or mule. Bicycles and motorcycles zoom around and are a true danger in the narrow streets. We each had close calls many times barely getting out of the way in time. It really gets irritating after a while. We’ve noticed that no vehicle slows down for pedestrians even if they are on crosswalks. Sometimes motor bikes go through red lights, make turns from the wrong side of the street and everyone seems to ignore one way signs. Even if there is a rare pedestrian crossing light, that doesn’t mean it is safe to cross the street.January 23rdToday we totally avoided going through the souk, something I don’t mind but Maurice gets annoyed with it. After a fruitless visit once more to the cyber garden-not open until 2 PM-we walked to the Bandi Palace which is totally empty and has few remaining walls or tiles left as it was stipped by a conquerer. It was mostly crumbling brown walls open to the sky. I liked the storks there which had made messy round nests on top of the walls. They had a funny mating call where they bent their heads backwards until it touched their backs and as they brought their heads fowards they clacked their long beaks rapidly together rather like castanettes. We were unable to find another palace that I wanted to see walking around for quite a long time. We found ourselves back at the huge square and had a pizza up three stories over-looking the huge area once more.Maurice called our first taxi driver for a ride out to Palmeraia, an area that reminded me of Scotsdale with many pink mansions, golf courses and desert vegetation. At one time there were 150,000 palm trees but, as a guide book said, they are quickly being replaced with celelbrities, such as Paul McCartney. Chirac has a place there too.Each evening at about 6:30 PM you can hear carts full of metal cannisters of natural gas being pushed down the streets to be sold. In the morning we hear a man honking a hand held horn with a cart of cooking oil containers for sale. There are often little boys in the narrow street leading to our riad playing some sort of game with a type of hand made ball. I bet they would like a hacky sack. I’ve looked for some around here but didn’t see them. There air here always seems full of dust due to construction, traffic and lack of rain. There are many carts in the streets pulled by men, donkies or horses, carts sitting around with men in them waiting to be hired to carry heavy loads, especially in the medina. There are many horse pulled carriages for tourists all mingled with auto traffic.We really like our riad. It gives more of a feel of real life, not the artificial life of a hotel. The location is good, on the edge of the medina. Maurice’s daughter stayed in the center and said it was too isolated and hard to get out to a taxi. Our only complaint is that it gets really cold at night (in January) and the rooms stay very cold. There are gas heaters but they don’t put out enough heat. I was cold in all of the rooms. Our shower head was too high and put out a think stream of water and it wasn’t hot enough to get a good shower. There was no lip on the floor so water spread out on the floor and there was no shower curtain either. Other than that, we loved our riad.January 23rdWe decided to take the open top bus around Marrakech to get a over view of the city. A 12 euro ticket was good for all day. We took the drive around old Marrakech seeing parts of the old city wall and a wonderful door in the wall, the Bab Agnaou. We got off to see the Bahia Palace but it was closed for lunch. We ended up, via the bus, in the newer part of Marrakech where we once again had pizza. We are having an expensive dinner so we want to eat light. We got of the bus to to see the la Menara garden, a total waste of time. All that is there is an olive tree grove and a big rectanglular cement basin. We took another bus out to the Palmeraia again and saw the same palm trees and camels. I did learn that the palm trees are not natural but were planted from date seeds brought from Arabia centuries ago. There is a lot of unseen irrigation underground. There are plans to plant more trees and there will one day be many more. We were riding the bus all day and got back to the riad at 5 PM.Dinner at Dar Moha turned out to be a fabulous, romantic experience. We walked into the reception area where rose petals floated on the water of a fountain. We were led through several very nice rooms out to the patio. In the center was a small swimming pool filled to the brim with clear water and a geometric design of tile on the bottom. The walls surrounding the patio were painted a persian blue. Huge trees grew on each side. We were seated at a round table with a tall silver candle holder holding a white candle which was lit when we sat down. Rose petasl of red, apricot and white were scattered across the table top. We were were able to order a bottle of wine-a Morrocan rose-not always possible in this muslim city. Before our entre, 11 small dishes were placed on the table with a variety of marinated vegetables, cauliflower-tempera fried, small pieces of chicken breaded and fried. Everything had strong, pleasant tastes of various spices. It was hard not to eat too much to be too full for what was to come. The entre was a pastille, a pastry with a vegetable filling. We both had a tangine, Maurice’s lamb, mine beef fillet with two different vegetable couscous dishes. It all tasted wonderful. My beef dish was very tender with a flavorful gravy blended into the couscous and several types of vegetables. My dessert was a dainty apple concoction, very light and delicious. The service was great and it was a joy to sit in the beautiful lush setting while musicians played Morrocan music by the pool. The first musician had a stringed, guitar-like instrument. Some of his music sounded like he was tuning it, but some sounded like the guitar music from Spain, probably showing traces of the Andulasian affect still in existance here, in music and architecture. Two other musicians also played, with the guitar and a drum. Their music and singing sounded more Aftican. One man had a hat on with a tassle that he would swing around in a circle in time to the beat.January 24thUp bright and early to catch a bus to the sea coast town of Essaouira. It was a three hour drive but it seemed to go by quickly. We had to make the usual prerequisite stops that tour groups always do, such as an almond commune where women sat on the floor and shelled almonds, smashed them or crushed them into a paste. They sold soap, oil and face creams. We also made an stop near the town of Haha for a bathroom break where three restaurants all in a row advertised toilettes.The landscape was interesting as we traveled. There was a very busy four lane highway as we left Marrakech which then became two lane. We saw fewer and fewer vehicles although near villages there would be motor bikes and bicycles. Mostly people were on donkeys with an occasional mule or horse. They are truly beasts of burden here. I saw one pulling a plow, many being loaded up or pulling wagons. I think Morroco is actually rockier than Provence, something I never thought I’d see. At points there were no trees or plants to be seen although the sheep and goats must have been finding something out there. There were just rocks and, except for the lack of red coloring, it looked like a scene of the landscape of Mars sent down from the little explorer up there on that distant planet. It was very arid and deserty in places and seeing Joseph leading a pregnant Mary seated on a mule looking for a place to stay wouldn’t have been surprising..The town of Essaouira turned out to be delightful. We did a short walking tour through the old medina and around the ramparts and toured a little factory making, by hand, inlayed objects of wood found in a forest we passed through just before entering the little town. It was originally called Mogador, the name the Portugeues gave it when they occupied it. There were once many hippies here in the 60’s and 70’s but they got kicked out eventually. The mosque here was closed for a while recently as extremist were showing up and trying to recruit men for their activities.. For a long time it was the only port which shipped goods from Africa abroad until the French built a larger port in Casablanca. The town was full of doors into parts of an old wall. There was a little rampart to explore which overlooked the bay and crashing waves on a rocky coast. The harbor was very interesting with large boats being built of wood and many smaller boats, all painted blue, floating in the still waters. Blue and white are the predominant colors here, looking a little like some of the islands in Greece. It had a European feel having been designed by a Frenchman rather like St Malo with ramparts to protect the town.We made it back to Marrakech by 7:15 glad we had made the journey.Janurary 25thWe only had half a day left on our last day here and spent it wandering around the medina buying a few things. I wanted to buy a tangine dish but a friend told me that they are very tough on carryons at the airport and that she was forced to put it with the luggage and it arrived broken, so I decided to wait and get that back in Paris. They have great slippers, brightly colored and covered in sequin designs that are perfect for loafing around the house, so I got some of those. I also got some wonderful tassels to decorate pullls on curtains.I was pleasantly surprised by Morroco. I arrived with few expectations not knowing what to expect. We had perfect weather with blue skies and sunshine with the weather in the 70’s everyday-not bad for January. The people were friendly, the city fascinating, and there is a very heavy French influenence here as France was the protectorate of Morroco until the 50’s-which is rather like being a colony but it is voluntary. French is still mandatory in schools and everyone I met spoke French along with some English. Our guide on our day trip even spoke German. The main income of Morroco is its produce such as nuts and dates and tourism is becoming a big source as well. I really recommend a trip to Morroco for those who love to travel and see something different."
20,“A General review of Hammans in morroco”,"The Hamman (a spa type bath place) is such an experience it deserves a section for itself. There are many in Morocco but we went to a bit more tourist friendly one. The local ones are extremely cheap and they literally get you wet, scrub the hell out of you, then wash you down and you’re expected to pay for what could just as easily be done to you in a female prison. But the one we went to was decorated very nicely and here is what happened;•They stick you in the “relaxation room” where they tell you to take your clothes off however, being an English bird and very self conscious I had a swimming costume with me and I thought I’d got away with it until they took me to the shower room where I basically got my top yanked off me.•We then got taken to the scrubbing place (I didn’t take my hands away from my top half, I was trying to cover myself up as much as possible) and we got covered in this soapy stuff the taken to the steam room.•After being in there for about 10 minutes we got warm buckets of water thrown over us, well, buckets of warm water, not that the buckets were warm. Then told to lye down on this bed thing when they scrubbed us so much, it hurt like hell!•Then it was back to the shower where I got thoroughly molested and had my bikini bottoms pulled down, I was shocked and instantly pulled them back up! And I thought that the men were very forward towards me!•Next, upstairs to the massage room where we then totally naked, I did not enjoy this one little bit. But what was worse was that the woman left my curtain quite open and the towel they use to cover you didn’t quite cover you so my [--] was left exposed. It was like my worst nightmare, being naked in public and physically abused by woman! I’m scarred for life! So all in all it was a very strange experience and one I will definitely not be reenacting. “They really are like paradise; the ultimate place to relax” Yeah, [--] are they!"
40,"“Marrakech, Jan 2007”","Marrakech was fine, albeit manic, with traffic everywhere and people trying to make a living out of the tourist trade, although a sharp ""Non, Merci"" seemed to do the trick on most occasions.The Medina tourist office has been closed and so the only information centre is about a mile away from the old town area, which is rather inconvenient. Not much information available there, but the people are friendly and helpful.You mustn't miss the Jemaa el Fna experience as dusk settles on the city, and the whole scene changes in the course of 45 minutes. We found that the city tour bus (£8.00 per person for 24 hours hop on-hop off), stops regularly through the main hotel district, was good for orientation purposes and allowed us to plan what we wanted to see and do for the 4 full days that we had available. The main tourist office is located at the overlap point of the 2 city bus routes. Once you understand the layout of the city it's easy to walk around from place to place.. which is more than I can say for the souqs... which are truly labyrinthine... but just wandering around is an experience in itself, and we were pretty much left alone by the tradesmen."
20,“Tourist trap?”,"If you're thinking about a trip to Marrakech you have to be prepared for a city of contrasts:squalor & splendourhostility & charmchaos & tranquillityWe found it overwhelming and by the end of 4 days we just wanted to be left alone - we couldn't stand the constant hassling and haggling. There was a huge number of tourists and most restaurants seemed to cater for them alone, making for a rather strange atmosphere. We are not used to this type of location - it may be fine for others but we found it oddly contrived.There were a couple of moments when the hassling turned to prodding and actual contempt when we showed no interest - this was unnerving and upsetting. The police have far from got this under control despite claims to the contrary.Marrakech is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success, a bit like Venice, but I know where I'd rather go."
50,“First time visit to Marrakech”,"Below i have offered my advice on first time visitors to Marrakech:Do not be afraid of Marrakech and the intimidating nature of 'sellers' in the souqs. I was for the first few days of my trip - but when i relaxed and started to enjoy the experience i realised it was not as daunting as first impressions. If you say NO to people they will accept it - it is the minority that continue to pressure you.Ask for meters to be put on in the small taxis. Rides to anywhere in Marrakech should cost max of 15-20 dirham. Thats max.Visit the NARWARMA - it is the best place i have ever eaten - its not cheap - but the atmosphere, decor and setting are second to none. (There is also a one eyed cat that lives outside! Give it a stroke!)Speak to people - dont be afraid of the language barrier most people are friendly and helpful.When bartering for goods start at half the price you are willing to pay and work toward your maximum. Stop at a level you think is acceptable and be assured that is all you will pay - they will come down to your price eventually. Dont be scared to barter - it is what they expect and do for everything they sell! (i also found offering small presents as part of the deal helped, offer some small english currency or something of interest - i on one occasion swapped a beatles badge i had as part of a deal!)Hope this helps."
30,"“Great place, but beware the tourist trap”","We came to Marrakech in February 2006 for a 4 day break. The weather was lovely, and very warm in the sun, if a bit chilly in the shade or if the sun went behind a cloud.The food we ate was great, the tagines and couscous were a real treat. Generally most of the people we met were also very nice and friendly, and staying in the Sofitel we felt was a very good choice, it being a short walk into the Medina, while being in the relative calm just outside.Unfortunately the one cloud on our horizon was that we felt manipulated for the majority of our time in the medina. On our first day we engaged in conversation with someone we passed on the street who 'became' our guide in the medina and led us to certain shops, where we were then subjected to hard sell routines. Not being used to this, and a little naive, we bought things we now really feel we do not want or need. Even when we elected to take a Caleche (a horse drawn carraige) on a relaxing trip through the medina, the driver stopped and took us into a shop where the same happened. Although we recognise that this is a poor nation and the people are trying hard to earn a living, this wore thin fairly quickly, and even on our trip back to the airport at the end of our stay, the taxi driver tried very hard to charge us 8 times the going rate, also calling over a porter that we didn't need to take our bags the 100 metres to the check in desk.Although much of the advice we had read suggested we be pleasant but firm with regard to this, we were unprepared for the amount of pressure we were put under to part with more money there than we were comfortable with.To sum up, it is a lovely place to visit, with a rich array of sites, sounds, tastes and culture. However be aware that you will be a target from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, and perhaps leaving your credit card at home would be a good idea."
10,“Grubby Horrible Town”,"If considering a holiday in Marrakech, think very carefully about alternatives. I have just spent 8 days in this very over-rated town. The museums are poor quality. The food is worse than expected. The famous square is nothing more than a way to part with your cash to get rid of so called entertainers. Do not expect any help from the locals without crossing there palm with silver, even for directions. I will not be returning even if I won a trip.To balance this I will say the Atlas Mountains are spectacular but do not compensate for Marrakech.I do not understand the hype about this place. Try Vietnam its far superior."
20,“marrakech e dintorni”,"sicuramente dei bei posti, ma nel suk farina anziché spezie, troppi acchiappa turisti per ""qualsiasi"" truffa.

Mi dispiace doverlo dire, ma preferisco altri luoghi."

40,“Interessante anche se troppo turisticamente sfruttata”,"Marrakech va vista, prima di tutto perchè ha una struttura interessante, poi perchè la piazza principale ha una sua storia. In piazza quello che penso sia la cosa migliore sono i racconti che vengono fatti da uomini che raccolgono attorno a sé centinaia di autoctoni che ridono e si divertono, i racconti vengono fatti in arabo o in dialetto e purtroppo non sono comprensibili per noi.Una tradizione che c'era anche in altri paesi d'Europa e che è andata persa. Un altra attrazione da non perdere è a sera tutti i ristorantini che vengono montati nel pomeriggio (e smontati a sera tarda, ogni giorno) nella piazza e che offrono piattini locali da gustare, c'è solo l'imbarazzo della scelta. Da non pedere anche la spremuta di arance che viene fatta al momento nei numerosi ""baracchini"". Il resto, giocolieri, incantatori di serpenti e altro, sono ben poca cosa. Attenti a fare le foto, anche se non li inquadrati vi chiederanno soldi. Il turista , per loro, è solo da mungere, d'altra parte probabilmente non hanno alternative. A Marrakech preferisco Essaouira."

Soggiornare almeno una notte in un riad per comprendere meglio come si viveva una volta nelle case padronali, che bello svegiarsi fra gli arredi d'epoca immersa in mille colori.Una visita all'hammam è d'obbligo l'offerta è notevole ma una volta bisogna provarlo, ed infine un salto nel suk della medina per immergersi nei mille profumi della città delle spezie.Indimenticabile l'olio alla rosa.I prezzi sono bassi rispetto a una vacanza in Italia."

40,“Explore Marrakech”,"Städtetrip nach Marrakesch: Orientalisches Flair , in wenigen Flug-Stunden erreichbar. Die Altstadt (Medina) von Marrakesch ist für ein paar Tage Stadtbummel eine aufregende Abwechslung. Die Stadt ist extrem sauber, für arabische Verhältnisse besonders. Nach ein paar Stunden hat auch den Orientierungssinn für den Bummel durch die schmalen Wege, der Souks seine Übersichtgefunden. Wenn nicht, gibt es genug Helfer, die bereits am Gesichtsausdruck erkennen und die Richtung zum Jemaa-el-Fna square weisen .Hier gilt das arabische Sprichwort: Geduld ist der Schlüssel zum Erfolg. Das gilt bei dem Bummel und Einkaufen. Handeln ist anstrengend und ungewohnt, dafür sollte der Besucher sich einige Zeit nehmen. Übernachtung in der Medina. Im Riad El Wigwam --- Die Wahl ist bei dem großen Angebot, nicht einfach. Unsere Entscheidung war bestens. Gute Lage zu den Souks und Sehenswürdigkeiten. Die Zimmer, liebevoll im Detail eingerichtet, nur wenige Zimmer im Hotel. Ein ruhiges, romantisches Plätzchen mit 1001 Nacht Flair. Frühstück sehr fein zu bereitet. Auf alle Wünsche wird eingegangen. Auch wird nach Wunsch für den Gast gekocht. Der Transport vom Flughafen kurz und günstig vom Hotel organisiert. Kleiner Ausflug zum Jardin Majorelle mit riesigen Kakteen. Im Souk ist das Essen sauber, die Orangensäfte frisch und billig. Alle Speisen gut verträglich. Tipp: Besuchen Sie Marrakesch mit ganz wenig Gepäck, für den Rückflug brauchen sie Platz. Leider sehr nervend sind die Mopeds und Motorräder die durch die Altstadt im Menschengewimmel durchbrettern."
40,“Klassisches Ziel und trotzdem trendy”,"Marrakesch ist und bleibt das klassische Ziel in Marokko. Hotels aller Kategorien (neuerdings unglaublich viele 5-Sterne-Hotels), Golfplätze (obwohl das Wasser knapp ist) und ansonsten natürlich auch Unterkünfte aller Preisklassen.

Am Hauptplatz betören Orangensaftverkäufer, Schlangenbändiger und tanzende Derrwische - alles echt.

40,“Tolles Erlebnis”,"Da Marrakesch jetzt mit Ryanair von etlichen deutschen Flughäfen billig und nonstop zu erreichen ist, ist es ein ideales Ziel für ein verlängertes Wochenende (3-4 Tage): Orientalisch, buntes Treiben und so ganz anders als das durchorganisierte Deutschland. Länger als 4 Tage würde ich nicht empfehlen, da doch alles zwar sehr interessant, aber auch anstrengend ist. Aber gut mit Essaouira oder Agadir für ein paar Tage Erholung zu kombinieren."
