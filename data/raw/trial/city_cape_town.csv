40,“Running routes”,"As a seasoned runner, I have run all over Cape Town. Be it o the slopes of Table Mountain or in Newlands Forest, you can particularly any where in Cape Town. I prefer to run in the morning just as the sun rises."
40,“Cape Town City Tour”,"This city with its fascinating history offers the visitor an opportunity to learn about the history of the Koi, Malay and Europeans that span over many years. This is a fascinating city and many museums are open and within walking distance of each other to give you an insight into the history of Cape Town and its people. The Slave Lodge, Iziko South African Museum, South African Jewish Museum are quite close to each other and provides quite an insight into the history and stories of Cape Town. The Castle of Good Hope is another museum entrenched in history and is quite large so, one would need more then one day if you are planning on doing a typical museum experience. And also, the Company Gardens are nice to take a walk through with beautiful flowers and trees.Many restaurants are open to choose from and quite a variety of dishes can be chosen to give you a taste of South Africa. And always, a glass of wine with your meal is a must when in cape Town.Like any large city, Cape Town has its problems with criminality but the police are quite organised and one gets the feeling that the city is quite safe. Even at night. Always be aware what is happening around you and do not allow your credit card out of your sight.This city has a good public transport system and you can get quite easily from one museum to another as more can be found in Houtbay, Stellenbosch and other areas."
40,“Amazing Destination Yet Highly Unsafe”,"I travelled to Cape town alongwith my spuse in February 2015. We planned to travel from India New Delhi to Cape Town since getting a visa was easy and the place looked beautiful when searced on the web. Indeed the place is beautiful, it is full of natural beauty. Mountains, beaches and good English arcitchture and history, you will find it here in Cape Town. The city is well connected by buses (MYCiti Bus), hiring a taxi can be expensive though. On our first day we decided to explore the area around our hotel by foot. We were out in the main city area, Long Street and around 1830 hours and onwards we realised that the place is not safe at all. A man walked towards us in the middle of the road near flower market along the Long Street (Very famous with tourists) and asked us to give him money else he wold put his hands in my pocket and steal. We literally got scared and started walking fast. The man walked with us for some distance before going away. Then we started walking towards our hotel in Gardens and witnessed many homeless people and whose stares did not make us feel safe. Cape town is safe only between 0900-1800 hours. Also, one must avoid visiting places where not many tourists would go. If one prefers to stay only around touristy areas like V&A waterfront and Sea Point and trvel only by taxi all the time, then it is safer.If visitng Cape Town the start early and return to your hotel by maximum 1800 hours. Night Life is limited to certain areas and one should rather avoid it. If travelling late(post 1800 hours), travel by taxi and keep the windows rolled up. Never flash anything at all and carry limited cash. Tourist police is confined to certian areas and can only be seen between 0900-1800 hours. Police do exist in this city but they are always inside the police station and can never be seen patrolling the streets.You may read lot of comments on the web by the local and other calling Cape Town safe but the reality is that it is unsafe. 99% houses have electri fencing with armed response, locals also do not go out post 1900 hours. You will not find anybody except few on the streets post 1830 hours. Locals if go out, travel in cars."
50,“Truly is the mother city”,"The City is vibrant, old and new has been blended in well. Loads of cultural traditions seeing the coon carnival in the streets of the City was fabulous. This is different groups that get dressed up in different costumes and colours they sing and dance and perform in the streets. A must see over the New Year period, also take a drive up to Bo Kaap and see the colourful houses ."
50,“Much of value Much of interest Many great eateries and experiences”,More you should not ask for.Yes adventure Ensure a an excellent experienceReporting as a friend I am a Cape Tonian and besotted with my city please do not encourage vagrants and beggars Please they are a headache of noteMany visits of interest Malay food Irish Pub ( The Dubliner ) Incredible Indian cuisineAfrican food ( not to missed ) Pure love and goodness at some restaurants ( Café Mozart to name one of many ) Italian food Mama Mia Greek The GODS are jealous French Mon AmiHave to stop now to numerous good to mentionVictorian architecture ( trey Marias in Gardens for lunch ) architecture added complimentaryScour the Internet Ask your Hotel for sound advice
50,“Great City”,Just a great city on the southern tip of Africa….Roads can be busy mostly…drive with caution. Always take a jumper when you go out at night. The weather can turn rapidly
30,“cape town”,"Better to see this city equipped with your own car. We drove up to sea point, Waterfront and to the Green Market Square. Of course the Table Mountains was spectacular."
30,“Over rated city”,Sight seeing tour is essential to explore the city . City is only good in pockets. Cab scam- beware! Stick only to tourist spots as unsafe elsewhere. Driving around aimlessly is fun!
30,“City Sightseeing”,"There isn't much to do in the city as such. There are markets and if you are there for the first time, the normal ""new city"" will amaze you for a little while but the novely will soon wear out.I wouldn't recommend going to see the Aquarium. There is nothing surprising in there.In fact, I can't think of anything there which I say is a must!"
50,"“Shopping in Capetown, South Africa”","I'm a hard-core shopper, always looking for unusual items to bring back to the U.S. I absolutely loved the Pan-African Market on Long St. when I was in Capetown in late 2011. Every item bought -- a large, beaded elephant mask, a ceremonial mask from Gabon, a hand-carved wooden lidded bowl in the shape of a giraffe, and 6 small ""passport"" masks -- have elicited enthusiastic comments from friends and remain some of my most treasured ""finds."" Yes, it's true that none of these were actually from South Africa, but they were authentic and came from countries mostly in the western part of the continent that I will probably never get to visit. I found the Pan-African a more interesting place to shop than the Blue Shed, the Red Shed and the Waterkant. I found it superior as well to the items on the first floor of the Trading Post on the waterfront; however, I learned later that the trick at the Trading Post is to demand to go to the second floor. The large man standing guard at the bottom of the stairs is not from the second-floor merchants; he is paid by the first-floor merchants to dissuade people from going up to where the really interesting things are. Before going back to Capetown in late 2014, I will investigate trustworthy shippers, which should be cheaper and less hassle than relying on my hotel concierge."
40,“Cape Town International Airport facilities”,The ladies who service the toilet facilities 18 hours a day at Cape Town International Airport need to be acknowledged and commended for the excellent condition of the facility in the International Hall. I am always greeted with a friendly smile and nothing is ever out of place. Thank you ladies! Unfortunately the same can not be said of the same facilities throughout France where the most unhygienic conditions prevail.
40,“Beautiful city”,"What a setting!It seems to have everything of a modern city; just a shame obout the feeling of potential violenceWe saw nothing, not a hint; in fact the only hassle I had was from the Jehovah's witness trying to sell me their paper!But when everyone advises to take taxis after dark and avoid some places even in the day it doesn't help you to feel relaxed enough to explore, which I would have loved to do"
50,"“Inner city fun, museums, pulsing life and the Castle”","The Cape Castle was well-run and after a long interval from my last visit a pleasant surprise. They have made some excellent changes to the guided tours and the castle and its historical art work and galleries are looking well-maintained. The walk to parliament and the syurrounding precinct was also a buzz with people, students and tourists enjoying the early morning atmosphere. We enjoyed visiting the museums and the company gardens with the wonderful display of roses. The proximity of all the attractions and great coffe shops meant that the walk did not exist more than 3 hours."
50,“Luhambo Tours - Highly recommended”,"Had a fantastic private tour with Luhambo Tours. We were picked up in Cape Town and then spent the day traveling down the peninsula going to Cape of Good Hope, Cape Point and to see the Penguin colony. Then we worked our way back up to the Constantia area and went to several wineries. Cedric was most excellent in providing information and most importantly spotting wild game. We were able to pull over to the side of the road often and take in the beautiful scenery and get a history of the area from Cedric. IT was casual, full of information and fun. Cedric is extremely knowledgeable about the area and provided great guidance to us about the wine region. Given his background previously operating safari's, finding game on the route was easy (I would even give him a call to get the low down on the best safari's to consider!).I highly recommend the Luhambo Tours."
50,“Cruise the harbor”,Quaint. Lots of shopping and lots of places to sit and have a drink
50,“Fall in love with Cape Town & the Garden Route”,"We visited Cape Town and the Garden Route because several friends strongly recommended it. And we had the greatest vacation ever. Of course, you must see the the ‘must-see’ and do the ‘must-do’ – it’s easy enough to get a list of these and fit it into your schedule and preferences. We spent 3 days in Cape Town, and then ventured out into the winelands of Stellenbosch & Franschhoek, before taking in the amazing Garden Route, a drive which is a feast for the senses and the spirit. But what made our trip memorable was the “experience”. We arranged a private tour through Wayne Milne, Director of Take 2 Tours. In addition to visiting the sights, we experienced many little joys along our 12-day journey. Wayne introduced to a winemaker off the main tourist circuit and introduced us to cafes, food stalls and home-cooked meals that a typical tourist would just drive through. We stayed at a real farm, and had the most wonderful home-cooked barbecue dinner, sitting around a long table with other guests, regaled by the stories of our hosts. Driving through the Overberg was visually stimulating and emotionally powerful. We spent a few days at Knysna, and just soaked in the local hospitaliyy and good food. We drove through Tsitsikamma National Park on our way to Scotia Safari while staying at Cosmos Cuisine. We had great food and wonderful wine everyday, usually at owner-run restaurants or home-style kitchens. We stayed at small inns or bed-and-breakfasts: beautiful, homey, welcoming, cozy and personal. It is one thing to be a tour guide. It is quite a different thing to be a friend and host. Wayne was the latter. He is clearly passionate about South Africa, and because of that, we have fallen in love with this beautiful country and its very warm people. South Africa isn’t just a beautiful place. It is a magical place to be experienced, to be immersed in. One must feel it, taste it and breathe it. We are most thankful to Wayne Milne and Take 2 Tours (www.take2tours.co.za) for arranging not just a tour, but an experience of South Africa up close and personal. This was our first visit to South Africa, but it felt like we were visiting old friends, rather than just tourists. My advice: don’t rush through South Africa and try to see everything in one trip. Take it slow, experience it. And come back for more. We are definitely coming back. Definitely!!!"
50,“Table View beachfront - Magic”,"This is the most wonderful place to walk and ….Yesterday the wind BLEW but the wind surfers had a great day. Today there is little wind and the standing surfers with a single paddle had a great day. I walked the beach front with the pram, no wind, safe, and with a beautiful view. I watched a seal playing in the surf near the beach, catching the waves to surf in. Magic!"
50,“My favourite City in the world”,"I consider myself lucky to have travelled extensively, but no matter what destinations I add to my list Cape Town remains top of the pile. Be it the scenery, or the range of Hospitality establishments, this city and its surrounding areas have so much to offer. Wherever you go Table Mountain towers above the skyline, which helps one's orientation, quite apart from its natural beauty. Whether I stay in a B&B, Guest House or hotel the choice is vast and the quality is invariable high. Prices have risen in recent years, but are still reasonable. From a gastronomic point of view, I found myself in 7th heaven. Excellent service, fresh produce and beautiful locations to choose from.Quite often, I travel just a few miles out of town and I find myself amongst picturesque vineyards and mountains. There, most vineyards don't just offer superbwines but good Restaurants with outdoor seating.I cannot wait to go back."
50,“European city in africa”,"beautiful city to visit, friendly people, incredible beaches, breath taking landscapes, 1rs class restaurants, cape twon has it all!"
50,“A fantastic city”,"We stayed in Cape Town for five days after touring across South Africa with Virgin Atlantic. It is vibrant with every nationality. The people, the hotels and restaurants are amazing, and the places of interest easily accessible. There are two 'hop-on, hop-off' buses, red and blue, depending where you want to visit, which run from 9am until 6pm every day.Beaches are very clean and can be reached by the red and blue buses, also Kirstenbosch Gardens, in the shadow of Table Mountain, where you can spend a whole day amongst the trees, shrubs and proteas.Table Mountain and the cable car is a must - the views from the top are fantastic - you can even buy a coffee from the cafe.Entertainment at the Water Front is cultural and very professional. There is nothing better than enjoying a meal at the Water Front with the evening lights shining on the water and the stars beginning to twinkle.A return visit is essential!"
50,“Capetown South Africa.”,"I have been to Cape Town on many occasions before and after the Apartheid period and still feel it is one of the wonderful cities of the World.The climate,the sun,the beauty of Table Mountain and beaches.Albert and Victoria Wharf and the fabulous restaurants.But if you travel in a rented car you must do the 12 Apostles route going to Cape Point via Chapmans Peak.I found another little gem of an area tucked away from the hussle and bussle of the City and having the most Fabulous beach .Misty Cliffs and Scarborough come to mind just before The Reserve of Cape Point.It has a fabulous little fish restaurant next to the road and a lovely drive down will take you to the most fabulous beach.Many of the houses in Scarborough are based on The New England look and if you can get some self catering there it would be a bonus.I met Harold Kolnik there and his family and they have a few self catering properties.The views from them are fabulous overlooking the beach.It feels safe there and your made most welcome.Yes ! I would love to live there as you are tucked away in this tiny hidy hole of the Western Cape away from the crowds and have seclusion and privacy.I think it is just about the only place I felt safe in at night.As it is unwise of anyone just to wonder the streets of the city at night.It is not the done thing and you are asking for trouble if you do.Don't flash your cash, clothes and jewellery amongst the locals.Look plain and simple and lock everything in the boot as sadly with all CountrIes in Africa you will become a target for crime at night.Keep your car doors locked at traffic lights and if you keep to these simple basic rules you will have the experience of a life time down there.You have the Vineyards of Stellenbosch and Franschoek to visit and the latter has lovely restaurants. Also with the back drop of fabulous hills with a tinge of blue on their summits.Shear magic in my book !! Go before the Country ends up like Zimbabwe and enjoy.P.S. Do not stop to feed the Baboons on route.They can come down in troops and destroy the car and perhaps harm you.Leave them alone and just watch from a distance windows closed !"
50,“An OK city in a Stunning Location...”,"Cape Town is one of the most geographically stunning locations in the world!We come from a beautiful country however; Cape Town pips some of our locations by a country mile!I'm talking about the city's enviable location between Table Mountain and the never-ending stretch of blue water.This fabulous coastline has some superb modern architecture, trendy restaurants, cafés and a similar beach culture to ours.There are stretches of beautiful coastline in the National Parks area of Cape Point and further along the Western Cape.Although, these waters have more great white's to be sure!One of the best ways to see it is on the Red Hop On/Off bus that takes you along parts of the coastline suburbs and up to Table Mountain.The V & A Waterfront has similar layouts to both Sydney Harbour and San Francisco and as they suggest, it has gone one step further.A large enclosed Ferris wheel would give a bird's eye view of the coastline and city centre and it’s a shopping and foodie heaven…. especially seafood.However, it's out on the water, which gives you a spectacular kaleidoscope of colours, with the blue of the sea and sky, the backdrop of the mountains and the lovely beaches.There many companies which run short or longer water trips from the V & A and it is a must do while here in Cape Town.It's not always sunny here and we made the most of it when fine but the rolling mist off the water and the 'blanket' that can drape the mountains is rather stunning too. Not so good out on the water in windy conditions though!The city centre was a disappointment.Not the buildings but the dreariness of the centre.It has no atmosphere like other major cities and all of that is primarily found along the water.As with some locations in South Africa, they are doing their best to accommodate some citizens into better buildings projects, however, terrible housing conditions still exist and are visible in a few areas.Some areas are not so safe for tourists after dusk and that includes the city centre and parts walking back from the V & A.There are tourist police around strategic areas but mostly to give advice when you need directions, not for safety.We loved it here and would like to come back and spend more time at the many beaches and surrounds, not necessarily the city centre.Enjoy your visit!"
50,“Fantastic place u must go visit !”,"so much to do , you'll need at least 3 weeks in capetown ! very reasonable resturants/food easy to find accomodation so dont worry if you havent booked any ! we never do ! Hout bay is amazing people so friendly so dont worry about any trouble weve never seen any ! if you dont venture off the beaten track as in any city........amazing craft fairs, in hout bay every sunday and the best one is on the last sunday in the month in Kirstenbosh gardens about 15 minutes from Hout Bay..............property so cheap too..... a must is afternoon tea at the 'mount Nelson Hotel' as good as the Ritz and a half the price !"
50,“My favourite place in South Africa”,"its faboulous with the table mountains on one side and blue sea on the other. Food and wine is superb over here. Nightlife is cool with some great clubs and bars.Ideal for sightseeing, partying, honeymoon,adventure"
50,“my caprtown trip”,"everyone must see the beauty of capetown...its the city which has everything sea,mountains,good weather,hill stations etc..and it is known for the 4 times change in weather during a single day...the famous places are water front,two oceans aquarium,table top etc...."
50,“My all time favourite destination”,"As a honeymoon couple, we had some expectations of the country and especially Cape Town. The city is beyond imagination and expectations. The pictures or the videos that you see in the web will not even capture the true mesmerizing beauty. You have to be there to get lost in the most beautiful city we have ever seen – it is BLISS. The picturesque beaches( camps bay - the best for us ), table mountain, cape point, v & a waterfront, garden route, the 12 apostles and the list goes on. It’s a paradise for adventure enthusiasts; romantic for couples; entertaining for kids and joy for all.The experience is truly mesmerizing and lasts for life time. Yes, we yearn to visit the city again sometime soon and would recommend the place for all occasions. A must in every traveler’s list.Note: Travelers are to keep their ears open to their travel agents tips for a security in South Africa. Our travel agents warned us of not venturing out on our own after 6. We did comply that and made our dinner arrangements through the hotel and the travel agents."
50,“Amazing Cape Town”,My sister and I traveled to South Africa during the World Cup and one of our favorite places was Cape Town. There is so much to see and the scenary is amazing! The cape pennisula tour was breath taking even though we were caught in some rain it was still worth the trip. Everyone was very friendly and our hotel (Holiday Inn Express) helped us a great deal. Their rooms were amazing and the staff was exteremly nice! I would definetely love to go back.
10,“World Cup. Apart from Virgin Atlantic ( As good as the England Team).”,"The City is lovely, plenty to do and see.The only down side was booking thro Virgin Atlantic, because they dont fly direct, they booked us onto a South African Airways flight, Which they didnt explain to us at the time of booking.So when we went to checkin 24hrs before departure, because we didnt have the correct details it took much longer than usual, causing alot of stress.When I complained to Virgin Atlantic, thet were very dismissive and said, take it up with the SA Airways. Not impressed. They can stick there Airmiles.To make things a little worse, The plane we fly out on was a borrowed 747,that had no markings, with an out of date entertainment system. Altho it was crewed by SA staff it was a long 12hrs.Cape Town great.Virgin Atlantic...........Never Again, useless!!"
50,“Capetown S.A. is a place everyone should see”,This past Feb I had a chance to visit a friend there and because I was already staying in Rio it seem like a good time to go. Well it was a great choice. Its a wonderful city-the people couldn't be nicer-The sites are out of this world. Took in a Safari which was great while I was there and had a chance to visit some of the best winers they have. All and all its a wonderful country with some areas looking like Palm Springs another area like Beverly Hills.
50,“Another Awesome day in Cape Town”,"I used to live in Cape Town and I highly recommmend that anyone visiting the mother city should make a stop in Blouberg straand. There are the most beautiful beaches along the West Coast from which you have an amazing view of Roben Island. It also has a great waterfront area filled with a number of restaurants, bars and small shops."
10,“a city of thieves”,"This city was supposed to be safe for the Fifa soccer tournaments. Not so, my disabled husband, who has MS and walks with a cane, was mugged his first day there and got his cell phone and money stolen even though he wasn't alone. Beware!"
50,“cape town feb holiday”,"winter [feb] in cape town - FANTASTIC. Stayed in V&A waterfront apart. complex overlooking waterways to the front & table mountain to the rear. Stayed 5 days then hired car & stayed various lengths - 2-3 days on average to hermanus, knysna, stellenbosh [scuse sp.] & back to capetown.Very stark contrasts in wealth are abundantly apparent & I was pretty naive about how bad some of it was but very glad to have seen it first hand - gave me a greater understanding of some of the issues that people face on a daily basis - somthing that will stay with me for a long time. Hard to understand just how this situation carries on while other people live in the lap of luxury literally yards away from each other. Food for thought.Fab people, excellent value for money, NO problems with any crime related issues. There are areas that you should avoid [as in most places] but we all had a great time.Also went on a short safari - saw all the big ones but not a lion in site !!!! the hippo,rhino,giraff & the beautiful elephants & baby - memorable, as was the bumpy transport !!The V&A waterfront is vibrant, exciting, plenty to do, eat/drink - graet variety restaurants etc all very inexpensive. A must is up to table mountain, we did not hire a car in capetown - no need, take a taxie, very reasonable. Hermanus was terrific, whale watching at its best, stayed at the Misty Waves Hotel - highly reccommend.The drive along the garden route is something not to be missed. Knysna was nice & again good fun but wouldnt rush back. Stellenbosch is also a must - great restaurants, fab setting - pretty up market, not as inexpensive as the other places but in terms of comparison to UK prices still excellent. Obviously wine country - very nice. Its also a university town & it shows. All in all I would highly reccomment a visit to South Africa - I was very surprised at just how much I enjoyed it, & very surprised at the cost of things. Would go back in a shot !"
50,“Trip of a lifetime”,"We just returned from Capetown to visit our daughter who is studying at University of Capetown. We had a fabulous time in and around the city. We also spent 3 days on Safari at Kirkman's Kamp near Kruger National Park which was unbelievable. If you have an interest in South Africa, I would highly recommend using Tracy Payne at Go2Africa out of Capetown. She was the most responsive and professional travel consultant I have ever dealt with. Feel free to email me if you want more details of our experience."
50,“great scenic beauty”,"Cape Town is a fascinating mosaic of Asian, European and African traditions. These streams of history flow together in the city but, particularly because of the legacy of the apartheid system, visitors to Cape Town are often amazed by the dramatic contrasts that remain between different areas. Nature, too, creates very different sub-climates around the mountain so the vegetation varies a great deal, as of course do the vistas. The city, however, is connected by fast freeways. Thus, twenty minutes from the wine farms of the leafy Constantia valley you could be on a beach, in the bustling city center or in a shanty township. It is truly fascinating to discover the different areas and experience the diversity of culture in the city."

40,“Beautiful city”,"Cape Town is a beautiful vibrant diverse city. We spent 12 nights in Cape Town. We rented a car from Avis at the Cape Town airport. One recommendation we would have is to rent an automatic transmission. We made the mistake of renting a 5 speed and there are too many hills to traverse with some traffic delays. Service at the Avis car rental agency at the airport leaves much to be desired. They are sloppy with their checkout procedures and rather rude with their return services. We would not rent from Avis again; there are other agencies at the airport.The Hop on Hop Off bus is a lot of fun and goes to many of the wonderful sights of Cape Town. Also there are beautiful drives out to Cape Hope and over to the wine regions of Cape Town. Drivers on the main roads are very considerate, but be careful if you try to drive in the townships; there you will encounter the van buses that rule the roads.We stayed in Camps Bay, but we would not choose that area again; way too many hills and the roads are very crowded and parking is terrible. There are a lot of better choices and lots of excellent condos to rent in many areas of Cape Town.If you have a chance to extend your stay in South Africa, then Cape Town is tops on the list."
50,"“Cape Town, South Africa Wildlife, Culture, & Great Foods!”","I enjoyed my holiday in Cape Town, South Africa !My accommodations were in a hostel on Long Street.As a solo traveler, I felt safe, as Long Street was patrolled by police officers every few hundred feet or so.The street also has many wonderful restaurants featuring the cuisines of Africa, Turkey, Ethiopia, Cape Malay, and even vegan.The V & A waterfront has great restaurants, shopping, & street musicians.For sightseeing, I recommend District Six Museum, Slave Lodge, Gold Museum, Robben's Island, San Cultural Village (tribal life explained), wine country, Ostrich Farm (ride one), Cape Of Good Hope, Cape Agulhas(tip of Africa), the shanty towns, Table Mountain, and Garden Route 3 day tour!"
50,"“Cape town, South Africa”","While in Cape town we stayed at the Victoria & Alfred hotelclose to nearby restaurants and shopping area all set with in the harbour marina.Cape town offers an excellant variety of things to explore.with coastal drives,shopping, the garden route and game parks not to far away.There are plenty of restaurants around the harbour with a wide range of cultures and tastes to choose from, we found the foodto be excellent and cheap.There is a wide range of accommadation in Hotels and villa rentals that cater to all needs.A trip up Table is a must ( weather permitting ) even if its just for the view.Also visit the local jewellery shops for Tanzanite its a lot cheaper and you can get your tax back on your purchases, the service is realy good, or if you like visit the local market in the city centre.My advice is hire a car and dont be afraid to get out and explore the area or if you like go on guided tours of the area."
50,“Great for Families”,"Visited Cape Town for four days with my husband, two children and another family in August 2009. Children ranged in age from 5 to 11. Very child-friendly city. Lots to do - go south on Cape Peninsula to see penguins and other wildlife, go out to wine country and visit cheetah and rapter sanctuary, aquarium is fantastic, Table Mountain breathtaking and the kids loved the tram ride up. Easy to navigate the city with rental car or cabs. Stayed at Twelve Apostles Hotel just south of the city. Highly recommend- easy to get into town, beautiful views, elegant hotel yet child-friendly. Found the hotel through our travel agent Jenny Strand at Travel Beyond, whom I highly recommend. She's well-informed, never pushy, efficient, responsive."
50,“SOUTH AFRICA”,"Just returned from 2 weeks in Cape Town beautiful weather ,great food,stayed in lovely luxurious self catering cottage,in Constantia West,Serendipity.Hosts Anne and George made sure we had a pleasant.South Africa is in my opinion one of the top holiday destinations.English speaking and driving on the same side as at home.the people could not be more helpful and friendlier.Like anywhere one has to be careful where one goes.Definately golng back."
50,“Safer than NYC and Paris!”,"I've just returned from Cape Town where I did a guided tour of the city and the beautiful scenic Garden Route with Cape Heritage Tours (guide was Jamie Greatorex, excellent and good fun). The dangers are an urban myth, and I felt a lot safer there than New York or Paris! I was paranoid about crime when I arrived but left wondering why the media makes it out to be so bad. Diverse scenery and experiences a plenty, an all-round fabulous holiday destination especially for nature lovers, foodies and wine buffs, and adventure holiday enthusiasts. Your money goes a long way too - and you'll save money on shopping as there's not much to buy since the fashion and electrical gadgets are around a decade behind the rest of the world, no kidding! I usually come back having overspent with a suitcase full of purchases, but this time nothing! A refreshing change. I highly recommend going - but do have a guide."
40,“Wonderful city”,"This is a really nice city and the food is more then excellent, the marina is a place you never want to leave again.Also take the chance to see the citys around, but NOT alone, it can be dangerous, but it´s worth to see the true side of South Africa aswell."

50,“Fab Time In Cape Town”,"What a city, vibrant easy to walk around, and the best bit very friendly. Wow where do I start, food at Cape Quarter was outstanding, tried the Tapas, also the Sushi bar, we did not have one bad meal in a fortnight.Take the Red bus around the city, well worth it to get your bearings, make sure you get off at Camps Bay, the beach is stunning, lovely restaurants along the front.Drove to Simon's Town via Chapmans Peak, the views will take your breath away, and down to Cape of Good Hope.Table Mountain after 6pm is half price, so head there if a clear evening to witness the beautiful sunset, with a drink in hand just like the locals."
40,“Cape Town November 2009”,"Cape Town is still a magnificient city even though it is struggling with traffic problems due to the upgrading of road systems for the 2010 world cup.Many of the restaurants and service orientated places had helpful, friendly staff. Some went out of their way to help us and that was greatly appreciated.When it comes to self catering apartments I would advise caution. The flat in Table View in which we stayed was shabby, the shower was grubby and so small we needed to climb in the door sideways! (No we are not humungous people!) It proves photos do lie! Doors rattled in the wind and the TV reception was almost non-existent. If the photos of the view are empasised - beware!"
40,“My escape from the NY winter!”,"After spending a week in London, my husband and I were thrilled to spend the rest of our Christmas Vacation in warm, sunny South Africa! The second we got off the plane I was thrilled to be able to take off my jacket and gloves and enjoy the beautiful weather.We began our vacation by walking to the V & A Waterfront and checking out the many shops, live musicians, and stunning views. It was especially neat to see the new soccer stadium being built for the World Cup 2010. After a bit we settled down and had our first sea food dinner. It was delicious!The next day we devoted pretty much entirely to the beach. The water was a perfectly clear blue and it felt great to lay in the sun. Unfortunately I forgot how much stronger the sun is in SA and we found ourselves a little red by the end of the day! :)We took advantage of the many guided tours offered and went on an amazing wine tasting tour and a stunning tour of the Cape of Good Hope. The best part was seeing the penguins at Simon's Town.After seeing all the amazing pictures and hearing about our trip, our friends can't wait to visit SA. We definitely recommend it!"
50,“Cape Town”,"Cape Town was amazing! There is so much variety in things to see and do, and the food is excellent! I would definitely recommend spending time on Robben Island, taking the cable car up to Table Mountain (make sure it's not windy because they close it down), the Cape of Good Hope (and the towns between it and Cape Town), taking a self-guided walking tour of Bo-Kaap, and taking a tour of one of the townships. I stayed several nights in the Waterfront area, a couple of nights in the City Bowl area, and one night in a township homestay. All offered great experiences! The Waterfront was a little more upscale and was in walking distance to the water, beach, and Robben Island launch point. The City Bowl had a lot of activity with more budget restaurants, clubs, and hotels. I would highly recommend a homestay in one of the townships! It is completely safe, very comfortable, and a great way to get a more accurate perspective of township life."
40,“V&A Waterfront in Cape Town”,"We flew to Capetown in October begining and found the weather a little cold and very Windy – not the best weather for the Beach. Inspite of that Capetown is a very pretty city (though you will see the slums and occasional poverty on the streets) and the V&A waterfront is really rocking with shops and concerts and fabulous sea food. Robben’s Island is a must see as well – it has a sad history but there is redemption that that period of SA is over. Make sure you book your tickets in advance since the tours get booked very quickly. We were unable to go on top of Table Mountain since the winds were too strong but the wine region is wonderful for doing some wine tasting. The drive to Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope and Hermanus were also very scenic (Reminded me of the drive on Route 1 from San Francisco to Los Angeles ). We saw cute jackass penguins near SimonTown and humpback whales near the shore at Hermanus.All in all, a beautiful country with earnestly friendly and helpful people. Twice folks went out of their way to help us when we got lost in our car. The way I see it, a must see country for everyone who wants a real vacation."
50,“Wonderful City”,"Cape Town, South Africa is a wonderful city, with excellent wine, good food and friendly people. I will definitely come back."
40,“Beautiful Cape Town”,"Cape Town was a pleasant surprise! I visited here around 7 years back, but I still remember the places as if I was there yesterday. The weather was slightly cooler than Durbin, but it was still nice during summer.If you visit, you HAVE to take the lift on the mountain to get to the viewpoints. From there you see the entire cape of the city, simply AMAZING. No other scenery like it on earth. It does get windy though.Then there are the 12 (i think) peaks of the mountains, and the ferry ride to an island, which is quite nice.The tip of the continent, where the 2 oceans meet, wasn't as nice as I expected, but you could see the changes in the colors of the ocean. There are monkeys along the way to there so becareful on the roads. The drives along the beaches were beautiful though. Just stop by and take all the pictures you want along the beach and homes.The main commercial area has very nice restaurants and tourism shopping. I still remember the most amazing waffle I've ever had at a small restaurant there.Overall, Cape Town was a nice experience. Not as much as I liked Durbin, but something definitely worth seeing and experiencing once in your life."
50,“A great base city near many wonderful experiences”,"My sister and I just returned from a couple weeks in South Africa. We started by spending five nights at the Westin in Cape Town. We chose it as I had Starwood points that made it very affordable. Although the hotel is adjacent to a convention center it was still an excellent site for tourists with top notch concierge service and a free shuttle bus every fifteen minutes to the V&A Waterfront area. The waterfront gets a lot of good press but it is all fairly new and although a good safe place to head for dinner not somewhere I would plan to spend much time otherwise. We did have dinner at Baia one night and the linefish catch for that day was excellent. It's also where you go to catch the ferry to go to Robben Island where, among other things, Nelson Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in prison. Don't miss a trip to the island. It's best to buy tickets online in advance of your trip as it does sell out at times. We went on the 11 a.m. ferry and were back a little after 2:00 p.m. Former political prisoners are your guides and it's fascinating. After that we went for high tea at the Mount Nelson hotel (a cab ride) which was very ""civilized""! We had a lovely dinner one evening at Savoy Cabbage which I would recommend (again, take a cab). We hired private guides to take us to the wine country for a day - definitely don't drive there yourself! The cost was about $80 per person for a 9 hour or so day including admission costs - a bargain. We also hired a guide to take us around two other days and it was well worth it. We were there in mid to late September and were surprised at how cold and rainy it was. Luckily we had many layers with us. Be sure to check the weather reports ahead of your trip and then don't make optimistic assumptions! I did the cable aerialway on Table Mountain and enjoyed it although the mountain became completely enshrouded in fog just as I got to the top! The fog cleared away in about ten minutes. Plan on being MUCH colder at the top of the ride. If the weather's iffy check on both that and the Robben Island ferry to be sure they're running before you head to them as they both cancel not infrequently. A shop we liked at the edge of the V&A waterfront (where our hotel shuttle dropped us off) was Resonance. They have a good price range of lovely decorative items and jewelry all made in South Africa. Plan to carry what you buy and not to ship it to the U.S. as the shipping prices are astronomical from South Africa. I can recommend the two guides we used if anyone is interested."
50,“Beautiful Cape Town”,"Cape Town is a beautiful, modern, international city in South Africa. I try to visit SA every couple years, but this last trip was amazing b/c it was summer time. A beautiful drive along the ocean and scenery of Table Mountain was breathtaking. Also, the food was amazing. Fish and Chips at Fishermans Wharf was great. Enjoy your trip to SA."
50,“Beauty and more................”,"It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited. There is so much to see and do. There are also many day trips within easy reach. The weather cooperated and the ocean was magnificent, albeit too cold for me to swim in.The restuarants were all good although sometimes the service could have bee a little more professional."
50,“Best Place in South Africa”,"Cape Town is a wonderful town - beautifully situated, great climate, and lots to do in and around the place. We stayed at the Waterfront - great assortment of restaurants, shops, sites. In fact, we could see both the harbor and Table Mountain from our hotel window. A great experience."
40,“An interesting African experience.”,"Cape Town is an interesting city, with loads of history and things to see. Make sure you go on some tours to explore the winelands and more of the city. I highly recommend Enoa tours, whose staff were very friendly and knew everything!The only downside to Cape Town is its safety. We were explicitly told not to be outside after 4pm, because it would be too dangerous (ok, we were 2 girls travelling, but it wasn't a problem in any other cities). The V&A waterfront is a very safe area though, and so this was a great place to go for meals out.Even though we went in winter, we still were sunbathing towards the end of the week! There was some pretty changeable weather, but it never rained."
50,“Most beautiful city in the world”,"I have traveled all over the world and have to say that Cape Town is the most beautiful of anywhere I have ever been. The locals are friendly, wonderful and all very attractive. It has gorgeous mountains, beaches and wine farms....the wine farms make Napa Valley look bad. I recommend Spier as one of the best farms...they have a great restaurant with tree houses and African dancers. The Cape Town restaurants are very good and basically very inexpensive for western standards and is extremely easy to get around everywhere. Only thing that was a slight negative was that the water was too cold for swimming, although you can go to the beaches and lay out (gorgeous turquoise water) and lots of beautiful people there. As with anywhere in Africa, one has to be a little careful, although I have been there many times (knock on wood) and never had anything bad happen. Can't wait to go there again for the world cup :)"
40,“Cape town & Gerden Route”,"Have recently returned from a wonderful holiday in south africa. It was our first time in SA and were slightly concerned about crime etc but like most people who have posted reviews as long as you are sensible like most major cities in the world you will have a great time. I would like to say thanks to cape diva and belfast whose threads i consulted.I stayed in the protea holtel in bantry bay which was very nice and easy to get local buses or taxis into the city / waterfront.A couple of things near hotel, a local pub called Brian's - very friendly and welcoming especially Clive one of the Barman.We did try a meal in saul's ( disappointing ) but further up the road is a italian Restaurant (only opened 2 months) called cafe nostra 66 regents street.I throughly recommend it, great food, service. .......... Cape diva i believe you live local to this one .... check it out.we did all the touristy stuff and ate in a lovely restaurant on the waterfront called Den Ankers.We moved on from Cape Town to Hermanus - lovely seaside town and did see whales from the shore. We Stayed in Swellendam, very quaint ... well worth a visit and stayed in the Hideaway accomadation ... a gem of a find .... if you are looking for someware to stay I would highly reccomended it.We moved on to Plettenburg Bay and stayed 3 nights at lairds country estate, another great find , with wonderful staff and service. If you are around this area, visit birds of eden, the cheetah park and monkey land. Further down the cosat is Storms river which - when i come back again - I would definitely stayed a couple of days around.we moved on then to Kariega Game Reserve which again I would highly reccomend but would suggest bringing warm clothes, hats & gloves for your game drives. We were well looked after by Brendan our rangerOn the way back to Cape town we stayed just outside Plett Bay at a gorrgeous place called Hog Hollow with monkeys on the veranda in the morning.We had another night in swellendham at the hideaway ( hopfully will be back there also) and our final night was spent in Stellenbosch at the manor River Spa (another great find )So for those of you who are thinking of doing a trip to South Africa do yourselves a favour and book it ( only don't tell too many of your friends .......)"
50,“Cape Town ready for Summer 2009”,"As a born South African and as someone who has traveled all of Africa at numerous occasions, I need to say that Cape Town is still one of the best tourist destinations in the World today!With summer 2009 already here in South Africa, all of Cape Town is 100% ready to attract tourists from all over the world. Cape Town offers the best hotels at the best affordable prices and the tourist attractions are too numerous to mention.Various websites are available!!So, do make Cape Town one of your travel destination this summer of 2009/10. Our summer last at least until May 2010. Contact me if you need to know more.Je parle Francais aussi.Pieter"
50,“Beautiful City”,"I just returned from Capetown August 28, 2009. The city is beautiful and so are the people. I traveled alone/ senior lady and had no problems. The scenery is beautiful. Spend at least one day taking the sight seeing bus. The food is good and shopping is just great."
10,“99 humewood drive villa guest house cape town”,"hi all i had the most unpleasant stay at the 99 humewood villa guesthouse parklands in cape town. i paid upfront and am sorry i did. firstly the rooms are very small and dirty! the people running it are very unfriendly indeed and make you feel very unwelcome. it seems to me it is treated more like a family home than a professional guesthouse.when i asked for a vegetarian dinner they couldnt accommodate me.when i asked for extra towels the same day they said they were unavailable.i saw a page of paper with lots of . card details just laying around in full view of everybody. what kind of service is this, its leaving its customers open to fraud. when i mentioned this to a worker they simple said ohh sorry, the receptionist must have left it there.also i found that although it is located in a nice looking area, it offers nothing to the traveller or tourist. you would need a car to get anywhere. the only view is out onto a field in front of you, is very far from the sea and beach and not in walking distance really to any local shops or restaurants.basically if you dont have a car, you are stranded !!!there was even no laundry service, like come on!im back in the uk now and glad to be!!! and one thing is for sure i will never return to this guest house, no way!!!!!!. next time i will do my research properly and find out more information before i pick my guest house.has anyone else had any problems or unhappiness with this humewood villa guest house ???"
40,“Need more than a week”,"Cape Town is lovely - if you, like us, have a limited amount of time in South Africa and you want to see as much of the country as you can, then please make sure you leave a decent amount of time to visit Cape Town.Some great things we did, that I'm sure all the tourists will get to read about:Cable car up Table mountain - beware though that this is weather dependant and if the winds/clouds close in then you won't be able to go so don't leave it for the last minute!That said, see if you can get up there with a small picnic (and some warm fleeces) to watch the sun set. That's a great memory!V&A waterfront - full of tourists and tourist prices, but it's a lovely place to spend an afternoon at a waterside restaurant eating lots of lovely prawns and downing copious quantities of white wine. The police are strict about drink driving so make sure you have a designated driver.Green Market - again it seems fully set up for tourists and quite a rip off at times, but we did buy some lovely carvings and things there.Wine Farms - We picked a couple of the big ones, our favourite was Spier. They've got a cheetah there that we had our photo's taken with. Superb wine and food.******However we were lucky to have some friends in Cape Town and they showed us a couple of things that the typical tourist might not get to do:Camps Bay - Sundowners at La-Med followed by dinner at a wicked seafood restaurant called The Codfather. It's at the end of Camps Bay beach road and I'm sure that if you book you can get seats with a great view of the evening sunset.Swimming with the penguins at Boulders beach - there are a limited number of people allowed in there each day, and I'm not sure if you have to book. We loved the penguins, they're amazingly tame.The views from Blouberg - It's the sight that we all know from the postcards - Cape Town city nestled at the bottom of Table Mountain. Get across to Blouberg - again at sunset if you can as the light is just wonderful. We went to a seafood restaurant - I can't remember the name of the restaurant, but any of the ones along the beach road will give a lovely view of the mountain and the city, especially as the lights come on after the sun sets.Make sure you get there early enough so that you can have a long walk along the beach - the water was too cold for us to swim, but the surfers seemed to like it (I think their long wetsuits with hoodie, booties and gloves may have been a contributing factor).All in all, you'll need at least a week in Cape Town, there's just so much to see and do!Enjoy!"
50,“Best things about Cape Town”,"I went to cape town in 2008 it is such a nice place and so much to do, you can go on safari (on quads), go up table mountain, play with cheetas at the santuary, see penguins on the beach, whale watch even from the shaw and best of all go cage diving with sharks which is only 3 hours away an one of the best things I have ever done, its fantastic for animal lovers like myself, its a must."
50,“Living the dream...”,"I just wanted to suggest a wonderful idea for the travellers like me who do not drive themselves but would like to be mobile and see as much as possible.The Private Guide Tour is a perfect way to do it. And its not expensive at all! I had absolutely wonderful times (3 days, 2 nights) in South African Western Coast with Craig (a private tour guide info@trailfinders.co.za). It felt like being on holiday with an old friend, he was so easy to get on with, very experienced & knowledgeable about almost everything. He will show you parts of this beautiful region that most tourists miss!"
40,“St Georges Hotel Capetown South Africa”,"Very cheap by Australian standards.We had 2 nights here as part of a cruise deal and were very pleasantly surprised. The staff are friendly and efficient.We were given the internet rate , for one night a week later.The black slate in front of the (antique) lifts were being polished whenever we went in and out , day or night. Clean,comfortable and quiet. The buffet breakfast included in the price was as good as the cruise ship we had been on.After I paid too much for an hours internet in the Business Centre on the 5th floor I discovered that it had 2 very old Dell PCs with fuzzy CRT screens . I had to get someone to come up and set one up for internet and show me how to enter the code I had bought at reception.After going outside to smoke I discovered you can smoke in the downstairs bar !The station is only 5 minutes walk but we had 3 big cases, the hotel provided a shuttle for us at a reasonable cost of 20 Rand."
50,“SPECTACULAR VACATION”,"My husband and I went to South Africa last October for a 3 week holiday. We travel quite a bit but this was a truly memorable experience combining culture, scenery, history, botanical and zoological life in all dimensions. Our tour guide Chris Oosterhuizen with Ikapa Tours was a wealth of knowledge on all aspects of South African life. The 2 week tour was well organized as we circled from Johannesburg to Capetown and saw various aspects and diversifications within the country. We even went to Swaziland! We preceeded the tour with 2 weeks at Zulu Nyala Game Reserve in Zululand which was also absolutely wonderful. The people and the hospitality shown was A-1 and we never felt intimidated or afraid. The animals we saw close up are amazing. We highly recommend Ikapa Tours for the holiday of a lifetime. They can be contacted at [ --XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-- ].Joanne and TomOntario, Canada"
50,“Take a terrific township tour with Nthuseng”,"For a terrific cultural experience, take a Capetown township tour with Nthuseng tours. Our guide, the outgoing Nthuseng, picked us up at our hotel and customized the tour to what we wanted to see. Nthuseng lived in the townships for a while before she got her business going so she shares a lot of first hand stories of the life there. We started with Mass at her church in Phillipi township. Everyone at the church welcomed us with open arms. The service was an amazing experience as it was Youth Day, honoring all the youth who led the 1980's uprising against apartheid. It was an experience to realize that many of those same youth could be in the church with us. The music was fabulous with many in the congregation dancing. Everone sings! After that, we stopped at Langa township and Khayelitsha, Capetown's largest township. We stopped at a shabeen and several houses. It really makes an impression to see all the entrepreneurs in the townships. Many people have phone cards companies, barber shops, small grocery stores. We stopped at Vicki's B&B which has charming, spotless rooms and a gracious hostess. If we had known, we would have stayed there. Everyone we met was upbeat about life and it really made a great impression on us and especially our teenage sons. They still talk about our tour there."
50,“Getting around Cape Town City”,"I live in Zonnebloem, Cape Town and always use Excite Taxis to take me to work. Excite service is good and cheaper than the other taxis. Thank you Lucinde for the good service."
50,“Harbour area is awsome a must”,Last year we went on tour of South Africa. We covered from North to South travelling via the garden route to Cape Town. For sheer value you cannot odds the Harbour Shopping Mall. It has many shops selling quality items. The Restaurants are first class. My partner and I for example had a fresh Lobster lunch with quality wine at less than £ 20 each in the complex. And this was one of the more classier restaurants. Entertainment by live bands and the general ambience will thrill you. Visit Robbin Island it is an exsperience not forgotten. Table Mountain is another must. This is a country undersold believe me.
50,“Great visit.”,"Spent 14 days in South Africa and Zimbabwe from April 27 to May10th. Visited Capetown, Sabi Sands, and Victoria Falls. Most lasting impression is probably how friendly were all the people with whom we came in contact. Felt like the arrangements were well handled by the travel service - Lark Tours out of N. Carolina. Got excellent guides, particularly in Capetown - did all inclusive package, and basically didn't worry about anything except what kind of wine to have with dinner. Also recommend people ask for our guide in Capetown - Alistar Jacobs. Good restaurants in Capetown - plan on big meals. Memorable ones include Africa Cafe and Pigalle. Recommend South Africa highly as a destination."
50,“What a place. Visually stunning!”,"We were in Cape Town for only four days in April 2009, & we must go back!We were on a round the world tour & went to Cape Town to do a white shark cage dive, which was fantastic. The city itself is spectacular with something amazing to look at everywhere we turned.Table Mountain is incredible to look at from the city but stupendous from the top. Just take a taxi to the cable car station & get yourself up there. We also got a taxi to Camps Bay then walked all the way back along the coast to the city-a long walk but stunning.On our last day, our flight was 8.15pm, so we booked a full day Cape tour with Tania of Discovery Tours-. http://www.discoverytours.co.za- The tour was brilliant-they go where you want them to go & it was like a day out with a friend, not like being a paying customer. I would recommend this company wholeheartedly-they will also collect you at the airport & take you back there when you have to leave.We didn't have nearly long enough in Cape Town, but we managed to cram a fair bit into 4 days, especially the last day with Discovery Tours."
50,“There's no better way to explore the Winelands...”,"... than spending some time with Alan Bent of Wine and Whales Golf Tours. My husband and I were in South Africa in late January and were lucky enough to have two days of Alan's time as a tour guide. It was such a treat to be driven to some of the vineyards around Stellenbosch and Franschhoek . We could really enjoy the tastings without having to worry about our transport and we learnt so much from Alan along the way. He's not just passionate about wine but about the Western Cape region as a whole and has a great relaxed style as he takes you around the sights. Having had such a memorable couple of days, we were reluctant to leave the area (Stellenbosch especially) and move on to our next destination along the Garden Route."
50,“Discovery Tours”,"During a two week stay in Cape Town, our party of eight had many wonderful experiences thanks to Discovery Tours, operated by Yaseen and Tania. Yaseen and Tania are very professional, knowledgeable, and hospitable. From day tours to winelands, the coastline, museums, mountains, and much more, we gained a deep appreciation for the beauty of South Africa and marveled at the striking variety of wonderful experiences each day.We highly recommend Discovery Tours to future Cape Town visitors. The memories that our group will treasure forever are due to their efforts, flexibility, and kindness."
50,"“Cape Town,Garden Route,Arathusa,Victoria Falls!!!”","A group of 12 friends and relatives travelled to South Africa, Mpumalaunga, and Livingstone, Zambia Feb.3-19,2009. Everyone agreed that it was the trip of a lifetime!! We arrived in Cape Town on Feb.4, after a very long trip from Louisville, KY!I arranged most of our trip through Island-Safari, Cara, who did a very good job getting everything coordinated. Our first stop was Blackheath Lodge B & B in seaport, Cape Town. Antony, Lisa,John, Jeane-Paul, were the perfect hosts and staff! The rooms were all beautifully appointed and their attention was superb!We walked down the hill to the ""hop-on/off"" bus the next morning and toured the city. Had lunch a the waterfront and walked a few miles along the water back to the lodge. Antony arranged a special dinner with Chef Sophia on their porch, which was a beautiful setting! Finished off with some amarullo!Next 3 days we went with Gerald (Travel in Africa), our favortie guide, and our excellent driver Rodney along the garden route.Spent the night at La Plume Guesthouse in Oudsthoorn, which was also a wonderful treat with a beautiful dinner and great view!Cango Caves, Monkeyland, Birds of Eden were our next day's adventures and then to the Knysna River Club overnight. We were disappointed with no airconditioning after being ""spoiled"" everywhere else. Next day was a cruise on the Knysna estuary, Diaz museum at Mossel Bay, and a stop at an Aloe Factory on our way back to Blackheath. Two more nights there for a new guide with Hylton Ross (Ian) who took us all around the cape peninsula to see the seals and the penquins, and the gorgeous views at Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point. Dinners in Cape Town were at the African Cafe where we got our faces painted and were highly entertained by the staff, and at Summerville in Camp's Bay with a beautiful view. Food was great at both spots.From there our trip kept getting even better if you can believe it! We had a ""longer than expected"" ride after we flew to Johannesburg, to get to our safari lodge outside of Kruger Park.It took us over 8 hrs and we had expected only 5. But, once we were there it was unbelievable!! Arathusa Safari Lodge in Sabi Sands!! Highly recommeded!! We saw the BIG FIVE numerous times in just 5 game drives. Our rangers, Andre & Ryan, and our trackers, Rufus and Morris did a phenomenal job! Just amazing!! After driving back to Joburg, after our 3 nights at Arathusa, we spent a short night at the Safari Club, and then flew to Livingstone the next morning. Arrived at Zambezi Sun in time to walk to Victoria Falls, the Royal Livingstone and take the sunset cruise on the Zambezi River to see crocs and more hippos! Next day was a visit to the local Mukuni Village and then a boat ride to Livingstone Island where we actually got to swim overlooking the breathtaking Falls!! And we had a lovely afternoon ""tea"" under a tent looking at the falls. Our final day we walked to the ""boiling pot"" and back up for a nice little morning workout, and then rode the elephants(Safari Par Excellence) which was a different experience(too pricey, but interesting). Last night we had a nice dinner at the Royal Livingstone and the next morning we were taken back to the airport for our flight to JoBurg and then home. I don't think you can fully appreciate a trip like this unless you've been there! So, if you get the opportunity to go, don't let it pass you by!!!!"
50,“My favorite place in the whole world”,"Cape Town is amazing. It has adventure, great scenery, great shopping, great tours and amazing people. It seems like you can do everything! You have got the beautiful V&A shopping area, Bo- Kapp (Beautiful colured houses), Long St, and of course Table Mountain! You have also got a national park basically next door where the Indian and Atlantic Ocean met."
50,“December 2008 Trip Review”,"My insights for the benefit of future visitors to the Western Cape. To start, the country is beautiful; a treat for the eyes. Just be careful if driving especially if you are used to US or European side of the road as I turned into the wrong lane several times.Wine country (Paarl, Stellenbosch and Franschhoek) is a must; although known for big wines (Cabs and Shiraz), we found several very good Pinot Noirs and Merlots there. Favorite :""wine farms"" include Nederburg and Meerlust. The best dining experience was in Paarl at Rhebokskloof (a wine farm) - many of the wine farms also have a restaurant.If you want to see African game, you might consider going to Zimbabwe or Botswana (fallbacks are Kruger or Addo, which is closer to the Cape). I went to Aquila (a private game reserve just 2-hours from Cape Town) and the experience was disappointing. We did see the big 5 as promised but the big cats (lions and cheetahs) were segregated in modest enclosures and the amenities (lodging, meals) were very modest. Not good value in my opinion.The Cape Peninsula circuit was very enjoyable with the highlite being Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope (be sure to take the hike between the two capes, only about 40-minutes). Take plenty of time to explore the natural beauty of this area. Many of the other stops (Hout Bay, Kals Bay, Simon's Town) really seemed built on tourism and lacked genuousness. Be sure to travel the M3 road from False Bay into Cape Town as it is the most scenic road in a country full of picturesque vistas.The few days we spent in Cape Town we lodged at Parker Cottage in the Tamboerskloof section, very nicely located. I cannot say enough good about this B&B and host Phil Rendel - all rooms were spotlessly clean and elegantly appointed. Phil is shamelessly upbeat and accomodating; despite the effortless manner, he works very hard to attend to the needs and wants of each of his customers and he promotes an interactive environment among his guests. What a great place and a great value! The obligatory visits to Table Mountain, V&A Waterfront and Green Market are in order. I recommend taking a sunset cruise from the V&A Harbor - we booked on Charles Maharani Yacht (a clipper) and found them to provide a great experience at a very fair price. You should consider looking through the airport gift shops before going to Green Market to establish some sort of price/value benchmark before venturing into the densely packed, haggling of the Green Market off Long Street. It was great entertainment and terrific fun although I'm not sure I made out with the great bargains that I thought I made while there. Still, it is a carnival-like atmosphere that is well worth the visit. Long Street is the night spot to be although for those over 50 like me, it might lack the same appeal is holds for younger, more energetic visitors.I am certain that many visitors will insist on going to a traditional ""African"" restaurant. We went to one and were not very pleased with the quality of the food and I believe that is usual for such fare based on other experiences I heard while there."
50,“Everyone should visit Cape Town”,"Cape Town was great. There is so much shopping to do here.The V&A waterfront is the best place. You can spend hours here shopping, eatting, walking around. Table Mountain was also beautiful. The View from the top is really something to see. We found that People here in Cape Town are really friendly. The beaches are very nice. I'd like to visit here again some day."
50,“Awesome Fun”,Everything to do and the best summer fun during Christmas
50,“It was a great experience”,"Dear all,All the time we hear about CapeTown is somethings like...Take care, beware of thieves etc...Ya...even i was bit reluctant to see what is in my plate at CapeTown.But my experience was entirely different.I had very much comfortable stay without any trouble. I was advised to take care about myself when traveling in CT.What i can say is....just be precocious...Thats it. Dont go by Public Transport if you dont have any local fellow with you.No flashing of your wealth.Roam in well crowded place like waterfront, Canal walk mall.If u follow this i am sure you can enjoy ur CT stay."
20,“Getting ready for Soccer 2010”,"I live in Cape Town and have been flying from / to Cape Town International Airport. A word of warning for all travellers to /from Cape Town: make sure that you are at the CT airport at least 2 hours before your flight leaves as the flights are often overbooked. The cheaper variety of domestic airlines often cancel flights, so make sure you give them a mobile number to notify you of changes. Can have a huge impact if you need to get a connecting flight. That said, Cape Town is a brilliant place to visit."
50,“african experience”,"just came back from capetown and had a brilliant time from start to finish. Stopped at the ""fountains hotel"" in the city centre and my partner and i couldnt fault it. The staff were fantastic, the rooms were well above average, this was probably becasue they gave us a free upgrade on arrival when my partner enquired about the possibility. We had arranged a pick up from the airport off the hotel and he was standing there waiting for us. As for capetown its self it is a beautiful and very interesting place to spend a holiday. The locals are lovely people to be around and everyone of them were great and always had a smile on there face and are not at all bitter with the past history of the country. The V&A have some great restaraunts, especially the ""thai wang"" and there are a few very friendly pubs. Long street is another place that has bars and restraunts to visit, but a word of warning, do not go into a bar called ""purple turtle"" it is full of all sorts of wierd people as we found out when we visited. Great staff and customers in the ""Dubliner"" with live music every night. A must is a organised trip to ""robben island"" and the ""townships"" also ""cape point"" is a great trip not forgetting the cable car ride up ""table mountain"" which is a great day out. If you have time ""shark diving"" is a option though we didnt get to do it as our trip was cancelled due to the weather, safari and whale watching(june-november) are great trips."
50,“Sunny Cape Town”,"Luckily I have family in Cape Town so no need for a hotel and I can't complain about the accommodation or service!If there is one place you visit in your life then make it Cape Town without a doubt. There is so much to see and do you will probably have to delay your return back home to fit it all in.I recently travelled with my other half and kids (7 and 5) and cannot express enough what an absolutely fantastic time we had.Firstly, definitely hire a car as public transport is not considered overly safe for tourists but driving is very easy on freeways and ensure you avoid the rush hours as you will be stuck forever! An international driving licence is also required for UK residents but contact the local consulate before you go if unsure about any documentation etc. They are very helpful.Cape Town is perfectly safe and welcoming. Don't be put off. Safety wise it is pretty much the same rules as any major city you visit i.e. don't flash your valuables or walk around with huge wads of cash, stay in well populated areas and out of poorer areas. However, keep your windows up, doors locked and don't stop for anyone as there is still poverty.I would recommend one of the first things you do is visit 'The Waterfront'. As well as great shopping and fantastic food there is an excellent information centre where maps, guides, info can be obtained and excursions booked. Why not sit having a spot of lunch planning the rest of your holiday!!It is also worth noting that the gateway to Robben Island (where Nelson Mandela and various other apartheid activists were held) is situated beside the Tourist Info Centre. Spend half a day visiting and understanding the history of Cape Town and the apartheid. Not being able to really remember this period of history it blew me away and is a great way to enhance your understanding of the problems South Africa has faced. District Six Museum is worth combining with this. Prepare to be shocked but inspired by the history of this humantarian struggle. I wouldn't recommend taking young children but for anyone older it is a great educational experience.For days out my kids loved the drive south to Boulders Beach where the penguin colony is and the Cape of Good Hope where they felt they were standing on the end of the world. There is also the Two Oceans aquarium in 'The Waterfront' where the kids were able to see sharks and other exotic sealife. Definitely view the feeding in the main tank and see the touch exhibit. My daughter still likes to tell me about the time she held a starfish.If you are an adventurer then book a trip shark viewing/diving but I would encourage that you go with White Shark Projects who are a bit more environmentally aware than some trips. The trip is quite pricy but great value for money and well worth it as a one off experience.After beaches then go and hang out with the beautiful people in Camps Bay. Fantastic beach and perfectly safe. It has sand, sea and sunshine what more could you ask for!!Eating out is generally much cheaper than the UK so a great excuse to eat out as much as you can! Friends have recommended to go to steak restaurants such as Madame Zingara's or Nelsons Eye bit I haven't been yet. My kids love the simple yet value chain 'The Spur'.Climate is hot as you'd expect and just remember the seasons are reversed...This is just a brief summary of what there is to do but if I was going to write it all in I'd be here all day. I have a better idea, get online, book your ticket (Virgin or BA) and fly asap. No one will leave disappointed of that I am sure."
10,“Looks are Decieving: A Horrible Place to Stay”,"Cape Town Hollow at frist glance is an inticing location with its great view of Table Mountain and what appears on the surface to be clean rooms. The reality is that the hotel is cheap, dirty and filled with deception. Upon traveling to Cape Town for the first time with my class for a travel course that I took I learned that I would be staying at the Cape Town Hollow. After looking at the hotels website I was sure that I would have a lovely stay. However instead we were greeted by roaches, theft, leaks from the roof and being accused of lying about my things which had been stolen. As a group we had money, a flat iron and a cellphone stolen. Please be careful. I will say that there were some very nice staff members who worked the desk and the concierge services for both the morning and the night shift. However I would not recommend this hotel. There were no refigerators, iron or amble storage areas for what was suppose to be a five star hotel. The only thing this hotel offers is a great view and a good breakfest bar. Do yourself a favor, save your time annd money DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!"
50,“Gorg place”,"Its a beautiful place we stayed in Romany Hotel 5* , it was a lovely place if you have the chance you should go !"
40,“Lots to Do - hire a car !”,"Cape Town is a beautiful location. It is safe so dont let other people tell you it isnt. I was working there and drove around and walked around on my own with no problem at all.I would recommend Table Mountain, its no point in planning it as the clouds have a time of their own. It can be the hotest, sunniest day and the clouds can still be over Table Mountain. I have been twice each year between February and March. The weather was stil fantastic, hot enough for a tan anyway.V&A & ShoppingThe V&A is super b shopping, lots of things to buy. If you want traditional, local things then try one of the many markets, on the outskirts of the V&A. If you want pictures, Ostrich Eggs, etc, then on a Sunday in the Market square in the banking area, this is where a local market is, and at least you are giving money back directly to the locals. Woolworths is the equivilent of M&S out there - good bargins to be had..DIAMONDSWell! I am not a jewelry girl, but if you want to see every colour of the rainbow then this is where it is. Visit one of the Factories, ""Out of Africa"" was good. Remember any shopping claim you taxation back, pre do the forms etc at the V&A then collect your cheque or CC Payment at the airport.Dont be taken in by all the hype of poor aspects, there are some that still live in the shacks!! they get free electricity, phone etc, and then go a buy a BMW to ride around in.STELLENBOSCHThe wine regions are great to visit, the one a friend (SA) took me to in Stellenbosch was Spier Vineyard. You can visit for the day, their are shops, market, Zoo, and a beautiful location for a picnic for the day. You cannot take your own food, but they have a fantastic delicatessan that will give you all you need.CAMPS BAYBeautiful beach area where you can eat from the front and return to the beach as you please. The sea is Freeeezing though and thats from someone who was brought up in Kent swimming in the UK.MOYO - Traditional south african restaurant at the Spire Vineyard.. Be prepared to have african face painting, and enjoy. There is another in Joburg in Melrose Arch. Search on their website.I worked and stayed at the Mount Nelson - Orient Express Hotel. Very expensive I believe, but if you are going to do anything, if you can afford staying there!! then at least go and have a high tea there.. worth every penny."
50,“The Cape offers more than just wine (but even that was enough!)”,"I just experienced a fantastic few days in the Western Cape, enjoying the weather (good), food (better) and wine (best).I thought I knew Cape Town until I spent a day with Alan Bent of Wine and Whales Golf Tours. Alan’s knowledge of the Cape Peninsula and Cape Town City made me realise just how much I had missed on two previous visits to the Cape. His delivery of the facts is both relaxed and informative.I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience and would not hesitate to recommend the Western Cape, and Alan’s services to others planning to visit South Africa."
50,“best holiday ever”,"I have been to cape town twice. it is the most amazing city table mountain is amazing if you want to go up onto the mountain make sure that it is in the morning as the table cloth (mist) covers the mountain in the afternoon. the view is spectacular. cape town sits on the two oceans the indian ocean meets the atlantic ocean.the botanical gardens are well worth a visit you can spend the whole day there the children love it, there is a stream that falls from table mountain right through the gardens it is shallow and safe for the little ones to put their feet in my children loved it. I went there several times and never wanted to leave, there is a cafe and a restaurant all very nice and as usual spotless very clean. it is cheaper to have a bottle of wine than a glass. the gardens are immaculate. i saw lots of people having a picnic. the gardens are a must on your visit.cape town has a waterfront where there are alot of nice places to eat you will find all kinds of food there is a fab victorian style shopping center lots of boats seals that play in the marinas. they have shows there some nights and there is a fab view of table mountain from here which gets lit up at night. there are two great hotels on the water front the victoria and alfred and the cape grace i have stayed in both. the victoria and alfred is the best only a small hotel with amazing sservice this hotel has the best view of the mountain and overlooks one of the basins where the seals play in the water just infront of our room try to have a mountain view room if you can it will be worth the extra money. dont stay at a hotel in town it is a 15min walk to the water front from there and you will always want to be on the waterfront at night as it is very safe. also the two aceans aquarium is on the waterfront the children will enjoy a visit and the adults to.while we were in cape town we visited alot of vinyards the best one i think is boschendal it is about an hours drive from ct and you can sit wine tasting under a big old oak tree the whole place is paradise you wont want to leave. there is a fab place to eat to and the food is great you will find the cape very cheap to eat out compared to the uk. at boschendal there is an old dutch homestead very beautiful with lots of beautiful furniture. the air is so pure and fresh sweet fresh air. i never want to leave infact all of the vinyards are great. you can also book afew night stay on one if you wish.cape point is a must when in cape town its a few hours drive to get there but you pass through lots of nice towns on the way simons town which was a british naval port and boulders bay where you will find the minature jak ass penguins that live on boulders bay in their natural habitat they are amazing children and adults love to have this experience how often do we see this in the uk. wild life is all around you in the cape its so interesting. on the way to cape point the views are spectacular you will want to keep stopping to take photographs as we did. when you finally reach cape point you drive for a while through the national park for about 20mins untill you reach the point where you will park your park your car. it is only then that you will realise that you have reached 'heaven on earth'. it is the most amazing place that i have been to. you can get up to the point on a small venicular that pulls you to the top of the point when you get out of the venicular to look out at the view you will see that this is the point where the indian ocean meets the atlantic ocean. wow what a view unrivalled view of the two oceans what a place. after wards we went to have a drink to calm down from the breathtaking view I bought a box of maltesers and sat to eat them with my daughter when from out of the blue the dissapeard from infront of my eyes a monkey has come along and taken them. i did tell you that wildlife is very close to you didnt I.if you only have a week in cape town stay on the waterfront, go onto the mountain, botanical gardens, cape point, boulders bay, and visit boschendal. i was lucky on my first visit i had a south african guy to show me around and he took me to the best places. if you go to the cape which is a massive area you wont need any jabs i took my two children we needed none. i went for 2-3 weeks on both trips so i did get the chance to travel up the garden route and beyond i went to knysna and stayed at the st james which is an upmarket small hotel they dont have children although i did convince them to take mine as they are well behaved. plettenburg bay where you will find a beautiful beach, storms river which is by the tsitsikamma national park wow another just amazing place to visit. there is a rope bridge over the storms river beware there are sharks below it. i did go to the cango caves they are worth a visit. along way though. i have had good reports that the shamwari game reserve is great for families they do a moonlight safari i have never been there though bearing in mind that it took 2 days to get to storms river but i did stop at knysna for 4 days to rest the hotel there sits right on a lagoon great for watersports the owner and his wife took my husband out water skiing well woth the 4 day stop. we were treated like king and queen every where that we went in the cape.I have never had any problems with safety in cape town just be carefull as you would in any city at night the waterfront is safe, i went into the city at night and its ok to park outside of where you want to go but in the day I always felt safe in the city shopping area. get the hotel taxi to drop you off in green market square its easier to leave your car at the hotel when going into the city the carparking attendants try to rip you off otherwise they were the only guys to give us any lip. that is why i would stay on the waterfront then at night you dont need your car as its all just there for you. in cape town you will never feel like you have been ripped off its not so over commercialised in any way tickets for anywhere are very cheap i think we payed three pounds each to go up on the mountain.so if you read this and want to contact me for any more advice please do so. i flew direct both times once with south african and once with ba south african were the best.south africa has alot to offer so go and see for yourself i did not want to leave its 100 times better than the uk not over crowded for one the roads are very safe the best we have ever been hardly any traffic polite drivers roads are well signposted if you use a map you will be ok the motorway service stations put ours to shame very clean and great food. every where is so clean compared to the uk and very clean. when I get home I miss seeing the mountain you can never get lost because it is always there as a focal point. i would get the hotel car to pick you up from the airport then get your hire care through avis or hertz the will drop it off at your hotel great service the cars are always better to than you would get say in europe.and thats it too much to say fantastic place no jet lag either."
50,“what a fantastic place”,"having just returned from cape Town on Wednesday evening I would like to recommend the place to anyone wanting a doing holiday. What a fantastic place, it has so much to offer. The amount of places to visit things to see is totally amazing. The weather was fantastic the people were just great and the quality of everything was second to none. I cannot express how much fun we have had."
10,“fabulous views”,"what a wonderful country,breathtaking views,marvelous food(very cheap),and off course great weather,so much to see and do even after a months stay we had hardly begun,cape town is dynamic,the cable car up to table mountain is in itself stunning,marvelous rest.&bars,music,on the albert&victoria waterfront,fabulous shops,we stayed at the ritz hotel in sea point, very reasonable a little out dated but very good atmosphere&very good service,would recommend if tou are on a budget,cant wait to go back"
50,"“Chill and just be, or maybe..?”","I adore South Africa and fallen hopelessly in love with Cape Town. This place has is very elemental. There is earth as etched into Table Mountain and the imposing columns of the 12 Apostles. There is the air, represented by the chil southeaster. And of course, there is water lapping in, frothy and obscenely blue from two oceans.Of course, there is much to see and do in Cape Town but I heartily recommend a day off from regimented sight seeing to just enjoy being.I would start the day by meeting the sun with a stroll along the beach in Camps Bay at dawn. Your jaw will drop and your knees will surely weaken at this peacock display of vibrancy.These early morning trips to the beach are perfectly safe in the right area (camps bay, bantry bay, hout bay). You will be unbothered by unwanted attention from those selling things that you're not sure you don't need and you can pick the choicest spot on the beach.I would recommend collecting a couple of pebbles or stones; stating your problem and then tossing them as far into the ocean as possible. One thing that you do realise, is that there is no problem bigger than the ocean.Pray, meditate, breathe.Then have a good breakfast, I normally stay at a hotel in Bantry Bay and their breakfasts are great.Now go do something interesting with your day, you can go and do an early afternoon workshop at the Gold Museum of Africa- chill and learn a skill what more could you want.After you've adorned yourself in your own creativity, go for a massage. You can get excellent massages at the Waterfront's Wellness Centre or in the more upmarket spa across the road. A good massage should leave you feeling slightly and deliciously incoherent and a tad boneless.Finish your day by taking yourself for a good dinner. I would recommend the jazz cafe over by the clock tower. Sit outside unless a blanket of stars, let the music wash over you, sip a cocktail and raise your glass to toast the embers of a dying African day."
50,“My introduction to South Africa”,"Capetown I must say is tops for family vacations. I went there on October and the weather was just right, sunny with a bit of chill. The landscape/ views are superb. A visit to the Mandela Museum is a must - you'll get reminded to learn from our ""mistakes"". If you yearn for something more fast-paced, the Camps Bay area and beaches are just a few kilometers away.If you love seafoods - they have the best! My children are steak eaters but there, they feasted on squid rings, sole, shrimps (hmmm, can still remember how they tasted).The people are warm and very hospitable including the staff of the SAS Radisson where we stayed. One more thing probably that added to our wonderful experience is that it is an English-speaking area, and we didn't have the difficulties we sometimes experience is other placesBest of all is the price - if you're used to the prices in Europe, a trip to South Africa is a bargain! Don't fall for their ""safari"" in the surrounding areas, they're not the real safaris and not worth your time.."
50,“Tourists/locals -different worlds”,"If you go to Cape Town to stay at a tourist resort, you will be able to see Table Mountain, Robben Island, Cape of good hope and a couple of wine farms. Not bad. But that's not all. There still are areas of the inner city that tourists (with good reason) are advised not to enter on their own. So, if you happen to know a local resident, the true city of Cape Town has much more to offer: backyard restaurants, sofa cinema, narrow streets with good coffeshops, minicab rides with 21other passengers, bars with all sorts of people that do not close until you go home. There's an atmosphere in this city like no other. It's laid back, yet restless and exciting. I love it"
40,“Cape Town really is Kaapstad”,"Great Place. Old architecture is fantastic.Just don't go to the much-touted V&A Waterfront. It just sucks tourists in.Parking for long periods is a horrible problem, but where not?Most interesting quarter, to us, was the Malay Quarter. But then, we have roots in Holland, the East and the West Indies. Not-so-funnily, these guys were imported from the East Indies as slaves, while those same Dutch were buying slaves in equatorial Africa and exporting them to the West Indies. Not a trace of Muslim Jihad feelings to be found."
50,“My favourite location in South Africa”,"Having grown up in South Africa, I travelled to Cape Town fairly often for vacations with family and friends. The last time I visited Cape Town was in September 2001 after immigrating to London in 1996. I was still inspired by this beautiful cosmopolitan city which has a special place in my heart. I find the people warm, friendly and very helpful. The beaches - specifically Clifton Beach - are packed to the brim with holiday-makers in peak season (October - February) but well worth the occasional hassle. IIf your accomodation is near enough, it's worth considering walking to your favourite beach during these times as travelling by car or taxi can take just as long - or even longer - due to lack of nearby parking facilities. Stunning white, powder-like sand and crystal clear (very cold!) waters make it all worthwhile though. You'll find many trendy restaurants and bars scattered in and around town. There are an abundance of good quality B&B's or hotels at affordable prices in all the main areas. Shopping is also a great experience - especially with a favourable exchange rate if you're visiting from abroad. If you've never been before, give Cape Town a go on your next vacation - I'm sure you won't be disappointed, in fact, once you've been, I'm sure you'll want to go back for more!"
40,“A great destination”,"There is a wealth of reasons to visit Cape Town. It's a beautiful seaside city with incredible mountatin views and beautiful beaches (although the water is really too cold for swimming). Be sure to visit Table Rock, Cape Point and the wine towns. It's almost guaranteed that you'll run out of time before running out of things you want to see."
30,“Nice Tourist Place”,"I think, if you've seen one city then you've seen them all. Traveling across the world to Africa and landing in Cape Town had it's ups and downs. Mostly, it was a tourist trap and people were falling for it. Hotels, shopping centers, African people singing and dancing in the streets, etc. Get me outta here!! I wanted to see Africa the way I'd always imagined it, since this was my dream trip.We left a few days later for the country."
50,“Amazing!!!”,Awesome place! Just be careful because of the crime! Try n go there with a saffa but if u can't listen to the advice the hotes give u!! I think this is probably one of the most beautiful places in the world!!
40,“Heaven”,"Recently married we traveled to Capetown for 3 weeks for our honeymoon. We stayed in Capetown with some family for a week then drove to Port Elizabeth which is about 500 miles stopping over in Mosel Bai in The Avenues guest house, beautiful accommodation but the breakfast in the morning requires the hosts to be less ""stingy"" - we asked for bacon only and my husband got bacon and eggs - I was given a huge dinner place with tomato and lots of dried herbs over the plate with one rasher..... I wouldnt even give that to a child!!!! we left here and traveled on to the Addo Elephant sanctury which is fab!! Not only elephants, lions, rhino,warthogs,kudo, zebra all animals that belong to that area, Also while up there we visited a reserve and rescue centre for lions tigers crocodiles and some other animals and cats that have been rescued. We lived at Valleyview Guest House which is a short distance from the sanctuary - [--] which is highly recomended great self contained apartment/bedsit very reasonable (B&B) and the owner will book you into the near by restaurant - I think its the only one about! On our way back we stoped off at an ostrich farm which was pot luck but was fantastic and the hosts were wonderful and welcomed us into their home for an evening meal - this is itemised seperately from the room at a small additional cost but the food was superb!!! Skeiding Guest Farm well worth a visit. We also went on the wine route where we visted Fairview view yard - sweet red wine is a must its like a port but also has a distinct flavor of rhubard and KWV which has a wonderful shop the champagne is to die for........ their are lots of wonderful places to visit and before leaving capetown remember to go up table mountain cable car and to go to Table View and if you like fish visit the Blowfish restaurant and go to the fish counter and pick your fish 3 of us went and it cost £50 including all the drinks and I think we ate half the ocean!!! Anyone looking for more information or places to visit do not hesitate to contact me - KLM flight was great logs of leg room and cabin staff were great."
50,“My favourite city”,"As a city Cape Town is a mash-up of cultures - combining the colonial flavour of it's European past, with the vibrant emergence of a young, trendy black culture and the old-world charm of it's Muslim inhabitants. It's an accepting, inviting city that caters to all types, from it's trendy gay & lesbian underground, to the Flashy Camps Bay elite. You're sure to find something here to thrill, excite and capture your imagination."
50,“Langa Township”,"We could not ask for a better experience of how local people live it was quite emotional , and we visited vicky's bed and breakfast and the welcome we got was amazing, we also went to a shabeen and meet the locals. also drank the local kaffa beer which I would have to say would but you off drinking . I would recommend a trip to the langa township,"
50,“Safari and SINGITA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”,"If anyone has any questions or needs advice on where to go, where to stay, please feel free to ask.We started in Cape Town for several days, stayed at the Cape Grace. Since there was a group of us we stayed in the three bedroom suite on the uppermost floor. Unbelieveable suite, fabulous accomodations and service!On our first full day we went Shark Diving with White Shark Ecoventures tours....what an amazing day! We were picked up very early (4:30am) for the two hour drive to Gaansbi and the drive was actually not unpleasant. Beautiful towns and scenery kept us busy on the way, and a very pleasant driver named Robb kept us entertained.Within 15 minutes of getting onto the boat, putting on wetsuits, we were told to get in the cage. There was already a HUGE great white shark approaching the boat. Several of us took the chance to plunge into the shark cage and when we were told to ""GO DOWN"" we went under and got some beautiful views of the most majestic, sleek animals I'd ever seen. We spent a full 6 hours on the boat going in and out of the cage, though some of the best viewing was from the top of the boat where you could see the sharks coming, and breaching the top of the water. I'd highly recommend it to anyone. It was not even the least scary, was very well run and at the end, you receive a video of your trip. Worth every second of it!In Cape Town, we hired a driver through the hotel who gave us a complete driving tour of the Cape, stories of every town along the way. If you love to see a little bit of everything, this is a must.We also went to Robben Island for the prison tour, which was quite informative.We hired a heliopter to see the overall view of the Cape, went to the Cape of Good Hope and stayed there many hours to see the beautiful scenery and waves crashing against the southern most point of South Africa.On to Safari: We started at Singita Lebombo....I cant recommend it highly enough. Within the first hour of the first game drive we saw all of the ""big five"" and every drive, morning or night, got better and better. The accomodations were top notch, the service and food were unbelieveable!Next stop was Singita Ebony and Singita Boulders. Both are vastly different in decor but are in Sabi Sands Park rather than Kruger (which is where Lebombo is). The animals are more used to people and we got within 3 feet of most animals. It took slightly longer to see the ""big five"" in this area but the animals got so close to you that you could literally touch them (though it was requested that we NOT do that). Again, the accomodations and food were outstanding.In all Singita locations, the service is something I've never experienced. If your battery on a camera went dead, they'd get you a new one, they'd take your camera memory sticks and convert the stick onto disc, you were never without a beverage, food, sunscreen, or someone smiling and asking if there was anything to be done to make your stay more enjoyable. Each meal was more delicious than the prior and if you wanted something that wasnt on the menu, all you had to do was ask. We were even given recipes for the foods we loved the most, and will use them at home quite often.Each night when we came back, someone had miraculously drawn a bath in my suite with flowers floating, champagne on ice and the whole room was filled with candles.Everyone in our group enjoyed the trip, words cannot describe it.We used an agent located in Johanessburg to arrange our flights within SA, and our accomodations. No one missed a beat, at each airport, someone had a sign with our names on it, the car was waiting and we were given cool refresher towels to use once we landed. It couldnt have gone more smoothly.If anyone wants pictures of accomodations, please feel free to let me know. I'd be happy to send them.All in all, it was the best vacation adventure of our lives and we are planning on going back as soon as possible.Happy Travels!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
50,“A week in Cape Town”,"Just returned from a two week trip to South Africa. The first week was all business and took me from Johannesburg to Durban and then to Cape Town. The second week was all holiday in Cape Town, and I couldn't be happier! If you have never visited South Africa, you must plan a trip to the Cape.Hotel: I stayed at the City Lodge Cape Town which was conveniently located about a 10 minute walk from the main part of the V & A Waterfront. The rooms were comfortable and well kept, the breakfast was very good and had a great selection. My only complaint would be that the supposed pool was nothing more than a large jacuzzi. Overall, I would stay here again for the price it was very nice, and the staff was very friendly.The Sights: As a first time visitor to South Africa, I did most of the tourist things. I travelled to Cape Point for a day and was not disappointed. The scenery in and of itself was worth the trip, a look to the right and you could watch the waves of the ocean crashing over beautiful rock formations and against the coast. A look to the left and I was amazed at the mountains and scenic views. Upon reaching the Cape Point Nature Park one sees wild baboons, ostriches, and gazelle type animals right along the road. The views from the point light house are fantastic and the weather was perfect.I spent another day on Table Mountain, which forms the backdrop of the city. Again, the views from the top are well worth the cost of the cable car ride. After leaving table mountain we travelled to Stellenbosch and the wine region. Make this a day and hire a driver to take you so that you don't have to worry about driving. I would recommend Simonsig Vineyards, and La Motte Winery as excellent choices.Another day was spent at the botanical gardens, and while it was mid summer and most of the plants were not in bloom, the beauty of the area and the scenic views are very nice. I would love to see this in the spring when the thousands of plants and flowers are in bloom. Followed this up with a walk through the Company Gardens and Greenmarket square in Downtown Cape Town.I did spent a day going to a game preserve about two hours from Cape Town. For $200 I expected a better event. The reserve was called Faire Glenn and while they advertise that they have over 20,000 hectacres only 1000 are actually part of the preserve at this time. There are a limited number of animals and much of our time felt like I was at a Disney animal ride complete with corny jokes. I would not do this again and would rather spent the extra time and money to go to Kruger or another actual game reserve where the experience is much more real.I ran out of time and did not make it to Robben Island but will do this upon my return to Cape Town.Dining: Hard to go wrong when you are in Cape Town. For the less adventuresome there are dozens of restaurants in the Waterfront are. We chose Belthazar Steakhouse and would recommend it to anyone. Not only was the food excellent but they serve over 200 wines by the glass. Also, if you are looking for a great place to spend the evening take a taxi to Camp's Bay and walk along the beach, climb around the rocks and then stoll up seaside blvd. and find a place to sit outside and eat and share a bottle of wine while watching the sun set over the ocean. It doesn't get better than this. Quay Four is a nice spot on the Waterfront for lunch while watching the harbor in action.Overall Impressions: I am already planning my next trip to Cape Town and would tell everyone to experience the beauty of the land, the friendliness of the people, and excellent dining and entertainment options."
50,“thank you thank you”,"wanted to thank all you guys for a wonderful review of cape town. went to capetown Dec 6 - 9th. short trip - i admit but well worth it.stayed at this small hotel Ikhaya lodge. it was quaint with a tropical feel to it. it is not a good recommendation for a long stay. need more comfort. used one of your recommendations and had dinner at MANOLO EATS. Grrrrreat food. ambience was fantastic. the bar area reminded me of any bar in NYC. dinner was mid priced and very very nice. the service was top class.one thing to let people know is that if you are coming to cape town and plan to go to RObben island, you might want to book ahead of time..... email for tickets. they were sold out when we went but our tour guide was able to score us some. we also did the township tour with rainbow tours and Cinga was our guide. love him...love him. only regret was the shortness of the trip but i will be back....."
50,“Table View good place to be”,"Having just returned from a trip to cape town wanted to share our experience. We were independant travellers i.e. booked our own flts, accom, car hire and had no problems, we had no plan just sort of knew where we wanted to visit. We had 3nights in CapeTown from there we decided a base would be easier then keep moving to different hotels (I am very fussy aswell) so we based ourselves at Table View where the beach and views were excellent and access to the Wetern Cape easy. We found an excellent guest house Villa de la Shore where the hosts Elaine And Conrad were very friendly and accomadating to the point of making us feel it was home from home. We visited all the normal tourist haunts ie Franschoek, Hermanus. But found a little gem the Riebeek Valley where we stayed in a great all be it unusual hotel Travellers Rest, the area should not be misssed great wine tasting and a lot less touristy then the normal wine route, the scenery was breathtaking. We would encourage anyone to visit the Cape Town independantly there is so much to see and it is lovely to choose when and where you want to go. We were always met with a warm smile and friendliness. We will return in the new year."
50,“Discover Cape Town Time”,"I have just returned from a 9 week volunteer project in Cape Town and when I wasn't working hard, I was experiencing the delight that is Cape Town. From Robben Island to Table Mountain and everything in between, there is so much to see and do in this city that you can be there for 9 weeks and never get bored.The scenery is beautiful and there are numerous tours that you can organise to experience all the different views. Take a trip to the Table Mountain Nature Reserve or visit the most southerly point on the continent of Africa. There is ample oppotunity to swim, surf, hike, and for those with a bigger appetite for excitement, you can abseil, skydive or dive with great white sharks.For those who prefer slightly less adrenalin-inducing activities, you can go whale watching, enjoy the beautiful beaches at Camps Bay and Simonstown or go shopping at the Waterfront. Spend a day in Greenmarket Square, bartering with the locals for their hand carved treasures while listening to the drumming and general buzz around you. You must also take the time to do a township tour and see the other side of Cape Town. These poorer neighbourhoods are also very welcoming to tourists and the differences between the standards of living is something that has to be seen to be believed.Take a stroll down Long Street where you can stop and have almost anything from a plain coffee to a cocktail, from a sandwich to tapas. For dinner, you can sample worldwide cusine at the food court down by the Waterfront, or any other number of restaurants around Long Street. For great food and service at an extremely reasonable price, I recommend Arnolds Restaurant on Kloof Street. Those guys go out of their way to ensure that you have as pleasant an evening as possible. For nightlife, Long Street again comes out tops, with a great mixture of clubs and bars to suit most tastes.All in all, the ""Mother City"" as it is affecionately known as (some people say that because it takes 9 months to get anything done) has been my favourite holiday destination to date. It's a beautiful, easy going city with wonderful people who make you feel at home within a day."
50,“One of the most fascinating cities in the world”,"Having seen the occasional program about Cape Town on TV, I decided to see it for myself. Wow!, is only one exclamation I could use. Seeing is believing is another. From the moment I left the airport, heading towards the city in my hired car(very reasonably priced),I could see Table Mountain towering over the city centre. There is a landmark of majestic proportions and beauty. My Guest House in the suburb of Tableview, some 8km out of the city was luxurious,and soon I found myself in the pool washing away the weariness of a 12 hour flight from London. The owners supplied me with maps and guides, and soon I was on the road to the famous Waterfront. 300 restaurants, 800 shops, countless craft stalls, and all at the waters' edge in a busy port. My ensuing days were filled with trips to the vineyards, only one hours' drive away, to Cape Point where the Indian and Atlantic Oceans meet, and many visits to exquisite restaurants in delectable settings.In summary, here's a city which ranks amongst the worlds' best, but does so little to promote itself. Want to know more? Simply write to me via this forum.Ulrich Dannecker"
50,“This city will blow you away”,"As a seasoned traveller I have seen most cities of the world, but Cape Town ranks amongst the top 3 !No matter what your taste is, Cape Town caters for it. Ranging from scenery to climate, from culture to wildlife, from accommodation to restaurants, Cape Town has the lot.Whether you travel on a tight budget, or you have some cash to spare, you will find excellent venues to suit your budget.The best way to describe Cape Town is: The world in one cityIf you would like details, or just some advise I would be happy to help you!Ulrich Dannecker"
50,“Local Tours”,"Visited Cape Town in March 2005. Single female. Poor local transport infrastructure. Thius one needs to hire a car, take a taxi or hire the services of tour operators or local guides. If you don't wish to be part of the standard 10 -40 tour group bunch, then best to use the local guides. I used one such, called Ebrahim Mall, whom I found via the Tourist Office on the Waterfront. He was excellent and fun. Why not give him a try. Contact the Waterfront Tourist Office directly."
20,“Sans plus”,"La ville n'est guère intéressante, de surcroît quand on est seul ça craint un peu, les transport en commun limité, la population est très fermée sur elle même ......."
50,“Una città che consiglio di visitare!”,"Città del Capo è una città veramente molto bella... Almeno la zona turistica e del centro è molto pulita ed ordinata e non dà assolutamente la sensazione di pericolo...La zona del porto è ricca di negozi e c'è un marina un po' turistica ma dove una passeggiata si fa volentieri e ci sono molti negozietti interessanti. Lì si comprano pure capi di abbigliamento carini a buoni prezzi.Consiglio vivamente l'escursione alla Table Mountain, semrpeché non soffirate di vertigini!!!!!!!! Infatti, la salita in teleferica è mozzafiato ma... sconsigliata ai vertiginosi! A piedi una salita è vivamente sconsigliabile: lunghissima distanza.Dalla Table Mountain si gode di un panorama eccezionale e se la giornata è nuvolosa ci si sente ""Fra le nuvole""...Se avete una giornata in più è carina pure l'idea di andare a visitare la zona delle case vinicole con un completo programma di degustazione: i vini sud africani sono eccellentti, sia rossi sia bianchi con qualche passito di alto profilo.Ci sono inoltre tramonti in spiaggia davvero eccezionali lungo le spiagie di Città del Capo.Io ci sono stato a giugno, un mese autonnale dire e il clima era fresco ma gradevole."
50,“Mein Favorit Südafrica-Kapstadt”,"Obwohl wir nur 1 Woche Zeit hatten,haben wir viele und gute Eindrücke und Bekanntschaften gemacht. Wir hatten Afrika überhaupt nicht auf""dem Zettel"" wie man so sagt.....aber da der Flug ein Gewinn war,wollten wir es uns ansehen. Und nun....? Ist etwas mit uns geschehen ,wir sind ""infiziert"" wir MÜSSEN da wieder hin , wir haben soviel entdeckt,was wir unbedingt noch sehen und ergründen möchten. Wir wissen,es ist anders als das übrige Afrika aber es hat so seine ganz eigene Geschichte und es finden Umbrüche statt und es ist spannend,wohin es noch führt.....wir sind sehr interessiert und hoffen,wir schaffen es,nächstes Mal länger bleiben zu können."
50,“Schönste Stadt des Kontinents”,"Kapstadt ist für viele Besucher (und wahrscheinlich auch die Anwohner) die schönste Stadt Afrikas, besonders im südlicher Afrika, wo viele Städte langweilig, ähnlich und ohne wahrnehmbare Innenstadt sind. Kapstadt ist traumhaft am Fuß des Tafelbergs gelegen, ein Besuch dieses Berges sollte auf jeder Kapstadtreise ganz am Anfang stehen, allein schon um einen Überblick zu bekommen. Der Berg kann mit einer Seilbahn befahren werden, bei ausreichend Zeit bietet sich auch an, den Aufstieg zu Fuß zu machen und anschließend mit der Seilbahn herunter zu fahren. Der Aufstieg im Gorge Trail ist in 3-4 Stunden problemlos schaffbar und gut ausgebaut. Weitere schöne Bereiche Kapstadts die bei einem Besuch nicht fehlen sollten ist die Victoria and Alfred waterfront und natürlich der Nationalpark am Kap der guten Hoffnung."
40,“Eine tolle Stadt”,"Kapstadt schmiegt sich an den berühmten Tafelberg und ist Ziel für Touristen aus der ganzen Welt. In den Fussgängerzonen trifft sich ein buntes Völkergemisch, die Atmosphäre ist locker und gelöst. Strassenmusiker füllen jede Ecke mit Musik und an Ständen wird Kunsthandwerk angeboten."
40,“Das schönste Kap der Welt”,"Atmosphäre pur: Kapstadt ist die wohl spannendste Stadt Südafrikas. Bluesclubs, moderne Hafenviertel, koloniale Villen und viel afrikanisches Lebensgefühl in einer wohl einzigartigen Kulisse zwischen Tafelberg und dem tiefblauen Meer. Prädikat: unbedingt hinfahren, länger bleiben, eintauchen, Menschen kennenlernen und nicht (nur) das klassische Touristenprogramm abspulen."
50,“Kapstadt und Umgebung”,"Kapstadt ist der ideale Ausgangspunkt für erlebnisreiche Tage am südlichen Ende des afrikanischen Kontinents. In der Stadt bietet die Waterfront (in der Nähe man sich am besten seine Unterkunft sucht) ein wunderschönes Ambiente zum Flanieren und zum Shoppen. An einem möglichst wolkenlosen Tag sollte man die Auffahrt auf den Tafelberg genießen (Gondel), der Blick von oben auf Kapstadt und weit über dessen Grenzen hinaus ist atemberaubend!Eine Tours ans Kap der guten Hoffnung darf natürlich nicht fehlen, auch der Aufstieg zum Leuchtturm am Cap sollte unbedingt gemacht werden. Auch von hier hat man wieder einen wunderschönen Blick. Auf dem Rückweg kommt man durch die kleine Gemeinde Boulders Beach an dessen Strände sich die Pinguine tummeln-ein Erlebnis für Groß und Klein. Wir fanden auch die Townshiptour (unbedingt mit einem lokalen Führer unternehmen!!) spitze.Zudem sollte eine zumindest eintägige Safari nicht fehlen, wenn man in Südafrika ist, hier beiten sich mehrere Touren an und sollten nach Interessenslage ausgewählt werden."
50,“Sehenswert”,"Sea Point, ein Stadtteil von Kapstadt, liegt direkt am Meer. Es gibt zwar keinen Strand, jedoch kann man an der langen Promenade ausgedehnte Spaziergänge machen. Auf der anderen Straßenseite gibt es schöne Hotels und zahlreiche Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Abends sollte man jedoch etwas vorsichtig sein."
50,“schöne Hafenstadt nahe Ozeans”,"Kapstadt ist sehr schön, besonders faszinierend ist die Nähe des Ozeans und großen Tafelberges. Ungewöhnlich ist der rechtseitige Verkehr. Die Stadt ist sehr sauber. Verkehr ist nicht besonders intensiv, es sind weniger Staus. Es war 25 Grad im Februar. Es sind viele Touristen aus Europa. Etwas besonders fand ich, Alkoholverkaufsverbot in Geschäften ab Samstagabend bis Montag. Die Hauptsehenswürdigkeiten sind: Tafelberg, die Victoria and Alfred Waterfront und der victorianische Teil des Hafens, Two Oceans Aquarium und Castle of Good Hope."
50,“Die schönste Stadt am anderen Ende der Welt”,"Immer heißt es ""wie gefährlich ist es da""? Meine Antwort: Nicht gefährlicher als in einer anderen Großstadt. Es gibt keine Zeitverschiebung, wenn wir frieren ist dort Sommer, die Jahreszeiten sind genau entgegen gesetzt. Man findet Natur, Berge, Wasser und Shopping, alles was das Herz begehrt. Man isst und trinkt dort günstiger als bei uns und teilweise sind die Lebensmittel sogar hochwertiger."
50,“Kapstadt - ein Traum in Südafrika”,Die Perle an der südlichen Spitze von Afrika muss einen einfach in seinen Bann ziehen ! Zwischen Tafelberg und Meer liegt die Stadt in traumahafter Kulisse und lädt ein zum Bummeln und genießen.Must have:- Besuch auf dem Tafelberg- für alle ein wenig geübten Wanderer mit einem Abstieg zu Fuß anstelle der Seilbahn- Sonnenuntergang auf Lions Head mit Blick über Cape Town- Waterfront mit Shoppingtempel und Hafenatmosphäre- Seefood Platter in einem der unzähligen Fischrestaurants- natürlich ein Besuch in der Weinbergen nördlich von Kapstadt- und das Kap der guten Hoffnung
30,“Beklemmendes Gefühl in einer spannenden Stadt”,"Kapstadt - eine Stadt voller Gegensätze.Auf der einen Seite begeistert die Natur und das Panorama. Der Ausblick vom Tafelberg auf die verhältnismäßig kleine Stadt, im Hintergrund Robben Island und auf der anderen Seite des Tafelbergs der Blick Richtung Kap der Guten Hoffnung.In der Stadt faszinieren die kolonialen Bauten, es erschrecken jedoch die noch spürbaren Eindrücke der Rassentrennung und es beängstigen die zahlreichen Sercurity-Leute. Zwar wird überall betont, es sei schon viel für die Sicherheit getan worden, die hohen Zäune, die Pflicht zum Taxi-Fahren, die Security etc geben aber auch immer ein mulmiges Gefühl!"
50,“Paradies am südlichen Ende der Welt”,"Kapstadt liegt etwa 11 Flugstunden von Deutschland entfernt am südlichen Ende der Welt. Wer einmal dort war kommt mit Sicherheit wieder, weil man es in einem Urlaub nicht schafft alles Seheswerte zu sehen. Die perfekte Reisezeit ist zwischen Oktober und März ,wobei man bis etwa Ende November die Chance hat Wale vor der Küste zu sehen.Das hervorragende Essen und der gute Wein brauchen keinen internationalen Vergleich zu scheuen."
50,“Muss man gewesen sein !!”,"Hallo,Ich war sehr lange beruflich in Kapstadt.Sehr schöner Strand, Tafelberg Kap der guten Hoffnung sind nur ein paar der Higlights.Zum einkaufen geht man ins Canal Walk. es ist gigantisch gross... noch nie hab ich vergleichbares gesehnEs gibt in der Innenstadt eine Paulander bar wenn man dort länger ist und was von der heimat haben will. gibt es dort haxe mit kraut oder Bratwürste usw. und Prisch gebrautes Paulaner...kap der guten hoffnung sowie den Tafelber sollte man sich auch unbedingt anschauen...Es gibt viele gute Wein gute in dieser Region...Alles in allem... Kapstadt ist super geil.... !!"
50,“Schöne Stadt am Kap!!!”,"Kapstadt am Western Cape in Südafrika ist eine sehr schöne Stadt.Die Stadt ist sehr bunt! Es gibt sehr schicke Ecken, wie zum Beispiel das Gebiet um die Alfred & Victoria Waterfront.Das renovierte Hafenviertel besteht aus vielen Malls, guten Restaurants und zahlreichen Märkten!Hier findet man tolle Souvenirs, bezahlt jedoch auch gleichzeitig die teuersten Preise!Die Long Street ist die Straße mit der höchsten Café-Rate.Hier ist abends viel los!Tolle Clubs findet man zum Beispiel in der Camps Bay. Aber auch tagsüber sind dort gemütliche Cafés.Die Preise für Restaurants und Cafés in der Kapregion sind für Europäer sehr günstig!Empfehlenswerte Unterkünfte sind meiner Meinung nach Gasthäuser, welche sich en masse in dieser Ecke befinden.Ich kann das Southern Cross Guesthouse in Somerset West, einer Kleinstadt ca. 30 Autominuten von Kapstadt entfernt empfehlen.Es liegt sehr gut, da man von hier aus sehr viele Ausflüge unternehmen kann.Das Southern Cross Guesthouse ist sehr stilvoll eingerichtet und man fühlt sich auf Anhieb wohl!Das Frühstück ist perfekt!Für den nächsten Trip nach Südafrika, sollte man sich auf jeden Fall einmal überlegen, hier vorbei zu schauen!"
50,“Kapstadt”,"Kapstadt gehört allein schon wegen seiner geografischen Lage zu den schönsten Städten der Welt. Die vielen touristischen Möglichkeiten, das angenehme Klima und die umliegenden Strände bieten alles, was zu einem guten Urlaub dazu gehört. Was die Sicherheit betrifft, muss man natürlich etwas vorsichtig sein, besonders abends und nachts. Bei ca. 10 mehrwöchigen Besuchen ist uns jedenfalls bisher noch nie etwas passiert."
50,“Schönste Stadt der Welt - Camps Bay Ridge”,"Sollte in naher Zukunft eine Reise nach Südafrika anstehen, insbesondere Kapstadt Ziel der Reise sein, so möchte ich Ihnen eine der zahlreichen Bed & Breakfast Pensionen ans Herz legen. Gelegen in Camps Bay, salopp gesagt dem Beverly Hills von Cape Town, findet sich die Camps Bay Ridge. Die Pension ist in Besitz eines Deutschen, welcher selber in dieser lebt, somit finden sich keine Verständigungsschwierigkeiten und alle anstehenden Fragen können in der Muttersprache gelöst werden. Überdies steht er auch gern mit Rat und Tat zu Seite und hilft bei der doch oft schwierigen Frage, wo man was zu welcher Zeit am besten besichtigt und wo man zu Abend isst, großzügig mit und sorgt für entsprechende Reservierungen (wer schon einmal in Südafrika war weiss, wie schwierig es insbesondere am Wochendende ist, ohne Reservierung einen Tisch zu bekommen). Die Pension selber ist liebevoll im Detail eingerichtet, hat einen atemberaubenden Blick über die Camps Bay und deren Strände, auf den Lions Head und den Table Mountain im Rücken. Absolut zu erwähnen ist auch der große Rimflow Pool. Im Preis, welcher Verhandlungssache ist, ist das reichhaltige Frühstücksbuffee inbegriffen. Einziges Manko (oder auch Vorteil, je nach Standpunkt): Familien mit Kindern sind leider nicht erwünscht, um die Ruhe und Abgeschiedenheit zu gewährleisten..."
50,“helikopterflug mit civair über kapstadt”,"ein absolutes highlight eines besuches von kapstadt ist ein helikopterflug über kapstadt und die küstengebiete z.bsp clifton und camps bay. ich hatte das glück mit civair "" http://www.civair.co.za/ "" gebucht zu haben. ein ausgesprochen freundliches team hat mich empfangen und dann, obwohl die mitgebuchten reisenden kurzfristig abgesagt hatten, trotzdem den ""2oceanflug"" mit mir alleine durchgeführt. (normal sind 2personen minimum) es war ein ganz tolles erlebins - vor allem auch durch die interessanten erläuterungen des piloten. dieser flug ist ein super erlebnis, das man so schnell nicht vergessen wird. vielen dank civair. tip: zusammen mit der stadtrundfahrt im ""roten hop on - hop off bus"" buchen"
50,“mein Fovorit in Südafrika”,"Meine Lieblingsstadt in Südafrika, Strände, Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, Berge..... Viele schöne Lokale, gutes Essen, relativ sicher..Obwohl ich in Südafrika schon viel gereist bin, ist das meine Lieblingsstadt.Der Markt mit den vielen handwerklichen Dingen in der Innnenstadt (Green Market), sollte dazu genutzt werden möglichst viel zu kaufen, denn später habe ich keine so schönen Sachen mehr gesehen und habe mich dann geärgert (feilschen)"
50,“Toll!!!”,"War im Sommer bei der WM für drei Tage in Kapstadt. Mich hat die Stadt wirklich sehr beeindruckt. Am besten hat es mir am Tafelberg gefallen. Wir sind mit der Seilbahn nach oben gefahren und hatten einen wunderschönen Ausblick auf die Stadt und das Meer. Wenn man in Kapstadt ist, sollte man auf jeden Fall auch zum Kap der Guten Hoffnung fahren. Aber auch Robben Island darf man sich nicht entgehen lassen."
50,“vielleicht die schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Kapstadt ist sehr vielfältig, man kann tausend Dinge unternehmen. Zum Beispiel den Tafelberg besteigen oder am besten mit der Kabelbahn nach oben fahren und den atemberaubenden Ausblick genießen. Oder man geht ins TwoOcean Aquarium, dort lassen sich die Tiere des Indischen und des Atlantischen Ozeans bestaunen. Man kann aber auch einfach nur an der Waterfront entlang bummeln und vielleicht ins deutsche! Paulaner Bauhaus einkehren. Hier servieren farbige Mädels im Dirndel Weißwürste! Mulitkulti vom allerfeinsten!"
40,“Wunderbare Stadt”,"Eine sehr schöne Stadt im Süden Afrikas. Jedoch muss man vorsichtig sein, mir wurde die Kamera gestohlen.Tafelberg muss man von oben gesehen haben."
50,“Mein Favorit auf der Welt”,Kapstadt ist meine Lieblingsstadt auf der Welt. Die Lage ist einfach ein Traum. Umgeben von den Meeren gibt es viele Aussichtspunkte von denen man immer wieder einen fantastischen Blick auf die Stadt hat. Dabei ist der Tafelberg mein Favorit. Mein Tip: gegen Nachmittag herauffahren und dann den Sonnenuntergang abwarten. Dabei sollte man eine Flasche Sekt und ein paar Gläser dabei haben um dann beim Sonnenuntergang anstossen zu können. Ein Traum.
50,“Kapstadt - ein Erlebnis”,"Kapstadt ist eine Reise wert; die Aussicht vom Tafelberg, das Kap mit den beiden Ozeanen; die Tier-und Pflanzenwelt. Wenn man sich anpasst hat man keine Probleme mit der Kriminalität."
50,“Traumstadt”,"Kapstadt ist eine wahre Traumstadt. Der tiefblaue Himmel über dem Tafelberg, der Hafen, die Altstadt und die Victoria & Alfred Waterfront mit seinen Spitzenrestaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten suchen weltweit seines gleichen. Bei Regen lohnt ein Abstecher ins Aquarium. Einen traumhaften Blick kann man vom Tafelberg oder vom Signal Hill geniesen!"
50,“Die absolute schönste Stadt der Welt....”,"Die absolute schönste Stadt der Welt.... anders könnte ich Kapstadt nicht beschreiben. Ich war jetzt schon so oft dort, das ich mir kein schöneres Reiseziel vorstellen kann. Mann hat Kultur, Geschichte, Natur, Strände, Stadtleben, Nachtleben.... alles zusammen und das direkt am Kap. Beste Reisezeit: zwischen November und März. Mann sollte aber auch mal eine geführte Tour in die Townships machen (nicht alleine rein fahren!). Die Menschen sind super nett und offen, so wie dort habe ich es noch nirgend auf der Welt erlebt."
50,"“Südafrika,Kapstadt ein Muss”","Wir waren schon viele Male in Kapstadt,es zieht uns einfach immer wieder dorthin.Wenn wir ankommen, fahren wir als erstes an die sog.Waterfront,dann fühlen wir uns erst richtig angekommen.Hier gibt es ein tolles Einkaufszentrum mit vielen Läden, aber besonders schön ist die Aussenanlage mit den vielen Restaurants ,Bars,Shops etc.Hier kann man den Tag verbringen ,besonders schön ist es aber abends, wenn alles im Lichterglanz erstrahlt.Natürlich muss man unbedingt auf den Tafelberg.Ist nicht günstig,aber man wird durch den tollen Blick belohnt.Die Gondel dreht sich während der Fahrt,also Rundumpanorama.Schön ist es auch am Blaubergstrand,von wo man aus der Ferne einen wahnsinnigen Blick auf den Berg hat.Tagsüber kann man auch einen Ausflug in die Gegend machen, wo die Einheimischen wohnen,oder mit dem Auto v.d.Autobahn aus,die Slums sehen.Umliegend gibt es jede Menge toller Weingüter,unbedingt eine oder mehrere Weinproben machen und auch mal auf einem solchen übernachten.Es gibt noch vieles meht zu sehen, Kapstadt ist einfach mehrere Reisen wert."
50,“开普敦”,Cape Town位于非洲的最南端是南非的立法首都，其工业旅游业发达。以好望角和美丽的海岸线而闻名，走在城市里有置身欧洲的感觉。在这里你可以背靠“桌山”同时享受来自大西洋和印度洋的海风。
50,“Traumstadt am südlichsten Teil der Welt”,"Kapstadt mit seinen Vororten ist die schönste Stadt, die ich je gesehen habe. Als ich zum ersten Mal dort ankam, wußte ich sofort, dass ich wiederkommen wollte. Das ganz besondere Flair, was in dieser Stadt herrscht, kann man nicht beschreiben. Wer einmal auf den Tafelberg, der majestätisch über der Stadt thront, vom Bloubergstrand geschaut hat, wird diesen Anblick nie mehr vergessen. Die Einwohner sind von ihrer Herkunft bunt gewürfelt und das gibt der Stadt einen unglaublich internationalen Touch. Kapstadt ist immer eine Reise wert!"
50,“Traumhafte Stadt”,"Wir waren im März 2010 in Kapstadt. Von Deutschland aus buchten wir schon 2 Tage Stadt und Umgebungsfahrten. Es war einfach toll. Unser Führer zeigte uns alles Sehenswerte, auch abseits der Touris. Wir haben soviel gesehen und gehört über das Land und die Menschen. Kapstadt ist eine Reise wert - unbedingt ansehen."
50,“traumhaft !”,"ich habe direkt in der nähe vom hafen gewohnt. da ist alles fussläufig zu erreichen. die menschen sind alle total freundlich und hilfsbereit. nette lokale und viele aussgefallene geschäfte. allerdings sollte man abends vorsichtig sein, wo man hingeht. hier kann man durchaus 3 tage verbringen. unbedingt einen ausflug auf den tafelberg machen, allein die gondelfahrt (schweizer gondelsystem) ist atemberaubend.auch ein asflug zum kap der guten hoffnung als tagesausflug einplanen. einfach toll. daran denken, leihwagen mieten, und alle auf der linken strassenseite befahren. ist aber leichter als man denkt"
50,“die schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Morgens in Table View aufwachen, an den Strand laufen und ""Hello Mr. Mountain"" rufen, das ist Freiheit, das ist Glück!"
50,“TRAUMHAFTE Stadt”,Diese Stadt ist einfach sehenswert. Man hat auf der einen Seite das wunderschöne Meer und auf der anderen auch gleich tolle Weinberge.Das Hafengebiet ist sehr schön gestaltet und lädt zum bummeln ein. In jedem Fall einen Trip wert!!!
50,“Bunte Traumstadt an zwei Meeren”,"Capetown ist eine echte Herausforderung - allen Vorurteilen zu Trost bietet sie alles, was einen spannenden und abenteuerlichen Stadtaufenthalt besonders macht. Das Völkergemisch ist sehr bunt, die Restaurantszene super vielfältig, die Lage einfach traumhaft, das kulturelle Angebot überwätligend, die Verkehrssituation sehr europäisch-entspannt, ur das Linksfahren strengt den Deutschen an.Sehr schnell ist man an malerischen Stränden, wenngleich das Wasser zumeist eiskalt ist - die Sonne lacht! Die Menschen sind offen, freundlich, lachen und haben ihren Frieden. Wenngleich die Stadt von Townships belagert zu sein scheint - es ist ein Land im Wandel, das eine ist nicht besser als das andere. Beides hat auch für den Besucher seinen Reiz.Wir waren in einer Ferienwohnung von ganz ausgezeichntere Qualität in Camps Bay, super freundliche Landlords, sehr gute Betreuung, angenehmer Wohn- und Schlafkomfort - und preislich deutlich unter europäischem vergleichbaren Angebot.Die Stadt und ihre Umgebung sind absolut jedem empfehlbar, dem Alleinreisenden ebenso, wie der ganzen Family."
50,“Auch im südafrikanischem Winter ein Traum”,"War zum ersten Mal im Winter in Kapstadt - und kann nur sagen, dass das es auch zu dieser Jahreszeit ein Traum ist. Weniger Touristen - schönes angenehmes Reisewetter - einfach wunderbar.2 Tipps für 2 Locations die ich wirklich phantastisch fand:1. Le Grand - Traumrestaurant in- & outdoos. Einfach eine tolle Location mit viel Ambiente. 2. Hausbrand Gelateria Espresso Bar - für wirklich guten Espresso und herrliches Eis - beides in Capetown in dieser Spietzenqualität nicht leicht zu finden."
50,“Kapstadt - ein Tag im Hafenviertel an der Waterfront”,"Kapstadt - eigentlich fällt einem da sofort der Tafelberg ein. Den muss man natürlich unbedingt besuchen und einen Tag dafür einplanen. Aber eine Stadt in der Stadt bildet für mich die Victoria & Albert Waterfront mit ihren vielen kleinen und größeren Geschäften, in denen alles nur Erdenkliche angeboten wird. In zahlreichen Restaurants und Cafes kann man herrlich entspannen und sich erholen. Wer Fischgerichte liebt, ist hier besonders gut aufgehoben: Fangfrisch werden zahlreiche Köstlichkeiten angeboten. Und für Unterhaltung sorgen viele ""Künstler"", mit Musik, Akrobatik und anderem vergeht die Zeit wie im Flug. Nicht vergessen, die anderen Besucher zu beobachten, das allein lohnt schon einen Besuch.,"
50,“Verliebt in Kapstadt”,"Eine schönere Stadt haben wir noch nicht kennengelernt. Sie bietet immer wieder den nötigen Stoff um mehrere Wochen hier zu verbringen. Die traumhafte Kapregion, das Weinanbaugebiet um Stellenbosch, der Westcoast Nationalpark und natürlich ihre Metropole Kapstadt zieht uns immer wieder dorthin. Langeweile kommt hier nicht auf. Eine gute Küche mit ausgezeichneten Weinen trägt dazu bei, dass sich dieses Stückchen Erde von anderen abzuhebt."
40,“Top Destination mit vielen Facetten”,"Kapstadt ist wohl die Stadt, die in keinem Südafrika-Urlaub fehlen darf. Der Aufenthalt dort ist sehr facetten- und abwechslungsreich, da man hier viele interessante Touren, Tagesausflüge und Besichtigungen machen kann, die sowohl die kleinen als auch die großen Gäste begeistern. Dazu gehört das bunte Treiben an der Waterfront, das Two Oceans Aquarium, eine Fahrt auf den Tafelberg, ein Ausflug zur Robben-Insel, der Botanische Garten und natürlich das nahegelegene „Kap der guten Hoffnung“. Bei unserem Aufenthalt haben wir sowohl in Hotel der Protea Hotel Gruppe, als auch dem Radisson Blu (unmittelbar an der Waterfront) übernachtet. Vom Protea Hotel President hatten wir einen tollen Blick auf den Indischen Ozean (sogar mit Pool auf dem Hoteldach). Vom Radisson Blu hat man einen hervorragenden Blick auf den Sonnenuntergang im Atlantischen Ozean. Wir waren mit beiden Hotels sehr zufrieden. Mit etwas Glück kann man in den nahe gelegenen Ufergewässern schon Buckelwale beobachten, ohne auf eine der angebotenen „Whale Watching Touren“ gehen zu müssen. Kulturell interessierte kommen in mehr als 10 verschiedenen Museen auf ihre Kosten. In Kapstadt ist halt für jeden etwas dabei."
50,“Kapstadt immer eine Reise wert”,"Diesmal war ich waehrend der suedafrikanischen Wintermonate in Kapstadt. Es gibt bereits soviel Berichte ueber Kapstadt, doch mir gefaellt es im Winter fast noch besser als im Sommer. Sicherlich sind Regentage dazwischen, aber meistens Sonne und tagsueber mehr als 20 Grad. Wenig Wind ein traumhaftes Licht und keine Reservierungen notwendig fuer Restaurants.Meine Favoriten sind.Best Guesthouse 2inn1 OrangenzichtBest Gelato ICEZEIT in Seapoint PavillionBest Restaurant Il Leone GreenpointBest Coffee Hausbrandt in Waterkant StreetBest Winefarm Delaire between Stellenbosch and Franschoek"
50,“Schöne Tage am Kap der Guten Hoffnung”,"In Kapstadt - so wie in ganz Südafrika - herrscht Linksverkehr. Beherrscht wird die Stadt durch den Tafelberg, eine großartige Kulisse, auf die ein Gondelverkehr hinaufführt. Einmal oben, liegt dir die Stadt zu Füßen - die Küstenlinie, Robben Island, wo Nelson Mandela 18 Jahre lang in der prallen Sonne Steine klopfte, und natürlich Cape Point, das Kap der Guten Hoffnung. Auf der Fahrt zum Kap passiert man eine Straußenfarm, wo sich ein Stop unbedingt lohnt. Am Kap blasen dann frische Winde, der Platz ist traumhaft schön. In Kapstadt und Umgebung haben viele Reiche - so z.B. Elton John - sich ein Winterdomizil geschaffen, denn natürlich ist hier Sommer, wenn Europa und Amerika im Winter liegen. Es gibt viel zu sehen in Kapstadt - neben den landschaftlichen Reizen gibt es schöne Strände mit kalten und teilweise haiverseuchten Gewässern, eine Vielzahl historischer, kolonialer Gebäude, Parks und Straßenzüge. An der Victoria & Alfred Waterfront findet man neben Souvenirs und Mode auch hochkarätige Diamanten und Gold, beides im Hinterland geschürft. Im Hinterland liegt aber auch Stellenbosch, wo hervorragende Weine der Region dekantiert und verkostet werden können. Und eine Autostunde entfernt, liegt Gansbaai, von wo aus die Schiffe mit den Stahlkäfigen für Wagemutige starten, die dann zu Wasser gelassen werden und - mit etwas Glück - große weisse Haie aus nächster Nähe aus dem Käfig heraus beobachten können. Etwas für starke Nerven, aber ein unvergessliches Erlebnis!"
50,“Die Perle Südafrikas”,"Kapstadt - diese Stadt ist wirklich die Perle Südafrikas! Wenn man sie vom Tafelberg aus überblickt, wie sie da am Meer liegt oder wenn man auf dem Signal Hill mit einer Flasche des hervorragenden südafrikanischen Weins dem Sonnenuntergang über Cape Town zusieht, dann weiss man, dass man angekommen ist, an einem der schönsten Plätze Afrikas. Die Stadt selbst ist traumhaft schön (aber auch gefährlich, spezielle wegen der rasenden Autos, aber leider auch, weil viele Menschen hier immer noch erschreckend arm sind und daher aus reiner Not Überfälle geschehen), die Waterfront muss man besuchen, aber man sollte auch durch die Stadt ansonsten fahren/spazieren - es gibt soooooo viel zu sehen."
40,“cape town”,"südafrika, das land meiner träume :)schon als kleines kind habe ich schon immer davon geträumt eines tages nach südafrika zu fliegen und mich dort in kapstadt aufzuhalten, und ich muss wirklich sagen, das träumen und warten hat sicht gelohnt! Kapstadt ist eine wunderschöne, ringsum von hügeln umrundete großstadt....zwar gibt es sehr viele kontraste in dieser stadt, zwischen schwarz und weiß, reich und arm, erfolgreich und erfolglos.....doch diese stadt ist einfach einmalig, der tafelberg, ein einmalig schöner berg im direkten umland von kapstadt, genauso wie das kap der guten hoffnung sind alleine schon einen besuch in südafrika wert!"
50,“Europa in Afrika”,"Geile Stadt! Meine Erwartungen wurden deutlich übertroffen. Ich hätte mit nie vorstellen können, dass es in Afrika eine so sauberen Ort giebt, der die Sauberkeit in Deutschlad noch übertrifft. Einzigartiger Wein und Super Restaurants runden den durchweg positiven Eindruck ab."
50,“Die Perle Südafrikas”,"Kapstadt mit super tollen Stränden, dem Tafelberg sehr leckeres Esssen vor allem Steaks, Natur pur um die Stadt, viele Sehenswürdigkeiten, kaltes Wasser, mega Weine und viele bunt gemischte Menschen."
50,“mein Favorit auf dieser welt...”,"ein traum...diese kulisse, diese atmosphäre, die menschen alles ein traum...bevor ich dort hin flog sagte jeder ""oh die kriminalität usw. sei so schlimm in cape town!!!""also ich weiß nicht wo die leute alle waren???ich habe nichts mitbekommen und wurde auch nicht überfallen oder so, eher im gegenteil...alles super nette menschen...wenn man weiß wie man sich zu benehmen hat und das auch befolgt dann hat man auch keine probleme...ich war mit sicherheit nicht zum letzten mal in capetown..."
50,“Eine Stadt mit Flair und Charme”,"Diese Stadt ist voller pulsierendem Leben. Es gibt viele interessante Sehenswürdigkeiten. Den Green Market sollte man unbedingt besucht haben (1 Tag sollte eingeplant werden). Die Long Street bei Nacht, ein Muss für Jung u. Alt. Waterfront und Tafelberg ein einmaliges Erlebnis. Mein favorisiertes Restaurant an der Waterfront ist Fishermens Friend oder Quay 4. Natürlich darf ein Ausflug zu Blue Peter oder Hout Bay nicht im Programm ausgelassen werden."
40,“Mein Favorit in Sued Afrika”,Kapstadt ist die wohl attrktivste Grossstadt in SA; sie verbindet die Leichtigkeit einer Stadt am Meer mit dem >Flair einer Großstadt. Tolle Kulturen treffen dort aufeinander
50,“治安は良好に思えた”,怖い怖いといわれる南ア。勇気を振り絞り一人で活動しましたが、特におかしな様子はありません。日本人にありがちな過剰な警戒でしょう。市内では黒人が多く利用する乗り合いバスにも乗りましたが、特に異常なし。夜道をぶらついたが襲われることもなかった。
40,“the place to see”,"diese stadt und die gesamte umgebung dieser stadt ist einfach unglaublich und ein MUSS für jeden SA Touristen. in einem umkreis von 150 km berge, das meer, unberührte natur, berge, steppe, -. . . und überall freundliche menschen.viel spaß in der stadt in der provinc."
50,“Eine Sehenswürdikeit von Südafri¨ka.”,Cape Town ist eine besondere Attraktion von Kapstadt. Der Indische Ozean und der Atlantik kommen am Cape Town zusammen. Die grossen Wellen sind ein Naturschauspiel das man nie vergisst. Kapstadt ist eine Sehenswürdigkeit. Vom Tafelberg kann man die ganze Stadt und Cape Town bewundern. Die Fahrt mit der sich drehenden Gondel ist ein besonderes Erlebnis.
50,“Was für eine Stadt”,"Eigentlich ist Kapstadt eine fast normale Stadt, aber nur eigentlich.Es gibt eine Innenstadt... ABER es ist das ganze ""drum herum"" was Kapstadt auszeichnet: die V&A Waterfront, der Tafelberg, die Pinguine bei Boulders Beach, die Kaphalbinsel, Robben Island und und und. Man muß Kapstadt einfach besuchen, um zu verstehen, warum sie auch Mother City genannt wird!"
50,"“Die Stadt für alle, die viel Abwechslung brauchen”","Ganz egal, was Sie suchen, Kapstadt hat für jeden mehr als nur etwas zu bieten! Angefangen von jeder Menge Kultur, Sehenswürdigkeiten und einer einzigartigen Multi-kulti-Gesellschaft über unzählige Naturschönheiten bis hin zur sportlichen Hochburg inklusive unterschiedlichster Adrenalinkicks; Kapstadt lässt keine Wünsche offen. Auch kulinarisch handelt es sich bei der Stadt am Tafelberg nicht um einen Nebenschauplatz. Die Auswahl an einheimischer oder internationaler Küche ist unersättlich und in den Cocktailbars mit Blick auf den Atlantischen Ozean lässt es sich sowohl vor als auch nach dem Gaumenschmaus verweilen. Die Clubkultur der pulsierenden Stadt am Ende Afrikas ist familiär, kann dennoch mit allen möglichen Stilrichtungen trumpfen. Unterkünfte finden sich je nach Gusto vom günstigen - aber dennoch sauberen und komfortablem - Backpacker bis zur Luxusresidenz mit Spa und allen Extras, die das Herz begehrt. Ganz egal, ob man mitten in Geschehen oder ein bisschen Abseits in der Natur residieren möchte. Von Kapstadt aus, lassen sich viele Ausflugsziele mit dem Auto in kürzester Zeit erreichen. Ob man nun in einigen wenigen Tagen nur die Highlights besichtigen möchte oder während einiger Wochen das Now-Now-Feeling der freundlichen und geselligen Südafrikaner auskostet ist jedem selbst überlassen, so oder so, ist diese Stadt eine Reise wert. Wer noch ein bisschen mehr Zeit hat, sollte sich weitere Naturspektakel in ganz Südafrika wie z.B. die Drakensberge, den Krügerpark etc. auch nicht entgehen lassen."
50,“Kirstenbosch”,der schönste Botanische Garten der Welt. Wunderschöne Wanderungen auf den Tafelberg möglich.
30,“Schönste Stadt Südafrikas”,"Die Stadt ist wunderschön gelegen am Meer mit dem Tafelberg. Man kann schöne Spaziergänge an der Waterfront unternehmen, wo es traumhafte Restaurants uns Bars gibt. Mit einem Boot nach Robben Ireland fahen ist auf alle Fälle zu empfehlen. Der Tafelberg ein Muss an schönen Tagen mit dem Überblick über ganz Kapstadt und einer einmaligen Seilbahnfahrt. Wir haben uns zu jeder Zeit sicher gefühlt und hatten wunderschöne 3 Tage."
50,“Kapstadt - Traumstadt”,"Kapstadt - lange habe ich von ihr gehört, gelesen, im TV gesehen, der Mutterstadt in Südafrika. Dann, 2004, überwand ich mich, warf die Vorurteile hinsichtlich Sicherheit über Bord und- verliebte mich in diese Stadt am Kap. Die Freundlichkeit der Menschen dort, die Lebendigkeit der Stadt, Longstreet und Waterfront, Camps Bay und die Weingüter Stellenboschs, ich könnte jetzt stundenlang schwärmen. Fest steht, im nächsten Januar bi ich wieder dort."
