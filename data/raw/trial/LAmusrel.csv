50,Interesting Experience!,"Interesting experience of people and couples showing their worldwide and interntional stories about their relationships, thir stories, their bad and good moments. also it shows some items and letters of past broken relationships and you can as well tell your good and bad stories. nice souvenirs to collect at the end.",Philip N
40,Change of pace on Hollywood Boulevard,"We decided to check out this museum based on Tripadvisor reviews. The museum is filled with artifacts coupled with narratives about relationships that ended or failed. I read almost every display. Many were touching. A few were funny. Overall, the museum was a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of all that surrounds it and is worth a visit.",PaddleWarrior
30,An Experience,"I have wanted to go to the Museum of Broken Relationships ever since I heard about it! I was so excited when they opened one up in Los Angeles. The museum was interesting, but I was underwhelmed (probably given how excited I was for it in the first place). It is an interesting place and if the idea of reading about past loves interests you I am sure you will enjoy it",Rachel L
40,Relevant but it's definitely for the broken heart,"We purchased admission for 2 via Groupon. I do not recall the price.  However, it was a savings via getting it on the official website. This is a very interesting concept. My husband and I went together...  which was my idea. The space is sad in my opinion by relevant for someone that is in a unhappy space of their courting staging or marriage. This is a  excursion we could have passed on but it was a must see.. to see the submissions from ALL walks of life that suffered from the same cancer, a broken heart.",Rayn N
50,A Museum for Everyone,"I fell in love with the concept of this museum years ago when it was traveling from the original in Croatia-- and I am now thrilled that we have another permanent museum here in Los Angeles! This museum offers people a unique experience to sympathize with anonymous people who have donated their break up artifacts from relationships past. It allows oneself to reflect and think about things you could donate from your own life too. Dont forget to check out the confessional under the staircase before you leave, wow!",megan m
50,"A Special Place. I laughed, I Cried.","Living in Hollywood has made me a bit colder as a person over the years. In some ways I've become desensitized to heartbreak. On the news, on the streets, in my own personal life, it's everything. I think for a while I lost touch with my ability to empathize blindly and stay open to the world despite all the risk exposing your heart entails.Then, I injured my head in a theatre performance and fell down-and-out. The experience quickly revealed who cared about me. Who had my back and who didn't. During my recovery, I walked into the Museum and went through an emotional journey that led me through the often harrowing tales of other hearts who brought me both to laughter and tears. Instead of enabling me to wallow any further, the experience propelled me to want to put my heart out there again, further than ever before, and leave my injury behind more fearless than I've ever been in matters of vulnerability and the heart. The Museum was a reminder that THIS is what makes us human. That through heartbreak comes immense growth!I loved everything about the Museum. It may be pricier, but I will carry priceless wisdom away from it and into time. The Museum is clean, stunningly decorated, sunny, and interactive too. It is a treat flipping through the confessional and even contributing to one, honest exhibit. I found the staff to be endearing, helpful, and encouraging, and the experience as a whole gave a warm-fuzzy, homey feeling. I cannot wait to return on my next self-love days and see all the relics in forthcoming rotations! And I would also encourage everyone to check out the gift shop. I saw a great many quirky, bitter and sweet gifts that my loved ones would get a big kick out of.What a very special place.",kristykrabpizza
50,The most universal experience,"Going through I thought it was going to be sad, but it was really rewarding and uplifting to see other people from all over the world felt the way I had in the past. I left feeling emboldened to make new stories of my own!",hydeordie
10,Nothing to see,"This museum is a small room with cheap junkyard sale type items on exhibition. It is the worst paid-for museum I have ever been to. Admission is $18 per person and parking nearby is not cheap. Don't go there, you will regret it.",Fiona A
30,I love the concept of the museum but....,"I visited the museum after seeing it on tv. Upon entering, two young ladies were busy talking behind the counter and had absolutely no interaction with me what so ever except to take my money.The museum is set up well and easy to navigate. Lots of reading FYI. I didn't see any accommodations for hearing impaired or wheelchair however.The museum gets it's point across well, but here is my question/suggestion:I thought the entire conception of the museum was people sharing their stories. I also thought that the concept was interaction. I understand you have the ""sharing"" area, but what I think is needed, is take one of the girls (or someone) interacting in that area at all times. I saw many people wanting to write and share their experience, but not quite secure in doing that. If the purpose is to read others experiences, that were shared to get into the museum, and the museum want others to share their experiences BUT, why isn't there someone at that station to facilitate that experience??? If I was there and employees dropped the ball, please contact me for a refund.",Pamela H
50,On the boulevard of broken dreams...,"I recognize that this sounds very campy and cloying but it is neither. It is both artifact & poetry. Found it to be a great place of contemplation & reverie. Some are hilarious, others are poignant & heartbreaking. And you can chronicle your own.",Suanne S
50,"Unusual, and that's a good thing","Not a typical museum, but in a way still a typical museum. Thought-provoking, touching, creative and memorable. Isn't that what you want in a museum? Not appropriate for kids. For everyone else on the planet... you should go.",Daniel J
50,Brilliant,"The kids new about this from Twitter but it has been on NPR as well. Beautiful, well displayed, well done museum. Items from break ups, divorce, death or fractured family relationships. Glad we did it.",Connie F
30,Expensive,Good idea but $15 feels very expensive for such a small museum. Better to spend your money in the cool gift shop instead.,Wombling_Free_7548
40,Tragically Funny,"Don't be discouraged by the name of this attraction. You can find just as many laughs as you can tears here. Yes it's born of broken relationships, but all stories don't bear heartbreak. Some inspire (a break-up letter to her stoner self), some intrigue (secret fantasies about relationships that never were), and some amuse (silk wedding dress stuffed into an old dill pickle jar). You can spend a lot of time reading detailed stories or breeze through the one-liners that say it all! Don't miss the ""Confessional"", where a guestbook is open to all to write re-tellings of their own broken relationships. One particularly moving missive is a farewell to a child never born. The gift shop has unique touching and amusing items at budget-friendly prices. And (as of this writing) every 3rd Tuesday of the month they host a live performance of actors, comedians and regular audience members telling their stories in a casual make-shift theater in the middle of the museum (ticket purchase required). Excellent way to spend an evening laughing or crying. Your choice!",kim r
50,You can feel your heart breaking here,"Everyone has experienced a broken relationship which makes a trip to this museum more poignant. Don't miss the weeding dress in a jar. The stories of death, divorce, and estrangement make a visit a study in psychology and sociology. There is a confessional area with a scrapbook where you can leave a message. I would recommend better items in the gift shop like a cool t-shirt or some other product with a memorable logo to help the visitor remember the visit in a reflective way instead of a sad way.",Ustravelrt66
40,As good as the original,"Sweet, sad, and poignant stories about real life. Those items from relationships gone south that you just can't have in your possession anymore. Makes you think about people and things from your past and what it all means. Well done.",Tina K
50,Cool museum,"Got in for 15$ even though I couldn't show a student ID. Great pieces, some are very funny to read. There's also a book where evedy guest can rant or leave a comment about their (broken) relationships. It's really cool.",Sandro L
40,Loved it,"All the submissions were profound and I was honestly taken aback by how well written the explanations to the objects were (as in, most were v poetic). Must do a lot of reading though bc without reading descriptions the objects don't mean much",Michiko W
50,Brilliant,"This was a brilliant little museum - so personal, real, and amazingly honest.I highly recommend it - and a huge thank you to all the contributors. It's a truly incredible collection!",Rowena S
40,Had To See,"This was one of the few things I wanted to see while I was in LA on a brief visit to see a friend who has also been wanting to go. It was a bit of an emotional visit, so be prepared. The exhibits ran the gamut to sad, celebratory, and amusing. I was there with my husband as well and it certainly had me feeling grateful by the time we had seen all the exhibits.",Mary W
50,One of a Kind Museum,"Original, Unique, So Moving, Sad, Funny. We were blown away by how well done this is. Pace yourself as there is reading (each story of the broken relationship is presented in a short narrative as well as by an object) not to mention reflecting. Don't miss the booth in the back with the book where visitors make their own stories known.",AlanR27
40,Great concept!,"Stopped in to get a better understanding of this museum and found it quite interesting. If you'd like to see some of the many reasons relationships fail, this is your outlet. Those who choose to share their story are able to contribute something from the relationship and its significance to the dissolve. Ties in pretty well. Some pretty funny and others odd yet understandable.",S Remy M
50,Surprisingly good museum,Went into this museum with a so so feeling about it and surprisingly had a good time reading about these relationships. At first thought it was only boyfriend girlfriend but was different relationships too. Expect to spend at least an hour there's loads of reading.,coopervanning
30,Fun and Quirky museum,I heard about this on the news and wondered....well why not. Hollywood Blvd is the perfect location for this kind of museum. A good variety of different relationships that ended. Some notes were written better than others as you would expect. Most short term relationships than we were expected but still well done.,binkley007
20,Interesting concept but far too expensive,"Having read about the museum, we were interested in the concept and wanted to support a new creative initiative. We were really surprised by the price of a ticket - $18! It is a very small space and whilst there is are a lot of transcripts to read, the museum does not have a lot to it. It is shame that the price will prohibit many people who may be feeling heart-broken and lost themselves would genuinely find this a cathartic experience.",addictedtotravelz
50,Experience real human emotion in Hollywood,"I've been to the original museum in Zagreb, Croatia, and this one is just as good. Take some time out from the all the superficial glitz and glamour of L.A. and see real human stories and emotions. The museum has short stories of all kinds of broken relationships (most romantic relationships, but, other types as well) along with a memento of that relationship on display. All the stories are fascinating.... some sad, some funny, and some surprising. I'd plan on 60-90 minutes to go through and read everything. I think you'll be glad you did. I'm also happy that they have found a home in my neighborhood.",eurocarpaul
50,ABSOLUTE MUST SEE! SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE! AMAZING!,"WOW WOW WOW! This was not what I expected whatsoever, and I was completely surprised and totally blown away! Upon hearing of the museum's concept and it's name alone - one would think it might be depressing or just a random kitschy Hollywood Blvd. tourist grab. But this is a legitimate museum (one of the best in L.A., in my opinion) with beautifully curated exhibits, an awesome gift shop with fun gifts, a cool ""confessional"" area (that I had to keep circling back to, bc people never wanted to leave it!), and an overall truly unique space & immersive experience. HIGHLY recommended for everyone - friends, couples, families, or even solo - every single person will find an object or story they will relate to, and will come out of their visit really having experienced something moving. In a city as lonely as Los Angeles, this is one in place in all of L.A. where you don't feel quite as alone :)",NYLAEG
50,Must see museum on Hollywood Boulevard,"I visited this unique museum with my husband while we were visiting friends in LA. At first it seemed like a tongue in cheek exhibit of objects from failed relationships with funny stories to go with the items. But as you progress through the museum, the experience becomes much deeper and thought provoking. Be sure to read the stories attached to each item - some are light but some are heart wrenching. The museum represented to me the resiliency and courage of people and the ability to emerge stronger at the other end of a terminated relationship. I found the museum to be a meaningful experience and am so glad I went. I've been to many museums in my life but this one is unique. Take the time to leave the carnival atmosphere of Hollywood Boulevard and enjoy the open space, quiet and feelings of the Museum of Broken Relationships. Big thumbs up.",sally b
50,Not what you'd expect,"This is a great space right on Hollywood Blvd -- well lit and sharply laid out, and you feel like you're walking into an art gallery. Look a little closer, and all the exhibits tell a story about a relationship that's ended. Each exhibit comes with a written story -- some whimsical, some factual, some funny, some sad. It's interesting and cool and well worth a browse.",Brian C
50,Unique and intriguing,"It might not take you long to breeze through but you should take your time; it is well worth it. Fascinating pieces that must be appreciated by reading the backstory behind each one. This is not so much a museum about seeing things, but rather experiencing and visualizing the story behind each artifact.Eric",erich1328
50,Don't miss this unusual museum,"My husband and I visited this unusual museum on Hollywood Boulevard, in the old Frederick's of Hollywood building. It's well worth a visit. As the name of the museum indicates, it's about relationships of all types that have broken up for whatever reason. Each item in the collection has been contributed by someone with a story -- do take the time to read those stories accompanying each item on display. Some are amusing and some are heart wrenching. There is a lot of honesty on display here. We were lucky to have a chance to wander the museum with Alexa Hyde, the museum's director, who is clearly passionate about this project. Even though the objects and stories reflect a sad time in the lives of the people who donated them, there's also something hopeful about the fact they were ready to move on. I've been to many museums in my life but never one like this. Do go and enjoy.",Philip R
30,Is it ironic that this used to be the Frederick's of Hollywood Store and Museum???,"This is a totally LA concept for a Museum and Gift Shop.It is impossible to read the signage or look at their window displays without being drawn inside.Please feel confident that it is possible to survive the visit without needing to take antidepressants.Although you may feel some strong emotions, it is not all gloom and doom. There are some displays that will make you smile.Keep in mind... The price of admission is cheaper than the cost of an hour with a therapist.",Bryan B
50,Really enjoyable,"What a fantastic idea for a museum. Exhibits were funny, touching, heart-breaking, nostalgic, and evocative. And you would encounter something new on each visit, guaranteed. Well worth the visit, perhaps the highlight of my stay here in Hollywood.",Daniel J
50,Really Interesting and Unique Museum! Definitely Worth a visit!,"The Museum of Broken Relationships is a one-of-a-kind experience in LA. I was intrigued by the idea of the museum (items donated from people that symbolize some broken relationship in their life), but found the pieces to be more than I could have imagined. Every item was an insight into someone's life and with each item and its description, you found a little of your own experiences, some thing that resonated with you. I never would have expected to feel so much based on a small notecard explaining an otherwise unremarkable item that had been donated. Sometimes a few words were all you needed to understand exactly what the writer was thinking. Other times, the words left you desperately wanting to know how the story turned out.This was such an interesting and unique museum experience. I've recommended it to everyone I know. Definitely worth a visit whether you live in LA or if you're just visiting!",ji521
50,Definitely worth a visit!,"I looked forward to my visit to the museum and I was not disappointed. I was visiting Los Angeles from the East Coast and actually went to the museum twice. I was not able to see the entire exhibit because of an appointment. I saw most of the first floor the first visit and the rest the second. I found the exhibits beautifully presented and well organized. Each story resonated and contained universal truths. I enjoyed the space which is well lighted and rather beautiful. I did go to the confessional and wrote in the book. I read through the pages and enjoyed reading the entries - some humorous and some heartbreaking. I was moved to write about a very tragic incident in my life. It was actually a very cathartic experience for me. I left the museum feeling very gratified. I also did quite a bit of shopping in the gift shop, which has some really wonderful things. I definitely recommend a visit!",Janet H
50,Worth a visit! Unique and well done!,"If you find yourself in LA, definitely hit up this new museum which offers an amazing peek into people's ex-romantic lives. Well done and beautifully orchestrated, you'll totally relate to the exhibits, which range from out there to I've-been-there. Also, you'll be in the middle of Hollywood -- hit up the Roosevelt after for a much-needed drink!",Rina R
20,Would be better as an exhibit within another museum or was part of a package with other small museums.,"I remember seeing the opening featured on CBS Sunday Morning and I thought, ""I HAVE to check this out."" So when we stumbled across it during our Hollywood Walk of Fame, I insisted that we go. My husband opted out and waited in the lobby.At first it really was interesting. But shadow box after shadow box of people explaining away their relationship detritus started to get tedious quickly. Even though the space wasn't that huge, it felt like it was going to take forever to get through it all to ""get my money's worth.""I will say this: I liked the premise a lot. It reminds me of the book ""Letters of Note"" or ""Lists of Note."" There were gems with insightful, sad, and poignant stories. But that also became problematic in that you generally have to read a whole backstory on what you're looking at unless the objects are already interesting in themselves.However, unlike a book that you can put down and come back to, you don't have this option at the museum. You either force yourself to plow through and read backstory after backstory, or you eventually give up and hope that you're not missing something interesting because your eye got drawn to the object rather than the story.Plus, all backstories are not created equal. Both in the sense of not always being that interesting and in the sense that the authors weren't always that articulate.I definitely admire the curators attempts, but perhaps it would be more suitable as a show within another museum. Or I wouldn't have felt so disappointed if it had been part of a ""shared ticket"" with another small museum. Actually the curators maybe should have sorted the objects / stories in groups or themes so that it didn't end up being so overwhelming.",psyberhenry
40,Hold the Tears,"I had read about how this museum started, and wanted to see for myself what it is about.This is quite a unique museum whose collection is made up of donated objects representative of broken relationships. Each object has a story by its donor. Some are sad, some heartbreaking. Some will make you think of your own personal experiences. It is worth taking the time to read about the objects, otherwise it doesn't make sense. There is a confessional room where you can read, or write about your own situations. Interesting stuff.This is not a family attraction, children will may not like it, as so many of the topics are adult in nature. I saw several teens there, they amy walk away informed about what awaits them as they grow up...",Afazad
30,Fascinating and expensive.,My 22 was fascinated by the whole concept and enjoyed spending time looking at every display. My 20 year old and I could have lived without the experience. Interesting concept. I hope it keeps growing in size as I feel we definitely over paid.,Cindy
50,Unusual and fascinating museum!,Super interesting idea for a museum. Very well presented. Pleasant space. Very well curated. Fascinating look into the human psyche and into the nature of being human and the intricacies of our relationships. Highly recommended.,Catherine B
50,The Vibe of MOBR,"Hello AlexisGreat to see this new Museum! I was lucky enough to be at the Opening and feel the energy of compassion that we all have in common. Everything about the Museum looks fabulous and creates a safe unique environment in the space. The outside signage, impeccable stone, window treatment, branding, inside buildout, the variety of exhibits with presentation, and spirit of employees…makes for a gallery feel about relationships in a harmonious way.The vibe is fabulous!",Michael S
50,For something a little different...,"My 22 year old daughter and I ventured into Hollywood for the afternoon to check out this quirky museum after hearing a story on NPR about the original one, and it was worth the effort!Plan to spend about 1-1 1/2 hours going around the exhibits, which are fascinating/moving/odd/bizarre/funny/sad in no particular order.The fact that it's located on the wacky part of Hollywood Blvd (near the sidewalk stars, evangelicals on loud speakers, characters vying for attention and tourists galore) either contributes or detracts from the experience depending upon your mood. We found that fun, given that we'd just driven up from Long Beach for the afternoon, but I hope people visiting from other countries or middle America don't show up in that area and determine that that's what Californians are like!!",TrDCpr
50,A museum in Holllywood that encourages reflection and discussion.,"I visited the Museum of Broken Relationships with friends and hope to return again soon. The beautifully designed space respectfully and poignantly exhibits objects of love lost, and taps our own emotions as we read the stories of the donors. Objects are curated with reverence and artistry. The surprising takeaway is that each donation is part of the healing process and we feel both the loss and the release of pain vicariously. A visit to this compelling museum is a very special experience that no one should miss.",Artebella
50,"Poignant, funny, moving",Basically I visited the Museum of Broken Relationships because I had time to waste before going to the Airport and I really didn't realise how much I would enjoy it. An amazing idea with lots of interesting stories and items.In Hollywood where there seems to be a lot of fakery and this was an exhibit of genuine emotions. It was very moving and well worth a visit in my opinion.,Ains0808
50,"Beautiful, inspiring, thought provoking - a must see!","A voyeuristic delight for the senses. In a Facebook world, where all we display are the positive experiences, exotic vacations, loving friends, and supportive family members, it can be easy to feel depressed when surveying the golden hue of others’ lives. The Museum of Broken Relationships provides a welcome respite from that false projection of perfection. Here, we become one with others who have suffered heartbreak, regret, loss, and loneliness. The museum surrounds us with reminders that life’s imperfection is not to be hid, but can be shared with humor, grace, and even affection. Through the eyes of others’ painful, comical, and unexpected experiences, we are able to see our own failures in perspective, as part of one great whole that links us to every other person willing to candidly share their truth. As these souls find closure by sharing their souvenirs, we are reminded that closed doors make it possible for better windows to open, that owning up to our loss is necessary for meaningful gain, and that although some painful memories belong in the past, they light the way for a better future. As the box of matches available in the souvenir shop state, ""May the bridges I burn light the way."" I thank all those who have shared their intimate mementos and stories, for making me feel better able to release the weight of my own broken relationships.",TrampingAuntie
50,a must-see,"I went without expecting much - it was amazing. The layout was really great and didn't distract from the exhibition. It was a bit like reading a good novel - heartbreaking and inspiring. With a location in the heart of Hollywood, will definitely go back.",Blerta J
50,Interesting and unique!,"This is not your typical museum. It's new and fresh. The Museum of Broken Relationships is an incredibly interesting way to experience the range of emotions that accompany the end of a relationship. The exhibits range from sad to heartwarming. Some are strange, some are funny, others are fascinating. All are interesting. This place has captured personal, intimate stories and displayed them beautifully. Definitely worth checking out.",rdg0214
50,"Interesting concept, definitely worth visiting!",This was such a unique idea--very well done. Artifacts from relationships of all kinds with stories that speak to us all. A nice break from the craze of Hollywood outside!,Carrie W
50,"Stunning, Must See Museum","Incredibly unique and interesting museum. I was extremely moved by the pieces and stories, as well as the modern aesthetic of the property. A must see for anyone visiting LA!",jp3156
50,A must see in Hollywood,"Although once feculent, ground zero for Hollywood tourism is has made a decided turn for the better and there's no better example of the trend than the Museum of Broken Relationships. The build out of the physical space is museum quality in the literal sense, but what's truly impressive is the peek into the private, intimate moments of anonymous spouses, paramours, friends and, yes, enemies. You're likely to find mementos that will make you want to cry, laugh or perhaps celibate. Like the character Alex from ""Fatal Attraction"" (think Glenn Close), this museum Will Not Be Ignored. Go.",Spamriskemail
50,My new favorite museum.,"This is, by far, the most interesting and unique museum I have ever visited. As you can probably guess by the name of the museum, it's not your average collection of art. My girlfriend and I went this past weekend not knowing what to expect and were awestruck by how powerful the museum was.An assortment of (very) random objects, each piece includes a description of what the item is, the longevity of the relationship it was associated with, the location, and the story of its significance. Some of the stories are funny, some are sad, and some are a bit shocking. Across the vast spectrum, it is impossible to not relate to each one in some way. Many of the stories were amusing and even got some laughs out of us, but the vast majority really pull on your heart strings. Walking through the emotional journey with my girlfriend, we found ourselves holding each other’s hands tighter and walking more closely together as we read the more painful stories. This was something I didn’t expect – to have our relationship almost rejuvenated knowing that we never wanted ours to ‘break’ or put each other through any similar pain.It’s also very apparent that this is a way for many to let go of something they have been emotionally clinging onto, but could not bear the thought of that particular piece of their heart going into the trash…it seems this place provides a sense of solace for those not knowing where else to turn with their relational debris.Whether you are a local Angelino, or visiting LA and need an activity to add to the itinerary, I can’t recommend this museum enough. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen and it’s one of two places in the world where you can find it. The other being in Croatia.",eli811
