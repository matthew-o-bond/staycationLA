50,“Luxor tour”,"Hatshepsut temple, Luxor, Karnak, Valley of Kings..all was amazing. I don't care for the needless stops at the papyrus and alabaster shop which screamed ""commercial"". We weren't sure at first theater to embark on this trip, as we were worried about security as our small child travelled with us. But we felt completely safe and we noticed high level of security along the coast and on our way to Luxor. On the cost we noticed military presence, in small units spread all along the coast. Once we headed inland the roads got bad, but it was okey. Each village we entered had a check point upon entering and leaving. The village's local police patrolled the bus routs with guns. Luxor security was high. In Valley of kings you can't take pictures and it seemed that the surrounding hills were dotted with military patrols to protect tourists. I haven't noticed this level of security at the Hatshepsut temple though. The tour guides are very secretive about the history behind this high level of security. They prefer to to keep tourists in the dark. I expected some memorial for the vistims at the Hatshepsut temple but there was nothing. I very much enjoyed visiting Luxor and Karnak."
40,“Bargain n bargained”,"Be sure you have great bargaining skills over here. There are east bank and West Bank and only one bridge across river Nile . For full day in West Bank its upto 500LE but you have to press hard for the places and avoid waiting charges. East bank you can have taxi, horse cart, which we preferred over taxi as some money must go to the poor guys and horse which are keeping this place alive. For airport you can bargain between 50-70LE from downtown else 20-30 for city drop"
50,“The best experience of my life”,"Upon arriving in luxor, the weather was obviously the first thing we noticed, it was so hot! 45 degrees most days! We went on several trips in and around luxor, swimming in the nile, visiting temples and tombs. On one of our trips, we had the pleasure of having Yasmina as our tour guide, she was so lovely! Fluent in english and many other languages, she was so willing and full of information; she knew the answer to ever question.Luxor is so worth visiting, its like no other place, it has a bit of everything and really shows the culture of egypt! The people are so helpful and ever so nice. I would go back every year if i could!"
50,“The beauty of Luxor”,"I felt safer in Luxor than in my own city in the U.K. It is not the place to go if you want everything to be organised as in Europe, or if you want pristine cleanliness, modern facilities, perfect roads and London taxis. It is the place to go if you want to experience something different, where you might meet a camel or a stray donkey in the street, where strangers smile,wave and call out greetings or offer their services. Yes, they are suffering from the drop in the tourist trade and some are desperate for money, but 'No' is a simple word and is understood perfectly well. This was my second trip to Luxor and I would have no worries about going again. I love it."
50,“Highly recommended”,"We have just returned from a fantastic Nile Cruise on the Nile Vision booked via Orbital Travel, who I would highly recommend. Everything was very well organised from start to finish. Their local rep met us at the airport and organised visas and transportation. They also have an English Tour Manager, Peter; who accompanies you on the cruise and is there to make sure everything is OK. On board our cabin was light and spacious with a very comfortable bed, the food on board was good and the staff always had a ready smile.Our tour guide, Romany, was excellent. Not only was he extremely knowledgeable (all their guides are Egyptologists), enthusiastic, helpful but also a very nice guy. We felt very sad saying goodbye to him at the end of the cruise. It was my husband’s birthday whilst on the trip and the waiters sang and brought out a cake after dinner. The temples, and especially Valley of the Kings are amazing, and despite some early morning trips (we are not “morning” people!) we wouldn’t have missed any of them. We made some good friends amongst the other guests who we will keep in touch with.I want to stress that it is safe in Luxor. We were there during the latest problems in Cairo and were totally unaware of any disturbances anywhere on our trip, everywhere else was totally unaffected. Since the Arab Spring tourism is down dramatically in Egypt and I feel sorry for the locals who rely on tourism. People are afraid to go when there is no need to worry at all.After a busy week’s cruise we then had 5 days at Sofitel, Karnak chilling by their beautiful pool (all booked via Orbital Travel). They have really lovely gardens overlooking the Nile and the Sundowner bar is the place to watch the wonderful sunsets. It is very tranquil; I would not have wanted to be in a hotel in centre of Cairo as wanted total relaxation after the cruise."
50,“Excellent guided tours.”,"I visited Luxor in May 2012 with my 2 daughters for a week. I was a little worried beforehand as everyone looked at me as if I was mad to be going to Egypt but I needn't have worried we had a fantastic time.We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel which is in a fabulous location and the staff are really friendly and the food was great.One thing I would recommend you do is get yourself a tour guide. We hired Melad from Tours by locals.com and it was the best decision I made. You do get hassled by the locals, they are desperate for business right now, but having a local tour guide really helps and we felt safe at all times. There is so much to see in Luxor so it really helps to have someone with local knowledge to take you round.Go to Luxor, you won't regret it but make sure you visit Tours by Locals first and I have no hesitation in recommending Melad, he is knowledgeable and friendly and it could make all the difference to your holiday."
50,“LaRose Private Day Tours - Superb Service”,"I am a regular visitor to Luxor and whilst there like to visit the historical sites, both in the vicinity and further afield. I prefer to travel independently and alone instead of joining a coach trip. That way, I can avoid the side- stops at papyrus, alabaster and perfume factories and spend as much time as I wish at each place of interest.Although I have a taxi driver I always call upon for short trips, for excursions out of the city, local taxis are not meant to be used by foreign tourists, as they do not have the required permissions from the authorities. Instead, the advice is to hire a car with driver, who will arrange any paperwork necessary.On my last trip, I went to the street opposite Sonesta St George, El Rawda El Sharifa Street, to visit the company which usually arranges my excursions, only to find that they were no longer there. Spoilt for choice, as there are several such offices nearby, I compared what was on offer.I ended up arranging days out with LaRose Private Day Tours, run by a pleasant young man named Mahmoud Hussien. He speaks excellent English and was happy to spend as much time with me as I wished, discussing various itineraries, without any pressure to make a booking.I always use the services of local businesses as opposed to a UK tour operator, not only because of the extortionate prices charged by the likes of T.C. but so that my £s go into the Egyptian economy where it is badly needed. Even when compared to the other businesses in the same street, and with those operating from premises near the Winter Palace Hotel, Mahmoud’s prices were much lower.However, there was no question of providing an inferior service. On my visit to Gebel el-Silsila, El Kab and Edfu, I felt like royalty, being chauffeured in a ''limousine'' with suited driver. Apart from the monuments, which were breathtaking as usual, I was amazed by the guide, Khaled, who accompanied me for the day. He had a degree in Egyptology, unlike most guides who have a tourism qualification, and he was more than happy to share his knowledge with an enthusiastic amateur! At Edfu, he spent some considerable time translating the hieroglyphs, much to my delight. I took my time wandering around the monuments, with absolutely no pressure to move on. It was a wonderful, if exhausting day out and excellent value.I am already planning my next trip and hope to arrange a visit to the Cairo area and possibly one of the oases, again, using the services of LaRose. Mahmoud has also offered to arrange my hotel reservation in Luxor at a lower rate than I pay when using a UK based booking service, so I can heartily recommend him.Mahmoud can be contacted at mahmoud488@live.com and LaRose has a website."
20,“MS Jasmine Nile Cruise”,"BOAT was OK but not a lot of facilities or choice of drinks - red or white wine, whisky vodka and gin and local beer.FOOD was chicken, beef or fish every meal with salad and veggies and was always cooked to the highest standard and never disapointed.CREW was very attentive even more so if you tip at the beginning of the trip when they will go the extra mile to make sure you have excellent service.EXCURSIONS are well overpriced and beware of booking them all at the beginning as you will have no time to relax. Dont book Kom Ombo as its 10m from where you dock. Beware you will be taken to the Egyptologists favourite shops to buy gifts which will not be the cheapest as they have to give your guide his cut.CRUISE is centred around the excursions and not cruising down the Nile, which personally is what we went there to do. We were docked in Luxor for 4 days in total and did a lot of cruising at night;.FAGS buy them at the airport on your way home as they are $7 for 200 which is way cheaper than on the boat or in the shops.EGYPT from a womans point of view it is very intrusive and intimidating - they will stare - especially at your chest, shout things at you, repeatedly invade your space and touch and pull at you.IN SUMMARY going on a Nile Cruise is something i would recommend as the history, temples and views are amazing and willl stay with you forever however DO NOT TRUST THE LOCALS and CHECK YOUR ITINARY BEFORE YOU BOOK."

30,“14th Trip to Luxor”,"We have just got back from our 14th trip to Luxor. We fell in love with Luxor on our first trip, it really is a magical place. But at the moment Egypt has a very great shotage of tourist. 90 % of the inhabitants of Luxor rely on tourists for their livelyhood. This makes for an awful lot more hassel than usual. As we went into the bank to change money we had a very persistant taxi driver who we told very firmly that we did not need his services. Ten muinets later when we were walking around the town trying to look in shops this man chased us up the road insisting that we had agreed to use his taxi. How he thought we were going to look in shops from the back of his taxi I do not know. We did eventually get rid of him but it took us about twenty minutes and by this time we were not happy and had gone off the idea of shopping. On another occasion a carrige driver followed us down the road we were only five minutes walk from our hotel and were heading back. When we said we did not need a carrige he got quite abusive and asked me what was wrong with me and started shouting at me that I should spend my money. I told him that I was very happy to spend my money but on what I wanted to spend it on.We will be returning to Luxor as we love the place and are hopeing eventually to have an appartment there but at the moment it is not a very good time to make your first visit .Most of the people staying in our hotel were repeat visitors and everyone was saying the same thing. It has not put us off because we know how good Luxor can be . But if that had been our first trip we would have come away with a very bad view of Luxor.All of the locals are hopeing that once they have had their elections everything will get back to normal, we can only hope so.If you do go to Luxor in the next few months be prepared for a lot of hassle but don't let it ruin your whole holiday experiance. The Majority of people are friendly and helpfull and Luxor can be the best holiday in the world, why else would we have returned so many times. Just be prepared forwarned is forarmed !!"

50,“MS Monica - Nile Cruise”,"MS Monica - Nile Cruise - 23/03/11This cruise was certainly value for money as they really packed in every temple and tomb you can think of and a few other places for shopping etc.. Our guide, Safwat, was excellent and explained everything very well indeed. There is so much information to take in though and some booklets relating to each site would have been helpful. His English was perfect. He even personally took us to a good jewellery shop and spice shop.The boat itself is listed as 5 star but think it is more like a 3 star. The rooms were very comfortable and all had a little balcony though could do with a little TLC as some aspects were looking a little tired. However, the rooms were clean and you had clean towels twice a day, usually left in a lovely towel sculpture too.The food wasn't brilliant but to be honest I wasn't expecting a la carte. It started reasonably well but towards the end of the week the same foods were being served at every lunch and dinner, including a vegetable soup that seemed to be made of vegetable peelings!! Breakfasts were probably the best as long as you like eggs. There were waffles available which were lovely but for the last 3 days they ran out of maple syrup so you had to have them plain or with sugar syrup. The wine with dinner was watered down, not so bad if you drink white but not so good with the red! The coffee in the bars was very good. The beer also very drinkable and always served cold. There was hand sanitizer at the restaurant entrance but this was used by very few people. It ought to be more prominent in a buffet restaurant. I carried my own around and used it regularly, always use it after handling money as this is very dirty.The service was excellent. Our waiter, Mena, took the time to learn our names and remembered every day what we liked to drink. Every day when we returned to the boat from a trip there was a cool towel and a drink waiting for us. One evening we had a problem with an exploding bath drain (yes, exploding!) and they were at the room within minutes to fix it.The one point I think Orbital Travel need to do something about is on the last day the all inclusive finished at lunch time. This was fine for those who were leaving at lunch time but some of us were not leaving until mid afternoon and had to buy drinks (which were pretty expensive). I left a bottle of water with my jacket and bag at a table on deck while having lunch and they took the water away and then said I had to pay for another bottle!So, in all we enjoyed the trip thoroughly despite the food and the incident with the water. It is very good value for money in that most trips, food, drink, entertainment, accommodation, flights and transfers all included in the price. We've also kept in touch with Safwat and Mena. We would do the trip again but perhaps not for a few years.G & S Rees-Morgan"
30,“Ms Orchid/Jasmine - Nile Cruise - First Choice -”,"Booked to travel on the Jasmine but not sailing at the moment due to small amount of tourists going to Egypt. If you book a suite on the Jasmine you may not get the room you expect if you are transferred to the Orchid. The Orchid is very clean but realistically 3 star accommodation in need of refurbishment. The rooms are all furnished the same, if you upgrade the only difference will be the deck you are on and the size of the room. There is a free safe in the room. The bathrooms are good and the showers powerful. Food is plentiful, salads washed in bottled water which is very good - no tummy upsets on board -mainly beef, chicken and fish, good omlette chef in the morning. Bell rings for food and you are expected when the bell rings as crew eat after you. Small shop on board, fixed prices, good value and they will change money for you if they can. The pool on deck is good but might be crowded if the ship were full., loads of sunbeds very pleasant, excellent views of the Nile. The bar area is clean and comfortable and the service and measures generous. Staff are good and very friendly. Only 26 of us on board which was great as everyone was very pleasant and all got on very well. No daytime entertainment but a small selection of books behind the bar left by guests. Some evening entertainment -local. Organised trips are not cheap but would recommend going on selective trips as safer going with the tour operator. Some go very early so you might get very tired if you go on them all. If you go on the organised trips you will stop at a perfume shop or a picture shop or somewhere else, beware of the prices which are inflated, dont forget we are tourists and this shop is especially for us! We took the East and West Bank tours - Karnak temple and Luxor temple, West Bank valley of the Kings, Queens, Hatshepsut temple - which are a must really if you go to Luxor, not too far and is not too long. You can make your own way to Komombo as within sight of the ship when you dock.Tipping although when you book with First Choice states optional the First Choice rep made it clear that this is expected - asked to pay 300 egyptian pounds approx 33 pounds uk for the crew and 200 egyptian pounds approx 22 pounds uk for the egyptologist, per couple. Also 20 egyptian pounds 2.20 uk expected for each trip for the bus driver, we did give the full amount for the crew, and tipped personally at the end for individuals, also gave a tip for the egyptologist but not the amount asked as was disproportionate. The bus drivers could make a lot of money on the journeys, you can get a taxi locally for roughly the same price as the tip from the boat to Luxor. The toilet on the bus we had was extremely dirty and would not recommend using them. Our cruise was from Luxor to Aswan docked opposite the west bank views of the valley of the kings, stopping at Ensa - lock, very interesting, and Komumbo, local traders will hitch themselves alongside the boat for miles and you can haggle for their wares if you wish, they are friendly and it is fun to watch they throw things up and if you want to buy you throw the money back. Overall would say was a good experience, but very hot in May/June. Some very good deals if you book last minuite we found we paid a lot more than some of the other passengers who all had the same holiday. Would recommend the holiday but go with your eyes open as the culture is very different to our own.There are few tourists in luxor the moment, the most important advice is to be very careful, everyone expects a tip so take some us $1 dollar notes with you. At the airport the cost of a visa is 15 dollars or equivalent, suggest you take a 10 pound note as may be charged 15 pounds which is much more, ignore calls for tour operator visas and go to your left when you enter the terminal building. At the airport and sights there are men in the female toilets which we found inappropriate, expect tip for being there so take your own toilet tissue - we found there was usually no tissue in the toilets and did not want to use tissue which had been touched by someone else, they will tear some off a roll for you, for a price. When you get to the coach - very short distance - will have your bag loaded onto the coach they will expect a tip but you cant load them on yourselves, some tipped some did not - keep your hand luggage and valuables with you on the coach. You will need to tip when you get to the resort as you wont be able to carry your luggage onto the ship. Overwhelming attention everywhere especially at the valley of the kings you must be firm and ask them to leave you alone as they are very persistent, take small notes as they wont have any change if you decide to purchase anything, and they change the price they offer if you take hold of anything. Beware of armed guards with locals inside karnak and Luxor temples who invite you go with them to take pictures when the guide leaves, will expect money and can be quite intimidating. Horse and Carriage - Caleche - many of the animals are not well looked after and not recommended by the tour operator. Taxi's pay what you are happy with, usually price per taxi not per person and agree a price before you get in. There are local mini buses you can catch approx 10p per journey but not advised about this by the tour operator, we did not use them but might be an interesting experience . Only 3 tombs plus Tutankhamun's tomb open at the valley of the kings and an extra100 egyptian pounds- approx 10 pounds to go into Tutankhamun tomb which is really very small. Aswan has an excellent market but there are so few tourists there you will draw lots of attention, beware of people asking you to change coins they approach you as they cannot use 1 pound coins and may ask you to change them, be especially careful as can lose out on the exchange if not familiar wth the currency. May be approached to buy newspapers - old and may be different in the middle - may meet lots of people off your boat - chef - waiter - but not really off your boat - always take out the smallest notes you can, there are banks in Luxor and Aswan we changed our notes at the bank into 5 egyptian pounds about 55p which are not available from banks in the uk, and if you lose some you dont lose too much. Take some pens, pencils, small notebooks, toiletries etc for the children if you can as they are expensive for the locals to buy and they are delighted if you have something to give them."
40,“Luxor awaits you”,"Luxor, an archaeological town where there are many historical sites to see, there is the famous Valley of the Kings, where the young Tutankhamun was buried, many more tombs are to be found here, including probably one of my favoutires, the tomb of the Nobles, where you can see daily life in Ancient Egypt, even to two little girls fighting by pulling each others hair over a grain of wheat!The best time to visit is between October and March, when the weather is cooler but pleasantly warm so viewing sites is not a case of finding a sheltered shady spot.The hotels make for a quiet oasis and I recommend The Sofitel, Karnak, it is a little far out from the centre of Luxor but its amenities make up for it, beautifully kept gardens and swimming pools, a motor launch to take you to town twice a day for free, there is also a free mini bus. The rooms are in ""arms"" of two floors, so with either a terrace overlooking the gardens or River Nile the views are worthwhile.There is no trouble here after the revolution, so if you come this Autumn there will be a warm welcome, you can combine sight seeing with relaxation, a fellucca ride along the River Nile at sunset, with the mountains in the distance. making a dramatic back drop.So much to do, so much to see, a holiday of a lifetime, in the Land of the Pharaohs"
50,“Beautiful Luxor”,"I have just come back from Egypt I had 2 week holiday. Spent 2 weeks in Luxor the weather was beautiful and so were the people the souks and markets are just magical the smells and the noise just wonderful lots of exciting things do do a see theValley Kings and Valley Queens Luxor Temple Karnak West Bank long leisurely boat trips down the nile either by water boat or Feleccu.Lots of nice resturants and hotels to grab Lunch or Dinner the food is very good and the egyptian people really go out of their way to help, and the children are so smiley.Egypt is such a wonderful exciting place you must experience the whole package Luxor Red Sea Dessert Cairo. Now is a really good time to go."
50,“Luxor is a safe. Go - you will never regret it.”,"My husband and I stayed in Luxor from5th - 8th March 2011. ( after which we went for a fantastic cruise on the Oberoi Philae).I had wanted to see Egypt’s historical sites all my life, as Egyptology always fascinates me and my earliest childhood memories were looking through my father’s small black and white photographs, taken while he lived there in the 30’s.My husband, however, hates heat and was worried about tummy upsets! ( have no fear, Egypt has a dry heat, and you don’t sweat, and there were no tummy upsets!) As it was my 60’s birthday and our 30th wedding anniversary, he had no choice but to take me there! I was not going to let a little political unrest stop me!I thoroughly researched which tour company was best and choose Eye of Horus Tours, run by Mohamed abd El-Hamid and his brother Ahmed Abdel Hamid, because of the many reviews from their satisfied customers.I knew exactly what I wanted to see and Mohamed answered my many questions in many e-mails, immediately and with great patience! We paid a small deposit on-line by Western Union transfer, which could not have been easier.I could not be more pleased by my choice.Ahmed Abdel Hamid took us to the iconic Karnac and Luxor Temples, the magnificent Temple of Hatshepsut, The Ramesseum (the mortuary temple of Egypt’s greatest Pharaoh, Ramesis II )The incredible paintings in The Tombs of the Nobles, to Karnac’s Sound & light Show, the Luxor Museum and Mummification Museum and to the inspiring Temple of Hathor at Dendera, where there is the only carving of Cleopatra 6th, with her son Caesarean, by Julius Ceasar.Ahmed answered all my questions, never sounded like he was giving a prepared speech about the history, and never left our side ( so we were not pestered by many ‘unofficial guides’ and sellers). He always choose a shady spot to tell us thing, not standing out in the blazing sun as other guides do. Many guides just give a prepared speech then tell you to wander round taking pictures yourself – but it would be nice to know what you are taking pictures of! Not Ahmed. He was always ready to suggest things, but never pushy. He negotiated for us when my husband wanted to buy a galybaya. Great to see a real professional in action, Ahmed!We were taken to meet local people, like Moses the felucca captain, who talked politics and philosophy with us whilst sailing down the ageless Nile, where time has seemed to stand still from biblical times. The calm and peace it evokes – those white sails in the sunset - is very hard to describe. You have to do it!Another Moses, with a roguish sense of humour, the jeweller across the road from the mosque in Luxor Temple, who made my husband cuff links in a design he had seen on the temple wall and made me a beautiful ankh, whilst plying us with mint tea or lemonade and telling us we could pick them up tomorrow! That would never happen in England!Everyone is hard working yet laid back; unhurried. they have time for each other (something lacking in western society)The ordinary people of Luxor may not have much money but they have time and courtesy and great welcoming smiles for you. ( It also does your relationship a lot of good, when complete strangers in the street look at you respectfully and say to your husband ‘You are a very lucky man’, as they go by!) The key to this, I am sure, is a long and cool kaftan and neat walking shoes! ( don’t do short shorts and low tops, girls – to middle easterners it looks like you are out in the street in your underwear!)We were asked so many times where we came from and there seemed a very real pleasure that tourists had still chosen to come, despite recent unrest.The only unrest ( if it can be called that) that I saw was a group of people outside the governancy offices protesting and being allowed in one at a time because their houses had been cleared to re-instate the great, long avenue of sphinxes stretching form Luxor to Karnac, and they were not getting the compensation exactly as promised. Which is understandable, anywhere.At all the ancient sites the army, who have an iconic protector role in Egypt, are in evidence. Usually one tank and polite young men with guns outside. They seem far too nice and polite to ever use them! Egypt values it’s tourists and wants to protect then, as it wants to protect it’s unique history.We went up to the Temple of Hathor at Dendera ( 1 ¼ hours by road), us, Ahmed and our driver. Do not miss this. Not just the beautiful painted carving still preserved at Dendera ( no wonder Julius Caesar was impressed!) but the agricultural scenes and scenes of daily life as you drive up all the way by the side of the Nile are wonderful. People in galybay’s bringing in the sugar cane crops, travelling by horse or donkey cart, washing their horses in the Nile to cool them down. We stopped at the army road blocks to show a special permission form Ahmed had got for us, so we could travel out of Luxor. If we were not to return for any reason, Ahmed told us, they would come looking for us! This is how well hey look after their tourists. They are not going to loose one! What other country can you say that about? This is as seriously as Egypt takes it’s tourist industry, which is crucial to it’s economy.Please come to Luxor. Why go to lie on a beach in a Red Sea resort – you can lie on the beach in Europe! Experience Luxor. It is a unique, breathtaking, out of the world experience and the people of Luxor need us. Luxor relies so heavily on the tourist trade, people have seen their income plummet because tourists are too afraid to travel. For example, at the wonderful Hilton Resort and Spa where we stayed it is usually 70% + full but was only 5% full!We literally had Karnack temple and the Valley of the Kings to ourselvesEveryone speaks English, they are extremely hospitable and Egyptians are famous throughout the Arab world for their sense of humour. The small, lovely, town of Luxor must have the largest collection of ancient sites on it’s doorstep, than anywhere else in the world. And I would recommend lying by a hotel pool, after the visits of the day, with the world’s greatest river in front of you and the lush palms, vegetation and wild life that it is famous for.Or smoke a hookah or have a glass of Omar Kyam local wine ( both white and red is great – and I am really hard to please!)Please let me reassure you, you will feel 110% safe and cared for, especially with Eye of Horus Tours.My husband asked me ‘Has it lived up to your expectation’? ( as I had such high expectations). ‘It’s exceeded them’, I said.‘Let’s come back’, he said.So, thank you Eye of Horus Tours for making this happen!We will be back to see luxor. I can’t wait!Regards,Linda & Andrew DaviesChristchurch, Dorset, England"
20,“Luxor-- BEWARE”,"Just returned from a weeks holiday in Luxor, and would just like to make people who are planning to go to be aware of what is happening.On the first night of our arrival we went in search of a money exchange as the hotel did not change money. As we were walking down the street a youth approached trying to sell us shawls. I had my rucksack on my back at the time. The youth kept draping the shawl over my shoulders and was very persistant. I told him I did not want a shawl and in the end shouted for him to go away, which he did .(but with all my money, phone and other items).If you need to change money this can be done at an ATM, notes in and Egytpian notes out,if only our hotel had told us that!The very next day while walking near Luxor Temple the very same thing happened this time selling papyrus paintings, only this tme we were more aware and this time he had tried to open the zip on the money belt, which was underneath a T shirt. Needless to say be very very careful, if it is very hard sell then they are up to something and the police advised us to push them away."
40,“Temples and tombs”,"07/03/11We visited Luxor post revolution but it felt very safe and we encountered no problems. The big attractions were very quiet which was great for us but I guess not so good for the Egyptian economy. You can get hasseled when you leave your hotel, by taxi drivers and the guys with horse and carriages but they will accept a polite but firm no thank you. Be prepared to bargin hard for fares.One of the highlights of our stay was an early morning balloon flight over the east bank and the Nile.Would recomend a visit.T& V. BoardCardiff South Wales."
50,“Luxor is Great!!!”,"We are now in Luxor. We took the overnight train. If you decide to do this dont plan on getting good sleep. Dont pay for the sleeping compartment, we were told you cant sleep there either. Just pay for first class and plan for a rough trip. Its safe, just bumpy. We saw a group of young adults who brought sleeping bags and just laid them out on the floor. They slept well. The joys of youth!!! Luxor is incredible!!! We have been to Luxor Temple, Karnak, and took a falucka (probably not spelled right) down the Nile. We love Luxor. Suggested travel tips.1) Nefertiti is a great budget hotel2) Write down the figure on a piece of paper that you agree to when negotiating price so there is no confusion. People tend to agree and try to say that they didnt after the fact.3) Sophara (probably spelled wrong) is great authentic Egyptian Restaurant. Feel free to Visit our Travel Blog. We are going around the world in 120 days at http://songofsongs711.blogspot.com/2011/03/rome-italy.html. We have not posted Egypt yet. But we will in two days"
20,“Sights a must see”,"Sound & light show at Karnak Temple is well worth it, fascinating insight into the history, make sure you wrap up as can get quite cold. Luxor Temple is also worth seeing still so much restoration needed. Luxir nuseum is worth a visit as it contains alot of what was found in the Tombs & Temples closed 3 to 4pm. The valley of the kings is well worth a visit although forget paying the extra to see Tutankamuns tomb as its not as good as other tombs. Be aware that local guards will constantly ask for money to show you parts that are closed off, decline & walk away. Queen Hapsheputs Temple is amazing and although you cannot go inside to look around its def not to be missed, be aware toilets dont always work. Habu Temple and Denderrah Temple are both worth a visit, Denderrah being larger and more to see, toilets here not always working either. Most of the tour companies do trips to all these places however the local water taxi & minibus contrary to advice is fine to use and cheap and they will get you around for a fraction of the price. Local guides can be found outside most attractions offering their services but their is great variation in qualifications & authenticity of info given so ask for credentials. I would recommend a guide as you miss so much otherwise. Biggest pain is constant hassle from locals trying to get you to purchase something & call to prayer which is deafening over loudspeakers waking you up at 5 every morning"
40,“Petra travel”,Very reliable local tour operator.strongly recommended.all the tour guides are excellent .
40,“Some tips and advice of how to get the best of Luxor”,"Stayed at the Nile Palace Hotel, nice hotel and value for money. Easy to walk to most of the historical sites such as Luxor Temple, Luxor Musuem, Tourist and Local markets and Karnak Temple.Check out from other tourists if you can, for recommendations like a taxi driver who would not rip you off but give reasonable prices to take you wherever you want. The locals are so obliging (for a price, of course) and they are very engaging and friendly to the point some may feel like being harrassed after a couple of days.Favourite phrases like 'where are you from? your name? horse carriage ride, taxi? Come and see, no hassle, no charge, one moment please, do not worry about the price, what you like?' are common as you try to walk to your destinations. It is safe in Luxor.Beware of smiling faces trying to entice you into parting with your monies probably with things you do not really needs. Remember the rule of engagement, if you want something, try and check out general prices (if you can!) and always bargain at least down to 25% and work up from there until you get the price you are happy to pay. Walk away if you do not get the price and do not feel bad or you will fall into the trap of eventually paying the price they want to wriggle out of you, because you just want to get out of the situation. Avoid eye contacts or engagement if you are walking and just say no or nothing. They will give up eventually and leave you. Do not feel bad as you will probably think you are being rude and end up risking being offensive.The locals are very charming and at the end of the day, as third world country, they would hope to make as much monies as possible from tourism. Do not be alarmed if you get asked for your pens, money (for using the toilets), even someone asked for the shirt stating it was a lovely colour and he would like it for a wedding he is attending! You may experience young childrens asking for money in tourist spots or asking for your drinks in your hand or even for half a apple!Putting that aside, the historical sites are amazing and definitely worth a visit. You must always negiotate and agreed a price before committing to a service. Prices are alway per taxi, boat ride and horse carriage ride, and not how many people.Example from Nile Palace (next to St Georges) to Karnak Temple is about 40 to 50 Egyt pounds and they wait for you. Round trip via taxi to Valley of the Kings, Queen, Nobles over the other side of the river can be negiotated for about 120 Egyt pounds. You can negiotate where and how long you want to have the service. We cross the river and had a taxi taking us to the historical sites as mentioned and pay 150 egyt pounds for two people. You may wish to give the driver a small tip, which in generally is expected but at your discretion.Do not be fooled into being taken to 'government market/s' which are in fact cost more than the local market. You will be told things are made in Egypt and you do not get hassled and half the price. We were led to believe this and eventually trying to get out of the situation, managed to pay only 10% of what was quoted as I refused to pay for the price they claimed it is best because I was so nice and they like my smile! Some may find this shopping experiences irriating and harrassed. Take it in strides as part of the experiences.As for food, there is plently and definitely for those who can not get away from your local English or Irish pubs wanting to watch football matches away from home, try the Kings Head or Murphy's which are quite easy to find opposite the Nile Palace hotel.Seven days and seven ways is very popular and highly recommended and brilliant for local fish and egyptian dishes. Staff are attentive but not overbearing and could not do enough for you. They are not far from KFC and Pizza Hut. Puddle Duck is another recommendation from other tourists. There are Korean and Japanese resturants as well if you dying for kimchi or sushi.Always buy water and do so at Arkwright which is like a european mart which has fixed and reasonable priced stuff. You may think that the local mart is cheaper, think again as we paid once 10 Egy pound for water and another time 5 Egy pound. At Arkwright, you pay only 3 EP. I bought a camera battery from a local shop who I knew was ripping me off but thought probably for a pound or two, at 70 EP when it was only sold for 30EP at Arkwright.All in all, this is not stopping us from visiting Egypt again as it forms part of the whole experiences in a different culture and way of life. Enjoy....................."
50,“luxor day trips and hotel”,"spent 11 days @Steingenberger hotel and have to rate it as one of the best overall hotel experience we have done in US/ Europe /Africa we opted to use luxor as a base and do day trtips instead of a nile cruise and were glad of the decision . Booked one day trip and arrivals w/Viator and then scoped out local deals. Good choice ,we found PetraLuxor travel (Ahmed Balal owner) not far from hotel and has the best local tours prices and service no haggle honest prices(this is not a shill,the service was that good)Took day trips to west bank/east bank dendara, adydos then w/Petra overnite to edfu,komo ubo,aswan,and Abu Simbel(not to be missed)Also spent 3 nites in cairo @Husa Pyramid(STAY anywhere else!)Have been to Cairo before @ Hilton Golf in Giza should- have gone back there very good resort"
50,“ms monica”,"Just returned from a cruise down the Nile on MS Monica. It was a wonderful experience. The boat was lovely and the staff were friendly, polite and helpful. Our guide Mena was very knowledgable and spoke excellent English. There were some early starts but it was better to visit the sites in the morning as it was cooler. The trip to Abu Simbel was well worth the journey although if done again we might fly. Food was good but little choice for vegetarians. Rooms were very comfortable if a little dated in deor. Everywhere on board was spotlessly clean. Would recommend this boat and the cruise."
40,"“Lots around, not quite the city I was expecting..”","We spent a few days in Luxor on a tour throughout the country. There was a lot of hype leading up to Luxor and perhaps that contributed to the bit of disappointment I felt when we arrived. It's not that Luxor was boring or a bad city - I guess I just had a different picture in my mind as to what the city was going to be like.We heard countless times about how Luxor was an 'open air musuem', meaning there was history around every corner. To be honest, I didn't see it. There were few monuments around the city and basically, it just resembled the rest of Egypt.That's not to say there wasn't lots to do. The city is full of things to see in the surrounding area including the very interesting Valley Of The Kings. You can definitely keep busy for a few days in Luxor. It just didn't seem to have the history on every corner as say, Rome, does.Luxor is also good for shopping - there is an extensive tourist market located in the centre of town. You can also check out the local market (same street, opposite direction) if you'd like a more authentic experience. Luxor is also good for eating - whether that be local food or international food.Overall, the city is fun and definitely worth visiting. There is tons of stuff to see and do. I was just expecting a more historic city, and not a typical Egyptian one."
50,"“The most amazing, friendly, ineresting place.”","Second time back to Luxor and it never fails to impress. Stayed at El Luxor hotel. Very nice, lovely cool pool and found all staff friendly and attentive. Aly the tourist manager was very helpful with any little niggles. Breakfast was superb, every taste catered for. I recommend the freshly cooked omlettes.Please try to explore Luxor by yourself. Karnak is a MUST. 990 acres of mind blowing history, the Hypostle Hall being the highlight. Everywhere you feel totally safe, yes you do get hasseled, that is part of the holiday. A polite 'no thank-you' always seemed to suffice.Use locals to take you to the sights. They are poor and rely on tourism for their income. To many trips are organised through the tour companies, they take their percentage and give the locals the bare minimum. We have now used Ahmed the Nubian(002013371340) for all our travel arrangements, whilst we are in Luxor. He owns a taxi and a felluca, he picks you up from the ferry and deals with all tickets to the tombs and temples. He will insist on you having tea with his wife and beautiful children back at his house! His hospitality and genuine friendliness helped make our holiday so special. He joined us for a couple of meals at the wonderful 'Africa' restuarant on the West Bank. He even phoned us in England to make sure we had arrived back safely!!I'm sure we will return next year and I urge anyone to try Luxor at least once. Now Easyjet fly there, we are hoping that the locals will benefit more as people will be more independant."
30,"“Major changes in Luxor, but at what cost.”","As many recent travellers will be aware, the City of Luxor is undergoing a major transformation. The avenue of ""The Sphinx"" running between Luxor and Karnak Temples is well underway and should be spectacular when completed. The dropping of the former Corniche to Nile Level has also commenced. Currently, these works are causing major road disruption, and from enquiries I have made it seems that the majority of the local population are against it.The idea I believe, is to turn Luxor into ""an open Museum"", but the danger of course in doing this is that it may well change the authentic nature of the area.I give the example of Savoy Street situated near the Mercure Hotel on the Corniche. Up to 4 years ago, this was an authentic bazaar, with a roof made of carpet material, and where the shopkeepers would hassle and haggle in the usual Egyptian way, it was always busy and vibrant. Now it is a concrete monstrosity where little trade appears to be done, and its character has completely gone!Certainly within the next 3 years there will be a complete transformation of the Corniche area, I assume to cope with the demand from tourism that the Egyptian Authorities perceive these changes will bring. I just hope that it works."
50,"“lovely town, see more of the real Egypt”",Ride the horse and carts at sunset through the markets that the locals use. See their homes and the people.Ride the hot air balloons over the Valley of the Kings. Explore the tombs in the valley of the Kings. The place feels safer than a larger city like Cairo. People are more friendly. It's pretty.
40,“The best city in Egypt”,"I visited Luxor as part of a Nile River cruise in August 2010. It was by far the best city from the entire trip which included Cairo, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Edfu to name a few. My favorite part was the Karnak temple. It was not as busy as Luxor temple and much bigger and interesting in my opinion. It was the easiest city to explore by foot with everything within a 30 minute walk including the Luxor Museum, Karnak Temple, a bazaar, and Luxor Temple. You will be followed continuously being offered a galesh (horse and carriage ride). A nice side excursion was the Luxor museum which had real mummies, many artifacts with thorough information boards in English (additionally, it was air conditioned!). I travelled as a 25 year old female with my mother and never felt unsafe. By far the best travel experience to date."
50,“Mine Visit”,"Just undertook a wonderful Nile cruise on the Nile Plaza from the 25th of August 2010 and then a lovely weeks stay in the Maritim Jolie.Booked the full package trip with Thompsons and wasnt disappointed.Thanks to Onsi our tour guide every temple was brought to life.Mind you if you didnt listen he would swat you!! The staff were superb and the food was excellent. Whilst there we celebrated our wedding anniversary and to our amazement the staff cooked us a beatiful cake and had us dancing whislt they sang and played the bongo drums with the fellow guests waving there napkins in the air.Met some fantastic folk on our dining table, Jonh,Dot,Sandra,Alan and Michael who we will endeavour to keep in touch with.Second week was spent at a more leisurely pace in the wonderful Jolie looking out at the Nile whilst swimming in the Infinity pool. Once again the staff were excellent and the breakfast was superb. Special mention to the singer in the Kings bar in the hotel.He tried his heart out and i have never cried so much when he did a rendition of Akon's I WANNA MAKE LOVE RIGHT NOW.Whilst on the second week we did an hot air ballon ride and went quad biking. A special mention must go to Ahmed Balal at Petra Luxor Travel.Whilst in Luxor i visited Centamin Egypt(company i own shares in) near Marsa Alam and organised the 700 km round trip over the internet with Ahmed(app £105 unbelievable included the driver and a people carrier for myself anfd the daughter).It probably seemed a risky undertaking but once in Luxor Ahmed arranged for a taxi to pick me up and showed me around his travel agents to meet his young sons and his staff.Unfortunately i could have saved myself a fortune on some of the trips organised by Thompsons but i booked the quad bikes later on in the week.During this week we met up with the folks on our table and Ahmed would kindly drop us back to our hotel free of charge.Minimally you should book the quads/ballon ride with Ahmed and have a look at all the other trips he can offer.If you are staying at Luxor and not doing the cruise then its a no brainer!!All in all one of the best holidays we have ever had"
50,“Fabulous Experience at Luxor-Aswan with Egypt Sparrow Tours”,"I'd like to thank you for a wonderful vacation , honestly I never expectedthe customer service level would reach that level professionalism .Luxor , Aswan trip was an amazing trip , and defiantly the guided tours youhave provided had a great impact to make this trip amazing by all means.I’m glad that I made the decision to make Luxor Aswan my holiday destination. and I’m sure inshalla it won’t be my last time , I’m looking forward forfuture trips with you as your hospitality level was impressive by all means.http://egyptsparrowtours.com"
50,“Sinbad Hot Air Balloons”,"We arranged this while in Luxor through a taxi driver.We took a boat to the other side of the Nile and then we rode the rest of the way by min-bus.Sinbad was very professional and safe. The pilot was great and the landing was soft and almost exactly on target. There was a guy that kept hinting towards a tip, but we just ignored him.I thought I would freak out because I hate heights, but I have to say the was the neatest experience flying over the valley. I loved it and wasn't scared at all!Beware, it is very hot in the balloon and surprisingly the coolest spot in the basket is closest to the center. You may want to put a cotton scarf and hat on to protect yourself from the heat blast. You will have to climb in and out of the basket which is at chest height as well."
50,“Honeymoon on a boat”,"We booked a twin centre holiday for our honeymoon in August, It was brilliant on the boat and could not ask for better service from the crew or the tour guide!! there was only 11 of us on the cruise so it was a bit special for us and we met a great couple there, we was given a table number at the start of the holiday and asked that we sit there all week with the couple,A word of advice... beware of the drinks, we went full board and drinks excluded, we spent £120 for two of us in a week"
40,“Luxury on the Nile”,"My wife and two girls (9 and 17) spent 6 nights on Alexander The Great. The quality of the boat and the service from the staff was exceptional. There were two issues that tarnished my view slightly.I thought i had paid for all inclusive (this has a different meaning out in Egypt) The only drinks that are included is Tea and coffee and squash during meals. Anything else like cola and any drinks outside the restaurant and you have to pay, and are quite expensive.The second problem after the 3rd day we all started getting ill with stomach problems. I think it was down to the air conditioning as soon as i spent any time in my room i started coughing unless i turned the aircon off.Other than this the food was Super - mainly buffet style, we had an egyption barbecue where we all had to dress up (really good fun) , and a couple of the evenings were AlaCarte.The ondeck pool was a must with the temperatures over 100 degrees.Our Tour Guide Yassa from Viking Travel was fantastic, explained the culture and took us through the sites in very good English."
50,“Great Tour Guide in Luxor”,"I visited Egypt in May 2010 with my daughter. We had a wonderful time. Usually when I travel I don't use a guide. I do my research before I go and prefer to be on my own. In Egypt, we did have guides. I found out how much I had been missing. In Luxor, we had the best guide of the trip. His name is Ahmed Hamada. He is also an Egyptologist. He was able to give us so much information and answer all our questions. I feel we would have missed out if we had not had him. He really takes care of you as he would his own family. He checked on things for us to make sure everything would go smoothly for the rest of our trip,even though we were not using his company. His email is mado372000@yahoo.com or hamadasa15@hotmail.com."
50,“Nile RIver Cruise on the Jaz Jubilee”,"In July of 2010, my wife, sister and I took a NIle river cruise on the Jaz Jubille. We booked with Memphis Tours online. It was a little scary booking a cruise online in a foreign country, but my worries were completely unfounded. I did my research and found good reviews for the Jaz Jubilee. I had heard some horror stories of dilapidated cruise ships.The Jaz Jubilee is a well maintained ship with kind and caring staff and decent food. Meals are served buffet style, but the decor is upscale and the public areas of the ship are well maintained.Memphis Tours were an absolute delight. They had a representative meet us at the train station in Cairo and sign the paperwork, give us our train and cruise tickets, loan us a ,mobile phone, and then wait with us to make sure we got on the train okay. When we arrived in Aswan, a representative was waiting and escorted us to an air conditioned van. We were driven to the ship where we checked in and met Sayed Selim, our English speaking guide. Sayed was knowledgeable and charming and took care of us in the extreme heat. We saw several interesting sights in Aswan, including Elephantine Island, the High Dam, and Philae, then saw Kom Umbu, Edfu Temple, on the way downriver to Luxor. At Luxor we enjoyed seeing Luxor Temple and Karnack.I would recommend Mamphis Tours in a heartbeat if you are looking for a low-stress way to see Upper Egypt. Sayed made us feel like friends and was always willing to answer our various questions. Upper Egypt in July is ridiculously hot, so we toured in the morning and then spent the afternoon in the air conditioned rooms or in the pool. My wife and sister thoroughly enjoyed their tour. Thanks Memphis Tours. Thanks Sayed."
50,“Aswan to Luxor Nile Cruise”,"My friends and I went on the Nile cruise from Aswan to Luxor the view was phenomenal. Our tour was arranged by Memphis travel group and our tour guide, Mr Islam gave us an excellent personalised tour bringing us to rare and unique places showing the true Egypt apart from the main tourists attractions. We were truly satisfied wit our trip and recommend Memphis and Mr Islam for this tour!"
50,“beautiful city”,"Egypt is just an amazing country, but just to go and see the pyramids is not enough, Luxor is perfect, Luxor temple, valley the queens and kings... i really recommend u to visit luxor, but be careful in august is really hot... 52Cps: take one day tour guide... so u can save yourself."
10,“Attention is not always a good thing!”,"I went last year with my fiance, it was our first holiday as a couple and we were very excited on the plane. We arrived at the Luxor airport and no less than 2 minutes after setting foot in the city we were approach by a polite gentleman who offered to carry our luggage on to the coach he said he was the driver, there was about 15 coaches waiting so we didn't think anything of it. He put our luggage on the coach then quickly turned around and held his hand out Yes he expected us to pay him for what we thought was a nice gesture. That was just the beginning all throughout the holiday every step we took we were bombarded by hasslers we even went to one of the temples and a police officer offered to take our picture so of course we thanked him I mean he was a police officer but no he took our picture then cornered us demanding money for him and a friend who didn't do anything. After this I was heart broken we felt helpless and spent most of our holiday in the hotel room counting down the days till we went home.We will never go back to egypt also we are getting married soon and are being very very careful and doing a lot of research for our honeymoon so we actually enjoy our time away."
50,"“Beautiful city, wonderful tour!”","Luxor was beautiful! We were there at the end of May 2010 and visited for 2 days before heading south towards Aswan through Edfu and Kom Ombo over a 5 day cruise.Our guide, Mosa Mahmoud, was wonderful and highly recommended. As a group of all females (mother and 2 daughters in their 20s), we felt safe and comfortable at all times. Mosa took us to Karnak and Luxor temples where we learned about their construction and discovery. We learned about the enormous columns at beautiful Karnak temple and the stories behind the hieroglyphics. Mosa clearly knew his stuff! Our visits were very informative and Mosa tied the sites to parts of Egyptian history he had taught us before - lots of effort to make sure we were remembering everything and making connections!!We attended the light show at Karnak temple which was hauntingly beautiful. We got to walk through the site as the show was narrated with different areas being highlighted as we went.We also stopped in the Valley of the Kings and got to see some tombs. Again, Mosa made sure we knew the history of the king in question and was sure to tell us what to look for when we entered (since the guides couldn't enter themselves).We stopped at Hatshepsut temple - another amazing place carved into the rock face. Definitely worth the climb up all the stairs to see the statues of the queen up close.Our only accommodation in Luxor was the cruise ship - Nile Sharms - which was perfectly adequate, but nothing exciting. It needed some modernizing inside as the decor was a bit dated (albeit comfortable). Meals were catered to the western guests with many ""plain"" options available. I personally would have liked some more authentic Egyptian fare though.The cruise itself is highly recommended. It was nice to sit on the top deck and watch the farmers in the fields, the grazing animals, and the kids splashing in the Nile. We had a few stops along the way when Mosa escorted us into town and through the temples. Edfu Temple, though not a favourite of our guide, was particularly beautiful before the crowds got in. Definitely worth getting up early to beat the heat and the people!A few side notes...We were surprised by all the tipping we had to do - EVERYONE got tipped for something. We had been warned before going to Egypt, but were still surprised at how often it was expected. Bring lots of small American bills!Go with a guide and look up Mosa Mahmoud if you possibly can. It was so helpful not only to have someone explaining the significance of the various sights, but also to take us through the crowds of vendors, advise us on ""fair"" prices, barter for us if necessary, etc. He even went back into town for us one night after the ship had docked to pick up some souvenirs we had meant to get earlier - definitely above and beyond and not something I would have wanted to do alone at night in the city! The peace of mind of having a guided trip through Egypt was well worth the extra cost."
50,“Nile cruise on the SS Magic II”,"My family and I have just arrived back from a cruise on the Nile.We travelled with Cosmos setting off from Manchester Airport on the 19th July for a seven day cruise to celebrate my birthday on the Nile.We flew out to Luxor from Manchester airport with Monarch Airlines. A comfortable 5½ hour flight, arriving in Luxor at 4.30pm (their time, two hours ahead of ours). A swift transfer from the airport via a coach and we were on our boat, the Magic Two.The ship is impressive, very clean, plenty of space over five decks, the top being the sun deck. The sun deck is the full length of the boat and complete with a welcome swimming pool and believe me, you will want a dip just to cool down. Some of the sun deck is covered so you can choose to be in the shade or the sun. There are plenty of sun lounges and seats for all.Our cabin was the same as all the others, a good size room with two single beds which were very comfortable. Plenty of wardrobe space and cupboards for clothing. There is no iron and you are not allowed to use a travel iron because of fire risks. You can ask the staff to iron anything at a small cost. One complete side of the room is glass so you could go to sleep or wake watching the Nile float by.The bathroom was large enough with all you need. The hair dryer is powerful enough to dry without any problems.The cabins are very clean and comfortable and cleaned twice a day whist you are out or in the dinning room..The whole staff on the boat and amazing. They are so friendly and can’t do enough for you. The chef in the dinning room works miracles, cooking up some lovely dishes. Each meal is a buffet and the choice is extensive for meat eaters and vegetarians. They offer English food and Egyptian. They offer a range of Egyptian breads with each meal. Try them all, they are lovely.If it is your birthday or a special occasion and they know about it in advance (tell your tour rep when booking your ho9liday) the Chef makes a special birthday cake and all the staff sing to you. The cake is then given to you. Another lovely touch. Very special.If you like a beer or wine etc, it is cheaper to bookall -inclusive as the drinks can be expensive otherwise.We had no problem with poorly tummy’s. The trick is to wash your hands before each meal and take alcohol cleansing gel with you. Use alcohol cleansing gel before each meal. Also use it after you handle their money and a number of times throughout the day. Only drink bottled water and wash your teeth in bottled water. Stay away from tap water, any food washed in tap water, ice cream made from water, that sort of thing. Common sense really and you will be fine.On board with you is a fully qualified Egyptologist who will take you on all the tours to the temples and explain the history of each. If you are very, very lucky, you will have Ernest. His knowledge is extensive and his love for his country’s history is infectious and he makes it so interesting he just draws you in. We never got tired of listening to him. He made the holiday.The trips out to the temples were all early starts to avoid the heat of the day and the crowds. There are so many wonderful trip to go on. A must to see is the trip to Abu Simble. For us this was not in the cost of the holiday but an extra. We choose to fly there and back, (a thirty minute flight each way ) to allow us to be there to see the sunrise at Abu Simble. Something to behold. To do it by coach it is 4½ hours each way and you miss the sunrise.As part of the excursions you visit markets and bazaars. This is an experience. The guide will advise you on what to expect and how to haggle but it is still and shock the first time you come face to face with the market holders. At first you feel like a piece of meat that has been thrown to the lions but you quickly learn how to say NO and how to haggle and get the best price. They expect you to haggle and enjoy it as much as you do. They key is to stay calm, don’t let them fluster you and stick to your price. If they don’t agree, walk away and they will call you back and if your price is fair you will get what you want.There are so many trips and all are an experience to treasure. All show you the real Egypt. This is not a holiday for those who like to sit on the beach and do nothing.Half-way through the week, after the evening meal , they hold a dance on the sun deck where you are encouraged to wear the local dress. This does not cost much and is cheaper bought from the markets rather than on board. It is a cracking night and lots of fun.The heat is full on and very dry. The temperatures are 45 degrees in the shade rising to 50 - 60 in the sun. While we were there it reached 52 degrees. You NEED you sun block and MUST drink plenty of water. When you can’t stand it anymore, the boat is air-conditioned and a lie down in your cabin will cool you down. One thing to say. There are no lifts on this boat so I can’t see how anyone disabled would manage if they can’t climb the stairs. Also they are stairs to and within the temples.We had never been to Egypt before but have now fallen in love with the people and its culture. It is so very different to the way we live here, but that is its beauty and fascination. I would recommend this holiday to anyone with an open mind and an eagerness to explore the world. I strongly recommend the Magic Two and all that work on it and I hope you are lucky enough to have Ernest show you around. If you have all that, you are in for a wonderful time."
50,“Amazing Trip”,"Multi holiday in Cario, Luxor and AswanBooked through Holistic Travel on web.Truly stunning scenary and such a wonderful locations.Right from start with Holistic travel, the Egyptian organiser was really helpful and made himself available for all my silly questions.They organised my boat trip, the visits to Aswan, Abu Simbel (don't miss this one) the Cario museum and even got me a take away pizza in Luxor.I have to admit that Egypt lives up to its name of being a spirtiual country. Everywhere is a place of antiquity and great energies surround you all the time. there was so much to see and do that by the end of the day I fell into bed and slept like a baby.The accomodation was very good and the service was excellent.The one bug bear is the copius amounts of people wanting to sell you something but the souks had so much that you just want to bring home with you.Can't wait to go back"
50,“History and Sunshine”,"Just returned from Luxor after our 21st time there. I get up early and go walking round the streets and the local markets see the locals buy there food for the day,never any hassel, Catch the local ferry over to the West bank and start your trip of the west bank there a lot better than going over the bridge.We always see something new to us even if its more than 4000 years old.one experence not to miss is tea in the Winter Palace, gents to wear long trousers and ladies dresses/ skirt and top as soon as you enter you are back in the 1920s.everyone finds there own special place to dine but try some others such as the Tudor Rose in the St. Joesph hotel, just down the street a South Shields lady as opened a tea room with home made scones very niceOver the road from the Sonesta St. George hotel,The Lantern (our choice) lovely staff and meals Debbie does wonders at lunch and dinnerSnobs just down the street from the Lantern very nice and friendly no drinks liecence but you can take your own in so buy acouple of bottles of wine at the duty free for your nights there.we have had only one bad experence with a restuarant and that was this time at PUDDLEDUCKS, the owner is rude as are the staff the table linen needed a good wash, as you enter and leave the air conditioning is leaking right over the door so you get a few drips.We will be returning again next year to walk the streets, sites,ride the river on a Felucca for half a day and dream of days gone bywhen"
50,“fantastic holiday people so friendly lots to see and experience”,we have stayed at the steinburger nile palace hotel 5 times its a first class hotel.The rooms are great the views over the valley of kings and the nile are fantastic. the resturants in the hotel are first class. Eating out is also great lots of resturants the puddleduck the jewel of the nile.The people are so friendly once you get over them pesturing you its great just say no and mean it and they leave you alone. The horse and cart rides are very good just set a price before you get on to them and stick tp it they try to get more out of you but just say no. Luxor Temple Karnak Temple are fantastic as is Luxor museum you are very safe and can walk anywhere without worrying.the hotel staff are great very helpful and polite you never have to open a door as they are always there to do it for you.We are defo going back as we love the hotel the staff and the people of Luxor
20,“LOVELY PLACE BUT SHAME EVERYONE OUT TO RIP YOU OFF”,"Luxor is Lovely the Winter Palace Hotel is a must sit in the gardens and buy a cool The Karnak temple day visit and evening Light show is amazing Check times for language of your choice, but don’t pay more than 20 Egyptian for a Kalish to get you there from the Winter Palace. The drivers argue a price before you get into a Kalish then when you arrive at destination always Via some gift souvenir shop they try to argue and rip you off for three times more, they get very aggressive. Only pay a third at most for anything you may see in the markets (very cheap, asda price No hassle cheaper than primark)The long embroidered dress robes they sell everywhere will cost you 100 Egyptian for 2. The Valley of the Kings is a must, go across on the local ferry about 6 Egyptian and then get a taxi who will stay with you all day taking you to tombs, Temples and statues for about 35 Egyptian Unfortunately everything you try to do will be a hassle even to trying to have a nice walk along the Nile Every one is trying to Rip you off and that is such a shame because Luxor and the sites are amazing Our Nile Cruise Boat the Kareem Palace was very good, small not posh a bit tired but the food excellent and not one bad stomach. The Chef and waiters were Lovely, The reception staff were a bit rude but we put it down to poor English (which should be better if on reception booking in English speaking people) The boat was predominately German which unfortunately meant fighting for sun beds as they would do the putting towels on sun beds"
20,“What a disappointment!”,"I don't really know what I'd expected of Luxor, but it wasn't this. With the amount of tourists that visit the town, one would think that there would at least be a part of the town that had been developed and modernised, but it was just a dump!I can only be thankful that our hotel was not in the town centre, as from the moment one steps on to the streets, there is nothing but hassle: ""Taxi, madam?"" (even when they've just seen you get OUT of a taxi!); beggars, touts that try to drag you off to shops in order to earn themselves a commission, and - worst of all - the caleche drivers.There was no shopping centre as such, and although I realise that some people enjoy haggling for goods, it soon becomes wearing, and - when you have no idea what things should really cost - you always end up getting ripped off.We did find some excellent, well-priced restaurants (in particular Lantern and Puddleducks), and there's a McDonalds, Pizza Hut and KFC if you fancy a snack.As a cultural centre, Luxor is very well placed. You have both Karnak and Luxor Temples in the town itself, and lots of other historical sites, including Valley of the Kings/Queens, Dendera Temple and Hatshepshut's Temple are very close by. The Luxor Museum is well worth a visit, but DO NOT waste your money on the Mummification Museum. It is literally one room with very little in the way of exhibits, but costs you about £5 each to get in.I highly recommend taking at least a one-day trip down the Nile (we did the Dendera cruise). A great way to relax and see a little of the countryside.Don't book tours with your travel company - you will pay well over the odds. Many sites can be visited via local taxi drivers, and Jolleys (next to the Winter Palace Hotel) offers a good, reliable service too.I'm glad that I went to Egypt once in my life, but don't think that I would ever think of going to Luxor again."
10,“Ritz Cruise Boat”,"We have just returned from a week on The Ritz , Nile Explorer sailing from Luxor. The rooms are small but ok, just. Almost 80% of the passengers were ill during the cruise. No help from the rep although tablets were sometimes available at reception at variable charges depending who was on duty. The cruise itself was enjoyable but this was spoilt by the illness onboard. Be prepared for stomach upsets.!!! The upside of this holiday was the trips, although expensive from the boat the tour guides were very good. Trips can be purchased cheaper shore side if you are based in a hotel for the 2nd week."
50,“best ever holiday”,May23rd-May30th 2010Just returned from a great time on Lady Carol nile cruise great boat and staff our tour guide was simply the best thank you Youseph(we called him Joseph) we were his FAMILY you made our holidayGreat group of people too .Linda & Dereck Cain
50,“Nile Cruise - Aswan to Luxor Egypt”,I just returned from a cruise on the Nile from Aswan to Luxor - the experience was something I will remember for the rest of my lifeOur tour guide Sayed Ahmed Selim was very good and well prepared and kept us laughing and entertained the whole timeOur guide was through Trip Advisor and I would use them again and I would request Sayed as a guide also
20,“Unpeaceful Luxor”,"Luxor was my least favorite city in Luxor. We were there in May 2010 and it was a low season. With 42% poverty, these tourist operators can't left us alone for at least 5 seconds.1. Arrived from Aswan and took a local ferry to West bank (where our hotel is). El-Nakhil hotel is awesome. From the moment we were dropped at the ferry, we had at least 5 peoples asking if we want private motorboat (don't pay more than LE5 to cross the river), taxi, carleche (horse carriage), felucca and even asking if we can tip them if they helped lifting the baggage. Paid LE1 for one way transfer per person. The ferry is cute. Very local and scenic. Short 5 mins cross the river.2. Tried to get few quotations on private taxi to Thebes. Our best price (and service) was given to a driver called Oscar. He picked us up at 8am and let us choose how many places we want to go in Thebes (west valley). We chose Valley of the Queens, Valley of the Kings, Medinet Habu and Hathepsut Temple. He dropped us and picked us up in a very nice and clean brand new car. He even had a nice MP5 that he played American sexy music video. He is the best part of the whole Luxor trip. We paid LE100 for 5 hours of his time. My husband gave him a tip but he refused to tell me how much. Oscar is a very great driver, respectable and fun!3. Valley of the Kings : you can only to 3 tombs (included in the price). We didn't pay more to visit Tutankhamum and Ramses VI. We chose Tomb of Ramses IX (6), Tomb of Ramses III (11) and Tomb of Tuthmosis III (34). Personally, the tuthmosis tomb was the most work to get in. You have to climb steep up and down stairs for not much painting and craving jobs. I was happy with Tomb 6 and 11.4. Medinet Habu : must go! I was surprise to see how much color and painting preserved on Medinet Habu. Probaby one one of the best temple I have seen.5. We skipped Carleche because the thought of negotiating with them was very annoying. We were being followed, asked, begged for carleche in every steps we took in Luxor. Leave us alone!6. Hired Oscar for Karnak temple, Luxor Temple and Luxor Museum for LE50 with no extra tip. Overal 3-4 hrs. He picked us up and wait for us. Love Luxor museum.6. We ate at Snack Time couple of times. Nice view but the food sucks. Oh, if you stay at West bank are, try to eat at Africa restaurant. Their fried eggplant is good but they charged service fee. Whatt??? We kinda trapped at that point but we paid unwillingly. The food is a bit expensive but that was the only time we convert everything to US Dollar so it didn't sound so expensive.7. Walked through their Sharia souks with no attention to buy anything. Some seller were so rude and said things like ""Come and buy here. You look like rubbish"" when we didn't do anything. We didn't meet many nice people in Luxor. It seemed that money influence the way they are behaving towards tourist.8. Walked at Corniche El Neil during sunset. What we need were just one peaceful walk but we got followed, begged and asked throught our ""peaceful walk"". Sad..9. Took a 18 hrs bus ride to Sharm el- sheikh because there were no ferry from Hurghada to Sharm el-Sheikh and no flight on that day either. Don't do this, people! the bus is so dirty and uncomfortable. We are backpackers but still we don't think that we should do it again! It was a nightmare!!!!Tips :1. You can use free clean WC (restroom) at tourist info centre (in front of railway station) when you are in downtown. AC zone too.2. Go for air con, nice taxi. You can find them at the front of Winter Place Hotel and negotiate.3. Bring umbrella when you go to Valley of the Kings and Queen. Trust me.Happy travelLynnemariposa"
40,“Nile Cruise”,"Have just returned from a week on the Nile Ritz and I have to say what a great week me and my husband had......despite both of us having the cursed 'Egypt tummy'.The boat was as expected (we were told not to expect a ship) and although looked a little tired in places was a good place to spend the week.The food was excellent, plenty of choice and plenty of it. The drinks were what you would expect on AI.The trips aren't included on this cruise and we found that they were a bit expensive but as you had no choice than to book through Thomsons you had to pay it. Having said that our giude Onsi was absolutely fantastic, we learnt so much about Egypt thanks to him. Sami our rep was also very good and always there when you needed him. In fact all the staff were great, the maitre de in the resaurant would ask every day if you wanted anything else instead of what was on the menu.The trips were excellent, albeit expensive (as mentioned above) however the Valley of the Kings and Karnak were worth every penny.Will return again in a few years...there are so many other places I want to see first...but would recommend it to anyone."
40,“MS Stephanie Nile Cruise”,"We returned from a Nile Cruise on the 3rd of May 2010 after a week aboard the MS Stephanie. The public areas are beautiful and so well tended. The cabins were big but are in need of refurbishment, but after being on board for a few hours you don't see the peeling paint and the cracked windows. The cabin stewart, Ibrahim, went the extra mile by surprising us every evening with cleverly folded towels depicting everything from swans to monkeys and we were even treated to a mummy sitting on our bed! The marvellous organisational skills of our tour manager Peter made all our excursions a treat without any hiccups. The tour guide Amir was exceptional in his knowledge making our visits interesting and bringing ancient Egypt alive for us. He is obviously very passionate about his subject. The meals on board were more than acceptable and because we decided to go All Inclusive we made sure we got our water for the next day the night before as the AI doesn't start until 11.30 am. All in all we had an amazing holiday aboard the MS Stephanie and would highly recommend this style holiday to anyone."
50,“Experience with the Buro Real Life Egypt (personal guide and chauffeur)”,"In February 2010 we visted Luxor.To make the excursions we wanted to have a private guide and chauffeur.In Holland I contacted buroreallifeegypt.com. They gave us several suggestions about what we could do.When we arrived at the airport our chauffeur Achmed was there punctually.And so every day at the time we had agreed they were there.They took us to the west Bank, Valley of the King,Oueens and Nobles. To the Karnak Temple and Luxor Tempel. Even to Dendara.We visted several Musea and the marked with them. We also had a Nile cruis to the Babana Island.They were very reliable and polite and we feld save with them.Our guide Achmed ( also called A) knew very much about the Ancient Egypt and told many good things at the excursions. We had a very nice stay in Luxor because of them. They made also a good price for us.So when you like to take a personal guide and chauffeur I recommend buroreallifeegypt.com.next year we will also take this buro. The have a internet site."
40,“great hospitality in luxor”,"I had been to egypt for the clasical tour about 17 days. the most memorable place is Luxor, not only with the good scenary but also the people i have met. Me and my friend were met by the tourguide ,Ehab, who has great knowledge about the local places and giving his best of work to make us an amazing tour."
40,“when in Luxor”,Luxor was wonderful but a bit of a hassle for two women traveling together. Get a nice hotel is my advice and then find the tour guide we had-a bit of hustle guy but intelligent and amusing AND knowledgeable about Karnak and the Valley of the kings and queens.His name is Ragab Mohamed Saber-phone (002) 0164571758 or (002) 0117194579-having someone guide you keeps a lot of hassle away-skip the alabaster factory however.Also-great shopping there but TONS of hassle-try the shop 'Habiba'which is between the Corniche and the main market street-It is a 'no bargain shop' owned by a nice Australian woman who does fair trade and promotes women's traditional crafts-and has the nicest stuff we foundKarnak was the most amazing place on our trip-I would go back in a heartbeat.
40,“Relaxing on the Nile - MS Monica Nile Cruise”,"Early March - took a 7-night nile cruise on the MS Monica. Booked through ClassicHolidays4U website. The Luxor-Aswan package included flights, airport transfers in Luxor, 12-excursions, English-speaking Egyptologist guide throughout and all-inclusive board - twin share. Tour groups managed under Orbital Travel.This review is limited to the MS Monica itself.It is classified as 5-star Deluxe boat. It is beautiful, the crew respectful and entertaining, amenities good.If given the choice at booking - I totally recommend All-Inclusive full board. I believe everyone on board took that option.Cabin room - I shared with a friend - twin room. It is a good size room (european standard), small bathroom and balcony (every room). There is the usual furniture - wardrobe, dressing table & mirror, TV (never needed to use), nightstand, hairdryer, towels, shampoo, writing stuff, safe box and life-jacket !! The beds were comfortable. The walls and ceiling are quite thin. You can hear your neighbours if they are loud. If your room faces the dock - it can be a bit noisy. Please do not be fooled by the pictures of the website - which depicts the Suite (I believe there are 2 on board). Some passengers were disappointed. Our room was only a couple of rooms from the entrance at 'ground level' - called mid-deck.There were 2 more decks of rooms above and a lower deck below - dining room, kitchen and a few rooms - only for crew & guides I believe. The entrance has a grand lobby and bar-lounge. The top most deck is the sundeck - which includes a small pool, small jacuzzi, plenty of sun lounges, seats under shades and a small bar. There is also a small shop (Bazaar) onboard - selling typical sourvenir, including galabaya, throw rug, jewellery.Mealtime - this is at set times. Although breakfast was a bit flexible as starting the day differs each day depending on Excursions. All were buffet-style except one night - which was sit-down service dinner (4-5 course). Breakfast - western style of cold cuts, cheese, cereal, a selection of bread & pastry, a few hot dishes (sausages, egg, tomato, potato) and omelette chef (making eggs to order). On the early trip to Abu Simbel (4am start) - we each had a generous breakfast bag - to have on the coachtrip. Lunch & Dinner - soup of the day, bread selection, salad bar, 8-9 hot dishes, rice or noodle and a briliant selection of dessert (local) and fruits. The food hot and plentyful & a sufficient selection (mind you - it is not a Vegas buffet). Afternoon tea - 3-4 afternoons when there were no excursions - pancakes, cake, biscuits. Everynight there was at least one celebration or another - birthday, anniversary etc. The crew made a big hoopla - presented a cake to each celebrant's table, sang and cheer - after dinner. Great !! On return from most excursions - at the Lobby met with cool towel and hot tea (temperature was hitting mid to high 30C by late morning). All inclusive is bottled water anytime (they definitely encourage you to take one on excursions), softdrinks and alcohol from 11:30 - 23:00 only. At the first meal - the table you choose will be your designated table for the rest of the trip and you get the same waiter. Ours was Mohammad - cheeky, friendly despite limited English. Our table of 12 got on really well.Onboard entertainment - 3-4 nights in the bar lounge. Dervish dancer/belly dancer; Nubian dancers; fun & games night & music night. The waiters and bartenders learn your choice of drinks very quickly. The towels in the rooms are change 2x a day - sometimes there is a surprise on return from excursion or dinner - towel sculpture.The onboard Bazaar is convenient. Got stamps there (stamps are overcharges everywhere - LE2.50 worth (for a postcard) charged upward of LE4 each. No chance to get to Post Office on the trip).General comments - Health & Safety is not a big priority in Egypt in general. We carried our individual life jacket from our room to each excursion that involved going on a small boat. Getting onboard the Monica from land and on 2x occasions transfer to smaller boats can be tricky if you have balance issue or not agile. At one point we climbed from the Monica onto the roof of a small boat then climb down narrow step to the sitting area below. However, crew and guides did look after everyone well - no one fell off !! The other clients onboard were mainly British, though there were some Americans, a handful of German (they were looked after by a German guide on a different tour programme) and a 'local' couple with a very young child. The whole group were fairly sensible - so no loud & late nights. I would not recommend having young children on board - whilst cruising the main doors were left opened without barriers - so could easily fall over.The boat is only on the move 3 days/nights in the whole week. The gentle pace is great to enjoy the changing scenery. The were lots of other boats - about a dozen or so pass us by each way. When docked - there can be 3 boats abreast - so on one occasion we had to walk through another boat to access land. The rest of the time we were next to land, with other boat passengers traversing our boat saying ' this one is better than ours' !!!Sadly one of our tablemate came down with a 'bug' and was unwell for most of the trip (the only person who got sick). The crew looked after her well, catered to her needs - special attention to her meals, had a doctor come on board at one point. Her travelling companions were singing the crew's praises. Overall - we all felt well-looked after.I would heartily recommend this boat and would love to go back at some point. I know I was worried and concerned as first time on a cruise and not sure what to expect. If you feel the same - don't worry - you will have a great time."
50,"“Luxor, Egypt. May 2010”","Had a wonderful time in Luxor, Egypt-May 2010.Stayed at the St Joseph Hotel opposite the Nile.The hotel & food was lovely. The staff very friendly.We visited a lovey English tea room a few doors down on St Joseph Street called The Tutti Fruitti Cafe. The staff, Christine (the owner), Lorraine, Ahmed (the strongman!), Hisham & Machmood were all great, very friendly & the food was to die for.Arkwrights, along the same street is also a English convenience store at cheap prices, very clean.Over all a great holiday. The only down side were the calesh drivers-a complete pain!!We went on a few trips. Our guide was punctual, polite & informative.The Fellahs Tent evening was fab.The weather was very hot. Not much shade out & about, espeially at the valley of the Kings & Queens.Look forward to visiting again."
10,“pollution”,Did not realise until visited Luxor last week how polluted it is.Arriving early evening I iwitnessed a huge black cloud of smog hanging over the town.It could be tasted and smelt.Looked like it was emitted from the cruise ships that churn out diesel day and night.Dreadfull sight.Totally spoils a wonderfull city.Goodness knows what it is doing to the worlds envronment.
10,“RIP OFF LUXOR”,We recently visited Luxor 5 April for 2 weeks which turned out to be 3 weeks due to Icelandic Volcano !95% of the people we met wanted to over charge for any or all purchases including taxi and horse and carriage rides even after agreeing a price we were told it was double the agreed amount when we protested about this a group of large men aproached us and then began to intimidate us till we paid the amount they wanted !As far as we were concerned there was only one Egyptian who we could trust and he is a guy we new as MR SMILEY owner of restaurant ( Smileys).He even bought us our last evening meal in his restaurant !!!
40,“MS Stepanie 12/4/10 1 week cruise that was extended”,"I have decided to rate my experience before the Icelandic volcano incident. We had a great time on the tours with our rep Ahmen who was a joy to listen to.He made the weeks tours enjoyable for both myself, husband and the teenage kids. The boat needs updating, but was adequate. We didn't spend much time onboard, too much to see. The food did get to be a little repetitive and all my family did come down with ""The Bug"" as did alot of others on the boat. We met the Orbital manager, Peter Barnett on the 1st day and we didn't see him again until what should have been our last day, Monday 19th April. He then stayed on that boat and later on the MS Monica with us until we managed to get our Monarch return flight on Friday 23rd. I am disapointed to say that when unusual situations occur, as it did at this time, then Orbital Traval can not deal with it in an honest and compassionate way. Co-op Travel will reimburse us most of our accomodation fee that Orbital Travel charged us,which is really good, but having to pay over £1 for 1/2 a litre of water after Orbital decided that they would not carry on with the all inclusive deal was extortionate, plus the boat manager would not allow us to bring on our own cheaper water from landside . For a family of 4 we needed at least 8 litres per day, in 40 degrees heat! Water is a necessity not a luxury.I understand how things work in the travel business and know that both the boat owners and Orbital Travel will be paid on contract from Co-op and the other travel companies for the week starting 19th April, when no pre-booked British holiday makers could make it over there. They also have taken payments from over 60 people who were originally on Ms Stephanie and stayed on the boat because they didn't have a clue of what else they could do, but stay on board until a flight arrived to get them home."
50,“Beau Soliel”,"A fortnight ago we came back from a weeks cruise along the nile (from Luxor to Aswan). If you have only dreamed of taking this trip YOU MUST make it happen, it is simply amazing. The temples and tombs that you will see and the intricate drawings and statues will make the hairs stand on the back of your neck. We went with Discover Egypt and they took care of our every need. We had just 16 in our group and a really great mix of people, our guide was very informative and brought to life Egypts past and present teaching us in a way that we will all remember for ever what we saw and experienced, yet it was as if it was a pleasure to share his countries secrets with us. Yasser was a star. Most of our trips were included in the very reasonable price, the boat was clean and tidy and the staff did their upmost to make our experience a good one, they could not have been more attentive and fun with our bedroom decorations each evening. The food catered for a general european diet and was the only thing we would have liked to have seen with more authentic options, there were also lots of dishes for vegetarians and they were happy to meet personal requests. This will be the best holiday you will ever have, a must is the baloon ride at the end, Abu Simbel by Coach and Luxor Museum in one of your afternoons off - and perhaps a delightful cocktail at the Winter Gardens....."
50,"“Cycling in Luxor, marvelous experience”","Luxor is an fantastic place to use a bicycle as means of transport and to Relax.If you are cycling on a bike, you will 'miss all the fun' of harrasment from calesh and taxi drivers... Also everything in Luxor is very close, and easy to do with a bicycle.In Luxor you have the Temple of Luxor & Karnak, but on the Westbank you have many Temple's and ancient sites, all you can visit by bicycle.Medinet Habo, Deir-El-Medina, Valley of the KIngs, Private tumbs of Qurna, Ramsesseum, Collossi of Memnon and many more. If you would want to see all of them, it would be about 15km.An important thing is to use the right equipment. And to receive te information you need. There are many places on the East & Westbank to rent bicycles. Till sunset normal prices for simple bicycles (without speedgears) will be approx. 20-30 EGP (about 3 Euro) to find bicycles with speedgears is more difficult.However, the streetkids, on the corners of the streets and especially on the Westbank of the Nile, will do their utmost to try to find more ways to take your money. Especially with the very cheap bikes... if something breaks, and it will in a couple of km, they will ask you to pay for it, ofcource they never fix it.For my self, I found a Dutch Bike Rental Shop in Sheraton street, next DHL office. They have misc. models of bikes, the budget bikes of 20-30EGP, bikes with speedgears 50EGP and Dutch 28"" imported bicycles for about 80EGP. All bikes are well maintained and the staff is well trained.Also they have a breakdown service, does something happen, just sent a txt message and they will be there in about 15 minutes to fix or change the bike. You need assistance to cross the Nile, Instead of the ferry, they will rent a motorboat, put your bikes inside, cross the Nile, put the bikes on the road, and without any (ferry) delay, you can start your adventure.I am no scout or something, but for sure you do not want to save 1 euro, and your bike breaks down in 35c in the desert. Just spent that extra Euro for great quality and service. Have a look on Internet for renting a bike in Luxor, and you will find them easy.Have fun!"
10,“A tarnished view of Egypt”,"This place is not the hassle capital of the world, it's the hasle capital of the universe.The touts are territorial and are every five metres to ensure that you receive the hassle continuously when you step outside the hotel to escape the touts and cheats inside.I would not be surprised if this place goes into terminal tourist decline very soon as everyone I met would not reccommend a visit.Scams and stealing abound even in straightforward transactions you would normally think of as scam free.A couple of days in Luxor is enough if you have to go, otherwise you are going to be worn down by the incessant hassle, dirt, heat, bad food and fleapit accommodation, even the 5 star.Corruption is rife and the tourist police totally ineffective, being bribed by touts constantly.I did not encounter an honest local anywhere, thus leaving me with a very tarnished view of Egypt.My advice, don't bother, just buy the DVD and visit Luxor at home"
50,“the land of civilizations”,It`s the land where the civilizations were begun
50,"“Christmas Day in Luxor, Egypt”","After a few days in Cairo, my daughter and I took the overnight train to Luxor. The best I can say about that trip is ""different."" The train was packed with other tourists, but my daughter and I were alone in our cabin. The evening meal was terrible....some sort of ""airline"" food that we couldn't identify and didn't want to eat. We went to the lounge bar briefly, but it was not particularly comfortable so we went back to our cabin. The steward had let the beds down for us and it certainly looked more comfortable. The beds were not bad and both of us got some sleep before we arrived in Luxor next morning. On the way home, we ate a big dinner before boarding the train and didn't even try the evening meal.Luxor is a small town that was very sleepy in the morning. Someone walked us to our hotle ""The Little Garden,"" which was about 5 minutes away from the station.The street in Luxor are mostly what we would call alleyways. Of course there are main streets, but a lot of shops and hotels are located off the main streets. The alleyways look a bit daunting, but it didn't take long to find our way around and we felt perfectly safe.The Little Garden was a charming bed and breakfast. The rooms were not luxurious and the sheets and blankets were threadbare but very clean. The hotel staff was very friendly and the food was good. We only stayed one night, but it was enough to feel very comfortable and well looked after. ( At $20.00 a night, it was a bargain.)We hired a car through the hotel and the driver took us to the Valley of the Kings, Queen Hatshepsut's Temple and the Temple of Karnak. At Karnak he left us to ourselves.Thye Valley of the Kings was not at all what I had expected. When we arrived, we were in the middle of sandy mountains and could not see where any of the tombs were. We quickly discovered that the entrances are not really visible until you are right on them. The entrance ticket gives you entrance to three tombs, and these vary evry day. You can enter other tombs for an additional price. There are no cameras allowed in the Valley, you're asked to check them in at the gate.After our claustrophobic panic attacks at the Great Pyramid at Giza, my daughter and I were both a little nervous about going into these tombs, but the experience was completely different.The entrances are wide and the tombs have high ceilings. It did get a little stuffy, but it was so worth it! The hieroglyphs are absolutely incredible and there was not the same crush of people as at Giza.It is hard to describe the majesty of Queen Hatshepsut's temple, it was so beautiful and so peaceful that we had a hard time leaving. Our driver had another appointment so we had to skip the Valley of the Queens's and go back to Luxor.The Temple of Karnak and the Temple of Luxor are again beyond description. They are so vast and so beautifully built that we spent the whole time in a state of wonderment. We saw the Temple of Luxor at night which made it even more breathtaking.Our experience with the Egyptian people was just as positive in Luxor as it had been in Cairo. They were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed ourselves very much."
50,“Visa Scam”,Just returned from another visit to Luxor. Thomas Cook and other travel companies continue to operate a visa scam. They charge their clients £13 for a visa which are readily available from the numerous bank kiosks in the arrivals area for £10. Also their charges for excursions were on average 300% more expensive than from the dozens of travel agencies within Luxor town.
50,“Awesome experience”,"Luxor can give you a really wonderful insight into the wonders of ancient Egypt. Don't miss the little Luxor museum which is a little gem. The temples of Karnak and Luxor are absolutely stunning, as is the West Bank and the tombs. Take a torch to help you on your way during the wonderful light and sounds shows in Luxor and Karnak. Make friends with a taxi driver and do the West Bank one site at a time in the early morning. The group tours do all the sites in one day and it can get exhausting and overwhelming. The taxis are cheap, reliable, and indispensible - agree a price in advance and you cannot go wrong."
50,“Egyptian Magic”,"We were on a Nile cruise Dec 2009, sailing from and returning to Luxor. It was an amazing holiday. We were blown away by the various temples we visited. Admittedly the cruise ship was rather dated and could have done with a refitt. However the staff were very helpful and friendly. One thing that any new visitor to Egypt should be made aware off is tipping - its the way of life there. We found that 5 Egyptian's was the average tip. ALWAYS haggle with street vendors/shop owners over the price and negotiate a price with taxi drivers etc BEFORE you set off (& make sure you know which currency you have agreed a price on!) If you have to answer a call of nature when out and about; have a few 1 Egyptians about you and Ladies take some extra tissues!We had a stunning holiday (especially once we had got used to haggling/tipping) and we will definitely go back again to visit all the places that we didn't have time to see first time round!Must do's in Luxor are Karnac/Luxor temples, the souk where you can haggle to your hearts content, and a ride in a hot air balloon - this was a fitting end to what was a wonderful week in Egypt."
20,“Problems with Taxi drivers/horse&carriages/sellers of anything.”,"Step out from your hotel or walk anywhere and the taxi drivers, horse carriages, or any-one selling anything will drive you mad. Visit the Temples and sights and they still want money from you. We went to The Valley of the Artisans, no photos allowed and had to leave our cameras with the security man. Went to get them back and he wanted money to return our cameras to us!!!! Needless to say, we didn't pay. Went to the museum, no photography allowed but the security guards tried to get us to take photos - for money in their hands! It really does spoil what would be a fabulous place to go to. We watched fights outside our hotel between taxi drivers then the same with the horse/carriage/drivers. You can't walk down a street because they pester you so much then ask for money. Even on our 2 hour Falloon (boat) trip on the Nile to see the sunset, we had 2 youngters each in their own boats rowing along side us for about 30 minutes shouting "" money, give us money, money, etc...""Lovely place but the locals need to back off."
50,“Luxor and Cairo Vist”,"Never having been to an African country before, we made our trip arrangements with some trepidation. But, once there, I found the people to be friendly and nice, the facilities and infrastructure quite good and honestly we had an amazing visit to this fascinating land.We stayed in Luxor at the Sofitel Karnak for 7 nights, as we were on a package deal through Thomas Cook. Overall experience was just fine, but this is definitely not a 5 star hotel. I would rate the facilities as being around 41/2 stars, but the rooms, service and food were about 3 and 1/2 stars. good value for money.Before leaving, I was in 2 minds as to whether to make all my bookings from here in the UK or to use one of the local travel agents in Egypt. Based on some research and reviews on the internet, I picked a local travel agent Ahmed Balal who has offices in Luxor to take care of all our local trips. On our first day he came to my hotel, picked me up and took me to his office, where in 2 hours we had set our travel plans. He also booked our Luxor-Cario-Luxor air tickets. He gave us a very competitive price and excellent service. I would highly recommend him for any reservations to be made in Egypt. We probably paid about 30-40% of prices quoted by travel agents in the UK.For all our trips in Egypt he provided us with a 15 seater Toyota, guide and driver. All his guides were excellent.We booked the following trips through him.1) 1 day trip to the Valley of the Kings, temple of Queen Hatshepsut, Colossi of Memmnon, Karnak Temple and Luxor temple. All amazing and a must see. At the end of the trip we asked to be taken to eat some local food. We ate some cochery (I am sure I am screwing up the name), shish kababs and falafal. It was excellent, and our total bill ws less than £10.2) Flight to Cario and back. We visited the Giza Pyramids, Sphinx, and the Egypt Museum. All amazing and a must see. The King Tut collection is amazing (out of this world)3) A one day trip to Aswan dam, along the way we stopped by at Edfu, Temple of Philae and Kom Ombu temple. Long day, but well worth it.Overall we had an excellent holiday in Egypt and would recommend it to one and all.Feel free to drop me a line if you want further feedback."
40,“Enjoy Luxor”,"We have just come back from a week at Luxor staying at the Nile Palace Hotel (excellent-see separate review). these are my recommendations for an enjoyable holiday:- Bring a lot of cash either LE or £ or Euro to change. Each site costs quite a bit and you can visit 3 in a day. As a family of 4 we got through quite a lot. V. expensive to use credit cards for cash.- Don't eat in the hotel, try the many local restaurants. We went to: Snobs, Maxine, Jewel of the Nile (all near hotel) and Sofra & El Kababgy in the centre. All cheap, great local food and no tummy problems- Go to the West Bank on your own ie ferry over and local West Bank taxi. We saw the Vally of the Kings, Hatshepsut and Medinet Habu temple. It cost us LE561(£70) for 4 adults compared to Thomsons trip at LE1568(£196). Maybe not as extensive and more hassle but much more fun than a cocooned bus.- Do not take the tourist train at the Valley of the Kings. It may only cost you 50p each way but it's only 200yards!- We went for a 2nd day to the West bank. This time we saw the Tombs of the Nobles and the Artisans. I enjoyed these tombs just as much as the Kings. But the Tombs of the Nobles has no map so you have to ask a local to tell you where the tombs are and of course they want a tip plus every tomb attendant wanted a tip.- Go for a day trip to Aswan, we went on the train. Good fun, slow but comfortable train. The 2 dams were rather disappointing. You can't stop easily at the Aswan dam and the High dam has a LE20 'visitor centre' which consists of 4 picture panels -rubbish. The unfinished obelisk quarry is worth a visit.- Don't miss out on Luxor Temple. In some ways I preferred it to Karnak- Luxor Museum worth a visit and Mummification Museum good but only one room. Both of these shut from 1-4pm but good places to go in the early evening.- I was very concerned about the amount of hassle before we went but just be firm and walk on. They do get the message."
20,“Lots of history/ Lots of problems”,"Although I never really fancied Egypt we boooked this as a last minute holiday and got a great deal. There are lots of things to see in and around Luxor including Valley of The Kings, Hatshipsu and Luxor Temple so if you like culture and history this is one for you. The downsides are hassel off the locals which is constant EVEN TO A POINT WHERE YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED AROUND and the food which is definitley below British hygeine standards. If you are thinking of visiting Luxor please be aware of the horse and carriage drivers they are out to rip you off. Also try an avoid getting into a taxi off the street and use a reputable taxi driver preferably recommended from your hotel."
50,“Explore Luxor”,"Firstly dont stay in your hotel and become a recluse. There is so much to do and experience you will miss out. The food outside of the hotels is much better quality and is much better value. Get out there and try Egyptian food it is really great and there is so much variety. I would recommend to eat at Sofra, The Oasis Cafe, Jamboree and the Metropolitan restaurants - all offer great food and great value. The cheapest place to find a beer is Sindbads (just behind the Luxor Temple) or The Kings Head which is still below average. I would highly recommend a Hot Air Balloon absolutely amazing and dont pay more than £60 (Thomas Cook charge £100 a rip off!) so be aware...The Valley of the Kings is a must, as is Karnak Temples and Luxor Temple. Explore Luxor and the town away from the main touristy bit as well as the west bank - Take a horseback ride through the sugar cane fields at sunset for £3.50 for an hour! Very safe and you see the REAL Luxor. Yes there is a certain amount of hassle but nowhere near as much as I expected and certainly a lot less than places such as The Gambia....Haggle your hardest cut there original price by over half and then even below that! I travelled there with another girl both of us mid-twenties we felt very safe walking alone and at night everywhere is lit up and beautiful - the Egyptians as a whole were very friendly and helpful....Luxor has so much to offer - a great place to learn, explore, walk, have fun, eat, drink and meet people...Amazing place."
20,"“Could be a nice place but be guarded, especially around the tour guides”","If you've ever dreamed of seeing Luxor and Karnak Temple it's well worth it however; get a guide who has legitimate references before setting off with them. If you don't you could end up in situations like we did and live to regret it. One thing that is not widely publicized is that you are told (not asked) to tip for everything over and above what you've already paid for - guides, drivers, porters, waiters, taking photos at sites, toilets and just because you're a tourist.The sad part is you might want to see these places soon because if the ""guards"" at the sites have anything to do with it not many will last. They will let you have access to restricted areas if you pay and probably within a few years the only thing you'll be able to do is walk behind barriers and pay for post card photos.Not everyone is like that but unfortunately the ones we came across were. Another note - If women travelling alone venture into this area be aware that you will be expected to defer to men so be prepared."
50,“luxor”,"Luxor (Arabic: الأقصر) is a city in southern Egypt. It has been called the ""world's greatest open-air museum"" and for good reason. Luxor is home to the ruins of Karnak Temple and Luxor Temple, as well as the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens and other monuments on the West Bank of the Nile. Modern Luxor stands on the site of the ancient city of Thebes, which drew visitors from all over the world even in ancient times. Today, Luxor has a population of about 150,000 and is a popular holiday destination. In addition to its own spectacular sights, Luxor makes an excellent base for touring Upper Egypt and as a starting or finishing point for Nile cruises."
10,“luxor review”,"i do not recommend luxor to anyone who wants to base their selves there for a stay unless you are connecting straight to the cruise boats from the airport.the place is dirty,smelly with half build buildings and you cant walk down the street without being pestered by the locals.there are no fixed prices on anything and being ripped off is very common place.there seems to be alot of single middle age western women holidaying so it has a seemingly sleazy content.it surely is a destination i wont be repeating."

50,“My favorite driver and guide in Luxor”,"If you 're in Luxor look for Hamdi Ebaid, great driver, honest, will haggle on your behalf and is very patient... He speaks great english and He knows where you can fnd the best falafel in town... Thank you Hamdi for being awsome!!!"
20,“Oh my ***. How much hassle can you tolerate?”,"Luxor is a great place to visit if you have even a passing interest in ancient history. Its like a giant movie set and restrictions on viewing the ruins are much less restrictive than they would be in the west.However... the locals are incredible. You cant walk so much as a single step without them trying to sell you something, over, and over, and over. They just dont give up. And when you do need a service you'll have to haggle over everything (price, currency, per-person or total price, extras etc etc) and still they will try and con you in some way (watch out for the favourite of giving a 50 pence note rather than a 50 pound note).Remove the locals and it woudl be great. I would recommend staying outside of the town or on a cruise boat so you can escape them at the end of the day.You can escape the madness by going to one of the hidden gem cafes on the west bank (take the ferry and head right(south))."
50,“great hotel”,"stayed at the nile palace in november.we found the hotel had a very freindly and warm atmosphere.the rooms were cleaned every day .we had a side facing nile view room.the sunsets over the nile were amazing.i have to say that i could not fault the hotel or staff in anyway ,the entire staff from cleaners to managemant make you feel really welcome.don't be put off by the hassel outside the hotel,just ignore the caleche drivers they arent worth bothering with.if you want to go to the west bank(valley of kings etc) or any temples i can reccomend a great taxi driverkaled hashem.just turn to the right directly outside the hotel and ask the taxi drivers for kaled they will contact him for you if hes not therekaled is very diastinctive hes a very thin guy about 5 ft7 and about 30.he will take you to the west bank for 1/2 a day for 100 egytian-10 quid.just make sure you agree the prices upfronthe's very relialable friendly and genuine. he will take to a resterraunt and come and pick you up no probs.so much cheaper and more fun to use a taxidriver like kaled for excursions than your tour company. kaled will take you everywhere.all the temples dendera 27 english quid(80 mile round trip)edfu temple same price. ask him to take you to a rural egyptain family house on the banks of the nile at sunset...real humbling experience.he will also take you to the off licenses for cheap spirits.please do eat outside the hotel ..good resteraunts include..jewl of the nile snobs, el hussein, el kerbagy, spices of india...all 3 of the hotels are good aswell but twice the price.please do go and walk the back steets of luxor they are so very safe. once you get off the corniche and away from the hotel into the back steets its great"
50,"“A month on the West Bank, Luxor,Egypt.”","I arrived at Luxor airport at night, hoping my emails had been understood and my new friend would be there to meet me--he was ! ! and drove me to one of his flats by the Nile. It was warm, there was tea and milk and coffee waiting, my bag was brought in and he left, wishing me a good nights sleep. I woke at 6.30. opened the patio doors and had coffee and left-over Egyptair cake for breakfast, watching the sun rise over Luxor Temple and the small boats going slowly over the Nile. Another world, and one I was really enjoying. My landlord, Abdou Rasuul, came later with money changed for me, I met my houseman,Debis, who was an enormous help and went into Luxor as neither of my phones worked, had to pay 99L:E:(like-under 10 G:B:) and met my last trip driver,Mike Taiebbono,we lunched on kushari and exchanged numbers for more trips when my friends arrived. Mike and his driver Anwar were a pleasure to travel with, we felt safe and they found the best resturants for us, not the most expensive.Landlord=perfect-Driver=perfect==the BEST time ever."
50,"“Fantastic location, great local guides and accomodation”","My six adult extended family members and I spent three wonderful days in Luxor. It was one of the highlights of our time in Egypt. I would recommend at least three days if not more if you can spare the time. We are independent travelers and don't like tour groups but we didn't want to have to worry about transport and wanted a knowledgeable guide. We decided to go with Hassany (--) and were really glad that we did. He arranged for mini-van transport and a guide for each day and was very professional and welcoming. In the morning we discussed our plans for the day's excursion with the guide. If you are only there for a short time I would recommend that you arrange that ahead of time via email.Our guide was fantastic. His name is Khaled Helmy. Not only is he a knowledgeable Egyptologist but he is also active in archeological digs and the translation of hieroglyphics. This was an added bonus as he was able to translate the hieroglyphics at the sites that we visited and share the stories that they revealed. The cost (without tip) was $1050 Egyptian pounds for two days for car and driver and guide for seven of us. I would also recommend that you stay at the Flats In Luxor (--) as they are quite large, comfortable and in a very quiet location."
50,“Sonesta Nile Goddess Cruise from Luxor to Aswan”,"Recently completed our FIFTH Nile Cruise with the Sonesta group. This time on the beautifully refurbished ""Nile Goddess"", four nights from Luxor to Aswan. Having learned to expect only the best from our previous cruises, we were still greatly pleased by the level of service and attention we received from Dr. Maged Nader, surely one of the most efficient managers on the Nile, and his excellently trained staff and crew.After a rather hectic arrival (our travel representative had a hard time finding the new mooring location), it was a relief to be greeted with a 'hassle-free' check in, and a quick wash up in our perfectly appointed suite, before heading to a remarkable lunch.The restaurant staff were exceptional; nothing like friendly, smiling faces to top off a great meal. And to see people like sous-chef Safwat Adrawy smilingly explaining some 'new' dishes, and actually helping guests to their tables with their selections was really gratifying.The Nile Goddess (Sonesta's First Cruise ship) is beautifully appointed in a clean, spare Modern design...almost Art Deco. It is small enough that no guests need feel neglected, yet perfectly appointed with all the amenities one would expect; adequate pool with enough lounges and pleanty of fresh towels, and a fully equipped bar, under the aegis of the intrepid Ayman Wasan, who has proved one of Sonesta's greatest assets, pampering his guests, and conducting the party nights like an old pro.The itenerary is classic Nile Cruise, with tours in Luxor (Valley of the Kings & Queens; Temple of Hatshepsut, Luxor and Karnak temples), stops at Edfu (Temple of Horus), Kom Ombo (twin temples of Sobek, the crocodile god, and Haroeris, the Horus of the Dawn), and finally Aswan with visits to the High Dam, the unfinished Obelisk, and the stunning Temple of Isis at Philae.Guides were ALL very well trained and knowledgable. And the tours were all conducted in comfortable, air conditioned buses.A fun highlight was the stop at Esna, waiting to go thru the locks. Merchants row up to the Ship and literally TOSS their merchandise (in plastic bags) to the passengers, with much haggling and much laughter. Once a price was determined the passenger placed the money in the plastic bag and tossed it back. These guys had perfect aim and even managed to toss their goods thru open windows!. For those who prefer a more sedate shopping experience, the on-board shop has a nice slection of gold, souvenirs, books and gallabyas (native robes) that can be purchased, or rented, for the gala Gallabya costume party that is a feature of every Cruise...a great time to dress up, party and play games. NOTE: their is nothing quite so unhappy as a passanger who refuses to dress up and party hearty. Our group of five, extended to fourteen with the addition of new friends, did out best (under the direction of the indomitable Ayman) to keep the party going in high gear.The only drawback to the Cruise, but one that is unavoidable, is the distance between the new mooring location (for practically ALL of the Nile Cruisers) and Luxor city, necessitating a LONG cab ride for those who want to stroll Luxor in the evening. However, it is being done in an attempt to reduce the air pollution in Luxor, and is a small price to pay for a memorable cruise.All in all, having completed more than 25 Nile Cruises, with at least 10 different lines, and close to 20 different ships, we have found none that offer us the comfort, the fun, the great food and personal attention we receive from Sonesta....just what we look for, a casual, relaxing and somewhat pampered experience."
50,“Sun and a sea of sand”,"Luxor is an amazing city with it's history and culture. Temples and monuments are awe inspiring and easily and cheaply accessed.One small criticism is that the disabled tourist is not yet catered for.People are friendly and although many are poor they are still cheerful and welcoming.Temperatures are very high in June-Aug and extra care must be taken with protection against the sun, but normal common sense works best. Use sun screen, hats and sunglasses and carry plenty of water, although you can buy this anywhere. Barter the price of everything including water.Worth visiting in the city are Luxor Temple, Karnak Temple, Luxor Museum and The Mummification Museum.A short trip (about 20 mins) takes you to the West Bank where must sees include the Collossi of Memnon, Temple of Hatchepsut, Valley of Kings, Valley of Queens and Valley of the Workers. Also here are hot air balloon trips, the Ramesseum and Camel rides.The West Bank is easily accessed by road, ferry or pleasure boat, although organised trips are propably best to make sure you don't miss out on the highlights.Hotel and travel reps were quite expensive for excursions so we used a local group called Petra Travel Agency. All trips were well organised, had excellent english speaking guides and were very safe and reliable and reasonably priced.Day trips outside Luxor are plentiful. Dendera by boat, Aswan by boat or road, Abu Simbel and Cairo by train or plane. The only problem you will have is deciding which you will have to leave out as there is so much to see and do.Not for kids or Beach lovers. Hotels do have facilities for children , but the town has not. No water parks, theme parks or nightclubs.This city has more history and culture than most of us will see in a lifetime. Don't miss it."
40,“overall holiday review”,"Just returned yesterday (11.11.09) from a great 2 week stay at the Sonesta St George in Luxor EgyptThe hotel was really nice (a 5 star hotel. Very accurate). Very helpful staff. Nice pool and views of river nile. Rooms are resonably sized.Very impressed with the weather as it was over 40 degrees celcius all days. Roads are quit difficult to cross as traffic is coming all the time outside the sonesta st george.Good location to be in if you are the type of person who likes to eat out at different resteraunts as there are many across the road to the sonesta st george.Everywhere was easy to go to as there are alot of colleshes and taxis around. One day we went to a zoo on an island on the river nile. We organised it with a man called Hussain, who's shop is across the road of the sonesta st george and underneath the kings head pub. About 3 days after that we found out we were ripped off. We paid 700 Egyptian pounds for the whole trip and we found out we could have done it for 200 Egyptian pounds. The problem is Hussain told us about the zoo so we couldn't have gone with anyone else.We went to Luxor 2 years ago. Then we met a taxi driver called Mr Fish. He took us anywhere. A month after we left that time he was getting married and when we unpacked this time we went for a walk and bumped into him. We reminded him of who we were and a few days later he took us to see his wife and baby daughter.Oh yes. And we were away for my mum's birthday we went to the spa in the hotel. It was wonderful.Overall we have had an enjoyable holiday!!!"
40,“Exasperating Luxor”,"Just returned from Luxor (Nov '09) and thought I'd offer some advice to those about to visit the city. 1. Book full or half board hotel. There are few good restaurants or bars and the hassle from street vendors makes it impossible to enjoy a leisurely stroll. 2. Book a hotel with a big pool area. You're going for winter sun and that's the only place to enjoy it. There's no beach of course and you would not get peace in the park or by the river. 3. Everything you may have read about the street hassle is true or even worse! I say this carefully, but in our experience it seems no one can be trusted. Our felucca seller didn't actually have a boat and our caleche driver cheated us in a classic scam. I can only say keep your wits about you and don't try for a bargain anywhere. 4. Prepare for extreme haggling! As an example, we bought a hat that started as 235 Egyptian pounds and was bought at 45. It's tedious having to haggle for everything but you do have to offer a fraction of whatever price they offer you. 5. Everyone wants a tip, from the helpful guy who offers to take a photo to the young boy who offers the ladies a hand down some steps. It is very difficult to obtain small change so take some British pounds, or Euros or dollars. 6. Take organised tours rather than try and do it yourself. The double dealing and hassle will take away the enjoyment. If visiting the valley of the kings, cameras can be left in the tour coach. 7. I'd recommend the extra cost for Tutankhamun's tomb, the Fellah Tent (arabian entertainment evening) and Karnak by day or night. 8. Finally, if you haven't read up on the Luxor scams and hassles, it's worth doing so in order to prevent being seriously misled. Just don't let the hassle and rudenesss upset you. If you really don't mind that, then you'll be in your element!"
30,"“Spectacular sights, grotty town and hassle on the street.”","Stay in a good hotel and see the Luxor and Karnak temples which are spectacular. The town is hardly worth the effort of fighting off the endless touts who must be killing their own trades and commerce, although there are decent places to eat at low low prices.Watch out for a subtle trick used by guides offering to take you to the sights at a discount - we were had by a great guy who took us to the best spots, by-passed problems and was charming, funny and good company.He asks what price the holiday company wants, answer £30 (GB) each for two people = £60 GB. He says he will give you a discount £10 (GB) discount on the cost for two people, and casually suggests an exchange rate of 15 Egyptian to 1 UK pound and says this means discount of 150 Egyptian pounds. You may realise that the official rate should be about 10 Egyptian to 1 GB pound so you have an excessively large discount and you obviously agree. He then calculates the £60 cost with the inflated 15:1 exchange rate (= 900 Egytian) , he deducts the 150 Egyptian pound discount and guess what you are paying over the odds - 750 instead of 600 Egytian after the lovely discount. Great scam and entirely our own fault as it relies on the victims greed. It's only a few pounds but worth watching out for."
50,"“Luxor, Egypt - Hamdi Ebaid: My favorite Luxor taxi!!!”","I travelled from Cairo to Luxor on Sunday November 1, 2009 with 3 of my friends from Canada. Because of our previous experience of landing in Cairo and being swarmed with offers to take us to our hotel, I was a little apprehensive as to what would await us in Luxor when we stepped foot outside the airport. Thankfully, to my suprise a kind man by the name of Hamdi Ebaid and his taxi were parked outside and he kindly offered to take us to our hotel in Luxor. We were staying at the Iberotel right on the Nile; a beautiful and affordable place beautifully located. On our way to the hotel Hamdi informed us that he was actually one of the few individuals referenced on page 338 in the book 'Rough Guide to Egypt', which we actually purchased and had been referring to our entire trip thus far. Hamdi took care of us and arranged for us to see all of Luxor (West Bank and East Bank) all the while accompanying us. The best part of our entire stay is when he took us to have an Egyptian meal at his place in Luxor. He told us about all the tours he helped arrange for people that he met that return to visit Luxor. He is a true pleasure and honest business man who just wants to help make your stay in Egypt as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. I would recommend for anyone travelling to Egypt in the near future to look him up and get in touch with him. You can go to his website http://www.asktheegyptian.com. Although we didn't use him to arrange our accomodations and such, you would actually be best asking him to do so on your behalf. He has many connections here and can get you a much better rate at the hotels than what they advertise. He also rents our his apartments which are beautiful as well (I did see on of them during our stay in Luxor).If you have any doubts or any questions feel free to email me directly at janicezeppieri@hotmail.com.I enjoyed my entire stay in Egypt and would love it if someone that was there had shared their tips with me but passing it on to those visiting is equally fulfilling!Enjoy your trip!Janice."
50,“The impressive streets of Luxor”,"I have just returned from Egypt, from a tour arranged by Ramses Tours traveling agency and I have to say I was impressed. Until now I had traveled only to Europe, but there is a different world in Egypt. I was not impressed only by the monuments and the history/mythology, but also by the people, the lifestyle and the atmosphere. The representatives from the agency were very kind and open minded and they made possible things that were not included in the standard tour. All I had to do was ask and they came up with a solution. I arrived in Luxor and we had to visit both river banks, it was hot and the boat to Aswan was due to depart at a certain hour. There was little time to full around, but thanks to Ehab, the agency's main man from Luxor I had the chance to walk the streets of his city. There are so many things one could learn just by walking those streets, by day and by night, buying fruits, buying ice cream, buying juice, drinking sugar cane :), looking at the buildings, at the people. For me it was a fascinating world and I am glad the tour was not just past, but also present. I also liked the camel ride in a nearby Luxor village. It is strange to pass by the houses riding a camel, with everyone looking at you, but it is something that leaves a certain mark in your soul ... Go to Egypt, go to Luxor!Catalin"
40,“Visiting Luxor?”,"There's one thing that almost certain, if you are visiting staying in Luxor for the first time you will get, hassled for money, a tummy upset and mosquito bites, but don't be put off, just prepare well for all three.If you have not been to a poor city before, the town is an eye opener but the charm and character of the place is great. The people have very little money and tourist are their main source of income so they will hassle you from the off set, however they are friendly and seem happy with whatever you give them so if you are careful it should not cost you a lot and its all part of the fun.Becareful about what you drink and eat and wash your hand before eating, when you do get an upset take something asap.The mosquito's come out about at dusk and if you have not applied your repellent they will bite your ankles so take some wipes, or spray, and use it.Have a good holiday."
50,“Best City in the Nile Valley”,"After the dirt and crowd of over populated Cairo, Luxor was a welcome respite. Full of charm, culture and just enough modern convenience not to intrude on the experience.I was very ill when I arrived having caught a stomach bug in the big city. The doctor made a house call and I was up on my feet in no time. With all the expat Brits in Luxor the quality of care was top notch for such a back water town.If you visit only one place in Egypt, make it Luxor!"
40,“Luxor can be exciting or...”,"Luxor is the gateway to some fantastic sites. The Valley of the Kings, Valley of the Queens , Karnak, Luxor Temple etc but be prepared!The local people do their best to earn a living by trying to separate you from your money and indirectly your sanity ! It is virtually impossible to avoid being offered services and goods on a non-ending basis by tout after tout. ""NO"" is not an answer that carries weight here. They are polite but persistent to the point of irritation. And as soon as you finish with one, another comes a t you. I am a VERY experienced traveler and ex-pat and I understand how to interact with folks trying to sell me things and believe me when I tell you NO PLACE is like Luxor! The sheer repetiveness of their banter is mind-numbing at times.As for the sites, they are not to be missed for any reason! The tombs in the Valley of the Queen are very colorful and don't miss Medinet Habu!!!!!!!!!!"
50,“Myfavourite place MS Orchid”,"I have just returned from my second holiday on the MS Orchid and once again it was a fantastic holiday, the staff all remembered us, We even had the same guide Yasser he was just as briliant as the first time, so knowledgeable and made the trips really fun,I can not find one fault about the whole trip, We did one week on the Orchid followed by 3 nights in Cairo and then 4 nights in Luxor, I was a little concerened about going on to Cairo as I was travelling with my 21 yr old daughter, but I needn't have worried every thing was really well organised from start to finish.Cant wait to return"
50,“A Jewel that has everything”,"We arrived in Luxor, to go on a Nile Cruise on Magic 1, it was fantastic. Magic is approximately 9 years old, and we were pleasantly suprised when we boarded her. We were very well looked after the food was excellent, & the crew were very obliging. It really was a Magical way of seeing all the truly amazing sites located on the Nile.The biggest decision we had to make on board, was what time to get up in the morning, as everything is done for you. If you can, take the extra excursion to Abu Simbel, it is truly breathtaking, but pay extra to fly,we got there intime for Sunrise., it was a sight we will never forget.The second week we stayed at the Sonnesta St George Luxor, an excellent Hotel, with a Nile front location, which afforded everything you could possibly need. We opted to experience a bit of Luxor by eating out at night, which was enjoyable, not a bad meal out of 7 nights. However, I hated the incessent hassle from the Caleche drivers, and the traders, they do not know when to stop. But it wouldn't put me off booking up again,Luxor is ideal for seeing the Valley of the kings, Karnak & the Luxor temple, just keep your wits about you, and it will be an amazing experience"
40,“The Davinci cruise on the nile”,"Having booked just four days before we travelled with youtravelfrom manchester to luxor on tuesday 21st september 2009.We payed £998 for two people full board and 10 excersions to the temples.We were suppose to go on the flurette but they put us on the da vinci.Our travel agent told us these boats were 5 star maybe in egypt i would give flurette 3 as when docked we went and had a look around .And asked people that sailed with the ship the comments were the people on board was lovely no comments on the boat.Well back to the holiday when we arrived in luxor the first thing you need to do is get your visa go yourselves to the visa booth DO NOT leave your tour guides stamp your visa its a scam. We went to the booth got our own £8 per person. People on the bus that had it stamped by the boys had to pay on the bus £12.50-£15.00 per person.Having arrived at the davinci was pleasantly suprised i give it a four star does need refurbishing .Our cabin was on the second floor rooms was bigger than we expected with ensuite tv and aircon two single beds and a dressing table .large shower hairdryer.A tip take your own tea coffee and kettle if you like a cuppa otherwise you have to pay for everything.Second floor reception very nice big staircase going up to other floors. You can not change money at reception they make every excuse not to change your money.Plenty of banks of ship.When you arrive you will meet your tour guide who will tell you what is happening everday. Then he tells you he wants £15 per person towards tips between all the staff which i didnt think the room boys etc got so we left money for them ourselves.If you say you do not want to pay you will then be asked to write why you are refusing to pay.The second deck was the restaurant and lounge and the bar area.The food in the restaurant was good and no one on board was ill.This is our fourth time to egypt and the first time we have not been ill with a tummy bug.Hooray.The top deck has a swiming pool, sunbeds and also a covered areaOnly on certain days at 5pm they made tea and coffee.All drinks including water has to be payed for they will put it on A tab make sure you keep all receipts as you pay at end of cruises.It was forty degrees when we were there.By your water off the ship make sure they are sealed bottle on ship 12 egyptian pounds one bottle of the ship three bottles 10 egyptian pounds.There was not many people drinking in the bar as it was so expensive one can of their local larger which was rubbish and the smallest vodka and orange i have ever seen £ 10 our money so could not have a session. All of us had brought some duty free drinks with us thank goodness..The temples and all excursions was wonderfull . Because its a small boat everyone was friendly and we met some lovely people.I am not going into detail about our excursions otherwise i will never finish my review.The end of our holiday the tour guide asked us to meet again for the last time then informed us to look on the notice board and guess what it was saying his tip had not been included and he wanted £1.50 per day per personso £21 per couple.Although we had a lovely time we would not go on a nile cruise again as we have run out of money."
50,“Visit & bicycle rental”,"Thoroughly enjoyed Luxor and the West Bank, VoK , VoQ, etc.There is so much to see that I advise researching what you want to see before you go, particularly the names of the Pharoahs and the Gods of Mumuification. Your visits to the temples and tombs will benefit from the knowledge as most guides or tomb guardians do not have perfect English to explain fully.If arriving without research I suggest starting at the Museum of Mumification followed by Luxor Museum, all the articles are desribed in good English and for the children there are real mummies on display !If arriving late afternnoon you could make the Light & Sound display at Karnak Temple in the evening but CHECK if there is an English show that day and its time, your hotel may not have reliable information about this. This is also a good opportunity to hire a horse and carriage taxi, return fare from Pyramasia Isis 70le and the driver will wait for you until the end of the show.I hired a bicycle from Rent A Bike in Sheraton St, they provided local knowledge of the West Bank, temples, which tombs to see and maintenance when required. I used a tour bike with a basket as that meant I could use the basket to carry water, sun creams, camera etc in one relatively large and heavy bag. As I visited during Ramadan I was also able to carry a pair of trousers to wear over my cycling shorts when visiting temples etc.Everywhere I went was very safe so you can become complacent, I cycled up the West Bank from the bridge to the ferry, enroute some children 'playfully' helped themselves to my camera from the back pocket of my cycling vest, FORTUNATELY one of the children shouted ""Camera, Camera"" and it was quickly returned to me, my own fault.The more research you have done before you go the better.It was too early in the season for Rent A Bike to be running guided tours when I was there. However based on the information Olette passed onto to me in the shop I would certainly investgate hiring her as a guide. Although Dutch she has very good English and immense local knowledge. A guide will also save you vast amounts in unjustified tips.Always check over your bicycle before setting off, the heat can cause items to come loose overnight. Rent A Bike are prepared for this and did any necessary tightening etc first thing before I set off."
50,“Our most peaceful and interesting holiday to date”,"My partner and I stayed in Luxor for the too short time of 1 week in the middle of July 2009. The weather was amazingly hot but not too much of a problem for exploring... only for sitting outside by the pool... sunburn is only a factor if you sit still!We arranged our holiday through www.preferedegypt.com and could not recommend them highly enough. The representative I spoke to on the phone was knowledgeable and helpful and their Instant Messenger service for talking the offer through online was most useful especially as my partner and I kept asking questions regarding the area and hotel.We flew with Thomas Cook and while the staff were friendly it is still like a cattle train and you do feel as if you are being shoe horned into the smallest space possible, which I suspect is the same for all economy airlines so for a few hours we were uncomfortable, but this was no big deal. Definitely watch yourselves at the airport as people will try to take your bags off you even if you say no and then want bakeesh for it. Best way is just to keep walking which I know if difficult but for the best.The hotel we stayed at in Luxor was the Sonesta St George and I cannot praise the staff more highly. Anything you wanted was catered for, the flirty breakfast chef kept us very entertained while making us wonderful ""Egyptian"" omelettes every morning (an omelette with everything including Chilli and a great way to wake up in the morning!) and the small cafe in the lobby was a nice place to relax when back from a long day of touring. They even took a recipe off me for a toasted Sandwich I like but they had never made before... very nice of them to go off menu like that. This was really the only times we ate in the hotel after we ate in the Italian one of the first nights we were there and neither of us felt very well the next day.However, don’t believe all you read about the local food as we ate at different take always and cafe's all week (not area's the tourists go) and had nothing but wonderful food and plenty of energy for the next day... silly to think the only day we got ill was from eating in the hotel!Our main saving grace was our tour guide Hassany, who single handedly (well almost) made our holiday the trip of a lifetime. Not only did he show us the real Luxor at night with trips to a shish cafe for Egyptian coffee and mint tea but also for arranging various trips on the spur of the moment for us.He made sure we were looked after all week and with the help of Abdul, our Egyptologist guide (who unfortunately is a Liverpool fan - but you cant have everything!) we saw everything we wanted to including 2 days on the west bank (valley of the kings, valley of the scribes, valley of the monkeys, etc..) the temple at Durnam (I hope I am spelling this all right otherwise I may get all of my gold stars taken back from Abdul!), Camel Ride, sunset and most of the night on the Nile on a felucca, Perfume museum (highlight for me), Luxor and Karnak temples (both in daylight and at night) and a Ferrari ride on the slowest Ferrari in the world!Amongst these trips as an amateur chef Hassany and Abdul (and Co) introduced us to different local cooking techniques and spices. All of this cost us £300 for the two of us and we had 5 days out with Hassany and Co and many more evenings spent as friends. Many of the reviews say that you can get these trips for less but having experienced the best on this trip I cannot recommend more strongly that in this case the cheapest is not the best... You may save £10 on the week but is that worth not making the most of your holiday.I have read in many of these reviews that people had hassle of felt obligated, we experienced none of this. We were taken to and from each destination in a private AC car, Abdul came with us as far as he could and advised us of what to do if people got pushy, but we never experienced any of this... everyone was friendly and polite and as soon as you said no they moved on with a smile.I would go back in an instant and would be willing to recommend Hassany as a guide to anyone wanting to explore the historical aspects of Luxor and its surroundings... Hell, I would recommend Hassany if you just wanted someone to take you shopping in the market there!I do have his details if you require them and I will be going back as soon as we can afford it as there is still so much to see.Oh and as a tip.... take sweeties with you... the kids and adults that you meet accept sweets as gifts (not in replacement for bakeesh) but if someone has been helpful in the hotel or has invited you to eat with their family a little bit of british fudge with bakeesh goes down very well!... just has too be very sweet as the Egyptians have a very sweet tooth which you will find out if you head to the TWINKY Pattiserrie."
20,"“MS FLEURETTE, LUXOR”","I went on this trip with African Safari Club in July and it was OK; good value for money as I was able to get it at their lowest price. However, on the 2nd day my camera went missing but I only realised when on the early morning excursion to The Valley of the Kings (I had changed the batteries before going down for b/fast at around 4am). I was hoping that when I returned from the excursion I would find it on the beside table but no. I reported this to the rep and a thorough search was carried out but nothing was found. On the last day 2 other passengers' mobile phones went missing and these too were never recovered. I approached ASC hoping for a goodwill gesture towards a new camera but this was declined. A very disappointing end to what would have been a really great holiday."
50,"“Luxor, takes your breath away”","Luxor, I just loved it.Luxor for most people is their first glimpse of the Nile in the country and it is beautiful, but the feeling is there that you have seen it before... and you probably have in old biblical photos, and Charlton Heston movies, for this is how it looks, the lushness of the vegetation on the banks, the starkness of the desert beyond.Karnak Temple, no other word can describe it but breathtaking or amazing. I walked around with my mouth agape.Luxor Temple, make sure you go there at sunset and be there for when the lights come on.... a trully magical experiece.Take a horse and buggy ride.. touristy yes, but you really get to see the place, the tourist side and the side streets, see how the Egyptians actually live.... and the children still rush out to wave and call hello.It is great to have some English pubs around after having been in Egypt a while... cold beers and chips!The markets in Luxor I thought were the best we were not hassled, we had more greetings, then pressure to buy. Easy to move in, easy to wonder through and plenty to buy beyond the tacky tourists items that unfortunately overflow in the Cairo markets.We were there in August, the hottest month, sure it was hot, but did that stop us from doing anything, or make life awful. Definitly not!And then there are the tombs on the other side of the river.... once again an experience or amazement.All I can to say to everyone even thinking of a trip to Egypt is GO!"
50,“Fabulous cultureal expirence not to be missed”,"We have just returned from our second trip to Luxor in as many years. I must say this trip was greatly enhanced by contacting , reallifeegypt.com which was recommended on trip advisor. Many thanks to all those who did recommend this fabulous team. Mohammad / Janet , Mohammad's brother Ahmed. We contacted them initially to ask for them to pick us up at the airport . We wanted to check them over as we were nervous about booking all our desired trips over the net. From the very start when we were whisked away from the airport bypassing all the , ' tourist' queuing for the large coaches. We had our own little air conditioned coach, no dropping off lots of people at their hotels but straight to ours. Ahmed met at our hotel next day as requested and our itinery was tailor made for us at a very special price in fact with our party of 4 around £300 was saved!!. We covered valley of the kings/ queens/karnock temple fallucca trip/ banana island/ sound and light show. Some of these we had covered in our last trip but since some of our party had not ,we all visited again. What a different experience. Our personal guide Ahmed ( Number 2) was simply fantastic . No question was left unanswered believe me we tried!! He was such a wealth of information. Such a gentleman with endless patience . We also covered a 3 day cruise met a each port by our own personal guide Ahmed visiting Aswan dam and some more wonderful temples. How super washe that his attention to detail went beyond the behonds. Then there was our driver, ' Ramadan' who knew the roads like the back of his hand. A wonderful safe driver. When we noticed the photo of children sitting at the front of the van we asked who they were. Turned out they were his 4year old triplets who lived with his mother-in law as his wife had sadly died in an accident. We asked could we meet them he gladly obliged and on our way back from Aswan we called by to meet them what beautiful children and a credit to their father. Finally I must make mention of the Captains of our felucca trip, Calab and Tamer what wonderful people they were and made the little felucca trip so wonderful. We even made friends with them and was invited back to Tamers mother and fathers house to what can only be decribed as an Egyptian feast!!! Life long friends were made!!! We also visited apartments for future reference and possible visits to luxor shown on the reallifeegypt site, fab and will definitly consider them. All to quickly our wonderful trip came to an end. As promised Ahmed arrived to whisk us back to the airport in our personal transport with the best driver in Egypt!!!!!! A million thank you reallifeegypt your are the real 5 star at 3 star prices!!!!!!! Hi Tamer if your reading. XXX"
20,“A historical gem but the constant begging is likely to take the edge off...”,"Visited: August 2009We spent our holiday at a hotel in Karnak and travelled to Luxor on a number of occasions but the constant begging really put us off staying in town for too long.Try to get yourself a taxi driver who you can use as you chauffer during your trip, if you find a good one, he will limit the amount of problems you have with people offering you rides in their boats/taxi's/Ferrari's (horse and carts) and from children trying to sell you book marks, and asking for whatever food you have in your hand. After 'shopping around' we found and stuck with Mohamed 'Crocodile', he has 2 cars so if you’re going on a long trip, you'll get a ride in his new Mitsubishi, complete with comfy seats and fab air con. His other car is comfortable and cool but probably wouldn't manage too many long journeys! He's car No.15 and available on [--], you will find his fares way more than reasonable, he's a really nice chap and will show you all the sites on your travels.Luxor Temple is a real site you must see, and there are plenty of decent restaurants in the area...including a McDonalds if you're that way inclined. As for history, you'll find a museum and plenty of other things to see and do.Try not to let the smell of horse and donkey poo and the constant mithering put you off, or if you’re like me and can't do this, learn to say no thank you and walk very quickly; because once one finishes, there's another local waiting to ask you exactly the same question all over again!!I can't say I'd ever want to stay in Luxor central but it’s a definite for at the very least, a one day visit."
40,“Must see in Egypt - tons of history and sights!!”,"July 2009 - Luxor. Stayed at Sonesta St. George (see separate review). Great temples in Karnak. Luxor, Edfu, Komobo, Dendara, West Bank. Top tip. Travel company excursions can be expensive. Find a local guide (for a recommendation please contact me) who will be with you and educate you through the history of Egypt in a fun and informative way. The only problem is the hassle. You need to be firm but polite with the calesh (horse drawn carraiges) drivers. Expect to pay about 10 egyptian pounds from one side of town to the other. Get out early to avoid the crowds to the temples and avoid the sun. Most open at 6.00am and an early start is well worth it. Children can be found begging but I heard from our guide that there is local welfare from the Mosques and other organisations that help these kids - so it is up to you! YOU MUST take dihoreah tablets as you will get the runs. Take plent of pocket tissues for toilets around the sights and alcohol hand cleanser. You will enjoy the sights and the holiday was well worth it."
10,“Avoid at all costs”,"I am experienced traveler having visited hundreds of cities and over 40 countries. By far, Luxor was the worst place I have ever visited. I was so hassled and harangued by the mob of men trying to sell carriage rides, boat rides or taxis that they managed to ruin my experience. A simple ""no thank you"" would not do. They continued and continued, trying to get our attention with the worst British accents imaginable, asking us ""How was Yorkshire?"" They would follow us and follow us and continue until I would have to raise my voice to get them to leave. Then, less than a block later, it would all begin again. It was impossible to walk alone near any tourists sites. The non tourist sites did not look very appealing. Finding a restaurant was also difficult, not much choice. We ended up eating at the same restaurant three times. The city itself is quite pretty, and I am positive their are wonderful people living there. I just did not meet any. From the moment came off the plane, I was treated rudely.Warning: Do not travel here in small groups. If you really want to see the Valley of the Kings, go by tour."
50,“A delightful place”,"We have just returned from 2 weeks in Luxor Stay at the Mercure Coralia ( see my seperate review)I was pleasantly surprised by the town. it is fun lively in a cultural way.The summer month's are extremely hot around 110 degrees every day which does make moving away from the pool quite hard.Do not be put off by the inevitable hassle you will get in the street from taxi, caleche drives, shopkeppers etc. Yes it is a nuisance but a polite firm La shukran (no thank you) usually does the trick. The market that specialises in Egyptian souvenirs, silks etc is the worse for hassle. It is a shame because you are not allowed to stop, browse and eventually buy.If you want to try local food then I have 2 recommendations1. The Sofra an authentic roof top restaurent with excellent food. They do not serve alcohol but have wonderful freshy fruit juices. Make sure that you get a table positioned near a fan as there is no air con.The Jewel of the Nile - excellent food, air con, beer and wine if you want it. The restaurent is run by an english woman married to an Egyptian. She serves international and Egyptian.If you want to book trips/excursions then go to the Moon River Travel Agency (below the Thomas Cook shop), opposite the Steigenberge Nile Palace Hotel. The owner runs an excellent efficient service offering all the same trips as Cosmos/Thomsons etc but at a third of the price. He will pick you up from your hotel and take you back at the end of your trip. You will save yourself a fortune. The trip to Luxor Temple and Karnak Temple you can easily do yourself and again save a fortune.The horse drawn Caleche are cheap and plentiful, just make sure that your driver does not make his horse run or use a whip. Generally the drivers are very good. The owner of the Jewel of the Nile supports a charity called ACE whuch promotes the welfare of these horses.Have fun enjoy your trip take plenty of sunscreen and a very large floppy hat, you will need it."
20,“never again!!”,"my family and I have just returned from Luxor. We stayed at the Steigenberger Nile Palace.The hotel was good, friendly staff and good atmosphere but I booked an executive room which I did not get!! The windows opened out to an alleyway used by staff and delivery trucks, it had no view or balcony. If you are going to this hotel do not stay in room 130 unless you want no sleep on your holiday. I am put off going back to Luxor because of the men on the street constantly hassling you every step you take. It was very frightning for me when I was out with my two young children and the way they kept following my 15yr old neice was disgusting! My advice would be not to make eye contact with them and when shopping never pay the first price they ask, they will always come down in price."
20,“Luxor: the good the bad and the ugly”,"My letter to the Governor of Luxor following my recent visitDear Mr FaragI have recently returned from a one week stay at the Iberotel hotel in Luxor and felt that I really had to write to someone and share my experiences of the city and its environs.The hotel itself was outstanding. A fabulous location on the Nile with unparalleled views of the river and distant Temple of Hatshepsut. The staff were courteous, cheerful and helpful and sufficiently relaxed to make my stay there truly memorable. However, my memories of the city and a minority of its inhabitants will not be so positive.I read before I went that Luxor is considered the hassle capital of Egypt (some books and websites say the World), however, I was also assured that during your tenure as Governor matters had improved.I consider myself to be a relatively seasoned solo traveller having, in the past few years visited a number of cities, some renowned for their scams and hassles; Beijing, Caracas, Kiev, Tunis, Nairobi, Dar es Salam to name a few. None of this prepared me for the shear hell that was Luxor! From the moment you emerge from the airport into the punishing heat of the car park you are pulled, pushed, conned and hassled. It is difficult to know where to start describing my experiences of the intimidation faced so will limit my letter to a few incidents and my thoughts.For many years I have read about ancient civilisations and spend my summer visiting ancient sites. Being my first visit to Egypt I particularly wanted to visit the Rameseum and other sites associated with Ramases II. I caught the Baladi across to the West bank with my hired pushbike and cycled to Medinat Habu and the temple of Seti I. The hassle at these two sites had been a nuisance but no worse than I had experienced in other parts of the world. I had my ticket to see “Ozymandius” and was looking forward to sitting by his fallen monument and sitting in quiet contemplation. No such luck! I thought I had the place almost to myself. But as I approached I could see the first ‘hassle’ coming towards me. For the next twenty minutes I never got a moments peace. One after the other three of them took it in turns to point randomly at rocks and soil and despite pleadings to be left alone they stuck to me like leaches. Realising the backsheesh would not be forthcoming one blocked my way and told me it was closed. Now I had read about this scam but this was my first experience. When I tried to get by he called for reinforcements. Rather than cause a confrontation I walked out past the totally ineffective ‘tourist police’ and vowed never to return to Luxor. I had one more visit planned for that day; two tombs a short cycle ride away. As I approached the scammers appeared. Despite having paid for my ticket I rode off. Enough hassle for one day!Speaking to people back at the hotel about my experiences I was left in no doubt that this was not unusual. Many in the hotel were too afraid to go out or simply stayed, imprisoned in the Iberotel, knowing that a walk outside would try their patience and be a costly experience. Elderly people especially felt intimidated by the constant attention of these scammers and expressed surprise that the police were so ineffective.On my first day I tried to walk to Luxor temple, a matter of minutes away… or so it should have been. Every other step you’re met with ‘Friend’, ‘English’ ‘Taxi?’ Try being polite and you’re likely to be ripped off. In the UK we believe ‘manners maketh man.’ In Luxor it seems ‘manners maketh mugs!’ Try other tactics and they either call you ‘rude English’ or will follow you until you cross the road as you take evasive action. On occasions they will grab hold of you and try to pull you towards their taxi or bazaar. I wondered on this first day how many tourists must suffer injury and accidents each year taking evasive action. You find yourself wandering into the road not paying due attention to your own well being.On Sunday I awoke early for a ride to the Valley of the Kings. My bike was secured outside the hotel. As I emerged from the lobby my main concern was avoiding Ashraf, my tormentor for the previous three days. Like everyone else on the Corniche at that time in the morning he has an English wife, a taxi and lives on the west bank! In my rush to avoid another pointless ten minutes explaining to him that I didn’t require his services I tripped over the rather silly chain fence, fell hard into the road, cut both knees and tore the ligaments in my left hand. Not even slightly concerned by my distress Ashraf continued the previous days’ sales pitch selling me the virtues of his air conditioned taxi and his family on the west bank. I got on my bike and cycled like fury not stopping to lick my wounds until reaching the Baladi. That would be my last tourist trip outside the hotel. For the next three days I emerged briefly, when absolutely necessary and kept my wanderings in this inhospitable environment to a minimum.I could bore you with countless other incidents of supposedly closed roads, closed temples, closed restaurants, unparallelled rudeness and ineffective policing. Managing to avoid scammers on the way into a restaurant and being told ‘we’ll get you on the way out’ doesn’t make for an enjoyable meal!Yet everywhere in Luxor there are policemen. They watch as all this goes on and never intervene. What precisely is their role? Two scammers got into a vicious fight outside the hotel with fists and flip flops flying everywhere. Locals ran to separate them. As I walked on hurriedly I turned to observe the reaction of the police. They continued chatting and texting and propping themselves up on their rifles. At monuments they add to rather than prevent the hassle, Being pestered for backsheesh by armed policemen is a tad intimidating.Why place bazaars across the exits of temples ensuring that tourists visiting sites have to run the gauntlet of harassment and physical assault on the way out. I felt particularly pleased with myself on my second visit to Deir el Bahri.I left through the entrance and told security I had forgotten to get a ticket. They let me out by the scanners and I quickly unlocked my bike and pedalled for the valley bottom! What a shame that tourists should have to stoop to such levels to avoid what is in effect institutionalised and State-sanctioned harassment!Luxor is a magnificent city! Its monuments, its position on the Nile and its intriguing history ensure it can rise above the appalling behaviour of a minority. And the scammers are a minority. On my rare visits down the backstreets I was rarely hassled, being able to walk unhindered for minutes at a time, smiling at locals who seemed surprised to see me and amused by my shaven head. They were friendly and called me ‘Zidane’ and similar. I felt welcome and tried not to be obtrusive. There were no police in those areas and none were needed. But, re-emerge onto the Corniche and the hell would re-commence and all under the ever-watchful eyes of the men in white!It only takes a few to ruin the reputation of the many. I’m afraid that is the position Luxor finds itself in. People will still come and they will come in their droves. But they won’t always return and those that do will confine their stays to the sanctuaries that are the hotels. I felt unable to buy gifts for my nieces or pick postcards to send to friends. Restaurants I had circled in my guide were never visited. Walks along the Nile were out of the question.One day I will hopefully return. My stay will be brief and confined to the places the scammers prevented me from fully appreciating this time. And that would be my sorry advice for others wishing to visit this ‘largest outdoor museum in the World.’ Go, but go with care. Keep your visit brief. Go on organised tours. Don’t go out walking. Buy your gifts at the airport. For a solo traveller, it saddens me to recommend such measures to others but Luxor is unlike any other city. Sadly in more ways than one.Yours sincerelyPete Waring"
50,“luxor is exciting”,"If you are going to Luxor for the first time let us give some advise. The place is a ""must see place"" and a real challenge to the senses. Sun tan protection is a must, a hat that is large enough to cover face and neck is advisable. You can get sunburn just walking from the airoplane. Take good sunglasses because the glare of reflection from rock and sand can torment. Also take an umbrella for portable shade you will bless having it specially when visiting the sights. Take some wet wipes to always clean your hands after handling their money, its always filthy and a serious cause of cross infection. Take some english coins for tipping. At the airport on arrival the porters will turn up their noses to shame you into giving them an english note. Ignore that because they collect english coins and swop them with other passengers for notes later. Never accept water in opened bottles even in restuarants We are rich to them so always keep your wits about you. When you buy films ect. note the sell by date. Always go in groups when new to the area and despite what other might say travel with properly offered trips with your hotel travel agentsfor insurance reasons. stay safe and enjoy"
50,“Great and relaxed city”,"I stayed in Luxor between June and July at the Mercure Hotel. We travelled with Thomson who really made our stay great, their reps are the best in my opinion. Definately go out early morning and have a siesta before going out again early evening, the midday sun is much to hot to move about in. The city really comes alive at night with locals taking their families out for the evening. Some great places to shop are in the centre of Luxor in the locals shops, we got the best silver jewellery at Isis unit 23 in the mall next to the Mercure and if you have small children the place to go in the evening is the Susan Memorial Gardens where you will find local Luxor families sitting and relaxing.People always write about the hassle they recieve there, however if you learn the phrase 'Laa Shukran' (no thank you) you should be fine. Also bear in mind you are in a Muslim country so try and be sympathetic by covering your shoulders and wearing clothes that reach below the knee when going outside. We were 2 girls travelling alone and found that doing this meant we got minimal hassle. The egyptians also love children and are very family friendly.We did unfortuneately end up in the hospital whilst in Luxor (due to the panic over swine flu!) but found the staff there friendly and helpful with a high level of care. Hopefully you will never need to use their facilities but if you do you won't be upset with the level of care you recieve.All in all Luxor I found Luxor to be a friendly and relaxing place and would definately reccommend it as a place to holiday."
20,“Don't be taken for a ride!!”,"Luxor is beautiful, but the hassle, Oh My Goodness!! It can get you down. You have to be very firm. I had read all the reviews before I went and was prepared to ignore everybody, but it is so hard when you think you are being impolite. The calesh drivers are very good at trying to get you to say you will have a ride with them later or maybe tomorrow. Never say ""Maybe"" as they will see that as an agreement. Just say I have a taxi booked tomorrow. Under any circumstances do not get a calesh with a man called Ahmed Saprey. He will tell everyone is bad but him and even give you his card, but he will charge double the going rate and then has ""No Change"" so you feel obliged to leave without your change. Other calesh drivers were nicer. Agree a price and say where you want to go. Also tell them where you do not want to go. Make sure the price is in Egyptian pounds and not per person. Enjoy your stay!!"
50,"“egypt - luxor, cairo,”","Just back from a very very well organised trip to the temples, pyramids, tombs and museum. We were originally based in Dahab, but thanks to our travel organiser Omar, who organised flights to cairo and luxor, tour bus and guides, lunch, hotels ect for us, to fit into our busy holiday shedule (a shopping trip to the city stars was even included!!) we had an amazing adventure. Everything was organised beautifully, making sure we did not miss a thing. If we had taken the bus, it would have taken@8hrs to reach cairo, making it a very long and tiring trip and i feel i would not have enjoyed my experience.The hotel in Luxor was perfect, roof top pool!! Great for sunbathing and catching the views. The weather was extremely hot, so our tour guided fitted the trips around the most suitable times to visit the ""sites"" and made it really comfortable for us moaning brits! ha ha! The itinarery was brilliant!I would recommend the pyramids, valley of the tombs,workers, temples and cairo museum is fitted into your trip!! I would probably have been lazy and never visited any of these things if Omar hadnt organised it all for us. Being there was the most amazing feeling!!Had a great time, thankyou so much Omar!! The experience is amazing and i hope many more tourists find you!! You certainly made our visit to egypt unforgetable!!ThankyouClaire from Scotland"
40,“Busy Interesting history”,"We did the cruise up the Nile to Aswan then a coach trip to see the historic sites. Travelled back to Luxor both developed stomach problems. Stayed in a nice hotel overlooking the Nile stomach problems disappeared. Tavelled to the Valley of the Kings very interesting marvelleous tombs with stunning interiors.Saw the light show at Karnak Temple, wonerderful.Went to Cairo by over night train, very smelly toilets, dont think they know what bleach is. Saw the mummies and artifacts in the Cairo musium the visted the Pyramids, spectacular.A good interesting Holiday"
50,"“Luxor, Egypt - not to be missed, amazing place”","We have just returned from 2 weeks in Egypt where we based ourselves at the St. Joseph Hotel in Luxor. It is a budget hotel but the rooms are clean, a good size, most with excellent views of the Nile. The staff are friendly and the food, especially at the pool bar, good. The location is good at the South end of town but this does mean having to take taxis, due to a) the heat and b) the persistent hassle from caleche drivers if you try to walk.Prior to our holiday we found an excellent tour operator via the internet - Ahmed Balal, who has just set up his own agency having been the Manager of Jolly’s Travel Agency in Luxor for 20 years. He knows his business, is honest and arranged our 2 trips to the West Bank with private guide and driver, both very friendly and knowledgeable. Ahmed has set tours but will customize anything that you wish. Cannot recommend him highly enough.I said we were based in Luxor because I had booked 2 nights in Aswan and 2 in Hurghada to go snorkelling. Ahmed arranged our transport to both in a private air-conditioned minibus, same driver as for the West Bank trips, again he could not do enough – stopping when we wished, getting fresh fruit juices if we wanted a change from bottled water, a must in Egypt.For the Hurghada trip Ahmed arranged a ½ day snorkelling trip. We did the snorkelling then Mohammad the driver took us on to our hotel and returned 2 days later to take us back to Luxor.On the Aswan trip, same driver and minibus, we stopped for as long as we wished at Komombo and Edfu before being delivered to our hotel in Aswan. Again Mohammad returned 2 days later to take us back to Luxor.We thoroughly enjoyed our whole visit and will, all being well, return next year.Top tips:1. Take and wear sunglasses if only to avoid eye contact when combating or ignoring hassle from caleche drivers and shop-holders.2. Plan trips for the mornings – the heat from 1230 to 1700 is overpowering.3. Do not give money to small children “begging” for food, you will be mobbed in no time if you do.4. Make sure you have a pocket full of 1, 5, 10 and 20 EGP’s. Change is hard to get from taxi drivers.5. Agree the taxi price before getting into the taxi (meters not used). If the driver says 20 EGP he will probably accept 10 or 15 depending on his success so far that day. There are hundreds of taxis.6. Parasol(telescopic umbrella) and/or fan a must for all ladies especially those of a certain age as there is no shade in the desert and the mid-day/afternoon sun is fierce!Jean and DavidWorcestershireMay 2009"
50,“A must-see place!”,"I was already amazed by the beautiful sight of River Nile when we arrived to Louxor, but this place could also show something special! Karnak temple is simply FANTASTIC, BEAUTIFUL, and other temples are nice too.And when you see the bildboard with the request: ""Smile! You are in Louxor!"", you won't get any questions if you should do it... (And it's very easy because all the people there are smiling continously.)"
40,"“Magic 1, Nile River Cruise”","April 2009, one week cruise from Luxor to Aswan and back again. Booked through Cosmos, good price considering it was Easter. First off the flight was with Monarch, that almost put us off as not very customer friendly. Arrived in Luxor, and straight onto the boat. Rooms where picked before arrival, so no choice. Porters tried to get a tip even though we where putting all tips in a kitty with the boat. Trips were very good, but Abu Simbel is £130 each, not £120. You can only fly as there isnt a coach trip anymore (even though agent said there was). Tipping is done via the boat, but be aware that it is about £30 each, not per couple. There is a Gallabaya party night, so you can have a dress up. There is a gallabaya shop on board, about £10 each. Food was very good, we didnt have any upset stomaches. We had a tour of the kitchen and it was very clean and organised. We were told to pack a kettle as some early days, but the kitchen opened early for us, and we had a snack and drink before leaving. Guides were very good, but some VERY early mornings with limited time at the sites. this is because by 10.00 am it can be up in the 30's. The boat provides bottled water at meal times and you can get extra for trips. Valley of the Kings is a 3 tomb tour with chance for 2 extra's; Ramses IV at £50LE and Tut at £100LE extra. Rooms clean and comfortable, but with twin single beds. Shower not bath. There is a DVD made of your stay at £100LE but we found it was very poor quality, but worth it for the laugh. Beware of the constant hawkers and sellers, who sometimes wont take no for an answer. Well worth the effort, and we will definately go back."
40,“Luxor as a holiday destination”,"Luxor is a holiday resort only for those interested in Egyptian antiquities and experiencing a different culture. Do not go there if you just want sun, sand and nightlife. Recommended trips are a visit to the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple especially the sound and light show, and an early morning balloon trip over the desert. The balloon trip was very well organised - Sindbad was the company I used - it is much easier than you would imagine and not at all frightening.Eat at the English owned restaurants as they are clean and serve alcohol - Laura at the Jewel in the Nile restaurant will give you plenty of interesting information about Luxor as well as serve you a good meal. Good English owned shop for water, ice creams and sandwiches etc - Arkwrights.The hassle from taxi drivers, caleshe drivers and shop owners got extremely wearing by the end of the week - they do not take no for an answer, even in arabic - and do not believe a word they say - some even say they work at your hotel in order to get tips. I stayed at the Sonesta St George - no hassle in there - lovely hotel with great position on the Nile, but small pool and a lot of noise at night from outside as bedroom windows not well soundproofed.I would recommend perhaps 4 or 5 days in Luxor and then a transfer to Cairo to see the Pyramids etc."
40,“Luxor :Egypt. Want to go back again!!”,"Luxor: Experience of a lifetime.Just back from Luxor after another brilliant trip. Stayed a the Gaddis hotel which is in a cluster of Hotels in Khalid IbnWhalid St, close to The Isis and Sheraton and a short taxi drive from East Bank sites, Luxor Temple and Karnak, Museums, ifyour up to it you can walk to most. Hotel is basic but clean, withbar Kareoke and an excellent restaurant. Use Luxor as a base and have been on tours of the Western Desert vsiting the OasisDakla, Bahria and to Cairo. Luxor is just a very friendly place, yes, you will get some hassle but thats the way they do business. From the guy selling water outside the hotel to Ahmed the Travel Agent by 7 Days 7 Ways Restaurant, thescarf seller, even Kentuck Fried Chicken, good sevice, a smile,a joke, i all goes with the Territory. A good meal try the Lanterns, even with the reduced English pound your money stll goes a long way."
50,“In love with Egypt”,"Just come back from a week's Nile cruise starting in Luxor. Stayed on the Crown Prince which was exactly as we'd expected from reading the forums - lovely boat but some areas a little tired.However, please don't let that put you off! The rooms are comfortable and the food is really good (particularly the fish dishes and desserts).The staff on the boat are really friendly - especially Amro the bar manager, ""cheeky monkey"" is his favourite catchphrase.The Egyptian people are friendly all around with a great sense of humour. The children just want to say hello in English and maybe take a photo with you.Yes there is some hassle from street vendors - hard to avoid - but this is such a small part of the trip. The temples and other sites are so special that they outweigh any small negatives.I'm totally devoted to Egypt and can't wait to go back.My best holiday ever."
20,“A beautiful land ruined by greed!”,"Karnak, Luxor Temple, hot air balloon flights, the valley of the kings/queens were all amazing. This is what we went to see and to experince the many facets of Egyptian culture. To stand and simply look in awe of these amazing sights will never leave me. The problem is that surrounding these ancient wonders are a million people simply preying on you for your money. At first it's ok, you simply put up with and politely say no (La Shukra) but after a while you do realise that all of these amazing sights are being completely devalued by this onslaught of pure greed. I have never lost so much faith in humanity than I have on my trip to Luxor. Is money really going to improve the lives of the locals? Or do they need to realise the each cluture is different and to progress as an economy and and viable tourist destination that they should back off a little."
10,“Royal Ruby Nile cruise”,"If you are wanting a budget cruise, then this boat is OK. We booked a 5 star ship and willingly paid high season prices as a Christmas treat to ourselves. Our disappointment was immediate. We had to trek through 3 beautiful ships before we got to ours. They all had lovely lobbies and were decked out with cheery Christmas lights. Ours was drab with worn chairs and benches. A drab welcome. Our room was OK..barely 3 star, only shampoo for amenities. No balcony. We could look right out our window to the boat next to us and saw cabins with balconys. The dining area was in the bottom of the boat with no view at all of the passing scenery. It was like going into a dungeon. I couldn't wait to get out of there. The food was OK only and was definately recycled from one day to the next. One bright spot were the desserts. They were very tasty and lovely. We were told that there was gourmet food with a spectacular view of the river as we dined. Awful! The deck upstairs was abysmal. Worn plastic, uncomfortable chairs and many of the loungers broken. The bar area was uninviting, no decor at all and the same tired plastic chairs and worn tables. Service was almost nonexistent. We ended up going down to the dining area to get drinks.We complained to our agent an left a very poor review. Lots of excuses about not having enough people to fill one boat. they offered no compensation and certainly did not care.Avoid this line! Check with your agent! Find out what boat you will be on and know what you have paid for! the conditions on this boat dampened the enjoyment of the beautiful Nile cruise."
40,“No Hassle !!”,"We have spent an eye opening week in Luxor and have returned with lots of great photo's and good memories. Many reviewers have mentioned the amount of hassle from the locals and we were expecting some mad mob to be waiting for us every time we left the Hotel. How wrong they were.We walked along the Cornich every day to go to the Temple, town centre, bars or the ferry and I would not class our encounters as hassle. Sure these boat owners and carriage drivers have to make a living, but there are so many of them they just want to get you first if you want their services.We also ate out every night in Luxor at different places and never suffered any problems with the food. Drink some of the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice if you find it, it's great ! Also get some cakes from the bread shop on the back side of the Temple away from the Nile. Freshly cooked while you watch and about one Egyptian pound per item.We were really lucky as on day two we met this guy on the Cornich near the ferry, called Mostafa. He owned his own mini-bus on the West Bank and spoke good English. Anyway, we haggled with him and decided to trust him to take us out in the West Bank for the day. He cost us 85 Egyptian pounds ( just over £10.00 ) in total for four of us for the day including his time and the mini-bus. He was really honest and said his fee was 50 Egyptian pounds for the day and we could give hime what we thought he was worth over that price. Incredible trust from him towards us from the start. We went to Valley of Kings, Hatcheput Temple plus Madinat Hebu, stopped at a bar for a drink at lunch time. He also dropped us at a local restaurant for dinner, waited and then took us back to the ferry. The dinner was 35 Egyptian pounds each so were were not ' ripped off '.We went with him a second day and saw Valley of Queens, Nobles Tombs, Ramesseum, Sety 1. First though, as it was Tuesday he took us to the West Bank market. Everything from donkeys to apples were on sale and only the locals shop there. It was packed. We never realised that people live this way such a short way from the touristy Luxor centre.Later that day he took us to meet his parents, then to his friends house ( with sugar cane branches for a roof ) to drink some tea and finally to his house where his wife put on a great dinner for us with chicken and beef, beers and cokes. All this, he said, was free and his gift to us.This man made the real difference for us and made us realise that amongst all of the poverty people can still be happy and generous.We also flew to Cairo for the day to see the Pyramids, sphinx, museum souk etc. We booked locally through Karnak Travel who were willing to haggle. Jolleys did not seem bothered. Total price for four of us was 4,000 Egyptian pounds so about £120.00 each.A great place for sightseeing and seeing how other people live.We loved Luxor for seven days and maybe we will go back one day when the good memories have faded away and re-live the experience all over again.I don't know if any body is interested or if giving telephone numbers is allowed, but Mostafa has mobile [-] if you want to give him a try."
10,"“Luxor, Egypt - pros and cons”","TO GO or NOT TO GO to Luxor ? That's the question.GO to Luxor and Aswan...1. If you want a relatively cheap vacation in a warm place in the middle of winter, close to Europe. the Mediterranean or the Atlantic could be cold and rainy in December. In Egypt you can suntan and swim in a pool anytime .2. if you're interested in ancient art and and architecture, you might need a whole week to enjoy all the monuments of Luxor. It's a rewarding trip if this is your main reason to go to Egypt.Luxor has the biggest concentration of temples, tombs.. which you can visit individually, on a bike or taxi. The walks over the mountain from the Valley of the Queens or Deir el Medina towards the Valley of the Kings are not difficult and they take you to to fantastic viewpoints. Buy a good guidebook and start exploring. We had one by the American Press in cairo.DON'T GO to Luxor...1. If you want a quiet, relaxing vacation. The moment you step out of the hotel/boat you are continously hassled by boat people, sellers of any kind of junk souvenirs, honking taxi drivers. People just stop you and start bombarding you with the same stupid questions ""Where are you from ? Australia ? Good people. Wanna go Banana Island ?"" You can tell them you are tired, sick or that your plane leaves in 2 hours, they drill your brain with the same story : "" I take you banana island, good price"".Their English is limited to numerals and currencies (5 pound, ten euros, 20 dollars); to anything you say, the answer will be "" No problem"" which basically doesn't mean anything. You will still be cheated. Taxi drivers developped fantastic skills in diverting you from your destination to a ""typical egyptian market, that takes place once a week"". In fact they take you to the shop of their cousin. For Egyptians, foreigners are walking ATMs. You never get the right change for the goods you purchased (even at the valley of the Kings ticket office), boat people seem to never have the right change for your ride, gate keepers at the monuments are never satisfied with the backshish you just gave them. Even worse, 5 years old childred run yelling ""money, money"". That's when they don't throw stones at you or spit at you. I was coming over the mountain from the Valley of the Kings from Deir el Madina when 3 barefoot people came out running from the security point shouting ""money, money"". ""Too late to walk here now, the boss wants to see you in his office"". Two police agents at The Valley of the Kings invited us to take a photo with them, just the right pretext to ask for some pounds after. The Tumbs of the Nobles are less visited but very interesting, with artistic styles much more diverse than those of the Kings. When I heard that the Egyptian government is demolishing the village around the tumbs of the Nobles, I was outraged. But when I just couldn't walk from one tumb to the next because 5 people were yelling around around me begging for money, wanting to serve as a guide or trying to selll me postcards, I told myself that this destructive initiative might bring some peace to the poor tourist. In Aswan the ferry man simply refused to allow us on the ferry for one pound (the regular fare everyone pays). He wanted 5. I was asking other locals what was the right amount, hoping for a clarification, but they all answered, after looking at each other and hesitating for a few seconds ""five"". Ask for the price before buying anything. In Aswan we paid 15 dollars for 2 cakes and a glass of juice. Don't forget the backshish. For every service you get, you are expected to pay some extra pound. Refuse to do so and you'll get a ""[--] you !"". In temples, some guy in dirty flip flops is pulling you to some corner to show you things you find in any guidebook ""This - Ossiris. This - Amun"". What's worse, they even ask you to touch the carvings or the statue. After this priceless initiation in egyptology, you must open your wallet again.2. If you are allergic/asthmaticIn Egypt it rains every 2 years. A thick dust lingers everywhere. Clouds of dust and sand raise at the slightest breeze. Cleanliness is still a neologism, especially in restrooms.Piles of garbage are scattered about anywhere, in towns and villages.3. If you travel with children or old people.They will be traumatised by the agressive contact with the greedy locals. If you travel in winter, you will walk off the boat or ferry in the dark. Stairs to the boats or ferry are in poor shape, no handrails. Sometimes you will have to cross several motorbosts to get to the riverbank. I hit my head against the roof, to the laughter of the boat pilot. Cars drive at night with their lights off. Police agents just watch you struggling to cross busy streets. Pedestrian crossings are just Land Art, drivers hardly stop at them.Conclusion : Luxor has unique artistic monuments, that you have to see at least once in your life. But the contact with the locals is traumatising. I will think twice before returning there. I saw fantastic things but this was not a pleasant vacation."
50,“Luxor to Aswan and back on a Nile River Cruise”,"We have just returned from a wonderful 7 night cruise on the Alexander the Great cruise boat organised by Discover Egypt. Wonderful boat, excellent cuisine, lots of space as the boat was half full. Comfortable and well equipped cabins. The excursions are wonderful in Luxor particularly. Our guide was knowledgeable and charming. The staff on the boat were very accommodating and friendly. The service was very good. Drinks on board a little expensive but that was the only negative. We would definitely sail on this boat again and would travel with Discover Egypt too. I won't forget the views from the sundeck of the passing vistas along the Nile - quite breathtaking. Highly recommended."
40,"“Luxor, Highs & Lows”","We have just returned from a trip to Luxor, so I thought I would share our experiences to help fellow travellers interested in a trip to this city.So to start!My wife & I flew independently of a package deal so on arrival we used the local taxi service to transfer to our hotel. We had been quoted transfer fees of GBP 25.00 + (equivalent to around 220 Egpyt Pounds,LE) each way using tour operators' buses. We got a taxi & paid LE40 in total( GBP 3.50) for both of us. The driver initially wanted LE100, but at the time of writing LE35 to LE40 is the going rate. So, not only did we save a substantial amount we also made sure that our money went into the local economy,On the tourist streets of Luxor, ie the Corniche and the 'tourist market' you will be constantly badgered to buy a trip, a Felucca ride, look in a shop, etc etc etc. This can be extremely wearing especially when you're hot and tired after a days sightseeing. My advice, if you are not interested, is to be polite, firm and tell them you are on your third trip to Luxor and that you have seen it & done it all before!On our visit 'La Shokrun' i.e. ""No thank you"", doesn't work anymore.The best bet is to keep walking, but don't be rude. They are only trying to make a living and presently tourist numbers to Luxor seem to be in decline.There are many Calleches (horse-drawn carriages). We went on a few, and they can cost anywhere from LE5 to LE15 depending on how long you require them for. They can be a fun experience, providing you agree a price first, but more importantly pick one whose horse is in good condition (you will see a number a malnourished horses in Luxor), and make sure the driver doesn't whip the horse or canter it along the road.My wife & I took the local mini buses around Luxor. They cost less than LE1, that's 12p per couple! After a couple of days you suss out the direction of travel. They all head past the train station and Luxor Temple. To get on one just stand by the roadside stick your hand out & if they have space they will stop and you can jump on. They are a great way to involve yourself in the local culture.We went on a number of trips that we organised ourselves using local taxis and a local guide.Not to be missed; Valley of the Kings, Queen Hatshepsut's Temple, Tombs of the Workers, Felucca trip along the Nile at sunset.One of the best trips my wife & I did was to take the local ferry, located by Luxor Temple. The fare is LE1 one way, over to the West bank. We hired a couple of bikes for the day at LE30 per person, then we cycled to Habu Temple. The roads are good & flat and it is possible to cycle to Valley of Kings or Queens etc. It is safe to leave your bikes and no one will touch them.A lot of tourists book their tours through the main companies and are generally paying double the price than if they were willing to do a little ground work themselves. Also, using the local taxi drivers and a local guide, if needed, puts the money into the local economy.On our trip we spent time eating in local restaurants, eating from the street stalls and experiencing Luxor away from the 'tourist' zones. We found the people of Luxor to be extremely friendly and accommodating. Not once were we hassled in any way, and not once did we feel unsafe at any time. Also we didn't suffer any sickness or dodgy tummies, because we took sensible precautions. After handling money clean your hands with Anti bacterial gel. Drink only bottled mineral water. We found the street stall food to be delicious, as well as piping hot.One restaurant we would highly recommend is 'Sofra' , a superb Egyptian dining experience. The food is traditional Egyptian, and is quite simply delicious. Try the mixed meze!For souveniers there are a number of 'Fixed Price' shops near Luxor Temple, where you can browse without any hassle. One shop in particular is the 'Fair Trade' shop which has a range of products made in Egypt at very reasonable prices.As for the other shops where the products have no price stickers, this is where you need to haggle, usually involving some mint tea. Decide on what you are happy to pay, within reason, let them make the first price offer, then off you go, enjoy, it's an experience.Overall we found Luxor to be the best and worst of Egypt. The historical sights are magnificent! Expect very friendly people, hard sell & hassle, breathtaking views of the Nile & the West bank, the contrast between the earthy back streets of downtown Luxor & the marble facades of luxury Hotels, blaring horns and frenetic traffic, and the smells of spices and incense."
40,"“Tips for luxor, attractions, prices, tourist information, money”","The things we saw in Luxor were brilliant, temples, tombs and the balloon flight! We ate at a restaurant recommended by internet “Jamboree” which was good but I didn’t like the road it was on, it was a back street with building work on it. Ate about 4 times at pizza hut and KFC as these were 5 mins away from us.The exchange rate in the UK was 7.2 LE to £1, we changed most of our money in Luxor as the exchange rate was 8.2 to £1. At the airport, get your visa from the banks on the left hand side as it’s cheaper, don’t get it through your travel agent. They try to direct you to another desk, it’s a way of making a couple of extra pounds from you. I paid for mine with US dollars. If you have any dollars take these, we used 1 dollar bills for tips. Try to change some money for smaller notes to give as tips. Nobody took our suitcases when we got them off the carousel at the airport but when we got to our bus there are guys there taking your suitcase off you just to load them on the bus and then they expect a tip!!!! Most of the tourists didn’t have small change and ended up giving them a big tip! You should only give them 1 LE (about 12p).For travelling around and visiting the sites you will find the travel agent prices are double or more, do it yourself if you can. We were luckily to get a really good taxi driver on the first day, Mr Abou is very knowledgeable and trustworthy we used him all week for all the tours Mr Abou (Hamdy Mohamed [--] We hired him for 4 hours at 150 LE (£18) and visited the Valley of the Kings 80LE plus 4LE for a fun little train to take you up and back again. Out of 20 odd tombs you have a choice of 3 to go and see we went down, 2 Ramses and 1 Sety. The paintings and carvings on the walls were amazing and to think they were 3000 to 4000 years old and still in good condition, we then had the choice of more tombs in the valley of the Queens but Hamdy suggested Habu Temple, 30 LE each to get in, which was excellent. You can’t use your camera in the tombs but you can take photos in the valley itself. We went shopping on the way back to the hotel, as we wanted water and beer!! It is hard to find shops that sell beer, they are not on the tourists streets but on the back streets. If you like red wine, bring it with you from duty free (3 bottles for £15) we did this and drank it on our balcony at night, as a bottle of European/foreign wine in a restaurant is £70.Another day we did Luxor Museum 80 LE (can’t use your camera) and Luxor Temple 65 LE and used Mr Abou again 20LE one way. We did the horse and carriage ride on the way back and paid 20LE.We booked our Balloon Flight through Mr Abou it was 350 LE each (£42, the travel agent was £90 each) we went with Alaska Ballons.. Amazing trip to watch the sun rise over the Nile and the valley of the kings/Queens. Transport to and from the hotel by taxi then by boat across the Nile, then you have an hour in a balloon. It is an early start in the morning but we managed to get on the second balloon ride as each balloon goes up twice, there are about 20 balloons going up at that time!!! Another couple from our hotel booked Sinbad ballons and paid 300 LE each but there ballon just went up and down in the same spot. So sometimes the cheapest isn’t the best! Ours was excellent we went over villages, roads, stream, farms, fields and by the Valley of the Queens!Mr Abou took us to Karnak Temple 65 LE each to get in (tickets from the wooden hut on your right as you go through the gates) this is the largest temple in the world. This was amazing the size of the columns etc. He then picked us up 2 hours later and we stopped of on the way back for water and beer and paid him 70 LE for the round trip (£8). Mr Abou took us to the airport for 40 LE as we decided not to get the bus provided. Mr Abou even texted us in the UK to see if we got back OK. I highly recommend him for your trips, he also has a new air conditioned car as you do see a lot of old bangers on the road!"
50,“Luxor Trips.”,"Best holiday Ever!!We stayed at the Nile Palace(known by a few other names) and absolutley loved it. It is 5 star and the service was nothing less.We organised some ttrips beefroe we went through www.luxortours.co.uk and we are so glad we did as we saved 20-30% compared to how much our tour operator wanted to charge us!We saw the wonderful valley of the kings, the amazing Hatshepsut temple and took the day trip to cairo to see the pyramids and sphynx.The Best bit had to be the Hot Air Balloon ride which was half the pice of the tour operator and was run by the same people! What a mind blowing experience!!!Going again soon...!!!!"
40,“Egyptian Luxury”,"Luxor is an open air museum with plenty to see and do and some very good restaurants outside the hotels (and a third of the price) Below I will list some of the more popular restaurants :-Snobs :- Good food and very friendly staff it is not licenced but they allow you to take your own drink.Deans Bistro :- Good home cooked food and sells beer and wine (no spirits)Jems :- Overcooked and overpricedNew Sunrise :- a wonderful restaurant with very good and reasonable priced food and drink. The manager Safrey will welcome you and the waiter Michael (a lovely man) will attend to all your needs.A word of warning there is a Chemist shop on the main street (near the KFC Restaurant) DO Not buy anything from this man he overcharges tourists as much as 10 times the going rate for medicine - in our ignorance we bought cough mixture and payed 49 Egyptian Pounds for it, the exact same bottle in a chemist opposite the Sonesta hotel was FOUR E .Pounds a difference ofFive English Pounds we spoke to some of the locals who informed us that this guy is a bad man and has a reputation for ripping off tourists. So Beware"
50,“Egypt!”,"Luxor is a beautiful and quiet part of Egypt. If you want to get out of the crazy city life of Cairo, take an overnight train to Luxor and spend 3 or 4 days there. Or, go down the River Nile on a boat trip to get there. Either way, you will be glad that you did.Visit the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens. This is a must do! It's all that you've seen in pictures, on TV travel programs, and have read about.Be prepared for the heat if you go in the summer. Buy bottled water while in Egypt and be careful in the food that you eat. Dress appropriately, (women, dress conservatively; this is respecting their culture), layering with cotton with works when it gets chilly at night (and it does sometimes.)You will love the experience!"
40,“Wonderful trip to Luxor”,"We have just returned home after our first trip to Egypt. We travelled independently and spent 4 days in Cairo and experienced two nights at the beautiful Mena House. the traffic , pollution and the drivers in Cairo are just unbelievable. I am surprised anyone comes out of there alive.From there we moved on to Luxor for another 4 nights. We travelled from Cairo to Luxor by Egypt Air and were totally unimpressed by their lacsidasical attitude and tardiness. The airport at Cairo is an absolute nightmare. We arrived safely however. We were met as pre arranged by Asraf Boriy, a taxi driver and arranger of of private tours. He came highly recommended from another review on Trip Advisor. He took us to the Sheraton Hotel where we were staying. The difference between Cairo and Luxor is incredible. Everything is cleaner, more spacious, relaxed and no nightmare traffic. We told Ashraf what we wanted to visit during our stay and we agreed a fair price. He did not try to pressure us to do more. He actually threw in a few little extras at no cost. He arrived on time each morning with an English speaking guide. He was always, relaxed, polite and professional. We felt completely safe with him. He was always concerned that we were getting exactly what we wanted. One day we decided to change the itinerary and it was obviously no trouble for him and we allowed him to suggest some alternatives for that day which we were very pleased with. If anyone is interested in contacting him, just let me know and I would be very pleased to let you have his information. I highly recommend him.The Sheraton hotel has a good reception area and two very nice swimming pools. One is right beside the Nile. Our room was a bit shabby and dated but it served its purpose as we were only there for sleeping. There was construction and renovation of some of the rooms going on during our stay so thus it was really quite noisy in the day time.Overall Luxor was a very pleasant and fascinating experience"
50,“Back to the roots of civilisation”,"If you are looking for some adventure, if you're a budding Indiana Jones, or if you just want somewhere different, somewhere thats not any other run of the mill holiday resort then look no further than Luxor in The Arab Republic of Egypt.It's descibed as the worlds largest open-air museum, and that is a description that is exact down to the last detail.If you want to see the sights then this is the place to be, there are no Pyramids in Luxor, they are at Giza and Sakara on the outskirts of Cairo, you can see them from Luxor via a local travel agent for approx £110 for a day trip by air.In Luxor you have, Luxor Temple, Luxor Museum, Karnak Temple, The Valley of the Kings, The Valley of the Queens, The Mumification Museum (Worth a look 11 out of 10), The Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, The Collosus of Memnon, The Ramesuem and all these are but a taxi ride away, I recommend Makmoud Taxi Number 82 from outside the Sonesta St George.There are many other sights to see, always find a local agent and compare their prices with your tour operator, the local agents are reliable, after all they have to make a living at it and bad press don't pay the mortgage, try Jollies by the old winter palace or Lotus Travel at the lotus hotel, i've used both and was very satisfied with the service I received.Luxor also has a very nice promenade on the banks of the nile, you do have to get used to saying La Shokkran (No Thankyou), but the walk is nice and the people are pleasant. There are a good selection of bars and restuarants on the Corniche El Nil, overlooking the cruise terminals.Try a trip round the city by taxi or horse and carriage, you can see more from the carriage but taxi will take you further, i've walked a lot but this depends on the weather (gets hot in summer), so always be aware of your own abilities before you set off. in the summer, my Girlfriend and I used to walk from the Sonesta St George down past Luxor Temple, turn right then right again into El Souk St, walk through the Souk to the other side of the road into the American Temple (Mcdonalds) for a cold drink, try sitting on the second or third floor, it gives you a great view of the Temple across the square. One day a week they have a good covered-in market in the square.If you get the chance go and have a look at the Train Station, it's a classic example of old colonialism.Luxor is not for everyone, it's not spain, the locals will hassle you for Baksheesh (Tips) but that is there culture, look at everything before you go and enjoy."
50,“Great help with shopping and taking trips in Luxor”,"I've recently come back from Luxor where I had a great time with my family. I was recommended to ask for Justin, outside the Iberotel Hotel Kodak Shop by a friend of a friend, as he can take you shopping without getting hassle, organise any trips and generally save you a fortune. This all turned out to be true and took a lot of the strain out of our holiday, as we found the language difficult. We had a trip in a balloon, saw the Valley of the Kings and Queens, went to Dendra, found all the souvenires we wanted, without getting ripped off, and had a great time with him. Would recommend him and Luxor highly. We're saving up to go back."
30,“Good for seeing sights”,":Luxor is a very busy place, Centre is verty dirty and market unspeakably so. Touts are everywhere and a real pest. It is impossible to go shopping without being pestered except in the government run craft centre near Winter Palace. Restaurants are not very good, the best we found was El Hussein in Karnak village with menus from about £E58. Taxi drivers are very crafty to say 15 then claim they said 50, so be quite clear what you are prepared to pay. See other info on taxis. The temple of Karnak and the Luxor museum are just fantastic, but go to Karnak as soon as it opens at 7 as it is cooler and before it gets flooded with tourists. Take plenty of water as the cafe charges £1 a small bottle. Take an umbrella for shade and always wear sunscreen and a hat. Insect repellant essential.Valley of Kings and Queens also amazing and even hotter than Karnak. Alabaster shop on tour dearer than airport shop.Would only really recommend a visit to Luxor to see the sights and suggest December/January best months. . 3/4 days enough."
50,“Favorite in Egypt ( so far )”,"I travelled alone to Egypt in June 2008 for 2 weeks. Stayed in Cairo, Luxor, Sharm El Sheikh, climed Mt. Sinai... Luxor was my favorite city so far. Had small town feel after leaving Cairo. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Most all spoke English! Do not let the ""terrorist"" hype keep you from experiencing some of the most marvelous creations in the world. These people are no different than we are."
30,"“Beautiful place, shame about the hassle!”","The Nile Valley is such a beautiful location and really is everything I expected it to be. The sunset is gorgeous and I didnt tire of watching it at all!The sites at Luxor are fantastic with my favourite being Karnak as I had seen it so many times on the telly. The Valley of the Kings is also amazing but as its in the middle of the dessert make sure to take a hat and plenty of water. The vast scale of the tombs is quite awe inspiring and some of the art just so well preseved and colourful its like they were almost painted yesterday.All of the sites are pretty busy so we found it quite hard to take a picture without a tourist wondering into shot, but I guess this was to be expected. I would also recommend a trip to the Red Sea if you have time as the snorkelling here is really good, although the police convoys which escort you for the four hour trip are pretty crazy and sometimes it feels a little like wacky races which each coach vying for pole position. Horns and flashing headlights seem to be the name of the game!The main problem we found with Luxor is the hassle!!!! I have travelled all over the world but here it is just relentless and they really dont seem to understand the word no. There is no point trying to be polite it is better to just try not to make eye contact and ignore them. We did find this spoilt out holiday as for the most part we didnt venture far from our hotel when most evenings it would have been lovely to have just gone for a quite walk! Even the tourist police try and get in on the act by pointing out a shot to take a photo.Also something to take into consideration is that this is a poor country where nothing is free. Everyone has an agenda and their hand out and after a while it can become a real drag. Even the smallest action expects a tip, so if there is something you can do yourself (ie put a case onto a coach) then do it or snatch it out of the hand of the man who has grabbed it first! The main concept to get your head round is that people here expect a tip just for doing their job, which is fine if they have done it well but for even poor or minimal service a tip is expected, which I dont agree with at all!"
10,“out and about in luxor”,"stayed in nile palace hotel which was gorgeous,but just one step outside the hassle is horrendous,i knew it was bad from reading reviews,so was not niave but immediately surrounded by at least 4 people trying to sell stuff or horse ridesetc.they followed us all the way to the restaurant even though it was a 2 minute walk and we had declined their offers.also it is smelly,dirty,.. rubble and refuse everywhere.shops didnt look clean either,also when we did do a horse and carriage ride,the driver stated a price,then took us out of our way,we passed same shops 3 times,and then the price went up and after eventually sorting the price out he tried to say we hadnt given him a 50 egyptian pound note,then after much arguing he backtracked and made a silly excuse.this obviously put us off taking any more rides.as stated the hotel was great and a weeks nile cruise was brilliant,so luckily do have a lot of good memories,just didnt enjoy luxor outside the hotel"
50,“hot tips for Luxor.................”,"Embrace the culture...........for a great choice of trips at prices way better than your hotel/holiday ""rep"", go to Karnak Travel on the corniche (by the Winter Palace Hotel) and ask for Alaa to assist you.........For balloon trips, no one is better then Hod-Hod Soliman. You pay more but you are up FAR longer than the other balloons and you travel further..most just hover over the Valley of the Kings...Get to the Valley of the Kings etc as early as possible ie: 7am to avoid the heat and the crowds.....you cannot take camera/video into the Valley......it £8 extra to go into Tutankhamun tomb and not worth it as all his ""treasures"" are in the Cairo Museum.....A 4am start for a day trip to Cairo by air is a must...you can sleep on the plane!! The Cairo Museum is heaving any time of day...again you have to surrender camera/camcorder on entry, are given a ticket to collect later......if you try to sneek them through, don't bother..you go through an airport scanner just inside the building and the guards get VERY irate if they see them in your bags......Make sure you haggle..it's part of the fun and they expect it.....Take a felucca across the Nile, visit Luxor Temple at night for the Sound and Light, visit El Souk in the day and see the locals doing their shopping.....and..........if possible, go to see an Egyptian wedding.....there always seems to be one in a backstreet somewhere and they are AN EXPERIENCE....I have been to Egypt 9 times and never had a dodgy belly...main thing to avoid is handling the filthy bank notes then touching your mouth.......Most of all, enjoy.................the people are friendly, the culture fascinating and you are guaranteed sun......."
50,“Great bar to visit in Luxor”,"Just returned from two weeks in Egypt, one week on Nile Cruise and can honestly not think of anything bad to say about it. We finished off the holiday with one week in Nile Palace, and again had a great time, as ready for a break from visiting so many temples etc. Not that we didn't enjoy every trip, but we were pretty tired by the end of the first week.So looking for somewhere to have a relaxing night out was a top priority for us during the second week. Got to say we found it by visiting the Metropolitan bar close to where the boat had been berthed. Very friendly, BOGOF most nights, owner goes out of his way to welcome you to the bar and all the bar staff were really friendly as well.Luxor can be a bit tiresome with the number of people hassling you at the bazaars, and when walking around Luxor, but this bar is a nice quiet place to relax and we enjoyed our visits there.Can't recommend Egypt highly enough, friendly people who were always welcoming, sun all day long, and great places to visit. We are already looking to book for next year."
30,“Very Hot”,I did a day trip to Luxor and it would have been fantastic but it was too hot which spoiled it abit because you just wanted to get back on the air conditioned bus! I would love to go back and do it all again at a cooler time of year. We went in April.
50,“Excellent Luxor Tour Guide”,"I had a wonderful trip to Luxor, thanks to my outstanding tour guide. I wouldn't recommend trying to see the sites on your own - there is so much to see and lots of people waiting to take advantage of tourists.Here is the contact information for my tour guide.Name: Aladdin Abo ElhaggagE-mail: aladdinofegypt@yahoo.comMobile : 0020100009201www.luxorguidedtours.comI went to Luxor with three co-workers and had only one day to see all of the sites. We found Aladdin's web site and decided to hire him. He designed the perfect tour of the best of the east and west bank sites. He is an expert Egyptologist, and clearly explained everything we saw. We traveled comfortably in an air-conditioned bus (very important!), and avoided the large crowds from the tour buses as much as possible. Aladdin also arranged for a delicious lunch. All of the entrance fees, the bus, and lunch were included in the fee, which is a very good deal.My friends and I all agreed that without Aladdin, we would not have enjoyed this trip. He is very friendly but not pushy like many people we encountered in Egypt. You couldn't go wrong hiring Aladdin as your tour guide!"
40,“a trip down the river Nile”,"I have just come back from a nile cruise with discover egypt- what an experience, getting up at the crack of dawn and seeing some of the worlds greatest man made wonders. Don't miss out on the valley of kings, it is unbelievable, on the top just rock and sand, underneath great works of art, you can hardly beleive these tombs are thousands of years old. Do not miss a trip to Abu Simbel, you have to be up at 4 am but it is more than worth the effort. Be prepared to have an Egyptian tummy! even with cleaning your hands every time you enter the restaurant or bar on board you are more than likely to get a sickness bug-If you can try to book a second week by the coast- you will need the rest!"
40,“Hidden Treasures”,"Have stayed in Luxor twice now, I enjoyed it although did find I was hasstled more the second time and had to be careful with the shop keepers and the taxis as they all tried to rip us off. Which wears you down after a while.Had afternoon tea at The Old Winter Palace a couple of times, which was great, it was nice to get dressed up and sit and imgine the people who have stayed there over the years, it is really stepping back in time. The tea cost ?12.00 for two, which I think is pretty fair."
50,“Nile Cruises are the best!”,Just returned from the Nile in Egypt after cruising between Luxor and Aswan. It is the best holiday ever. I am now in love with Egypt! Everyone should go it is worth all the early mornings!
20,"“Good, Bad & downright dishonest”","The Sofitel karnik is without doubt the most beautiful setting imaginable. Set at the side of the Nile in beautiful gardens with a terrace and heated swimming pool to match.Outside the hotel is a different matter. Luxor is the dirtiest city I have ever visited. As soon as you set foot outside you will be accosted with people after money, children and adults alike, either to go in their taxi, carraige or on a trip. They will not take no for an answer. The children just want money and demand it following for miles harrasing as you go.The dishonest. A man called Ali Abdu or Captain Ali as he likes to be known. We were introduced to him early on in our holiday as someone who organises trips. We went on two very good trips with him and he gained our trust until he new we were going home and then he conned one of our party an 83 year old out of her deposit for a trip. He has 2 websites info@luxorfat.com and info@luxortoursegypy.com. If he has changed hi name, as well he may, he has a moter boat called Tom & Jerry & a feluca called Asterick. Stay clear of him and his favourite sayings ""honesty is the best policy"" and ""money is here today gone tomorrow but freinds are here forever"". Keep well away from him!"
50,“Luxor Tips”,"There are many excellent reviews for Luxor on TA. Here's our observations from our 7 day trip.Holiday from 16-23 Jan 2008. Chilly mornings. Daytime weather around 23*C Evening around 8*C. Coat or jacket for the evenings. Did have rain 1 day. Plenty of sun and warm enough to sit by the pool.No Mossies, just some flies.The cost of excursions with the Holiday Companies are much more expensive than using a local company. There are several tour companies situated near The Old Winter Palace Hotel (if you get a chance go and view the gardens).Here's who we used.1) JOLLYS TRAVEL Le190 each for a guided day trip to The V. of The Kings(3 tombs), V. of the Queens(2 tombs), Hatshepsuts Temple, Ramesseum, C. of Memmnon. . Mini bus transport with 6 other persons. Entrance fees included in price.0800 pick up from hotel. Back to hotel around 1330. Stopped at an Alabaster factory. Demo of pot making, tea and toilet break with a chance to buy if you like.(20 mins)It seems only around 12 tombs are open each day. Tut's tomb is an extra Le80 and our guide suggested it was not really worth seeing.It is quite possible to do all the above on your own. The tour takes you across the bridge in Luxor to The West Bank which adds 20 mins to your journey. You can get a ferry across the Nile. Takes less than 5 mins and then arrange a cab to the sites on the other side. After paying your entrance fees you will probably save about GBP5 each doing the trip on your own. Have to say that we thought our trip was well worth the money and the guide was excellent.2) KARNAK TRAVEL Le290 each for a Hot air balloon ride. Mini bus transport to ferry port. Boat crossing to West Bank. Tea and a biscuit on boat. Catch mini bus on other side. Drive to balloon site. This can be any field which the pilot found convinient to land in! There can be quite an undignified entrance into the balloon if there are no steps available. 2 of the ground crew whisk you up and help you into the basket. Once the basket is full, around 20 people the pilot does a safety talk. He also explains the landing routine which involves crouching one behind the other for several seconds. Although not too arduous, this could be quite a task if you have bad knees, hips or back. The pilot and ground crew say a little prayer!!!!!!!! and then your'e off. The ride lasts about 50 mins and you are at the mercy of wind direction as to where you end up. We got good views of the valley and the surrounding area. The pilot does take you down close to ground level and back up again. The take off is surprisingly smooth and landing only a slight bump. Back into the mini bus and the boat to The East Bank. Back in the hotel by 0900 and breakfast. Very enjoyable.Obviously the pick up and return times mentioned will vary as to where your hotel is.For LUXOR TEMPLE, KARNAK TEMPLE, LUXOR MUSEUM, MUMMIFICATION MUSEUM we did our own thing. Get a good guide book.Don't be put off by being approached numerous times each day by someone wishing to sell you something, offer you a trip or just wanting to talk. If you don't want to buy, the most positive way to deal with this is to smile say no thank (LA SHUKRAN) and keep walking. It probably won't work the first time. No one knows or cares that you have been asked several times in the space of a 100m for a taxi, boat or a scarf. It may well start to annoy you. Don't let this happen as it will spoil your trip. Everyone needs to make a living. Remember that sometimes you are being asked to spend 10p, 50p, 1 Euro, 1 US Dollar. Embrace the culture and you will be just fine.Felucca trips can be picked up for Le10 for an hour. An hour in a horse drawn carraige (CALLECHE) can be picked up for Le5. If you need a cab get the price before you step in. Make sure it's in Egyptian Pounds and the fare is there and back if needed.Bartering is a way of life.There is a shopping area behind Luxor Temple. Look for ' LE SOUK '. At the beginning of the market there is tourist area and a lot of hard sell. Alabaster, cotton tops, scarfs, spices, glassware. Walk through this part and you will come to the Egyptian Market. This is real life. Meat, poultry,food, spices, clothing. Keep walking through this market and you will come to an open drain. All manor of things are thrown in hear. The market is a proper view of everyday exsistence. We were advised by some of the locals not to venture down the street opposite the market on the other side of the drain. Told us it was closed. Never found out what that meant but we took their advice.There are quite a few children around the market who may try and beg from you (BAKSHEESH) is what they will say. You will probabley feel very uncomfortable with this. If you don't wish to give money, take some pens or crayons to give away.There are many places to eat out. Along The Corniche , the main street, there is a variety of cafes and restaurants. Easily less than Le100 for 2 with a drink. There's also Mcdonalds, Kentucky Chicken and Western Dishes available if you miss home. There are also many resaturants and bars away from The Corniche towards The Sonesta Hotel. Taxi or Calleche will take you there.There are cash machines in all the hotels and numerous banks. The daily exchange rate is the same in all banks. No need to shop around. Get some small notes or coins for tipping. Exchange rate was about Le10.60 = GBP1Take a toilet roll and wet wipes when out and about. Sometimes you only get a few sheets of loo roll. Ladies don't be surprised if some of the toilets are a little. Well you know. Men. We can cope.Great trip.Great country. Great people. Hope you enjoy it."
30,"“A Nile cruise this winter, and the temples.”","Hello, We got back from Luxor and Aswan 3 weeks ago.A few tips for fellow Nile Cruisers.Take lavender oil to mask the exotic unexplained smells you will encounter on your trip and in your room.You have been warned not to eat raw food, this is a good tip. Only eat very hot well cooked food on board. The Egyptians seem to be vegeterian, the meat is inedible. If travelling with kids, take a lot of snacks to fill up with, even tinned hot dogs. The best wine is Omar Khayam, like a good Rhone red. This is a good tip.Ladies need to cover their shoulders, a short sleeved dark shirt does the job. Shorts are not cool in Egypt. It is a really biblical country, it's all horse and cart and sailboats. Leave your mobile phones and laptops behind. Connections are hopeless. Bliss. No one can contact you and vice versa. You will lose weight as the food served on board is pretty unrecognisable, and the salads are off limits. The Old Cataract Hotel at Aswan is great. If you need to be spoiled , this is the place to be. We ate there and had drinks on the terrace looking down the Nile. A very well run Hotel, and you must look the part.Loved Karnak Temple, we got a guide inside the temple, who spoke English. We took him also to the Valley of the Kings the next day by taxi from Luxor. The Valley's tombs are opened randomly. Fabulous. Take a hat and spend about 2-3 hours there. No photos allowed inside the tombs, but your mind will be overwhelmed by the beauty of the pictures inside.. Take water too. There's a little train bus that transports you around the site.Don'y miss Luxor Museum, it has so many beautiful items and is well laid out. Also The Luxor temple is beautiful., but my favorite was Karnak at sun down."
40,“Luxor in a Day”,"The alarm went off at 2:45 am - time to wake up! Armed with pillows, breakfast boxes and pullovers, we boarded our 3:15 am bus an headed north towards Safaga. Three hours and 12 pit-stops (to pick up other Luxor ""pilgrims"") later, we entered the bus convoy terminal where we transferred to the ""1-day English-speaking tour"" bus. The Egyptian government authorizes 3 police-escorted convoys per day to depart to and from Luxor (total 6 convoys both directions). Since it's currently peak season, convoys can consist of over 200 buses! Our bus is part of the day's first convoy of 178 buses, departing Safaga at 7 am (the other two depart at 9 am and 5 pm respectively).Luxor is a popular destination this time of year (winter months) because the weather is sunny and mild (20-23 °Celcius). An important part of the Egyptian history, this city is commonly known as the world's largest open air museum, and it has been a tourist destination since Diodorus of Sicily visited in 60 BC. The beginning of recorded history in Egypt dates back to 3200 BC, when the Egyptian pharaoh Narmer unified the whole country. Between his reign and the arrival of Alexander the Great in 332 BC, Egypt was ruled by thirty dynasties, roughly divided into Old Kingdom (capital city Cairo), Middle Kingdom (capital city Fayum) and New Kingdom (capital city Luxor). The dynasties of the Old and Middle Kingdoms were the pyramid builders, their pharaohs entombed in these huge structures. The pharaohs of the New Kingdom saw how easily these visible pyramids were plundered by thieves, and decided to build their tombs underground, cut deep into the limestone hills in the Valley of Kings from 1500 BC onwards. When Alexander the Great arrived in 332 BC, upon seeing the numerous gateways to the Egyptian temples, he changed the name of this city to ""Thebes"" – ""City of 100 Gates"". The Islamic period began in 640 AD, and the Arabs renamed this city of temples ""el-Uqsor"" – ""Palaces"". Luxor is the European form of the Arabic name.Our 4-hour journey to Luxor took us through the Eastern Desert, with one pit-stop in between. I had decided not to drink more water than necessary because the only accessible toilet was the tiny cubicle in the bus for 46 passengers! At the halfway point (district border), the Safaga police handed us over to their Qena counterparts. Not only did our escorts change, but the landscape as well. As we approached the Nile valley, the arid and mountainous land gave way to green and fertile farms irrigated by canals fed from River Nile. The closer we got to the populated areas, the practicality of the convoys became obvious – the police stops local traffic 6 times a day for the buses to pass, 2-way roads are converted into 2-lane ""highways"" to facilitate smooth journey for the hoards of tourist through the villages and towns.As we sped through the countryside, slowing down only at the numerous security checkpoints, we caught glimpses of village life typical along the river valley throughout Egypt. Despite covering only about 6% of the total area of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta are the most important regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of the population (15% Christians, 85% Sunni Muslims). The population is booming as well, apparently by 1 million every 9 months – that's one baby born every 23 seconds!Farming continues to be the way of life along the Nile Valley – main crops are sugar cane, tomatoes, bananas, cabbage, pumpkins and corn. Farmers here still go about things manually – the majority is very poor, harvesting earns them on average 50 EGP per day per person (1 Euro ~ 8 EGP). This is barely enough to cover the daily needs of a family of 6-10 persons. Hence, it is very common for young boys aged 10-11 onwards to stop schooling to help their families make ends meet. These simple folk build their homes on the farms, the bricks made from mud dug out from the canals. Living in mud-brick homes is not that risky in this part of Egypt because it rains only 4 days per year.Tour Itinerary* East Bank: Al Karnak, lunch* West Bank: Valley of Kings, Hatshepsut's Temple, alabaster workshop, Colossi of Memnon* Boat trip across the Nile to East Bank* Government Institute of PapyrusAl Karnak: This vast complex of temples, obelisks and sphinxes took more than 1300 years to construct (work began in 16 BC). Approximately 30 pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling the complex to reach a size and diversity not seen elsewhere. The Karnak temple was dedicated mainly to the so-called Theban triad, made up of the Egyptian gods Amun-Re, his consort the goddess Mut, and their son, the moon god Khonsu. The great earthquake of 27 BC destroyed most of the temple complex.Valley of Kings: Used by the pharaohs of the New Kingdom to house their underground tombs after they stopped building pyramids like their ancestors. So far, archaeologists have discovered 62 tombs (""used"" over a period of 500 years), but only 24 belong to the pharaohs. It is a myth that workmen were killed upon completion of a king's tomb to protect its location. If it were true, there would not be enough skilled workmen to go around! Men with such skills were often involved in other projects as well, tombs for members of the royal family, in the Valley of Queens and elsewhere.The most recent tomb discovered is that of the boy King Tutankhamun, on 4.11.1922 by the archaeologist Howard Carter. It took Carter and his team 10 years to move the tomb's entire contents (except mummy and casket) to the National Museum in Cairo. On 4.11.2007, 85 years after the 3000-year-old boy pharaoh's golden-enshrined tomb and mummy were discovered, the face of King Tutankhamun was unveiled in public for the first time. The mummy is housed in a climate-controlled glassbox, with only its shriveled leathery black face and feet showing under the linen covering (unfortunately recording devices strictly forbidden). The 19-year-old king was presumably murdered by his high priest-cum-prime minister Ay (fatal blow to the back of his head). Ay usurped the throne, and ordered King Tutankhamun's 17-year-old widow killed as well for refusing to marry him.Hatshepsut's Temple: Hatshepsut was the only female pharaoh of Egypt. A daughter of Tuthmose I and first wife of Tuthmose II, she became regent for the 6-year-old Tuthmose III (son of Tuthmose II's second wife) on his succession, but after seven years in this role she took on kingly aspects and titularies. While not denying Tuthmose III's kingship, she was the senior partner, ruling Egypt for 22 years (died 54 years old). After her death, Tuthmose III appeared to have organized a campaign to obliterate part of her memory in revenge. One of her shrines in Karnak was dismantled, and in many other places her figures were cut, and her names were replaced with that of Tuthmose III. Fortunately, her temple at Deir-el-Bahari was still well-preserved.Colossi of Memnon: The two statues are all that remains of the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III, which would have been one of the largest structures in Egypt. A popular tourist attraction, primarily during the Roman Period.Towards the end of the tour, we crossed back to the East Bank of Luxor by motorboat, an easy ride over the waters of the legendary River Nile. This is Egypt's lifeline – the Nile made the land surrounding it extremely fertile when it flooded annually. It would be difficult to imagine how civilization would have developed if not for this river.At the ""Government Institute of Papyrus"", we were given a brief demonstration of how papyrus is made, although I personally think the place is more a fixed-price showroom of Egyptian-motif paintings (albeit of good quality) on papyrus paper.By 6 pm, our bus has rejoined the convoy returning to Safaga. The journey back to Marsa Alam took a bit longer than 7 hours, but since we were so exhausted from the day's programme, we did not really notice. Our bus dropped us off at Kahramana at 1.30 am – it has been a long day!Verdict:Luxor in one day is exhausting, but if that’s all the time one has, it is worth the 14-hour bus ride. The tour operator Blue Sky (Thomas Cook affiliate) organized a very compact itinerary. We would have preferred to spend more time exploring Al Karnak, and do without the pit-stops at the alabaster workshop and the ""Government Institute of Papyrus"" – thinly veiled attempts at getting us tourists to part with our cash, but then I suppose that’s doing something for the local economy.Given the time constraints, for the comfort and convenience of being ferried from one must-see sight to another, having lunch and all entrance fees covered (except King Tut’s tomb 80 EGP), and being accompanied by a qualified archaeologist-cum-part-time guide who provides useful insight to the local culture – one could say the package was worth the 105 Euro per person price tag."
50,“A cultural trip of a lifetime”,"Greetings all future travellers.Luxor is fantastic destination. My wife and two boys have just returned from a one week trip. I only wish it could have been more.As our trip was made better by reports on this forum, we like to give a long report on what we found and experienced. So here goes.Arrival/VisasSimple. Whilst on the plane you fill out an immigration card. Once inside the airport, go to the banks on the left hand side, anyone will do. Hand over your passport, immigration card and £10. They will stick a Visa in your passport. Your then queue up at the immigration booths on the right hand side. Open your passport on the Visa page and they stamp it. That's it. Note on your return, you will be given another immigration card when you check in for your return flight. Similar procedure but no payment, it is just stamped to say you have left.MoneyAs most trip advisors say there is no problem in getting money in Luxor. There are plenty of ATMs. However, be sure to let your bank / credit card company know you are going BEFORE. We forgot, and had a temporary security restriction placed on our cards which meant we had to phone up to get it removed.ChildrenMost entry prices for places to see are available for half-price but only on production of a student identity card. We managed to get our 13 year old in without a card but our 16 year old had to pay full price. If you have a card, take it with you.Our HotelWe stayed at the Winter Palace Pavillion. The Pavillion is built in the same architectural style as the Old Winter Palace and looks much better than the New Winter Palace. Quite honestly, the New Winter Palace is an architectural disaster. Anyway our rooms were great overlooking the main garden. Rooms were cleaned everyday, sheets changed everyday, beds unfolded at night time with petals from the garden on the pillows - wonderful. Food followed a themed night arrangement and was well cooked and pleasant. Breakfast followed a fair mixture of cooked breakfast, cold meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries etc. You can sit inside or out on the terrace. The Saturday night was an Egyptian night which was good fun with Egyptian dancing, singing, belly dancers and a rather strange magician (whom we couldn't hear).The staff are all very helpful, pleasant and polite. The swimming pool comprises a rectangular pool with a deep section and a linked circular pool around a cocktail bar. Plenty of sun loungers with soft comfy mattresses and towels are provided at no cost.TripsAs you will have probably read on other forums, do your research and you will not be disappointed or ripped off. The prices indicated below are as of October 2007.Cairo - Pyramids, Citadel and Cairo MuseumWe pre-booked this, following recommendations on this website with Janet and Mohammed at Real Life Egypt. This cost us 600LE (Egyptian Pounds) per person but this includes all entrance fees and lunch. You have to book your own flights to Cairo from Luxor with Egypt Air but this is fairly simple to do. We had a fantastic Egyptologist explain to us a lot of things and we went around all the sights in our own time. We started at the Pyramids (50 LE pp), these are quite awe inspiring but they were busy. You can go down into the second pyramid (cost 25LE extra). It is good fun but you have to bend up double and it is quite steep and hot inside. We then travelled down to the Sphinx. There are a lot of sellers here and the hassle began to drain us somewhat.After we went to the Citadel (40LE pp but included in our price). Here is the Alabaster Mosque. Quite a fascinating place. Ladies you are given a green cape to cover up your arms and shoulders. This made our boys laugh as Mum ended up looking like someone out of Harry Potter.After this,we went for lunch on a boat on the Nile and then onto the Cairo Museum (50LE pp but included in our price). Here we had all the hieroglyphics explained and their meanings which helped us enormously. There are two rooms with ""The Royal Mummies"". Entry is an extra 50LE for adults and 25LE for students. However the same ticket is used for both rooms and you see virtually the same in each room - so work it out. One of the rooms has the mummy which has only recently been identified as Hatshepsut.Cairo traffic is absolutely amazing. Where there are three marked lines, they will make five lines. There are few traffic lights and you have to cross the road by virtually tapping the bonnet of the car you want to pass in front of. Hillarious but great fun. All the cars have dents, scratches.Half-day trip from Luxor to Valley of Kings, Hatshepsut and Medinat Habu and Colossi of Memnon.We arranged this trip with our friend Mohammed (different one to the one above) who organised transport and an English speaking guide.We started at Hatshepsut Temple (Al-Deir Al-Bahari Temple). (25LE pp). You start off with a short train journey to the temple (4LE pp). The background is impressive but it was very hot. The heiroglyphics were quite impressive but not quite what I had been expecting. On the way out you have to run a gauntlet of traders trying to sell plaster of paris statues and egyptian scarves.Next onto the Valley of the Kings (70LE pp). This gives you entry to three tombs. We also bought additional tickets for the boys to visit Tutankhamun (40LE pp). We visited the tombs of Ramesses III and Ramesses IX and one other. Fantastic frescoes and hieroglyphics, which were now better understood following our trip to Cairo. Watch out for the guides inside the tombs who will point things out to you but know absolutely nothing about their meaning and then ask you for a tip!Finally onto Medinat Habu. This was great. It would appear this is often missed out on most half-day trips but it is a must see. It is enormous and the carved hieroglyphics are fantastic, especially at around mid-day when the shadows make them stand out so much more. Look for the cut-off hands and male genitalia on the LHS in the third hall (I think) indicating the men lost in a battle.Karnuk Temple - Sound and Light Show (75LE pp)Make your own way there. Check which day and time does the show in English. This was not quite what we expected. A story is given as you wonder through the buildings and various lights are switched on and dimmed off as you go around. You finish at the Sacred Lake, which has a great reflection of the temple but the brightly coloured minarete of the mosque in the background is a bit of a juxtaposition. The show lasts about an hour. It was a bit over dramatic for me with the voices of kings and queens etc.Hot Air Ballon (300LE pp)This was fantastic and againa must-do. We booked with Sinbad. It starts early at 4.30am pick up. You are given Egyptian tea and a cake on the crossing over the Nile. We took off at about 5.40am. It was great seeing the sunrise and the views over the Valley of the Kings and Hatshepsut and Medinat Habu were great. We landed in a field of sugar cane at which point the farmer was not too impressed so we took off again and landed somewhere else. The whole flight lasted just over an hour. Be warned the heat from the burners is quite intense. Take a hat to make sure you are not burned.Camel Ride (40LE pp)Booked at Jolleys, just outside the Old Winter Palace. This was a fun day and the boys had good fun on the camels. Jolleys has a lot of tours and some of the best prices in the town.Village TripMohammed arranged for us to go to his village where we had dinner. This was probably the best day as we saw and talked to the locals, visited the local market where they traded everything. Fantastic photos of donkeys, carts and local children, who found us somewhat strange and ran after us with enormous smiles. We were even escorted around by the local tourist police - we felt like royalty. The boys played football in the dusty streets with the local boys and after the children returned from scholl we bough t a crate of Colas which cost us 1LE each (yes, 10p per bottle) and ahnded them to all the kids who laughed and drank. A wonderful day.Other InformationWater is available in the local shops. Expect to pay 25LE for a 1.5 litre bottle.The Caleche operators are persistant. Warning, there is always a market every day. Agree a price for all of you and agree a return. We paid 10LE for the four of us. However they do take you to a family run shop where you can expect to see something being made and you will be expected to buy - oh and there always seems to be a 50% discount - just for you. We found walking on the opposite side of the street to the direction of travel was best.Shopping - This is an art. If you like the hassle and the bargaining - enjoy it. We found it difficult but picked up some nice things, a large 14"" alabaster vase for 200LE for example. If you do not like the hassle, shop at Gaddis & Co, next door to the Old Winter Palace. The prices here are reasonable and they have the prices marked and you get absolutely no hassle - it is their company policy!TaxisThese are relatively inexpensive and you can get to most places within Luxor for around 10 to 15 LE. Agree your price beforehand.On arrival at Luxor airport, they tried to charge us £20 to get to our hotel, it was only after we asked the local policeman to check that this was reduced to 40LE (£4).TippingEverywhere this is a necessity. Get some change from you hotel. The 1LE notes are really manky but make great tips even though some may complain. Usually tips are round 5LE, 10LE and 20LE depending on the service provided.That is about it. I hope you find this posting useful.Enjoy your holiday."
40,“great value egypt”,"Just back from Luxor. A great value holiday.The trips were well run and the guide, Hussein was well informed and spoke excellent English, even told jokes! Our coach was air conditioned with a toilet and since only half full had plenty room. We bought 3 extra trips, Abu Simbel. Karnak temple sound and light and a hot air balloon. The sound and light show was not worth the money, all sound no light, but the other 2 were well worth the money. The 3 hour coach trip tp Abu Simbel was not so good so I'd consider the air option for £20 more. I was surprised to find that I should have brought £1 coins rather than change money to Egyptian. I hadn't realised that I could have brought currency from Britain which would have been easier than trying to change once there. Not much chance to pay by card anywhere we went. One couple with Barclay’s cards couldn't get cash from any bank or Thomas Cook in any of the towns we visited. Being two ladies we didn't wander but the couples who did found the locals very friendly unlike the market vendors.Our fellow travellers were really good company.I am delighted with my first venture to Egypt and would do much more research before going again so that I could understand the heiroglyphs and friezes of the gods and pharoahs.A brolly for a sun shade was a God send as was my Mum's old spanish fan."
40,"“Latest Travel Advice, Reviews and Information August 2007”","Luxor is the modern centre of the ancient City of Thebes predating the 11th Dynasty Middle Kingdom reign of Mentuhotep around 2134BC. The city rose to prominence during the so called 'Golden Age' about 1500BC growing in stature as the seat of power for 18th to 20th Dynasty Pharohs. Arguably the most famous being Pharoh Tut Ankh Amum - the boy King, but in reality, of moderate significance alongside the great millitary might of Ramses II, son of Seti I, who fought the Hittite wars. 32 Pharohs reigned at Thebes during the Golden Age.The results of this advanced ancient civilisation are the major draw to Luxor and the area has been referred to as the world's greatest open air museum. My advice is to come once to look, then plan to return one day to truly 'see'.Luxor lies on the banks of the Nile about 800km South of the Mediterranean coast and is home to about 400,000 people. Much of the city is contained on the East Bank, known as the 'City of the Living'. Smaller settlements lie on the West Bank which also provides access to the historical sights of The Valley of the Kings, Valley of the Queens, Deir el-Bahri and Tombs of the Nobles - hence its name, 'City of the Dead'.Essentials before you travel:***Essentials before you travel include a pen, anti-bacterial hand gel; wet toilet wipes; small denomination Egyptian Pounds (for tips); over shoulder bag or satchel and a 1litre stainless steel flask (believe me, having a drink of iced water available is worth the extra weight!)***Getting there:Luxor is now a major tourist destination for travellers from the UK and flights, both scheduled and charter arrive daily. The normal route is to fly from the UK directly to Luxor, expect a flight time around 5- 5.5hrs. Luxor airport is small and consists of one main runway which can accomodate medium range aircraft. Nervous flyers needent worry about bumps, bangs and excessive braking! The terminal buildings are all fairly new and air conditioned. There are no 'air-bridges' so you leave the aircraft by steps to a waiting bus which takes you to the terminal. ***Make sure you have a pen to complete the essential Visa forms*** it will save you time! You will be handed forms for the Visa application which you must pay for in UK Sterling £10 per person. Once you complete the form, you will be shown where to hand it in, given an entry Visa and allowed to queue for Passport Control. Before approaching the Customs Desk, your passport will be checked by the Police. You will get used to having your details checked, rechecked and checked again! Apart from that, passage is smooth and the baggage reclaim is speedy. Over the service road are coaches waiting to take you to the various hotels. The airport reps were very organised. ***Transport your own baggage otherwise you will be charged £5 for moving your bags about 100metres***Transfers:Transfers are trouble free and last about 20 minutes on an air-conditioned new-ish coach. Slightly worrying are the donkeys, goats, cyclists and people lying in the road but it all adds to the experience! Some journeys can take much longer depending on the number of hotel 'drops'.Getting around:Luxor is a fairly compact city with three distinct main roads around which much of the 'tourist sector' is based. The road along the Nile from Luxor Temple heading South is known as The Corniche and accomodates many of the larger hotel chains. Heading East away from the river takes you to the markets (Television Street), Post Office and Train Station situated on Station Road which runs East behind Luxor Temple.Taxis are painted blue and white and are clearly marked. In the windscreen your driver should display his permit and licence. Fares are ridiculously cheap. Crocodile Island to Luxor centre will cost 15EP about £1.40 one way. If you tip your driver well he will tend to wait for you at no charge, even if your trip takes hours. A taxi to Valley of the Kings will cost 100EP (about £9.30) for the return trip with your driver waiting for you. This price generally includes taking one of the small ferry boats which line up at the jetty near Luxor Temple. There are no other ways to cross the river in Luxor. Ferry boat personnel can be pushy. Practice saying 'NO THANKYOU' politely but firmly. I didn't haggle for anything since the prices to me are so cheap.Unless you really want to, avoid jumping on the first Felluca (sail boat) or Calleche (horse drawn carriage), that you see. Prices are high and you will have difficulty getting off. Usually, there's too little wind to propel the Felluca so your romantic peaceful sail will be accompanied by the rumble and fumes from a diesel engine. Calleche drivers have an in built GPS system to take you to their family's shop/house/friend and not where you actually want to go. I found that smiling nicely and then saying that you're leaving for the airport in a few minutes gets rid of them. **Safety note** Whilst there is a reasonable traffic system in place, always be aware that many animal powered vehicles ignore the normal rules of the road and often move towards the flow of traffic. I was almost run over by a camel train. Cyclists and motorcyclists do the same, red lights are there for decoration and any type of traffic jam forces all the cars to defy death on the opposite carriageway. On one of our trips we ran over a policeman who stuck his AK47 through the window at our driver until he realised our poor man had a fare (it was the policeman's fault). Generally, getting about should be done by taxi which are speedy, cheap and if you're really lucky, you get a seatbelt that works!Sightseeing:I wont repeat much that has been written about the wealth of historical sites except to update some prices on the places we visited (they are typical examples)**Always ask for student reductions or half price tickets for your children otherwise you may be charged full rate**:Luxor Museum: 70EP/35EP - filled with impressive artifacts from the tombs and including the mummified body of Ramses II. Suggested time allowance 2hrs. Closed in the afternoon. Best time to visit - 10am.Mummification Museum: 40EP/25EP - Interesting examples of various mummified people and animals.Suggested time allowance 45mins Best time to visit - after the Luxor museum.Valley of Kings: 70EP/35EP for 3 tombs (you choose as you wander around) - Annoying, hassling stall holders selling tat at the entrance. Annoying mini train drivers selling postcards (you need to get the train up the valley. 2EP from hut next to the ticket office). They could do with a board at the entrance telling you which tombs are open or closed (only about ten tombs are open) which would save you time in the excessive heat. All have good points and bad. Some are stunning, most are very hot. Avoid Tut Ankh Amun as its an extra charge to see one of the dullest tombs in the Valley. Guides in the tombs dont care about protecting the decorations and will allow you to take photographs or clamber under sarchophogus for a healthy tip. Please dont do it! The tombs need preserving.Suggested time allowance minimum 2hrs. Best time to visit - early morning. Nb. Tour companies show up at midday when the temperature in the shade reaches 50 degrees. ***No water available, few toilets, some shaded rest zones***Karnak Temple: 50EP/35EP - Stunning example of the Golden Age of Egypt's rulers. Vast site that rarely appears populated. Can be wandered around and explored at leisure. Avoid pushy guides near the ticket office but try to attach yourself to an English speaking guide with a party as you wander. Of note must be the collonade chamber, the largest in the world. Sadly the roof has caved in but in its heyday, the stone ceiling would have been pierced to catch the rays of the sun as it traversed the sky which reflected upon a mirrored alabaster floor. Stunning statues, hieroglyphic writing and carvings. Bad points, piles of rubbish, guides on the take, filthy sacred lake (be ashamed Luxor) and worst of all the first thing I noticed was graffiti etched over 3,000 year old hieroglyphs which said 'x woz ere UK 2007'.Suggested time allowance minimum 3hrs. Best time to visit - early morning. ***No water available, few toilets (the attendant wanted a £5 tip), some shade******For disabled travellers - in general many of the pavements and roads are difficult to negotiate for disabled people. Karnak is almost a building site and you may find access restrictive***Balloon flight: Price per person varies - minimum found 350EP, maximum (if bought in the UK) 1300EP (£135). I found a local man by the ferries named Fatia who negotiated a rate of 500EP each (about £48). The company I used was called HOD HOD SOLIMAN and is the oldest established balloon company in Egypt. All pilots must be FAA qualified whoever you use. HOD HOD is recommended because there seems to be a pecking order amongst the various balloon companies. HOD HOD has the area flying over the desert to close to Valley of the Kings/Queens, Tombs of the Nobles etc. You will be collected from your hotel usually around 5am, taken to the ferry, offered coffee then transported over the river to the West bank where mini buses take you to the launch site. This is a MUST DO BEFORE I DIE MOMENT. Rising gently over the desert as the sun rises over the horizon turning the desert blood red is an amazing experience. Our flight lasted much longer than the others - about 90 minutes and we were given certificates, music and dancing on our safe landing.*** People with mobility difficulties can still be helped into the basket though landings can (rarely) be bumpy***Travelling for the adventurous: Travel in Egypt in this political climate is difficult and you are warned not to travel away from tourist areas (which are protected by armed tourist and regular police or the millitary). Trips to Hurghada for example will be accompanied by armoured cars and at least three or four armed police vehicles.We wanted to see some of the true face of the country and hired our friendly taxi driver as my official guide. If you decide to do something like this my advice is to make sure your guide is known to your hotel, be seen leaving, tell people where you are heading, leave expensive property behind.We instructed our driver to take us away from the city, to small desert villages, farming communities and show us real life. We are told that this carries a dangerous risk but in practice we found a wonderful population that embraced us fully. They showed us their homes, offered us food and drink. Many people would surround us having rarely (if ever) met Westerners. The poverty was levelling yet these people showed a real and genuine liking for us. We were never asked for money or hassled - in fact people feared for my safety as I wandered in search of (and found) wild cobra and scorpion. They would hold out a hand if you stumbled, wanted to play football with you in the street. There is no English spoken at all, sign language and a drawing pad helped. Ask before taking photographs, smile, sit and take interest and you will be rewarded. I photographed two old men ploughing a field with a wooden plough and two skinny oxen in a scene that could be 4,000 years old. When I showed them the photograph on the digital camera they thought it was magic and gave praise to Allah - our worlds are very far apart. These trips into the unknown brought more understanding of Islam to us and made the holiday.Suggested time allowance minimum 5hrs. Best time to visit - early morning onwards. ***Refer to current Foreign Office safety advice*** We paid 100EP per day but I tipped my guide a further 50EPFood and drink: There are two schools of thought here. You can attempt to eat the local food in local cafes or restaurants or you can eat in the hotels. We did both. Native food can range from sheep testicles in Aysh (a bread) to cow's hoof soup (not sure if the hoofs are ever cleaned). However, the type of food isn't really the issue, its the cleanliness of the establishment that is. Food may not be washed in bottled water so stomach upsets are likely. Meat is considered a luxury and so many dishes are vegetarian in nature. Molokhiyya is a vegetable made into a soup. There are many varied salads, tomatoes, lettuce and olives. Mezze are small dishes of varied dips, similar to Tapas, mostly crushed beans, hummus and seseme. Fish dishes are very evident both freshwater Nile Perch and Red Sea catches. Lamb kebabs are spicy and tasty. Local chicken are tough and chewy (in fact many local meats are). Pork is considered unclean.Hotel food is far more Westernised and of good quality. I ate at the Sonesta St George 5*, beautiful food and excellent service two courses for about £18 with wine. The Chinese restaurant at the Hilton was fab with fantastic three course meal for 2 £20.Many people have recommended Snobs in Luxor. I cant! The service was good but the food, patchy. Best was the Tuna salad worst was the kebab. Pricy too considering the quality.***Local restaurants tend not to serve alcohol***My advice. Eat at the best hotels at the start of your holiday so that any illnesses wont effect your sightseeing. Later in your trip when you wont be straying too far from a toilet, become more adventurous!General advice:There is virtually no crime in Luxor. Punishments are swift and harsh but its worth keeping high value notes out of sight and small bills in your wallet.MANY PLACES DO NOT HAVE THE FACILITY TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDSDo not drink the Nile! Sounds stupid but I needed to eat and drink with locals to gain their trust for our adventures and spent a week on antibiotics.Avoid getting drunk! Your hangover will be ten times worse when you're dehydrated the following day.Do not approach domestic animals in rural areas. Rabies is widespread. We saw one dog suffering from the disease.Clean your hands with anti-bacterial gel after handling money, shaking hands etc.When eating with your hands in the company of local people, avoid offence and eat only with your RIGHT HAND. If you are left handed it is acceptable to use your left.Hope you find this review useful :)"
50,“Best thing i have ever done!!!!”,I have just returned from a holiday on the King tut 1 in Luxor. This is the best holiday i have had so far. If you are interested in Egyptian history then this cruise is the thing to do.Firstly the cruise ship that we stayed in was lovely. I t was really well air conditioned and had a very lovely interior. The food on the ship was beautifull always hot and fresh and there was a great mixture for all tastes. The cruise staff were so warm and welcome that they made you feel really at home. All of the excursions that we did were brilliant. but they would not have been half as good with out the wonderful tour guide JOHN. He was so knowledgeable and had such a great sense of humour. I would recomend this man to anyone who really wants to know about the egyptians and to see the sights. Also one thing that i would also recomend is the balloon ride over the valley of the kings and Abu Symbol. We had to pay extra for both of these but they were defonatly worth doing!!!!!!!
50,“Upper Egypt: Not for the narrow minded”,"Having worked as an hotelier myself, we used to say within the industry that for every 10 people who complain, there is only one who remembers to give praise. So this time I decided to be the one who gives praise (not customary for me at that).Only recently, my husband and I had the most fantastic, unforgettable, magical holiday ever! We went on an 8 day Nile Cruise but spent 3 of those days in Luxor.We visited Karnak Temple on our first day of stay. I found the temple a highly emotional experience, something that cannot be described in words, something beyond any sensory perception; something that has to be seen with the heart not just with the eyes.I later on, discovered that seeing with the heart is what was necessary all throughout visiting Egypt. Luxor and the whole of Egypt are magical places, but one has to be able to see past certain things like the poverty, the heat, the dust.Many people have concerns when traveling to Egypt about being hassledby the local traders, some people even worry about getting mugged etc.I would like to offer some reassurance, by saying that no unpleasantincidents happened while we were there, no one got mugged, or lost anypossessions, in fact I felt safer in Egypt than I did on Gatwick airport. The people were poor, and yes they did hassle you to buy their stuff, but it only took a firm ""No"" to settle things down, without any offence or aggression on either side. The locals are peaceful, friendly people, they would not steal from a tourist, but they would hope that they earn a living by selling souvenirs, etc.- all in the spirit of a good, friendly business transaction, no aggression or unpleasantness.From our point of view, we had been well briefed not to encourage certain cheeky behaviors by feeling that we have to tip all the time; they will try things on like offer you hand to get of a boat, when you don't really need help at all, and then they will hope to get a tip off you. If I felt that the help wasn't required and I didn't ask for it, I'll simply say ""No, thank you!"" - causes no offence if you are firm from the start.Generally, feel free to be firm and decline giving a tip, if you do not think it is appropriate. One of the best things that happened to us was having a fantastic tour guide Abou, who also works freelance for a company called step2egypt.Abou being local himself, not only did an excellent job in briefing us on how to handle the local ""hassles"", but also with his warm, sincere and helpful approach contributed to this holiday becoming an unforgettable one. And being on the subject of tour guides, we were lucky because Abou had not only the tour guide qualification of Egypt (equivalent to our HND) but also a doctorate in Egyptology. So, as a word of advice to those who go on package tours or solo holidays, ask, inform yourself about the qualifications of your guide! Because this person is there not only to take your through the magical world of the Ancients, but also to help you with any other advice, arrangements and negotiations to smooth your journey through the world of today's modern Egypt. Someone with intelligence and tact is priceless in a situation like that.The other people who made our holiday fantastic were the staff and crew on the Nephtis boat, they could not do enough for us!Finally, if you do visit Luxor and you want to do a spot of jewellery shopping, I do hope you will visit my friends in a shop called Madonna. They were the only people (and we visited many jewellery shops) who were happy to tell me the price per gram from the start, who had their scales in a highly visible position and who offered me half of the price of what everyone else did (after some bargaining of course). This shop was the first shop we visited in Luxor on our first day, I chose my item we agreed on a price. I didn't buy, thinking I might be able to get a better deal elsewhere. A week later, exhausted from bargaining with jewellers who were clearly intended on ripping me off, we went back to this shop in Luxor and bought the item and a few other things.To those of you who have made up their mind to visit Egypt, I wish a safe and enjoyable trip... and remember to keep an open mind!"
30,“amazing ruins worth seeing once but wouldn't go back”,"i went to luxor for a week in easter 07 with my family (mum, dad, sister (25) and me (19). We were glad we went to see the amazing ruins but will not be going back. I know it's good to have a little culture shock but I nearly cried on the coach from the airport to the hotel (nile palace) because of all the horse and carriages giving ignorant tourists rides; nearly all the horses were ridiculously skinny/lame/had bloody cuts and sores/cud barely pull the carriage full of tourists,were getting whipped ridiculously, and i hav to say this kinda ruined tne whole trip for me, it was so depressing,and i want to advise all the tourists not to go on them, as our tour guide did. some people in luxor still live like they did thousands of years ago, in mud huts and washing and bathing in the nile, which is really interesting to see, but gets a bit too much i tought when its right outside your hotel. you get alot of stares being white(and i think being blonde), and men offer camels to marry you! its quite like morrocco.the valley of the kings, karnak temple and luxor museum are definitely a must see, the mummification museum is tiny,expensive,and not worth the money as theres not much there. we also went to the karnak light and sound show, which is a bit of a joke but its entertainment for an evening; there's not a lot to do at night as you are advised only to eat in the nice hotels, otherwise you risk getting ill. a few people at our hotel were slightly ill, from food and the heat( 40degrees the day we visited valley of the kings).the bazaar is definitely worth going to, selling allsorts, like spices, souveniers, really nice scarves, 'designer' bags and sunglasses, trinkets etc. we did book to do the balloon ride one morning, but we cancelled it as every morning was really hazy.we were definitely ready to come home at the end of the holiday, there isn't much to occupy you for a full week, the afternoons were too hot to do anything really but lie by the pool,and if lazing by a pool reading a book isn't your thing then you only need a few days in luxor.me and my sister got quite bored at night, as there was nothing to do."
40,“Wonderful location for tourists with lots to do in area”,"Luxor is like stepping back in time. Everything around you is a different experience. The modern promenade is well built.The sheer amount of historical artefacts surrounding the area is marvellous.There are two ancient temples well worth visiting. Both the Luxor and Karnak temples are amazing.The Luxor museum has lots of artefacts to see and is air conditioned. Many of the artefacts from the valley of the kings have been taken to Cairo but there are still plenty there. You have to balance this with the poverty surrounding you. It is a subsistence country with lots of poor but proud people. You will not see many women which can be disconcerting for western women. The security is high because of terrorism but this makes it a safer place to go and you get used to it. The Egyptian communities need tourists to keep the economy going and provide education and health services. There are so many things to see and do in the area that it is well worth a visit. I would recommend an escorted tour round the markets. Take plenty of small notes, you will need it for baksheesh.The valley of the Kings, and Queens is a good trip, worth going to but very busy. Take antibacterial hand sanitiser as you wont want to use the sinks in the potaloos. The guards will pose for photographs and make up their pay this way. Early start to the day means tou avoid midday sun and stay healthy. Choose accomodation carefully before you go, the most expensive is not always the best experience."
50,“Lone female traveller in Luxor”,"As an experience lone female traveller, I travelled to Luxor for the blue skies, some sightseeing but mostly for relaxation. Before my trip I trawled TripAdvisor.com for its very useful tips and information on what to expect.Arriving in Luxor airport was, to say the least, an experience in itself - just to navigate successful through immigration requires steely determination and great patience. For first time arrivals what you are not told by the guide books nor the immigration officials is that before you join the mile long queues you must purchase a stamp from the ‘bank’ in the immigration hall (this cost about GBP 15.00). Only then should you join one of the queues and wait patiently for 30-40 minutes otherwise you will be sent back. For those arriving with an organised tour then you should not worry as your representative will unashamedly jump the queues for you.One of the best tips I retrieved from TripAdvisor.com was the name and number of a young businessman, Ashraf Boriy, who runs a fleet of taxis. Ashraf speaks English, is educated on all the sites, not just those around Luxor, is professional and very friendly and if you ask him to arrive at a certain time then he (or one of his drivers) will be there 5 minutes beforehand! He gives good advice too on where to purchase your souvenirs so do please ask him. [--]As my main focus was relaxation, I limited my visits to the Temple of Karnak, Valleys of the Kings and Queens and the Temple of Edfu. Using Ashraf’s drivers meant that I decided what times I travelled to these sites and, with his advice, was lucky enough to avoided the tourist ‘rush hour’ at each site. I found the official guides at these sites to be very pleasant and helpful and as I was on my own, was privileged to be allowed to view many ‘closed’ areas. Just a few tips: at Karnak the ticket office is a tiny booth in the car park outside the main site; Valley of the Kings – do not bother with the ‘train’ ticket as it takes about 3 minutes to walk up the hill to the tombs; Edfu – take care as the floor in the temple is very uneven and I would suggest bringing a small torch as it is quite dark in some places.The best food that I had in Luxor was at the rooftop restaurant of Tutankhamun on the west bank (do not be put off by the building exterior). To get there take a ferry across from Luxor or call in on the way back from the Valley of the Kings. With the advice of the Arabic/French speaking owner, ‘Am Mahmoud, (the translation being provided by Ashraf) I enjoyed one of the finest meals ever! I tried his chicken with rosemary, tagens and his freshly made breads, wonderful! Soft drinks only are served at this restaurant.Tipping is expected here so do please bring plenty of small notes. I did not have a problem with this as I found the people very pleasant and eager to help whether it was in restaurants, hotels, shops or at the various sites.What I did find intimidating was the number of street-sellers that gathered around you, all shouting, and pushing their wares in your face. One experience of this on my own was enough after that I used the presence of Ashraf to keep them at bay – quite a luxury.Do bring lots of tissues and bottled water with you. Bathroom tissue is limited at each tourist site. Tip: it is cheaper to purchase water, soft drink and beer at the local shop as I found the hotels to charge London prices for these.My experience as a lone female in Luxor was relaxing and overall very pleasant. However, I am in no doubt that had I not 'found' the recommendation for Ashraf Boriy on this site then my holiday would have been mainly restricted to my hotel and it's grounds. Well done TripAdvisor.com, keep up the good work."
40,“Budget trip to Luxor”,"We Travelled to Luxor with Budget Travel on 07/02/07 for a week.It was a last minute 1/2 price booking . We stayed at the St Joseph , a 80's style family hotel €30 per room.Basic ,very clean,good breakfast,friendly helpful staff.Nice roof terrace with pool ,cafe sun beds and mattresses and a great view of the nile.We talked to several couples there who come back to it again and again.We booked several trips to all the sites. Get prices from Jollys,Karnak, Thomas Cook Travel agents at The Winter Palace Nile St.We went on a 2 nite trip up the nile on a cruise boat to Aswan.5 star fully inclusive about €110 PP. The boat was a 5 star called Ramees.It was excellent with the best bread and selection we have ever had.It had a large sun deck with pool . Plenty of longers and towels supplied.Watching the sunset over the Nile on the first night was spectacular Stopped at Edfu, Kom Ombo Temples and over night at Aswan. Then the Train back to Luxor.The Falah Tent and Hot air balloon over the Nile Trips are well worth about the € 40 to € 50 each.Luxor and Karnak temples can be visited by foot or taxi as they are in Luxor.Valley of the kings/Queens and Hatshput can be seen by coach or taxi trips.A lot of trips start very early in the day.Overall it was a splendid week different to all our other holidays and was excellent value.Joe, Dublin"
40,“a place packed with loads of history”,"i travelled to Luxor in Feb 05 with 3 others and had a brill time. The valley of the kings and queens and the Luxor and Karnak temples were just amazing. The place is packed with so much history and things to see and learn. The locals were really friendly always going out of their way to help you out, but it did get frustrating when shopkeepers tried to sell you things you didnt really want. There's a really good indian restaurant called 'Bombay Resaurant' opposite the sheraton hotel, they do really good 'thalis' and another really good place to eat is 'The Lantern' on madina st...LOVED IT!!!!! also i loved the camel rides which is a must do for anyone whos thinking of going."
20,“Your first vist? you need to know!”,"Egyptians assume you are rich because you are there. They are low paid and tipping is expected for every small deed. Like carrying your suitcase, opening a door or giving you two sheets of toilet paper.As a muslim country alcohol and pork is not freely available.If you enjoy a brand of spirit, take it with you, you can take up to four litres into the country. Or, go to their duty free with your passport within 48 hours of landing you can buy three litres there. It will be cheaper, but they may not have what you want.Alcohol is available in hotels and some restaurants in the resort but mainly Egyptian. Local Beer is about 10 Egyptian pounds for bottle. It says 4.5% proof. Other alcoholic drinks may be expensive.Cigarettes are cheap and American brands are easy to buy. From about .50pence for twenty.Shopping can be a nightmare. Small shops with restricted stock. The system seems to be to charge as much as possible, a few shops do price their goods, sometimes in Arabic only, so as it is fairly easy to learn the arabic numbers it is worth doing so. Shoes bags and jewelwry seem to be best buys.Local busses charge .25 of an Egyptian pound. Ferry One Egyptian pound. Horse carriages 5 Egyptian pounds and Taxis 20 Egyptian Pounds. Be firm they will try to overcharge you.Do not accept a trip to the Bazaar, it will be to a relatives shop and you will be hassled to buy at inflated prices.It can be cold in the winter so make sure that you have some warm clothes with you.Eating out is the greatest pleasure, the restaurants with English Menus outside, are all worth trying, Snobs, Maxims, 7days-7ways, are particularly good. There are few frozen or packet foods so nearly everything is freshly made.Book all trips with local agencies, they are half price. We found them reliable. Karnak Travel along the Nile in front of the Winter Palace hotel. Highly recommended.A short trip to Cairo to see the Museum is worthwhile.Early morning Balloon trips are reccommended too. Check you are covered with insurance, although accidents are not common.The evening light and sound trips to the temples are better than the day trips.Admission to most sites are between 25 and 75 Egyptian pounds.Night life is mostly the odd folk dance and dinner, or a disco in a hotel.La-shuck- ran means No Thank you. Him-She is a rude word that means go away."
20,“It's not the costa del sol!!”,"Arriving in Luxor at a military airport was a bit daunting but the reality is that it is like any other airport!You need a visa to enter through Luxor but this wasn't detailed by our travel agent (they said we did not need one) we wanted one anyway because we were traveling to Cairo. The 'queue' for visas was more like a jumble sale scrum. An offical tried to pull my husband out of line to follow him. I had heard that they get your visa quicker but then they want paying for it!! Not a chance as we only had big notes, we waited and got it within minutes.The country is a developing area and poverty is evident everywhere. What you must remember is that these people get on fine in their lives and are on the whole happy.Money is what makes the world go round right?Everybody is on the take, whether they have a uniform on or not. This is part of the culture and just be prepared for constant hassle everywhere! The smile slips from there faces when you tell them that you are not wanting their 'services' but they persist and persist and persist............It's impossible to actually stop and enjoy the moment or the view. Someone will come up and say that the view is better from other there, 'come, you are English? let me show you a better place for photo' you really don't get a minute without hassle, and of course they all want paying for telling you how to spend your precious time. You don't have to tip for the info that you didn't want to start off with of course, but they really don't like it and let you know!The place is filthy but again this is part of the culture as I said it's not the costas. Spitting and litter is commonplace.Use anti-bacterial wipes often, especailly after handling money.Jippy tummy is very common with most conversations with your follow travellers opening with 'How are you? Got the squits yet?' One Enlglish lady had the runs for 4 days out of a 7 day holiday and went to the loo 15 times in a 12 hour period.Food is OK but very different from our English Palate. No fish 'n' Chips here! Although McDonalds and KFC are in evidence. Hygeine is not a strong point so be careful with the food. Under no circumstances drink or brush your teeth in the tap water.They know that you are unfamiliar with the currency but take your time and place the notes in your wallet or purse with the numbers facing you so that you can be certain what you are giving. A taxi driver tried to short change us by placing the notes with the Egyptian side uppermost. I turned them over to see the notes value and realised the scam!Would I go again? I don't think so. People do go back (one couple had been 15 times) but there are more places to see in the world and some are a lot less hassle!!!!"
20,“Animal care in Egypt”,"We have just returned from a week in Luxor in Egypt. which is an amazing place to visit. The people were very friendly and we really enjoyed looking at all the incredible antiquities. However, one of the most distressing aspects was seeing how the animals were treated, particularly the donkeys and horses. Part of this is obviously due to poverty but there were many tourists taking rides in the carriages where the drivers were making the animals go too fast. We visited the ACE (Animal Care in Egypt) Hospital where they provide treatement and help to animals and their owners on a very limited budget. It was well worth visit and they are grateful for any donations including suntan cream, dog collars and towels. It is an interesting cab ride out of the centre of Luxor and only costs a few Egyptian pounds from the area around the Luxor temple. Their address is El Gouahera, Luxor. Their tel no. is 0020 952 363610. Their website is: http://www.ace-egypt.org.uk/ace_contact.html."
50,“A lifetime of experiences in a week!”,"I booked this as a last minute break somewhere hot, what I actually had was a true lifetime memorable experiences.I stayed at the Movenpick Jolie Ville, a superb hotel (see separate review), and an excellent contrast from the hustle and bustle of the town, being on its own private island on the Nile.October is a good month to go, still hot, 97-100 most days but bearable.Luxor itself has incredible contrasts between history, east and western cultures and luxury and poverty.If you can get past the constant hassle of the hawking of taxi's boats papyrus etc. ( A swift no thank you and wave of the hand and avoiding eye contact does the trick most times), exploring the old souk and back streets is a rewarding experience with sights of an arab in tradional dress riding a donkey whilst on his mobile being a good example of the clash of cultures.The history is hard to take in. I'd recommend getting your own tour guide and taxi driver. This after haggling should be about £17 a day!Start at Karnak, go to Luxor temple (day and night if you can) and then the West Bank temples and Valley of the Kings; this order enables you to follow the in the Phaerohs footsteps from the temple to their tomb. The guide isa must, it will transform your experience and for the money seems wrong to get all that knowledge for so little reward!If you can past the initial pestering, the locals are friendly and tolerant of us westerners and will make it a very special trip. Make sure you do fill your days, you will only regret it by the ned of the holiday if you have just sat on a topur bus or in the hotel.One last tip, book no extras before you go, and then visit a local travel agent, not the tour reps for your excursions. I got a great deal from Karnak travel (by the Winter palace hotel), a 2 day trip to Cairo and the Pyramids, Karnak temple light show and a hot air balloon trip all for £170! This also include my own chauffeur and tour guides for each trip!"
50,“Luxor”,"Getting To Luxor (Thebes).We set off from Gatwick on the 14th December 2005, this was after taking up the option of staying overnight at the Hilton Gatwick, which included the cost of parking the car for 15 days. I would definitely recommend this, particularly if you have an early morning flight, as it avoids the M25 / M23 rush.We chose to have breakfast in the airport, this was not a good experience, the quantity of food was small, the quality was not much better, the service was slow and we almost left without paying as the staff delayed with the bill – with hindsight I wish I had.The flight itself was good through Thomas Cooke, and we left and arrived in Luxor to schedule. Getting through immigration was fairly straightforward, be ready to pay about £10 in sterling for Visa entry. The Thomas Cooke transfer bus was there waiting, but beware of offers to carry your bag – it is only a few yards and they expect payment or bakshee for it – so my advice is a firm and polite – no thank you. The advice offered by the courier on the bus on this issue was spot on – only pay a tip if you think the service was good, not just because they expect it or they ask for it – as they regularly and routinely do.The HotelWe stayed at the Mercure Inn (previously known as the Egotel), this was supposed to be a 4* hotel but was not – maybe it was Egyptian 4*. A couple of the things missing by way of example were a kettle and hair dryer, which I would have expected to be there for such a star rating.The room was acceptable though old fashioned in an ok sort of way, the bathroom itself was a bit on the shabby side. What I would recommend is getting a room with the balcony facing South, particularly if visiting in winter as you get the sun for pretty much the whole day, we were on the 3rd floor, above might have been slightly better, though in summer this may be too much for some. Servicing of the rooms is every day and the staff are very friendly, we had no problems over security at all, and I gave a good tip to the cleaners and porters.The swimming pool is adequate, it is cleaned each day and the area is good for sunbathing. Changing facilities and toilets are clean. I suggest you grab the spaces at the far end away from the café. The café itself serves pretty good western Italian style meals – lasagne and pizzas at reasonable costs for around E£22. The service is ok but can be painfully slow, as the staff seem to be content with filling their time rather than giving a good service. This is one place you will however be free from the “hassle” of Luxor life, though there is haircutting and a massage service touted daily.The breakfast arrangements are ok, it is self service with a fair variety of foods available, the main moans are; the insistence of the staff on serving tea and coffee rather than giving you a pot, as a consequence we seemed to be always asking for more, also it was sometimes not very hot; and only one chef who cooks the fried eggs or omelettes on a singe hot plate, so rather slow, having said that as long as you are not in a rush then enjoy it. Although most of the hotel is no smoking the restaurant is not so this may cause some people problems.As far as the bar itself is concerned, prices are good at around E£14 for a beer, but beware imported specialist drinks may be expensive.There are currency exchange facilities available in the hotel without charge but no doubt the rate reflected this, and there are ATMs about 10 minutes walk away. Certainly no problem with changing sterling and getting money from your own bank account. The rate will of course vary and you may get a charge, for me it was about 4% and I bank with Nat West, I am sure there are better deals, but this was very convenientThe hotel is private and there are guards at the front entrance and at the head of a longish driveway. Along the driveway there are a few shops which hassle you every time you go up and down the drive, and can be a bit of a pain, my advice is go in and decide whether you want something, if not, then tell them and thereafter you will get less hassle.Part way down the driveway is a restaurant, managed if not owned by the hotel. Good food, help yourself style is available (the Egyptian sweet cakes are fabulous) every Thursday along with a band, singers, a belly dancer and a colourful whirling dervish type of act ( this is truly amazing, he turns for over 15 minutes without stopping). This is a must not miss night; the price is about E£70 each plus beer, which is well worth it. The service is good and very friendly.Getting aboutLuxor is surprisingly safe, initially you may feel intimidated, but it is the hassle that is intimidating not the place itself. We walked around much of the time, including the old market areas, along the Corniche to Karnak, around the town and out to some of the more remote parts. My advice if you have the time, experience the place, by walking, but do be aware of taxis, cars and the kalish (a horse drawn carriage), they drive on both sides of the road and without regard for other drivers or pedestrians, fortunately rather slowly.Taxis are very cheap, pay no more than E£10 (often less) for anywhere within Luxor and Karnak for a single journey, you will of course be pestered for more money and more business, but agree the amount before getting in, if they say it is not enough walk away and try another, without doubt the first taxi driver will agree to what you offered.All the taxi drivers are friendly and helpful, if you are staying any length of time as we did ( 2 weeks) then negotiate a price with him for any of the tours that you may be planning, we did 4 tours using taxis.Typically for a tour of part of the West bank, (you can not do it all – we did 3 West bank trips and still there was much that we did not see) you can take the taxi from either bank; pay no more than E£170 for about 5 hours, this includes the driver taking you to whichever site or monument you want to see, waiting for you, then taking you to the next. Once you have agreed the price do not pay for extras, that he will most certainly try to get you to pay, for example as happened to us, if he is asked to pay the policeman, it is probably because his licence is out of date, it is his problem not yours so he should pay. He will probably try to persuade you to visit an alabaster factory, where you will be offered tea and shown how they make the alabaster, my advice is be careful, he is on commission and if you do not want to buy, then say no and goodbye. If however you want something specific then this is as good a place as any, my advice is think of a silly price then half that and offer it, go no higher than the silly price you thought of, walking away usually does the trick, with us we finalised the deal whilst in the taxi driving off as the owner hung through the window.The kalish (a horse drawn carriage), is a very pleasant experience, and a must do photo opportunity, agree a price before getting in and make sure it is an all in price not per person. Allow slightly more (perhaps 10% more) for the kalish than the taxi.The ferry across the Nile is located at the north end of the Luxor temple and costs E£1 each way for tourists, the locals pay virtually nothing, get a return handwritten ticket. The ferry runs all night or so we were told, the latest one we picked up was just after midnight. The alternative is the motorised small boats which are all along each of banks of the Nile and cost up to E£5 if you are in a hurry. The one experience of this for us was part of a specific tour and I would say the ferry is much better.We tried to get a train to Aswan, but the train was fully booked, which was a disappointment for us, so book ahead is my tip, and if travelling with a female send her to the front of the queue as this is the custom in Egypt, she should be prepared to shout to make herself heard. Within the station is the Tourist Information office, which we found most helpful and surprisingly no charge.The sitesI would encourage most people to go to these sites independently, rather than going as part of a group as you will have more time. There are guides available but I preferred not to use them but to occasionally listen in to somebody else’s.Most of the sites are now E£20 per person for each site, the Valley of the Kings entrance fee allows access to 3 tombs, as does the Valley of the Queens and the Nobles and the Artisans, assuming the tombs are open. Payment for all of the West Bank sites is in a small office at the junction of the main road just out of town. Remember to get your change as the clerk is rather slow on returning this on the basis that many people will forget and he can therefore pocket this himself.The most annoying aspect is the many locals, including the security guards, who come over to give their advice, to point out the obvious and offer to take or be in photos, and then ask for bakshee. If you have read up on the many books then you will probably know more than them. It may be rude but I found the best way was to say very firmly “No Thank You” I know they are in some cases desperate for money, but I found this aspect of the visit almost too much.East BankLuxor TempleFor us we saw this Temple every day as the hotel entrance was opposite it as we walked along the Corniche or into the market area. The Temple is remarkably impressive, with its high columns, specifically Amenhotep's colonnade, and I particularly liked the avenue of sphinxes, many of which were damaged, but if you explore the town to the North, you will see examples of remains of this avenue which originally stretched to the Karnak Temple. There is much to see here, with many piles of stones, which hopefully will be returned to their original place, as with many of the sites there is some ongoing repairs and restoration. Make sure you check out a doorway leads surrealistically out into thin air some 25 feet above the ground, this exit is from the Abu Haggag mosque.The Temple can get very busy with fellow tourists. Before you go in you will probably see a great deal of heavy duty trench work going on around the Temple, particularly at the South end outside the Sanctuary of Amenhotep up III to where there are the remains of the Roman Fort. This work has apparently been ongoing for a few years and is expected to continue for a few more, the problem is the sewer and water system which needs replacing as it is leaking and damaging the foundations of the South and Eastern part of the Temple.Karnak TemplesWe paid 2 visits to this site; the first was to see the light show in the evening. Remember to check the times which suit you as these are in different languages and at different times on each day. There is not very much to do or see outside the Temple, though the one café did good tea and when pressed, the waiter managed to find a small cake for us to have with it.The light show was ok; the seats at the end were reasonably comfortable, you may wish to take a torch, and in winter, as we travelled, you will need to wrap up warm. This is a good way of spending a few hours in the evening before having dinner. If however you are short on time then this may be one to miss.We returned during the day and would say this is one not to miss, particularly if travelling independently as the site is enormous, and the size and number of features, is covered in hieroglyphics, and can be quite overwhelming so take your time, oh and take water. Although there are areas that are off limits, we just ignored this and wandered everywhere, the Mut Temple area is being rebuilt using a crane and people are still excavating in the area, but do try and see this part. There are too many specific areas within the Temple to mention in detail and the many guide books cover these much better than I could, though the numerous statues and the obelisks do stand out in my mind. There is a small café on the site which gives some relief to the heat of the day. It’s worth just sitting and marvelling and taking it all in. If you want to visit the open air museum part you will have to pay a small extra charge, and of course pay bakshee for the use of the toilets, which were very clean for Egypt.Luxor MuseumOn the Corniche, this is well worth a visit; the pieces are well laid out and well lit, with many interesting notes to explain them. Take your time; do not be rushed, as you go through the museum. I found that much of the readings done prior to your visit start to slot into place as you go through the museum and see the exhibits. Even here the guards will try to explain things for you for some bakshee; I just ignored them as it detracted from my concentration on the exhibits, many of which are almost perfect. At the end before exiting, do not miss the last gallery, which is easy to miss. There are some recent finds from the Luxor Temple where 20 + New Kingdom statues were found under the floor in the inner sanctum area in 1989, some of these are exhibited and are in very good condition.The Mummification MuseumWalking from Luxor towards Karnak this is on the left hand side of the Corniche. This is an interesting place to visit, but is rather dark and is not a priority visit, we visited this museum before our visit to the Luxor Museum and I would recommend the other way around as you may have seen sufficient by then.Places to eatAs well as the restaurants within the grounds of the Mercure Inn, there are some good reasonably priced places to eat, mainly on the East Bank. My advice is to be adventurous, if the place looks reasonably clean and the locals use it, then it is worth a try. Two worth a mention that we tried and returned to was in the market area the Chez Omar and next door to it, I can’t recall the nameThe food at the Chez Omar was quite traditional; I would especially recommend the aubergines and the meat stews. The food comes piping hot. They do serve beer here, it is wrapped in a napkin and they provide you with a colored drinking glass, I am not sure whether this was a disguise or not.Next door was more basic, but very good both in quality and quantity, I recommend looking at what the locals are eating and if you fancy it then ask for that. No beer here though.On the West Bank was the rooftop restaurant of the Nile Valley Hotel. This was very good, and a definite recommendation, so much so that we spent Christmas night here celebrating with yet another belly dancer, another whirling dervish type of act, two bands and a singing troop, all topped up with participated dancing.For our last night we decided to treat ourselves and turned up at the Winter Palace Hotel intending to eat in the 1886 room, but was told we should have booked, but if we could wait two hours then they could fit us in. We decided not to wait, but took in the old fashioned surroundings of this late 19th century colonial building, which has much history to it, including where Carter stayed. We moved on to the Miyako, this is a Japanese restaurant and is to be found within the St George Hotel. This was very good and I would recommend a visit, but was the most expensive meal we had during our visit, but it still compared favorably to UK Japanese restaurant prices with some fixed price items, which we had and found to be very good and included some sushi.West BankValley of the KingsThe approach to the Valley is quite stunning, we took the train, but it is not necessary unless it is very hot. It is difficult initially to get a scale of things as there are many Tombs, but most are closed and your ticket allows access to only 3, if you want to see more then buy an extra set of tickets would be my advice, or pay 2 visits as there is such a lot to take in.The first Tomb we visited was Ramese III, we took our time as there were some very interesting side chambers, but unfortunately this Tomb was very busy, and it was difficult to properly view.The best for me was Tuthmosis III, this is to be found at the farthest end of the valley, where the Tomb is approached up many steps, once at the top then you descend into the Tomb down more steps, be careful, take your time as this could be difficult for some, do not bump your head. I do not know how they got the coffin into this Tomb, as this was enormous and made of granite.The next best for me was Tausert / Setnakht, this is one of the largest Tombs in the Valley, this has two burial chambers with columns which have linked walk ways, the wall paintings were very clear and seemed almost new, but there again it was one of the more recent Tombs that the Pharos had built, all relative of course.Valley of the QueensMuch smaller than the Valley of the Kings, and when we visited, the one to see Nepertari was not open, in fact it had not been open for over a year and there was no indication of when it would reopen. As a consequence we only were able to Tombs of sons, rather than Queens, though a little disappointing, this disappointment is only relative, when compared to the other sites available at Luxor.Medinet Habu (memorial temple of Ramesses III)In my opinion this was one of the best sites I visited, so it is highly recommended and is a must see site, allow sufficient time, there are fewer tourists here for some reason, which I could not understand; maybe the site is not on the coach tour list.It is very large in area, and is situated next to a cluster of shops that sell the usual things, but also you can get some tea or water and something to eat.The carvings here are really quite deeply engraved and there is lots of it, the first pylon is particularly impressive. There is quite a bit of restoration going on within a few outbuildings , which are out of bounds, but do take time to look around the outside of the Temple itself. Inside the columns are just amazing, both in size and in their inscriptions, towards the back and to either side there are some rooms where you would benefit from having a torch to see the engraving and paintings. Surrounding the Temple are more recent mud brick walls, which are impressive in themselvesThe Ramesseum (memorial temple of Ramesses II)This Temple is in need of much restoration and there is some ongoing, if you go to the outside of the 1st pylon, into the field you will see that it is in great danger of collapsing, and already has to a great degree. This needs to be restored soon as it will simply fall down if not.There is one enormous granite statue, that has toppled over and broken, I did not understand how it could have happened, because it is so big and no doubt extremely heavy, but it would be fantastic to see this restored. As with other Temples there are many mud brick walls around the perimeter of this site and some evidence of Roman occupation, so check it out.Deir al-Madinah (workers’ village)This is quite an extensive area with the remains of the workers homes in the lower area but there are some tombs further up the hillside, most of which are not open, some have not been looked after and there is much strewn rubbish around and in and around them, but it is worth going as high up the hill as you can, to get the view. At the far end of the workers homes there are the remains of a Greek Temple, but when we went it was locked, so we could not really check out the inside. Beware you may be offered so called originals here, we chose to ignore him, but it was a distraction.Tombs of the NoblesThese Tombs are somewhat hidden amongst the homes of locals, and consequently very few tourist visited here whilst we were there. I understand, but have nor verified the fact, that these people will be moved sometime in the next year or two, so that the Temples can be better protected and then, there is the possibility of finding more Tombs. From the tourists perspective this is a good move, maybe not for some of the locals.Surprisingly here we found some of the best paintings inside any of the Tombs, and some were much larger than we expected, this is a place to explore, do not be put off by the locals who want to show you other things. A torch would certainly help here, though at one of the Temples a local guide had designed a system of mirrors and tin foil to reflect the suns rays which was imaginative and very useful, this was one occasion I gave bakshee. I wish we had spent more time here as I am sure there is much more to see than I saw, but it is difficult to get a scale on things as there are many homes scattered over the hillside.Temple of Seti IThough this is a little off the beaten track, and is need of substantial repair, there is much missing, it is worth the effort as few tourists find this place, so you can wander about at your leisure. The columns are very large and extremely impressive. There are also some Roman remains here also in the grounds.Deir el-Bahri (temple of Hatshepsut, etc.)This is just amazing and a definite must see. When we went it was particularly hot so remember to take lots of water. The view as you approach the Temple is quite breathtaking, apart from your fellow travelers who tend to get in the way. Although there is a short train service, I would recommend not taking this as the short walk is part of the experience. When we were there was a group of people meditating in one part of the Hathor Chapel, which made it difficult to properly explore and see the carvings and paintings which were particularly good.Colossi of Memnon (memorial temple of Amenophis III)This is one of the sites where you do not have to pay. The site is just off the main road leading away from the Nile towards the Valleys, you can not really miss the two huge figures. It is a definite photo opportunity, but there are lots of tourists around so they will definitely be in your photo frame.Other things to do and visit.We went for a balloon ride, and although more expensive than other activities at Luxor, I would highly recommend this. The trip starts early in the morning and you have to get to the West Bank. We were lucky in that the basket was not overcrowded, but we did see some that certainly were extremely full, this would certainly detract from the experience.Obviously you go where the wind takes you, for us we crossed the Nile, which was apparently not the usual way the wind blows, crossing over Luxor itself getting a birds eye view of people getting up, brushing their teeth – you can see right into peoples homes, then there was the aerial view of Luxor Temple and for us we could see our own hotel room. The ride takes about an hour, the landing for us was smooth, but I understand from others can be less.Taking a faluka sailing trip is a must if you visit Luxor, but you must agree a price, we agreed E£15 per hour, which is mid range, but remember it is per hour and the pilot will keep you on the Nile as long as he can, for me I really enjoyed it sailing on the Nile, visiting Crocodile Island and Banana Island, was a nice extra, but not essential in my view.We took a short camel ride for half an hour; this was enough for me as it was good to have had the experience. Prices vary considerably, we considerably overpaid for this experience at E£50 each, and so make sure you agree a figure below this.You have to experience the market areas, you will be hassled constantly, if you go into a shop do not initially tell them what you are interested in as you will not see anything else browse around, if you are interested in something, then offer the lowest possible price you dare and stick to it. Although harmless, you will from time to time be accompanied by; usually young children who want to show you around, and expect some bakshee, tell them firmly no thank you and they may go away, but not always. Take it as leisurely as you can, soak up the atmosphere, this is the life and style of the traders and is the heart of Luxor and Egypt, you can feel the heart beating.We booked a Taxi to take us to Abydos and Dendara, which is a few hours drive to the North of Luxor. You will need to agree this trip the previous day as you go in a police escorted armed convoy, which sets off at 8am and returns at 5pm. In between there is a lot of driving very fast with your taxi driver constantly being pushed by the police to go faster, as a consequence he is forever trying to overtake other cars and busses in the convoy. This can be a little scary but also exhilarating as the police sirens wail and the traffic is stopped just to let us through. I really enjoyed this, as did the driver I believe, but my partner, she was less enthused about it, particularly as there are no seat belts in the back of the taxi.At Abydos The Temple of Seti I itself, there is little time to explore, but lots to see, so get on with it quickly as the convoy leaves after about an hour. There are toilets here so make use of them. This Temple is one of the few that has an almost complete roof to it and quite beautiful and as such leaves a much different impression than those that are open to the elements.At Dendara The Temple of Hathor, similarly you will have to rush as the convoy will be keen to set off and return to Luxor before 5pm. This is a truly wonderful and there is a great deal to see, For me the best and most interesting parts were the most unusual in so far as there is a roof are to visit, which you reach by some steps to the right and back as you go through, do not miss it. The ceilings here are particularly well adorned, check out the Zodiac, which looks real but I understand is a plaster castOverall ConclusionThis trip was well worth while, not very expensive, but when we visit again, and we will, we will rent out an apartment or villa as they are very cheap. Two weeks was about right, anything less than a week would not do justice to the place. The food was moderately exciting, the sights were absolutely out of this world, the only regret was not getting to Aswan, but there again we can go there another time."
50,“Loved my boattrip”,"This year I visited Luxor for the second time.Last year I visted the temples, did a daycruise en stayed at the swimmingpool.This year I went outside to meet the people, to talk with them and trying to know them better.I did a trip with a camel on the Westbank. Very recommendable if youcan do it with the boatsmen (not with travel organisation).I did a trip on the boat to an island where the shipper cooked for me on hisboat (Magic of the Nile). I did a trip on a feluka (Hamdy Dumpty)For the rest of my time I lived amongst the people. I eat in restaurantArabia on the West Bank - very recommendable - in the Nile Valley Hotel -where you are invited to dance.I also did a belloonflight. Magnificent.In one word : Fantastic Holiday"
10,“DO NOT SHOP AT KARNAK JEWELERS/ISIS HOTEL”,"Warning: Do not shop at this store located in the Isis Hotel. The shopkeeper sold us some precious stones which we paid several $100'sUSD for and were verified in Cairo as fakes. Fortunately, we used our charge cards, and were able to cancel the transaction after a lengthy call back to the US credit card company. We called the shop owner asking him if he knew they were fakes. His response to us, ""What do you think?"" He then told us to just keep the stones and bring them back the next time we visit Luxor. Yeah right."
50,“Het grootste openlucht museum ter wereld”,"Bruisend stadje waar veel te doen is. Toen ik in Luxor was heb ik egypteasytrip de tours laten organiseren, wat mij heel goed is bevallen. Zie tevens de website van deze tourcompany. Vanuit Luxor kun je allerhande trips maken. Maar in en rond Luxor zelf is ook veel te beleven. Zeer de moeite waard zijn de graven van de Vallei der Koningen, de prachtige tempel van Hatsjepsut, de tempel van Karnak een enorm tempelcomplex en nog veel meer. Vanuit een luchtballon is het eveneens genieten, vroeg in de ochtend startend op de Westbank, prachtig met de opkomende zon. Eten en drinken in Luxor is geweldig, de Egyptische keuken is meer dan verukkelijk."
50,“Nil und mehr”,"Wenn man nach Ägypten reist, muss es nicht immer All inclusive in einer Hotelanlage sein. Man kann auf eigene Faust in die Hauptstadt Kairo reisen oder mit dem Zug nach Luxor reisen und sich das Tal der Könige anschauen. In den Souks, den orientalischen Bazaren, ist das Feilschen ein Muss! So tief herunterhandeln, bis beide strahlen! Die Menschen dort sind freundlich, mit Englisch kommt man immer weiter und das Essen ist köstlich zu einem niedrigen Preis. Mit einer Kutsche kommt man zu den Sightseeing Plätzen und die Sonnencreme sollte man nie vergessen. Hier wird es im April schon über 35 Grad heiss. Eine Nilfahrt auf dem Schiff ist auch eine Reise wert!"
50,"“Luxor, wunderschön”","Luxor ist eine wirklich wunderschöne Stadt und ein Muss in Ägypten.Schon über Ägypten zu fliegen, über den Nil und die Wüste Richtung Luxor und dann die Landung zwischen den goldenen Sandhügeln ist ein Erlebnis.Vom Flughafen kann man nur ein taxi bis zur Stadt nehmen, ich kann mich nicht erninnern Busse gesehen zu haben. Wenn man aus dem Flughafen rauskommt warten auf einen schon 50 Anbieter aber ich glaube alle kosten gleich und man kann ruhig den ersten nehmen.Die Stadt in sich ist toll. Genung klein um alles zu Fuß sehen und erledigen zu können. Man kan auch zu Fuß nach Karnak, entlang der Sphinxstraße, laufen (ca. 30-40 min.) um dort den phantastischen Tempel zu besuchen. Wenn man am Ufer von Luxor spazieren geht wird man ununterbrochen von Einheimischen gefragt, ob man Boot fahren möchte oder in einem Restaurant essen möchte oder irgendetwas anderes. Das kann extrem nervig und anstrengend werden, besonderes wenn man nicht gewöhnt ist. Hier kann ich nur raten, keine Erklärungen zu geben und am besten auf arabisch ""La shukran"" zu sagen, was ""nein danke"" bedeutet. Irgendwie klappt es besser wenn man es auf arabisch sagt als auf englisch. Sonst wird man ständig angesprochen, am besten einfach lächeln und gnadenlos weiterlaufen. Frauen sollten keine kurze Hosen oder Röcke anziehen, auch keine Tops. T-Shirts sind grenzwertig, am besten etwa mit langen Ärmel. Die Haare trägt man nicht offen. Wenn ihr als Frau mit einem Mann in Urlaub seid, gewöhnt euch schon von Anfang an an Kommentare wie ""lucky man"" was man ca. 2000 Mal am Tag zu hören bekommt.Auf der anderen Seite des Ufers kann man mit der Fähre fahren, die kostet ca. 1 Euro...wenn man mit einem anderen Boot fährt wird man abgezockt und man bezahlt locker auch 20 euro! Also suchet die Fähre, sie ist groß, sicher und billig. Auf dem anderen Ufer kann man Fahrräder mieten, es ist definitiv die beste Lösung sich mit Fahrrad zu bewegen (vielleicht nicht wenn es 50 Grad sind). Fahhrräder kosten vielleicht 10-15 Euro für ein Tag. Mit dem Fahrrad ist man frei und man kann den Hatschepsut Tempel besuchen, den Tal der Könige, der Königinnen, Baharia, Asasif etc. außerdem mit dem Fahrrad hat man die Möglichkeit ein bisschen die Gegend zu erkunden.Die Natur ist spektakulär. Wir sind vom Hatschepsut Tempel bis zum Tal der Könige gelaufen, über den Berg hinter dem Tempel. Es war heiß, anstrengend und lang aber mit sicherheit das schönste was wir geseheh haben. Nimmt euch aber genug Wasser mit, auch für den Rückweg. Wenn ihr aber auf dem Rückweg doch zu müde seid, kann man vom Tal der Könige ein Taxi nehmen.In Luxor selber gibt es auch sehr viel zu sehen und genug zum Einkaufen. Es gibt auch einen Touristenmarkt, natürlich überteuert. Sonst gibt es auch einen ägyptischen Markt, sie verkaufen zwar keine Produkte, die man als Ausländer mit nach Hause nehmen möchte, es ist auch sehr dreckig, aber trotzdem sollte man es sehen. Mit dem fotografieren kann manchma schwierig werden. Nicht alle Ägypter wollen fotografiert werden, manchmal wird man richtig angeschrien.Essen findet man überall, vorsicht aber mit den Preisen. Für gewöhnlich gibt es keine Karten auf english, daher wird ein extrem höher Preis verlangt. Wir persönlich haben in einem Restaurant gegessen, der sich genau gegenüber vom Venus Hotel befindet, in der kleinen Straße. lecker und billig. Bäckereien sind auch gut.Es gibt auch Busse in der Stadt, sie sehen aber nicht aus wie unsere Busse daher benutzten sie sie die Ausländer nicht. Es handelt sich um Mini-Van, mit offene Tür. Sie halten an wenn sie jemanden sehen der am Straßenrand steht und winck, sie halten aber nicht immer an wenn sie Touristen sehen, besonders nicht wenn Frauen die leicht bekleidet sind. Um wieder auszusteigen reicht es zu klöpfen.Wir hatten wirklich eine tolle Zeit in Luxot, als Backpacker war für uns sehr einfach uns zu bewegen und zu Reisen. Die Menschen waren auch fast immer sehr freundlich. Zu Empfelen!"

Seine einzigartige Lage am Nil macht eine Felukkenfahrt nach einem anstrengendem Tag möglich. Auch Spaziergänge oder einfach am Ufer des Flusses zu sitzen, können sehr entspannend sein dank der austrahlenden Ruhe des Nils.Hotels und Restaurants aller Arten und Kategorien gibt es hier für jedermann. Unbedingt sollte man die lokale Küche probieren, sie ist es auf jeden Fall Wert!"
50,“エジプト観光の要”,エジプト主要観光地と言えば、カイロ、アスワン、そしてその中間地点のルクソール！　カルナック神殿や王家の谷など外せない観光地です。ただ、ルクソールはナイル川の西岸と東岸に分かれて見どころが点在しているので、ツアーなどに入らないと移動はキツイかも。貸自転車で周るというツワモノもいるようですが、夏は暑い！暑すぎます！西岸の王家の谷、王妃の谷などはかなり離れているので、観光前にへばってしまう恐れあり・・・お勧めは気球に乗って空からゆったりと遺跡観光。朝日が昇るのと同じくしてフワリと・・・　前日に地上での観光をしておけば、上空から見たときに、あそこは何とわかって楽しいです。　西岸ツアーも気球も多くの会社が取り扱っており、時期などによっても価格がさまざまなので、時間が許せば数社比較してみるのをお勧めします。安宿では大抵、リーズナブルなツアーを紹介してくれます。

Nicht nur, durch die bekannte Tempellandschaft sondern auch für eine kurze Rundfahrt (30 min - 1 Stunde) auf dem Nil, bei dem die grossen Nilkreuzfahrtschiffe beobachtet werden können sowie die Tempel aus einiger Entfernung.

50,“被时光留住的城市”,卢克索——一个被时光完整留住的城市。初听到那个城市的时候，你脑海中浮现出的大概只有一个字，那就是“热”。地处南部埃及的卢克索，全年接受着太阳神拉的热烈祝福。皮肤黝黑相貌英俊身形健美勇猛彪悍的法老王的正统子孙们依旧平静恬适的生活在这片伟大的而古老的上埃及土地上。蓝得令人窒息的天空，涓涓流淌的尼罗河，河两边宁静的村庄，绿油油的玉米地，那些画着色彩艳丽阿拉伯风格明晰的图案的房子，瘦得清晰可见肋骨的驴子，脸颊尖瘦宁静诡秘的埃及猫，宏伟壮丽精美的令人窒息的神庙群......一个拥有太多太多美景，太多太多历史点滴的城市，让你用太多太多的辞藻也描绘不尽。来到卢克索，你一定要去参观埃及历史上的“武则天”的神庙——哈特谢普苏特女王神庙，在那座其继子兼侄子图特摩斯三世企图掩盖的神庙深处的一个上了锁的小房间里，透过木栅栏你可以看到现存唯一的一座带有假胡须的女王像（不过很多时候你是要付给守卫人1美金消费的，1美金/人），神庙墙壁上的精美阴刻壁画也是绝对不容错过的，刻画细腻的智慧神树上现在还保留着那一抹若隐似无的绿，让你能直观的想象到在五千年前，在法老们的时代，那些壁画会是多么的精美多么的艳丽！凯尔纳克神庙群，绝对绝对不容错过的美妙之地，进入古老的神庙群你绝对可以感受到穿越历史的奇妙感觉。穿梭在参天的巨柱之中，仰望着那些遍布石柱的古老雕刻，敬畏的眼神一直延伸至最顶端那些颜色依旧瑰丽多姿的精美图案上；亲手触摸一下那些来自远古时代的艺术品，你甚至能感觉到5000年前的那个埃及石匠正在一凿一斧的在光滑的石柱上一点一滴的刻画下那些被永世享用的精美艺术。别忘了围着圣甲虫像转上七圈，之后许愿就会心想事成愿望成真（虽然一开始我把那个圣甲虫当成了蟾蜍......）卢克索神庙，也称拉美西斯神庙，与凯尔纳克神庙前的公羊大道相连的狮身人面像大道将你引到卢克索神庙前的四座拉美西斯二世的巨大坐像前，在他的脚边站立着历史上以美貌和博得君王无限宠爱而文明的——他美丽的王后奈菲尔塔丽。伟大的君主拉美西斯二世曾经这样形容过他对奈菲尔塔丽的热爱：我，已经是埃及的法老，我可以给你一切你所想要的，如果是合理的，那么你要一，我给你二，如果是不合理的，那么我也做一个不明事理的君主，满足你。 奈菲尔塔丽陪伴着她英武睿智的丈夫永生永世，知道3000年后的今天，还一直陪伴在他的身边凝视着他们的国土，看着太阳神拉每天从地平线的东侧升起，之后从西侧落下，千百年来从未改变。当你站在他们的脚下时，你会感慨万千：你会感慨在时间面前，你那沧海一粟昙花一现般的渺小；你会感慨在爱情面前，没有哪个男人的爱情能比一个英明神武、文韬武略能让千军万马俯于脚下的君王的钟情更蛊惑人心（虽然后来拉二又娶了N个嫔妃......但是伟大的可以同神等同的君主的独宠，即便只是一时的，却仍像罂粟般危险却充满诱惑）；你会感慨在艺术面前，3000年前的那些不知姓甚名谁的古代埃及艺术家们如此聪明睿智，用那些原始的工具制作出那么多或雄壮宏伟或精巧细腻的千年不腐，亘古不变的伟大作品......再去仔细品味最著名的帝王谷吧，去看看那位年纪轻轻就撒手人寰，在古代埃及历史上并无建树，却因为其数量众多制作精美的大量黄金珍宝陪葬品的发现而闻名的年轻法老王——图坦卡蒙的木乃伊吧。他的继母便是那位美貌被世人所惊叹，被称为古埃及最美的女人的奈菲尔提提，现在她的一尊已完成的半身像被保存在柏林博物馆里，像世人们验证着她美丽的不朽传奇！卢克索，一个原汁原味保留了古代埃及面貌的鲜活的城市，一个被誉为埃及的博物馆的城市，眼睛看着那些古老的埃及神庙、巨像，身边经过着流淌着法老王纯正血液的他的子孙们，凝望着远处尼罗河的湛蓝静谧，这一切的一切难道还不成为把你带到这座美妙的城市的理由吗？
50,“法老们的宫殿群”,这里，我用一句话解释，为什么我把卢克索叫法老们的宫殿群。 阿拉伯语中，宫殿叫做:gao sao le. 卢克索的意思呢，是最大的宫殿的意思，叫做：OGESAO 也就是说，相当于我们的GOOD BETTER BEST一样，OGESAO 就是 宫殿的最大名词。被称为最大的宫殿。 在这里，有N多法老，曾经建都在这里，经过不同年代的法老们扩建，修整，拆毁，继续 修建，扩大。这里成了埃及最著名，最重要的法老祭祀场所。这里，除了金字塔以外，这里才是真正能体现出古代埃及法老文明的地方。所以对于埃及旅游来说相当重要~！！！
50,“尼罗河沿岸的法老安息之地”,卢克索古称“底比斯”，位于尼罗河沿岸，它就像一个露天博物馆，不仅有“尼罗河惨案”外景地——卡尔纳克神庙，古埃及王拉美西斯二世建造的卢克索神庙，还有落日余晖下尼罗河西岸，那神秘辉煌的法老安息之地——帝王谷和王后谷。在这里，任何历史书籍都是苍白的，抚摸这些历经千年沧桑的建筑，仍然能感受到当年那黄沙漫漫，金戈铁马的年代。如果想拍到非常美丽的照片，可以考虑太阳西下和傍晚时分。卡尔纳克神庙晚上的灯光秀也是很棒的。
50,“Sehenswert”,"Luxor gehört sicher zu den bekanntesten Städten in Ägypten, wenn auch nicht zu den allergrößten. Aufgrund seienr Lage im Süden des Landes, ca. 700 km von Kairo entfernt, wird es meist im Zuge einer Nilkreuzfahrt besucht. Sehenswert sind dort, ein wenig außerhalb der Stadt, aber leicht erreichbar gelegen, das Tal der Könige mit den unterirdischen Gräbern der Pharaonen, der nahe gelegene Tempel der Hatschepsut sowie, im Stadtzentrum, der Karnak-Tempel. Vor allem letztere Monumentalanlage ist wirklich sehr beeindruckend, durchaus vergleichbar mit den Pyramiden bei Kairo."
40,“自転車で回りました”,3年ほど前、自転車でルクソールの街を回りました。宿のレンタサイクルです。私と同じように、バックパッカーの人は自転車で街を回っていて、遺跡の近くに”駐輪場”のようなものがあるので、そこに自転車を停めてから、遺跡観光という流れです。バクシーシを求める人が多く、馬の糞も良く道端に落ちていましたが（笑）、やはりエジプトならではの雰囲気が味わえる場所です。
50,“見どころいっぱい”,ツアーで行きました。王家の谷、ルクソール神殿、カルナック神殿など、見所いっぱいでした。とくにルクソール神殿では、ライトアップされた遺跡の中を歩くことができ、幻想的でした。王家の谷では楽しみにしていたツタンカーメンの墓に入ることができ、感激！
50,“Viaggio indimenticabile...”,"Nel Marzo del 2007 con la mia famiglia abbiamo passato una settimana a Luxor e al Cairo.4 giorni di navigazione: è stato bellissimo ammirare le coste del Nilo, osservando le donne con i bambini sulla riva del Grande fiume che raccoglievano l'acqua e gli uomini che curavano i campi. Che mi ha colpito tanto è stata la visita al villaggio Nubiano (da visitare!).La visita nei Templi molto interessante e unico.Poi abbiamo passato 3 giorni in un Hotel al Cairo, bellissimo!Visitate le Piramidi, un'esperienza unica da provare!!!Poi quello che mi ha colpito molto è il centro del Cairo:La gente che ci vive, semplici e solari. Il mercato interessante e curioso.Il museo del papiro molto istruttivo: Come realizzavano le pergamene.E infine bellissimo il museo delle essenze!Interessantissimo!Per concludere parlo delle specialità egiziane...:Non ci sono parole per descrivere quanto sono buone tante pietanze del posto. Mi picciono tantissimo!Ci sarebbero ancora tante cose da dire, ma è impossibile descrivere quante bellezze esistono in quel paradiso!!!"
40,“una citta' da mille e una notte”,"ho visitato luxor in occasione della stupenda crociera sul nilo che ho appena fatto e l'ho trovata una citta' molto affascinante con i suoi templi storici karnak e luxor uno spettacolo di storia e molto affascinante la valla dei re e delle regine con tutta la loro storia .il mercato turistico in centro citta' molto spettacolare e colorato ,tutti i calesse con i cavalli che girano per la citta' e uno stupendo matrimonio dove ci hanno invitato a partecipare alla festa ,insomma mi sono tuffata in un altra dimensione come tutti i posti che ho visitato andateci anche voi !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
50,"“Thèbes Ouest , incontournable.”","Aller à Louxor et visiter la rive Ouest en prenant le bac, est une activité incontournable pour qui est passionné de paysages majestueux. Les flots bleu-vert du Nil baignent les rives cultivées ou travaillent les agriculteurs et chantent les enfants en saluant de leurs mains. Puis le sable du désert et les monts arides tranchent avec leur couleur ocree et dorée. Le fleuve nourricier permet la culture de canne à sucre, de bananes, de sésame et de légumes divers, du désert fleurit l'histoire de l'ancienne Egypte, exhumée jour après jour par les hommes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui. Monter en direction de la ""cime"" en prenant le sentier des ouvriers d'antan restera un souvenir inoubliable."
40,“Pour les amateurs d'histoire”,"Si vous êtes amoureux de l'Egypte, des temples, des pharaons et de tout ce qui les entoure, Luxor est la destination rêvée.Entourée de plusieurs temple, celui de Luxor, de Karnak, d'Hatchepsout, de la Vallée des Rois, des Reines, des Nobles, vous serez gâtés par l'immensité et les informations que l'on peut avoir sur l'époque de ces rois, en visitant tous ces monuments.Luxor est également le point de départ pour plusieurs croisières sur le Nil, plusieurs bateaux y battent pavillon."
50,“magnifique et interaissant”,"La vallée de rois est magnifique, les tombeaux sont encore en bonne état. Tout est parfait!!C'est comme les pyramides ou le temple de Karnak, une fois qu'on est en Egypte, il ne faut pas les ratter!!!!! Ca vaut vraiment la peine!!!"
50,“ナイルクルーズ行ってみるべき”,ナイルクルーズにはぜひ行きたかったのですが、選ぶ基準が今ひとつはっきりしていなかった所へ、オベロイが新しいクルーズをスタートしたので行って参りました。全部で約300隻もあるというナイルクルーズ。騒がしいのは苦手だったので、これを選びましたが、、、最高でした。７泊、と長いのですが１番も見所のあるルクソールに３泊し、王家の谷、を中心に、行きたい所に、個人毎、車も通訳もオーガナイズをしてくれます。（これも料金に含まれている）時間もある程度フレキシブルなうえ、常に気配りと水のサービスが。乗船者全員で動くのは、最初と最後の日のパーティの移動だけで、あとはそれぞれ自由。プールテラスで雄大なナイル河の景色を見ているだけで気持ちいい。食事も３食付き、とてもおいしく、注文も聞いてくれます。夜もブッフェではない所が気に入りました。部屋もモダンに改装してあり、使いやすい。思ったより広い感じです。そしてスパ。オベロイスパなので、アジア的で安心。スパに近く、プールテラスにすぐ上がれるる３Fの部屋がおすすめです。そして遺跡もルクソールやアスワンに泊まるだけでは見られない所も立寄り、夕方のプライベートvisit等もあり、いたれりつくせりでした。マネージャーがしっかりしてますね。
