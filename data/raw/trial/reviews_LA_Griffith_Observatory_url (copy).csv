10,Parking is ridiculous $15 per hour,"The parking fee is expensive especially that the observatory is still closed. Parking attendant said that rate increases since last week and it is priced since it is a tourist spot. There are no metered parking as it used to be. Not worth visiting this site anymore, even for tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romeos637
50,Great way to spend an afternoon,"Fascinating building inside and out, with stunning views. Like everywhere nearby it gets busy, but not so much that it's overcrowded.Definitely worth having a walk down from the observatory on the nearby trails for even more great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arichards179
50,I was impressed by huge pendulum inside.,Wow. Must have point in LA. Super view on LA. very interesting excursions. Very nice walk from parking to the observatory. Best time to visit on sunset or sunrise. Of course you will get good view on HOLYWOOD.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11AntonK
50,Tourist,Great place to visit as a tourist . The walk down the hill was fun but walking back to the observatory was a task.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shetty782019
50,Amazing!,"My friend and I unfortunateljy came late, so we had only about an hour and a half to explore it but that was enough to make us love it! It is truly something you have to see and it has an amazing view of the city (recomend sunset or evening for pictures). The only problem is parking since there is not enough room so peple park next to the road and you have to walk up to the observatory and we had a little bit of a problem finding it cuz of the signs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2203ivat
50,Amazing and best LA’s attraction,"I would say the best attraction in Los Angeles. We went Los Angeles, for a weekend where we want to cover as much as we can but we were really disappointed by Hollywood walk of fame and rodeo drive but had very little.hopes from Griffith Observatory. But thankfully we were wrong and it exceeds our expectations.There is so much to learn from observatory about stars, earth, eco system and especially about telescopes.The best part of the telsa electricity show where they start the coil and that was amazing. It really blew our mind.the members are so great there and of you asked them any question, they patiently answer.Unfortunately, we were not able to attend any shows they are offering but if we ever went to LA we definitely love to attend the same. This place is good for hike lovers and only drawback their was parking. You need to park your car so far from observatory and walk around 1-2 m",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/himanshugupta0007
50,Great exhibitions and views,Nice (but hot!) walk up from the lower car park thinking we would just have a walk around the outside and take some pictures of the views but then found out it was free to enter! Great exhibitions there too around science and astronomy. We even saw a demonstration lead by some enthusiastic volunteers! Great for all ages. Would have happily paid to enter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
50,An experience!,"Me and my family just drove to L.A. from Nevada for the weekend, and when we got there we decided last minute to visit the observatory. At night, it's a very surreal and inspiring experience for everyone. My advice is to go, and just take in the unique visuals you can only get from the night sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bensongunderson
40,Interesting,We found this very interesting. Some cool exhibits. Obviously the view is great and it was pretty busy. We got a taxi up and down the hill as the parking was full. There was free WiFi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peggy05
50,Just great! Excelent view of the Hollywood sign!,"A place to visit. A must In LA, not only for the view of the sign, but also for the history of the place. The ride is already worth it! Make sure you travel light and bring comfy shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mudo75
40,It is pretty crowded,"prepare yourself for a looooong uphill walk if you don't arrive at the right time and nab a parking spot towards the top. It is a walk not for the faint heart. Best drop the kiddos and older folk at the top and be prepared to walk 20 minutes to the top, like I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaFella82
40,Great for Astronomy/Science Buffs,"After dozens of visits to L.A, this was the first time we wanted to check out the Hollywood Sign so we followed the GPS along a rather odd route to the rather busy Griffith Park. There is a very small parking lot (metered$$) in front of the observatory and parking along the road going back down. We snatched a spot and walked over to the railing for a view of the sign. It's TINY from this spot so you need a good zoom on your camera. If you have a few hours (and lots of bottled water), you can hike up to the sign and get a better view. Great views of downtown can be had here too. The observatory was an unexpected gem. Tons and tons of hands-on scientific activities. They have a solar telescope showing the sun which was neat (you don't often get to see the sun via a solar lens). If you have time, they had some extra ($$) activities you can sign up for. The restrooms are located in the place you pay/signup. There are tons of areas to explore inside and out and many with steps - which might be limiting if you have a wheelchair/stroller.14 year old - Enjoyed exploring the museum10 year old - Enjoyed exploring the museum5 year old - Enjoyed exploring the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyquest
30,Gaze on the City Lights,A nice place to take a night stroll. It's a great view of downtown L.A. and the Hollywood sign.The line is almost always long to get into the Observatory area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/900josephz
40,Interesting place,"You need to visit this observatory. Very interesting and gain knowledge. The views from the observatory over Los Angels is second to none. Make sure you take lots of Photos, you can also see the Hollywood sign from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ascot35
40,Excellent panoramic views of LA and Hollywood sign,We visited last week but the observatory was closed. The car park costs $10 per hour which is expensive but there are free parking 1 mile away if you prefer to hike to the top. The views of LA and the Hollywood sign are breathtaking. Well worth the drive and car park fee. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnclarkson
50,You can combine this with a visit to the LA Zoo too!,I've been coming here off and on since I was a teenager and that was quite awhile ago. It is still a fascinating experience and some of the views are absolutely inspiring; don't miss this!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ucommit
50,Great View of Hollywood Sign,Nice view of the Hollywood Sign. Wonderful displays. Great visit but we stayed till dark and it took us awhile to get an Uber because I kept loosing internet connection and when we did get one he went to the drop off location and called us to say he was here to pick us up. I was cold and upset while telling him you are at the drop off location to pick us up. He rushed me off the phone so that he could cancel the fare and of course we had to call another uber. It's funny now but not when you standing in the dark and wondering if you have to start walking back to your hotel until internet access is available...LOL!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tt297
40,Crowded,"The overall view was amazing, just trying to find a parking spot was hard maybe it was a bad day to go or everyone wanted to go on the day we were going there was just a lot of people, but we saw the Hollywood sign from inside the car and it was spectacular and i would highly recommend you go see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheAdventurer17
40,Go for the views alone,"Brilliant place to see and take photos of the observatory, the hollywood sign and LA city. The observatory was interesting and there is a lot of free things to do including entry to the observatory itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathansZ4280BP
50,A must visit site in LA,Never had an opportunity to see Griffith at night and decided to do so on our last visit...spectacular. Great views of the city and LA hills. The building is awesome lit up at night. Great art deco design and wonderful grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712jeffreyc
30,"Nice place, just not as great as I had imagined","This place can be a real pain to get to and to find a place to park. The easiest way is to get some sort of transportation that will just drop you off. Beautiful views and overall nice building with many interesting things, but maybe it was just me but I expected a bit more. I felt it didn't offer as much as I expected especially to fight the crowds.I would still recommend it as a place to visit if you have never been before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speedracer61
50,Must See,This place is breathtaking. We were only planning on visiting Griffith for one night but we ended up visiting 3 days in a row because it was that cool. There is so much to see here and it is 100% free. Best spot to take pictures and visit on romantic nights out. Next time we come to LA we will definitely come back to Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bitsytay
50,Mesmerizing,amazing view outside and very mesmerizing inside. prepare to walk as it gets busy especially on summer months. as parking gets filled.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taritz24

50,A must do when you visit LA,"Every time we visit LA, we always stop here. On this visit we discovered that you now have to pay for parking. In the past, it was free. It is free if you have a handicap placard. They now have a whole bunch of ugly meters that you can pay at.The view is amazing. Disappointed about the parking but the view makes up for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745ginaw
40,Great viewpoint,Great place to get up close to the ‘Hollywood’ sign (not amazingly impressive but box ticked) up in the Hills and to look over the whole of the greater LA area. Plenty of walks to do also. It was actually very cold up there despite being quite warm in West Hollywood so take a jacket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Epicureously
50,"Now, this is a tour of the Star's home","LA may be full of A lister's and wanna be celebs, but this is where the real stars hang out. We were supposed to spend the day at Knott's Berry but the wx washed us out, so after a nice picnic meal at the Trail (a food shack just inside the park), we raced up the hill to see the Center of the Univ show at the planetarium. It was a blast, large comfy (lazy boy) chairs and try not to fall asleep when they dim the lights..It was storming/pouring out plus the mist that surrounds the observatory, heck, we thought we were on a set of Star Wars. The show was fantastic, great for all age groups, and dont miss the self guided tours on 1st and even the bottom floor. The building itself is a work of art, and the views are breathtaking of the whole LA basin. A big southern shout out to Deanna (Ms Tesla Coil) who made us ""Dark Skys"" fans feel so much at home in the big city. Parking is plentiful on top of hill (10 @ hr), plus the show prices vary for children, students, seniors, military, etc. No trip to LA is complete without a stop at the Griffith, a must do if you traveling thru the LA universe. Not a full day, but worthy of a few hours for the star gazers in your group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VicS906
50,So glad we decided to visit,"On our recent visit to Hollywood, the Griffith Observatory was on our ‘maybe’ list of places to visit. We were so glad we decided to go, we went just before sunset so had the opportunity to look out across the vast scenery, we then watched as the sunset, witnessing a proposal whilst we were there. We decided to see if there was anything of interest inside and was shocked at the amount of exhibits on display. We had an 18, 15 and 7 year old with us and we all really enjoyed it. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tdog2701
50,Great view and nice exhibition,The view is great in daytime and very beautiful in nighttime. It's good to go there in the afternoon and wait until the sunset so you can appreciate the lights in the city at night. The planetarium and the educational exhibitions are interesting too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suda-sir

40,"Amazing views, neat place to visit","Parking costs $10, which is not bad for the area.The views area absolutely amazing and make this trip worth it.We did not go inside, we just walked around outside and admired the views.You can spend as much or as little time as you want in this area.There are some great hiking trails around and up to the observatory.One of the things we found is that people were parking on the road leading up the to the building and walking in, but there was more than plenty parking spaces at the main parking area at the observatory. Not sure why everyone was parking so far away, didn't understand that.So we are huge movie fans and wanted to see this due to how many movies it's been in and we were so glad we did!There are public bathrooms there too, which was nice...if you had to go!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txtrvlrs
50,Adventurous,"We went on the hiking trail TripAdvisor tour package which we bought on-line. Tour guide Elizabeth was energetic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and helpful. The day was beautiful and we took the afternoon climb. It was steep at times but able to climb. Wear good walking shoes. I felt good after the climb with the narration of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigator826261
50,Great Views,We stopped here for a short visit while on a post cruise tour of LA. It was a nice stop. We really enjoyed the views. We didn’t have time to walk any of the trails but they looked nice. There are lots of exhibits inside you can visit fit free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/49JW
30,It was shut,"When up to the Observitory only to find it was shut for a private function. Also found out the Observatory shuts on a Monday. But you can walk around it, normally. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get near it, lots of security. So we walked up into the hills to find some great views of LA. Great views, could see the Hollywood sign, saw the sunset over The city. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinkerbell1105
50,Hike to the observatory,It was a beautiful day for a hike to one of favorite spots for a picnic. At the top of the mountain in Griffith park is the observatory still an awesome place to see a view of the city. Me n my familia have been going here for years n we still love it. It’s a great place for kids to learn about the planets n space. For Free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emkikinit

50,A must visit if your in Los Angeles. Amazing Views. The family will enjoy!,"We took a family trip to visit L.A. for the day and this was the highlight of our visit. The view from the observatory is simply AMAZING! We got tickets to see the show ""The Center of the Universe"" and it was incredible. You could spend many hours here exploring the exhibits, the shows, and if you don't mind waiting till dark, you can look through their large telescope and see what stellar object they are observing that evening. (weather permitting) We definitely plan on going back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916vinnyc
50,Views views views,Provides great views over the city. We went at 4.30 approx to see the sunset and it was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
50,Great LA viewing,Be sure to drive all the way up to the parking lot. The views were great the exhibit fantastic. Wish we had spent more time. We got there later in the day and the clouds started to rill in,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marciaQ425HC
50,The best place to see LA,"From the Griffith observatory you can have great views. I said views because you can see the whole city and it's beautiful. You can see Hollywood and the Hollywood sign, you can see Downton and you can see the LAX airport. It's beautiful during the day and in the night time. Inside you have many different activities and interesting science stuffs, an example the Foucault's Pendulum. I suggest you pay a visit with your friends or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraLeeloo
50,Worth the trek,"The view of the Hollywood sign is good. It’s far, so bring a zoom lens. The observatory is very interesting. There are lots of hikes if you have the time. Parking is $10/hour and Ubers are not super cheap since it’s kind of far up there but still well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utaumom
50,Griffiths Observatory,Great place to visit for family and totally free. Brilliant view at night time. Get there just before dusk.Loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/specren
50,La La Land Personified in a 360°,"A quick trip to the Griffith Observatory and Planetarium is a must for any Angeleno and every visitor to our city. Want a clear view of the HOLLYWOOD sign just 1/4 mile across the ravine? All of LA Basin and the Santa Monica Mountains? This is the place for an amazing 360° experience! Hang outside for the location shot of the climax of teenage angst film Rebel Without A Cause and take your picture with a bronze bust of James Dean. Dance your way up the main steps and you're where Seb and Mia waltzed around the pendulum rotunda. The Observatory was built in the 1930's, when beautiful art deco design and authentic stone and bronze ruled architecture. Science-y peeps get a sense of the history of astronomy and astrophysics, design geeks will be delighted, nature lovers will marvel at the beauty of the Hollywood Hills. The Planetarium has shows 8x a day, for all ages. Or, just see the exhibits and learn something. At $10 for parking, with free admission to the Griffith, this is the cheapest fun side-trip for Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard-bound visitors, zoo lovers, and folks who like Western lore (LA Zoo and Gene Autry Museum is so close!) Main hiking trails branch off from here, or be brave and park at the bottom of Fern Dell Drive and do the hike a few miles up. Highly, highly recommended for people from 8 months to 80 and beyond! Simply gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nrstrips

50,"Fabulous views, nice science center",We enjoyed visiting the Griffith Observatory. The views from the outside are fabulous. Hiking/walking on the surrounding paths looked like fun but it wasn't on our agenda (kids were already tired.)We are enjoyed the science museum inside. It was well done. Wish we could have seen a planetarium show or gotten to see the telescopes but the telescopes are inaccessible during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenB_California

40,Not for ppl who are scared of heights,I’ve been here a few times. I need to say that it’s as lovely as described by others reviewers but if you’re not use to the steep mountain drive then don’t bother going. Also parking can be a problem and it’s very difficult to turned around when you start driving up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viza123

50,"Closed on Mondays, but still gorgeous!","My friend and I hiked up the west observatory trail and I was reminded that my midwestern body has been holed up in my home for so long that my lungs have nearly forgotten how to function when my body is doing more than a quick stroll. Hah. Anyway, the view was gorgeous the whole way up and even though most of the observatory and its grounds were closed (it was a Monday and I think it had been rented out for something) we were able to hike along the trails between the observatory and the city and enjoyed those. There's something about being a little further from the city, hearing the distant blaring of sirens coupled with the sweet twits of colorful birds that really speaks to the soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaochristine
50,Awesome!,"For a free attraction, the Griffith Observatory was amazing. Not just the views (which are spectacular and remind you of GTA V if you're a gaming enthusiast) but also the Observatory and exhibits itself. We went at dusk which was amazing, we got daytime pictures with the Hollwood sign in the background, and also sunset and night time pictures of the city. We also went into the Observatory and there was so much to do, you could easily spend half a day just exploring the science of space in there.To get there we got the DASH from Vermont Avenue which took about 10 minutes and was $1 per person, and is separate to the Metro so you can't use a TAP card etc.; they just take cash. It was quick and effecient and quite regular.Overall, I would definitely suggest a visit to the Observatory for the views and the science!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MR_Travels1920
50,Certainly the best views of LA,"This is definitely a tourist attraction, but one that should be on your ""must see"" list. You can spend 30 mins to over 3 hours inside and outside as there is so much to see. This is s museum as well as an observatory and there are several levels of information on the stars, and astronomers and life in out of space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763MelissaP
50,Gorgeous at twilight,"We were racing to get there before sunset, but ended up there at 6 pm--nighttime—and the views of L.A. were spectacular! Had no problem getting free parking on the roading leading up to the Observatory at that time. The observatory has various demonstrations--the Tesla machine, a huge telescope--that we were too early for, but had fun just walking around the place. The naked eye views were better than any iPhone photos, so best just to gaze. We were very near the Hollywood sign, behind us, but we could barely see its outlines since its nightlights never came on. On the drive up to the observatory you go by some amazing mansions--primo real estate, obviously. All in all, a worthwhile detour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leklekblue
40,Beautiful view of the city,"We really enjoyed our visit. The views are very nice on a clear day. If you can, be sure to visit on a sunny day as some of the exhibits rely on direct sunlight to be useful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ernieliedtke

50,Beautiful,"It's a wonderful place to go see the Los Angeles skyline, surrounding scenery, and the Hollywood sign. It can definitely get crowded as it is very beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsQ8220UJ
50,Bucket list visit,Living on the east coast and seeing this iconic location on so many tv and movie backdrops we had to go. The drive up to the park is truly amazing with beautiful views of LA and the Hollywood sign. The observatory is amazing in its Art Deco design. Inside is full of educational displays from plants and the stars to Tesla’s electric machine. Few things to note: can be very crowded inside with students and parking is pay by meter and walking up to the observatory can be exhausting but well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islander1971mv
50,Great Science Museum & Planetarium,"Besides the iconic grounds & building (which have been in dozens of movies over time) there are the amazing views of L.A. & the Hollywood sign. The museum is really about Cosmology & Astronomy. Stars, planets, etc. It is incredibly well done, and is small so it can be done in a few hours. The observatory is open at night for viewing whatever is interesting in the sky that night. If no planets are visible, it will likely be the moon. During the day, there is a sun telescope (with filter of course) and a really cool camera obsura. So good for day or night visits. And, of course, planetarium shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/illysez
50,Extremely busy,"The Griffith observatory is full of tourist from near and far. Especially busy on Friday and Saturday. Boasting the best views in LA it is quite a site to see. We could not really enjoy the exhibits based on there being so many people, but we were able to find some good places to take a few shots. I highly recommend visiting on a week day during the morning which was the advice of one of the workers when there is significantly less guest and it can be truly enjoyed. I also would love to see what it looked like at sunset, I bet the skyline is amazing. We went on a fairly clear day but there was a bit of an overcast typical for LA in February.Overall I would attempt to visit on a less busy day to get the true feel.Tip: if you go as part of a tour you get priority drop directly in front of the building. Otherwise you have to park quite away and walk uphill to the facility which can be problematic for those with mobility issues. Not recommended for those with height issues as it is very steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawyerBaeRenee
50,Loved this place,"What a great day to spend a first day in LA, after long journey from UK. I would advise to arrive prior to opening, as you should have a good parking spot at the top of the road, later on when we left the trail of cars parked on the road stretched well over a mile. The observatory and the views where amazing, but it was also a great spot to go walking on some of the trails and as I said for a first day in LA it was really great start. Parking is $10 an hour, however Observatory is free, we were passed a 3 hour ticket from someone who was giving up their space which just added to the day. Museum inside was informative, we didn't take in a visual show which you pay for, but young and old all enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhys_H24

50,Spectacular view and so much more,"We visited to see the amazing view overlooking LA but realized we should have planned for a longer day once we saw that it had so much more to offer. The view is just as good as one's you'll see from the Empire State Building, CN Tower or Willis Tower overlooking their respective cities. Not to mention it's free. The Observatory had so much more inside. It had an interactive history of the solar system, multiple theater experiences and world class telescopes. We just scratched the surface of what is an awesome place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeyRealtor

50,Hiking Hollywood,Brilliant hike around the observatory and all the way over for a photo op with the Hollywood sign. Great way to get out and about for the day. I took 5 hours to hike just taking my time following the different routes so if you’re a hiker allow plenty of time to get the best out of the area. Accessible by metro too so no need for an Uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notions
50,Interesting place with fantastic views,It's worth the drive for the views alone. The planetarium show was a bit simplistic but interesting. Go on a weekday before 4 and you will be able to find parking (at least on the street but close to the observatory). The first time we went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no parking anywhere close to the observatory so we had to drive back down without stopping. We stayed there for the sunset as did a lot of people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dctyyz
50,Very neat!,"This has been in so many movies that I love, we had to go. The drive up is wonderful, the views are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gablairin
30,LA Skyline,"Always wanted to see the city in lights LA, I am from the East Coast, I was sadly sooo crowded I didn’t get to enjoy anything on the inside, The Hollywood sign was not lit up, but I did see LA, maybe next time!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Regina351
50,"Stunning views, great trails and must go in the observatory","Where to start!? Well let’s just say if you want to get your exercise in - use the free parking at the base. It’s quite an elevated hike up to the observatory. Otherwise drive to the top and pay $10/hour to park - definitely worth it! There’s no fee to enter the observatory for the exhibits, so the parking fee was worth it to us! The exhibits are phenomenal! The hiking by the observatory - wow - great views, but steep! To enter the hiking trails walk toward the observatory and you’ll see off to the left is the trail (near the building). The paths are wide but steep! There’s plenty of restrooms on the hikes near the observatory. Take water with you though. The sunset from the observatory is breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravelusa
50,This is the place for Hollywood sign viewing,"Very cool place- lots of traffic from people walking, biking, hiking, and driving, to see not only the Hollywood sign, but awesome views of the L.A. area. We arrived around 830am, planning to just drive up, get out, and take pictures. We did that, and the sign is easy to see from the overlook. But then we realized what an incredible view of the entire city from this same spot. I would recommend to anyone who is going to l.a. To visit and has time to drive there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidn0209
50,Nice science exhibit,"The view is excellent, there is no doubt. But do not neglect the scientific exhibit inside the building. It is very nicely arranged and very educational for primary school kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamirS203

40,Excellent views,"This attraction has got busier over the decades to an extent that it can be a little claustrophobic. However, you get a good view of the Hollywood sign and a panoramic view of downtown LA. Parking if free at the Greek theatre a 20min walk below the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BT3rd
50,Must visit this!,Must go attraction! Awesome observatory to learn more about the universe. The show at the planetarium was an out-of-the-world experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850jiayanc
50,A true gateway to the cosmos,"For all the science and space lovers this is the place to be. So many different aspects and so many things to see, hear and touch. It's a unique experience, the telescope is amazing and the level of education is useful for every age.The Observatory holds public viewing events for most lunar and solar eclipses. There are different shows that are perfectly done, I would suggest Centered in the Universe. Be aware that you need to be there at least an hour and a half to buy tickets for the show, as there are lines. The entrance to the observatory is free of charge. Don't get over-excited about that Holywood sigh, as it is quite far though, bt the view down to L.A is just remarkable. The observatory can easily become one of the best spots of one's trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva

50,A great way to send an afternoon,My family had a great afternoon here. We saved the parking cost and did the short hike up from the golf course level. And the planetarium show is worth the few dollars cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twindad2013
50,Piece of my bucket list,Didn’t have the time to do this place justice but what I saw inside was amazing. Also very educational and lots of school trips were there. The views are to die for unbelievable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sallyalfie

50,Must visit and it’s free,"This place is just awesome. Can’t believe it’s free entry, free to see through a telescope and it’s open till late also. We watched Centered in the Universe show at Samuel Oschin Planetorium and it was just AWESOME. Tickets have to be bought on the day but use the kiosks if there is a big queue at the ticket window. There are other shows also but we couldn’t watch them. Can see awesome views of LA city from the observatory also. The guides are super helpful and knowledgeable. We were unable to see from the big telescope but the others mimic the same view. Would have liked to attend during the day also and with some more time. Next time I suppose.Definitely worth a visit, especially for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyaV661
50,Amazing Views,"We visited during late on a sunny afternoon; the vistas of the city were clear, the sunset was exquisite that evening, the free displays inside were excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/806RICKB
50,Great way to see the city,Park below and take the bus shuttle. Only .50 cents. Lots of educational exhibits to explore. Great views of downtown LA as well as iconic Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrp27
50,Visit with friends,"Everything at the Observatory was worth the wait to find a parking spot which was the only drawback as the walk can be a hike. Use sensible shoes and dress according to the temp for the day.. On a clear day, the view of the Hollywood Sign was fantastic as was the city of LA. The Planetarium and exhibits are spectacular. I recommend going in the evening so that when it gets dark you can use the telescopes to see the planets clearly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diplomasuccess1
50,Amazing intelligence in this building.,Entrance to the observatory is free however you have to pay for parking.Overwhelmed by the level of intelligence these scientists had.The observatory has several telescopes that you’re able to look through. Several hands on artefacts to teach and live shows to watch.You also get immense views all over LA and also the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916clairef
40,Something new different to do,Its interesting. If a night event you can use telescopes and see planets pretty clearly. Enough to see its shape. But its educational and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevot152
50,Busy,Beautiful building and views. Spectacular planetarium and exhibits. Very crowded. Impossible parking. Expect to walk. Avoid weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTravel695165
50,An Absolute Must See,"Without doubt, one of the 'must see' places in Los Angeles.Either daytime (for the Hollywood sign view), or nighttime (for the sea of LA neons by night), you can't possibly go wrong with the Griffith Observatory. Everybody - and I mean, absolutely everybody - loves it.Make sure to walk around the front of the building overlooking the city - one of the best views of LA you'll ever find.Make doubly-sure to go inside the main exhibition building, and - once inside - go DOWNSTAIRS to the huge presentation in the 'basement' area. There, tucked away in a quiet corner (blink and you'll miss it, you'll discover a little piece of moon rock (about the size of a golf ball) brought back from one of the Apollo missions. It's mind-blowing, and will score you a ton of kudos points with family & friends.Whether you make the observatory your first stop or your last stop in LA, it'll pull you in, lunar or later, like a supernova sucking in a teeny-tiny meteor.Resistance is futile. May the force be with you. Live long & prosper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulbK9778TB
50,Beautiful Universe,Great location and view. You learn A LOT at this place and what you can see through the telescopes makes you feel rather insignificant. Incredible experience. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/37hectord
20,"Too many people, terrible parking","If you don't like crowds avoid this place, particularly at sunset. Parking is exorbitant and the cafe is only mediocre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aeiou2018
40,Great place!,"Very nice place to hike with my husband, we like the variety of different hiking trails.The view is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arianar440
50,If you are looking for a hike in Los Angeles,There are many things to do in LA but if you want to combine sight seeing with some exercise you can park below Griffith Observatory and hike to the top. I wasn't in very good shape at the time but slow and steady got me there. Its a 400 ft climb and around .65 miles one way. From the top you can take pictures with The Hollywood Sign in the background and maybe buy a cold treat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4110DTroberth
50,Must See!,Our quick visit at the Griffith Observatory was not planned. Amazing views overlooking all of Los Angeles greeted us upon arrival. Enjoyed the lovely garden too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationer631410
50,Art Deco Jewel,Beautiful views as it’s high above Beverly Hills. So much info for star gazers or just mildly interested,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carmic01
50,Beautiful View and Historic Location,Griffith Park Observatory is a must see when you are in LA. On a clear day the view across the city goes all the way from Downtown to the Beach. Lots of trails to walk there as well. Great for a little time away from the office.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTootles
50,Perfect Valentine's Date,"Living in LA I have visited the Griffith Observatory many times, however for Valentine's Day is always my favorite!❤My husband and I have made it a tradition to watch the sunset from the observatories lovely view of LA, we then stay to enjoy the stars from the many telescopes that the observatory will place on their garden and my favorite telescope on the top terrace. Then end the night by going for dinner in Hollywood, Melrose or just about anywhere in LA!NOTE:Valentine's will be crowded so the easiest way to get to Griffith Observatory is by taking the DASH Observatory/Los Feliz bus from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Red Line station! And on weekends, you can ride the free Parkline Shuttle between the major attractions in Griffith Park. Did I mention that the entrance to the observatory is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678marier
50,Simply Stunning,"It is a must in L.A. No matter how many times I come to town , I just can’t avoid coming up here. The place is simply stunning , with those gorgeous views. Tip, try to go just before dusk, so you can photograph the Hollywood Sign, and then to see that beautiful city at night. Don’t miss it !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
40,Tradition to stop by.,My first tourist attraction I want to visit when I come into town. It has been several years since I was here but it was closed when I was last trip. Beautiful way to see the massive city and a glimpse of the ocean during sunset. I was surprised by the traffic and parking. $10 to park but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gosmiletoday
50,Great fun,"We took an Uber ride and were dropped off at Griffiths about 2pm weekday. Caught the planetarium show at 2.45pm and after that watched the Tesla ball get fired up and had a good look through the museum style displays. All a really high standard. Kinda like a school trip. All educational focused. Good viewpoints of city. Good chance for photos etc. Not possible to Uber back due to cellphone coverage at that height. Dash bus takes you back down the hill to either the Greek Theatre or onto Sunset metro station. I've heard that most people just visit Griffiths for photos outside, then leave. I can understand that. But if you do have some spare time its cool to look around. Nothing mind-blowing, but interesting enough to pass the time away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterm608
50,Wonderful experience,"Been coming here for years and I can highly recommend it. During the week is best and definitely see a planetarium show, especially if you have kids! Cafe is good for simple snacks, sandwiches, salads and coffee with a nice outdoor seating area with great views. Parking is challenging but if you pay more at the top lot it’s worth it unless you don’t mind walking uphill some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLondon26
50,Nice view,Good view of the city. Great for kids and family. Good learning environment. There was a line getting up the hill but it wasn't a line getting into the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368derrickb
50,Stunning views....,"I recently visited the observatory and was graced by the breath-taking views. The paid parking at the top is not worth it. Make sure you park in the free lot near the Greek theater. From the top, you can snap your photos of the famed ‘Hollywood’ sign in the distance. I was told you can get closer to the sign, but it’s a 3-hr walk (round-trip) from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjvanleuven
50,A Must do in LA! Planning ahead is the key to enjoyment!,"The Griffith is a must do in LA - if for nothing else but the scenery! Great shots of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA if nothing else. But the great things about this place does not stop there. The Observatory is top notch! One of the best I have been too! Yes, it is crowded and yes, parking does have it's issues, but the Griffith is a must see and has great value.If you put it on your list plan ahead- I cannot stress this enough! Due to it's popularity, shows and specials often sell out well in advance so buy on line and plan. Parking is a monster so take public transportation or a ride service if you can.Yes, Griffith can be a bit of a challenge, but well worth it. Plan ahead and you will have an enjoyable experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dkiefer1163376
50,Always beautiful. Very busy but always worth it.,"Get there early! Early being 7:00 am' ish Parking is now $10.00 an HOUR. Park down by the Greek Theater and hike up or take the bus up. Do not forget the hiking trails around the observatory, bring good shoes,water and a camera. Griffith is a wonderful place for kids and adults. It is safe and easy to use. Grew up here and I believe it is better than ever, aside from the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonpiperaway
50,Endless Views!,"Came here while in the area for a conference. By the time we got here it was already dark, but it ended up having breathtaking views. The lights from the city seemed endless and it was such an amazing experience, I think I would prefer to go at night! Unfortunately the Hollywood sign was not lit up, but you could still see it faintly. Very windy while we were up there, but that did not deter anyone. Inside there is a lot of educational areas and the staff is very engaging. We did not make it into the planetarium, but friends of ours said it was great. Definitely a must see if you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snow8791
20,Stay away on Weekends,"Although the views are spectacular our trip there was horrible. We read all the information provided on the internet. I would never recommend going on the weekend. There were hordes of people and the observatory is not equipped to handle them. The parking is a nightmare. Traffic jams, the Greek Theater parking is not close. The lines for the bus was super long it took 2 busses before we finally got on. The bus ride was jammed full. To get parking along the road you just have to get lucky someone is leaving and then you have to walk a long way to get to the observatory. You have to have a handicap sticker or an 88 pass to park close. Then if people leave the lot close they just might let some cars up. You are at their mercy. It is just luck. When you finally make it up after an hour and a half then you stand in lines to see their shows. It was not a good experience. I really cannot recocommend this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweetiepie135
40,Sunset beauty,Hiked up the hill which wasn't punishing and got to several spots to watch the sunset over LA. Gorgeous. The observatory itself was packed so I couldn't get to look through anything but I grabbed a position on the wall..lovely LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynp24
50,Iconic observation point,"Griffith Observatory is a great place to get the classic panoramic view of Los Angeles including best views of the Hollywood sign. The Observatory itself is architecturally striking Art Deco style and has scientifically interesting displays, though the interior itself is not large and can be toured in a short amount of time. There is very limited parking near the observatory (fee), including 7 handicapped spaces for which there is no charge. There are several hiking trail heads nearby, so naturally the area can get quite busy and congested. Definitely worth the effort. This location was used in the 50’s movie “Rebel Without A Cause,” starring James Dean. There is a memorial tribute to him on the right side leading up to the entrance to the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanabar
50,Fabulous!,"We had a blast. The view from the observatory is just stunning. We also visited the Planetarium, which was quite an experience. The only thing is that carparks are very limited. We parked in a residential area, about 10 minutes away and called an Uber to get up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toby0981
50,A must see tourist or not,Especially during a celestial event it is the hip place to be. There is a fantastic dog friendly trail you can walk to the top..The center is amazing a must see; but service dogs only inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peggyr299
40,"Very crowded, but interesting!","We tried to drive but the parking situation and traffic to get there are horrendous. We had to park far away and walk quite a distance to get to the Observatory. Once we got there it was very crowded, but we still enjoyed it. Great photo ops with the Hollywood Sign, and good view of downtown LA if it’s not smoggy. I would have liked to spend more time inside and learn about the exhibits, and the instruments they have there, but it was simply too crowded even early in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Astrobeemer
50,Great opportunity to look over LA with an incredible view,"I've always wanted to visit Griffith Observatory just to see the views it offers of LA and I wasn't disappointed. Finding parking was easy enough as it wasn't too crowded when I visited. However I'm sure it can become a nightmare on certain days if there's a lot of people visiting. Worth having a good camera with you if you want to capture some high quality images of the views, but I was happy with what I was able to get with my iPhone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Decj0791
40,Brief visit,We went briefly. The observatory was well maintained and had interesting exhibits. Due to it's popularity it was crowded and it was hard to find parking. It might be best enjoyed on a off peak time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgirdler
50,Absolutely Amazing!,"We spent a hour walking around and enjoying the views observatory! The grounds are beautiful and not that busy at 1030am on a Tuesday morning. Lots of parking, we parked close with a large SUV. The observatory and restaurant the day we were there didn’t open until noon. Restrooms near the parking lot were horrendous, ovoid then. But everything else in the park we explored was clean and easy to access. You can see the Hollywood sign, great photo spot. And you can really see LA! You can easily spend a couple hours and surely easy to spend a day at the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer0213
50,See the stars from LA,"Free, high-quality astronomy exhibits, in a gorgeous location! The first galleries are crowded, but once I travelled into the depths of the building I found more exhibits with fewer crowds. These well-designed exhibits transported me away from earth and across the solar system and beyond. Excellent displays & interactives, and simple signs that explained complex ideas in a way I found understandable despite not having a strong background in astronomy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greatgreenkale
40,Great view,We enjoyed our visit - the view is fantastic. Wonderful place to take pictures. We took a Lyft to the top because parking is limited and the hike up to the top may be challenging for some.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0beckyw

50,Really well worth a visit,"This is a great place to visit, such a great place, building and displays. There is plenty to see here and it looked like everyone visiting was enjoying everything.Very close to Hollywood, it’s worth stepping a little further out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570nickm
50,"Spectacular, not to be missed. Needs a rating more than 5!","This was a last minute add on visit for us, but if I were to be there again, this would be a highlight of a trip to LA. If you follow the GPS to the Greek theater or the Griffith Observatory, you will encounter signs to free parking in a large lot at the base of the hill. Park there for a nice walk (less than a mile) up the hill with beautiful views not only during the walk up the hill, but from the observatory at the top. (if the signs say parking full, that may well refer to the parking at the top of the hill). There is so much to see at the observatory, and no charge (other than for the planetarium move, which we did not see). Might be a good idea to first go downstairs (to the Leonard Nimoy theater) for a movie about the history of the Griffith observatory. A fantastic place with some hands on exhibits, lots of interesting sky related displays, a Foucault pendulum, moon rocks etc etc etc. I would give yourself a minimum 3 hours to park, walk, and see the observatory. I would rate this a 6 if I could.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldsmanh
40,Perfect sunset!,I went during the evening and had a great experience. Parking is a bit difficult and we had to walk uphill for approximately a mile. I would recommend taking an Uber or other ride share to prevent paying for parking and not having to walk. The sunset over the city was breathtaking. Very neat place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emybusta

It was a greasy mess. The tables were all dirty. Our table had an accumulation of grease that had to be virtually scraped off. We will return to the observatory, but we will eat in one of the (really good) restaurants down the hill on Vermont or Hillhurst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLB49

40,Amazing views,"Didn't get much from the museum itself but the views, oh THE VIEWS! Can't wait to hike up there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkusOli
50,Wow what views,I’m a huge fan of astronomy but the real star for me was the views of Los Angeles. That’s not saying the exhibits are great because they are. Not free especially when you add parking which can be really hard to find but not extravagant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edinsb2018
50,A favorite place in LA,"I love it here. The observatory has beautiful views of pretty much everything and you can just feel the history. The planetarium shows are pretty cool and if you belong to Friends of the Observatory there are special talks and viewings. There’s also great hiking around the area. Parking is a bit of a bear, but as long as you know that, you’ll have a great day. I do not recommend shoes with heels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chk1
50,Beautiful!,Highly recommend visiting here views are beautiful and Griffith observatory itself is very lovely! I visited in the day and would love to see it at sunset/night time this will be something I will be sure to come back and do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shinny_d
50,To cyclists dropping into LA; do it!,"Map it out, and head up to Griffith. The climb is nice and steady, the descent flows, and the views at the top are panoramic. I absolutely love this one ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidM8175
50,Best views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"If you want some of the best views of all of LA and the Hollywood sign for free this is the spot! The admission to Griffith is free, but parking near by is a charge. I would advise you to drive past it until you reach the ""park and hike"" parking lot which is very big and parking is free. The hike is about 20 minutes up if you're not in good shape and super quick on the way back down. The views along the way are incredible. NOTE it is all up hill, if you're not in good health I wouldn't advise it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kickinitwithkyla
50,Fun,A great place to go for a hike and end up with a spectacular view on Los Angeles. Try and go on off days as it does get very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allnines1414
30,"Eh, was okay","It was okay visiting this attraction. We had to see it since we've never been to the area. But it was somewhat boring. Not much to do in the actual observatory. We did hike a bit, which was nice though, but I wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FayFay17
50,Fascinating with views,"Very interesting exhibits especially the planets on the lower floor. Planetarium show excellent. Views are good. Takes a couple of hours to see everything. The only issue was using the LA Dash transport to get there, as the day was very crowded, it did not run on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahmB9853ZR
40,Amazing view - but no phone signal,"The view is amazing, mainly at evening timeHowever there is no phone signal, so make sure you know how to go backAlso, it can be really crowded",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramit1990
50,Awesome,"Great views, very well maintained. A terrific hike if that’s your thing, if not drive up and park a little closer. A must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenP252
40,Good venue terrible parking,The exhibits are very well presented but the parking is street side parallel only. On a Saturday or Sunday you can expect to hike uphill in excess of a half mile! Don’t go if rain is expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314carterw
50,Griffith Observatory,"I used to live within walking (long walk) / jogging distance to The Observatory and was always my finish line for my runs....and what a wonderful finish line to get to especially when around Sunset, there is no better place to be in LA than on top of the mountain next to The Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarronDeSanctis
40,beautiful place to see the sunset,"Griffith observatory offers fantastic views over the city of Los Angeles, it also holds some fascinating information regarding the sky above us. NOTE: get there early as traffic can b difficult and it takes longer than you think, if your using ride share ensure you allow an hour to get out of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shenaehyder
50,Iconic place with great view over the city,"Went to Griffith Observatory with the family while on vacation in the LA area and we all enjoyed the area and the fantastic views over the city.Griffith Observatory stands at the east end of the Hollywood Hills, in Griffith Park, and overlooks the Los Angeles Basin. On a good day, the view from there is fantastic, with the downtown straight to the south and the endless expanse of LA all the way from west to east. Well worth the visit, even if it requires walking up from the parking areas down the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EagleFlyer
40,Cool hike to the top,"Park in the lot down at the bottom of Ferndell and (easy) walk to the top. We did this with 2 kids (4 & 6) and grandparents (mid 60's). It's fun to see the Hollywood sign from different spots as you get to the top. Once at the observatory, see the show in the planetarium and wander through the museum. Pack a picnic and eat on the lawn. It's a good way to spend half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irsh21
50,Beautiful Views,"This was my first time to visit the Griffith Observatory. I must say Everyone should visit. We were there an hour before sunset and the view is Beautiful.I recommend to come earlier that 1 hour prior to sunset as parking and traffic is overwhelming on the weekends. We chose to park at the Greek and walk 1 mile (uphill). The parking is free.Many people try to park closer but you are not guaranteed to find a spot and you will waste at least an hour circling around.If you stay past dark. They had telescopes to view a few of the planets in the sky.We watched the show “Centered in the Universe” inside the panetarium for $7 per person. Well worth it. Also, get you tickets early as this show usually sells out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/759vincenta
50,Great view,"Great view, and you can also access to the middle and get to see information about space, and it is also a gift shop and a coffe shop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenCierra
40,Iconic scenery!,"We didn't go in to see the telescope, but surely enjoyed the scenery on a beautiful day! It was worth the congestion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithbV8579DA
50,Amazing view,"Besides fee for parking this is free. Fantastic view over LA from this nearby attraction. There is a coffeeshop/restaurant for people like me who wants a pause with a cup of coffee sitting on a chair, preferably outside with a view. Combine this visit with a walking trip on the mountain trails to the Hollywood sign. It takes 1-2 hours to get there but is worth every penny. Bring lots of water on hot days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30larsh
50,Good view,It was very good!! The view up there was so nice!! You could see the Hollywood sign and take out good pictures!! And the inside part was so good too!! I definitely want to go and visit it again soon!! You could see L.A from the observatory and take out good pictures!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashhh_26
50,Lovely Walk and Nice Experience,"It was a great tour and be ready to park and walk a bit if you visit on a busy day. Even though a lot of people parked more than 1/2 mile away from the observatory, I found parking available very closer to the observatory.. Please remember, if you want to use the telescope at the observatory, that's between 7.00pm and 9.00pm on weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayexpeditions
50,Great Day explore the wonders of the universe,"Free museum open to the public with some of the best view of L.A available. Interesting thing to do and learn, many you tube reviews so go and look but none do it justice as compared to being there yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopperprice71
40,Star Party,"We attended the most recent Star Party at Griffith Observatory... It was a great experience watching the sunset over LA and the Hollywood sign. The views across the city are stunning.Amateur astronomists bring their telescopes and gather outside the observatory to share their passion for the stars with the general public... The observatory and planaterium were also open.Only downside is its not a hidden gem, clearly massively popular and very very busy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BebeDrew
50,A wonderful place for the curious mind,I regret I didn't have enough time for my kids to 'play with' all the exhibits at the observatory. Exhibits are the best I've seen at science museums I visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jungshiks2019
50,A must-do in LA,"Unforgettable, panoramic views over LA, plenty of space. Don't forget the educational factor, it's a great observatory with many interesting events happening. Parking is never easy and rather expensive ($10 per car).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katrinaw707
50,Get to the sky,"Great place both, as educational Center and because of absolutely breathtaking view from there. We went many times with teens and family members of 78 and every time each of us learned something new. I highly recommend to visit this wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838geniar
50,Put this on your must-do list in Los Angeles,"Parking is no longer free but admission to the observatory is still free, so the parking fee is well worth it. I've been many times and have enjoyed sharing this iconic building many friends.The building has a long and interesting history there is still a working Observatory. Many nights you can even catch a glimpse through one of the telescopes for free but the lines are generally long.The city views are amazing both at night and in the daytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857hermanj
50,Worth the walk from the Hollywood sign,We walked the 2.5 miles from the Hollywood sign to the Observatory. It was a beautiful day and the Observatory was a mob scene. The park is beautiful and the Observatory has lots of interesting exhibits that are free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeesaD27
10,Lots of peoiple and long wait,"We went on a Fridat night. The cars were lined up and movng slowly. Most parking lots were full. We found a spot and took the shuttle bus up. The main entrance was closed and guy were periodically use a magephone to say the main entrance was closed but entrance was through the elevator. The web site said there would be people setting up teleccopes, so I searched the terraces and found a long line for the telecope. It was a clear night the moon was just a sliver with a planet above it. The line was really slow moving and when we got to the front of the line we were told the telescope viewing wouldn't start for another hour.We went inside and looked at some exhibits and decided to leave rather than wait an hour. We were really disgusted that there wasn't any information/signs or anyone letting people know what was going on and when. Thousands of people disastisfied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wineanddine32
40,Great views of LA,Visited as a stop on a tour. Great views of LA. too far from Hollywood sign for a good selfie. Not too busy (4th jan). Was dropped off at the top - be aware I saw people sweating their rocks off walking from the car parks as I travelled back in the tour bus. Plenty of things to see and do.4/5 as it it not the best spot to see Hollywood sign from - but I read that residents nearer the sign really do not like sightseers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andygR9400XH
50,Ambling visit to the Observatory,"Very good spot, perched up the hills and a lovely view of Hollywood sign and other Los Angeles areas. Great deal of information in the observatory and pretty cool view of the planet Venus through the telescope. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/padkri2019
40,Best views of LA at sunset,"This is a place you go to even if you're not into astronomy. Unfortunately, I missed out on the telescopes but the view over LA was stunning. Be aware that crowds really build up in the hour before sunset and it's almost impossible to get a car park at the top unless you arrive very early. If, like me, you arrived with the crowd, it's probably best to park at the large field part way up the hill and walk the final km or so. You'll probably out-pace the cars and it's not too steep. I got there about 15 minutes before the sun went down over the horizon and the sunset over the ocean was magnificent. This is definitely a place you should visit if you're in LA but make an afternoon of it and get there early enough to get full value. Best of all, its free (even the parking)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelbourneMacca
40,Loved the planetarium show,"The biggest downside to the observatory was the parking. It's prohibitive close to the Observatory, so we parked down by the Greek Chruch, but it's quite an uphill walk from there to the planetarium. Going back was easier on the legs. I dropped the family off and did the walk myself and then back with the family.As for the observatory it has a lot of little exhibits.. None of them are spectacular, but some are fun (faraday cage). The highlight was the planetarium show. We did the early morning show as it's the only one they allow young kids to. It was a really impressive show and both the 3 yr old and 9yr old enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior
50,Jan 3,We really enjoyed the Griffith Observatory. It was just very crowded and we didn’t get to see everything we wanted too. I wished they opened earlier than noon. Enjoyed and tiring day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaP224
50,Spectacular views of LA & an interesting show,"Public transport can get you right to the top so I'd avoid driving as the parking was full. The views across LA are absolutely amazing. We arrived in time to watch the sunset, went inside & watched the show, then got views of the city at night when we came out. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieY641
40,Nice Information and Location to shoot Hollywood Sign Photos,This is on little height which makes it perfect for Hollywood Sign as well as entire LA city photos. The information inside the building is amazing about Planets etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrienDeep
40,Space and science 101,"This is an amazing place to visit if you were ever interested in anything about the solar system, our planet, earthquakes, ocean tides, and how much you would weigh on each of the planets in the solar system. It teaches you about eclipses, stars, and has stunning visuals and interactive displays. Well worth your time. They have movies also but it is best to buy your ticket fast as they fill up quickly. You have stunning views of the valley on the outside walkways. The only downside is that parking at the lot at the observatory is $10.00 an HOUR. You can’t see it all in an hour so park below and enjoy the walk up. This is an amazing place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestJordanJim
40,Great place to visit but be aware parking is full well before it opens,"I’m really glad we went up here to see all the views and this landmark! One thing I didn’t realize was that while the observatory opens at noon the park and parking area are open hours before that so the parking leading up the whole road was full when we got there at 1130 as was the not very big parking area on top- be prepared to circle the lot and hope to find someone leaving so you can snag a spot esp the later you get there. It didn’t take us long so that might be the norm! We didn’t hike or do a show and spent about one hour there with two ten year olds which included a 20 min wait for the bathroom- I would say my only complaint is the bathroom situation there, single bathrooms that are pretty gross and long lines for them. (If there were other bathroom options I didn’t see them) . Would recommend visiting for sure just be aware of parking situation and go to the bathroom before you head up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncdel
50,Nice view over LA and Hollywood,"Griffith park is a good place to get an overview and view of the LA area. You get a nice photo op of the Hollywood sign. Don’t be afraid to park further down and walk up the scout trail which starts at the golf club, or further up and walk up the road. If you do, you get a nice walk and the parking is free. Bring a snack lunch and sit on the lawn In front.This is a good spot whether alone, with friends or kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob-CS
30,needs updating,"Parking system is bad, free shuttle takes only exact changethe whole place needs serious upgradesbathrooms are really dirtyfood expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FauziOG
50,Amazing views of LA & Hollywood Sign,On my bucket list and James Dean (featured in Rebel Without a Cause) is honoured with a bust.Amazing views - downtown LA to the sign to the coast to the snow capped mountains.It was really busy (New Years Eve day and Rose bowl) so an Uber/Lyft gets you taken right to the top otherwise a bit of a hike.Worth the effort either way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanOBrien7
50,"Very unique place, a must visit","We visited the observatory and there was a lot of traffic going there, parking is very limited. We went on a Sunday and couldn’t find a place where to park so we tried the next day in the morning and it was much better. Great views of downtown LA, Hollywood sign, and you must visit the inside. It was very unique and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377erickn
50,"Nice building, great views",It's free to visit and the views from this beautiful building make it one of the must see places in Los Angeles. Take also a hike to at least Mt Hollywood for great views over the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
40,Great location to look down on LA,An excellent place to visit if you have any interest in what's beyond our atmosphere. Probably not suitable for pre-teenage but otherwise caters for all levels of curiosity. Also good for taking photos of LA and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion552792
30,One of places where you get to see the Hollywood sign from,We had to get there to be able to take a photo with the Hollywood sign in the background. The observatory is sort of fun but for someone who has been studying the whole moon landing thing and is interested in science but not fiction it maybe better to cruise through it. Parking can be a problem so early morning hours recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex78J
50,Incredible view but busy,"Super nice view of LA, bus is convenient to go there. Can be busy at peak time, but. A most do while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovegoodfoodgoodwine
50,Fantastic View,"It was a very day when our family visited this place. It's is very informative, lot of things to learn with a very fantastic view of Los Angles which to include is the Hollywood sign up the mountain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsa030180
50,Good fun and education for the family and great view of LA,My daughter is really into astronomy and the planets. So we went up there on the first Friday of the month. During this time they have special showings and people out with the telescopes to show and teach all. I highly recommend. Note. The most of the parking is metered and walking up steep hills. adjust accordingly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreanicu
50,Great once you get past the parking,One of the must visits for anyone visiting or living in LA. It's got the history. It's free except for the movies. You can learn a great deal about science and astronomy. Lastly it has a gorgeous unparalleled view of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9444FTpatrickc
50,A day in the Observatory,Lovely place but it was quite hot when we visit. Los Angeles city view was hazy but aside from that we learned a lot. So much to see inside plus we watch the exhibition outside about the sun and time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gracie515
40,"Beautiful views, especially sunset","Parking can be an issue. The lot at the observatory was full when we went, but you can park along the road on the way up or down (for $10) - although it is a bit of a hike to the observatory. The views are great. Be there for sunset. It can get very crowded, so good pictures are difficdult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pookiepoo216
10,Bad parking and visitor management,"We wasted 2 half days trying to visit the observatory but could not. Parking gets full at 9 AM even though the observatory opens at 10 AM on weekends. The parking down below is available but the shuttle service which is supposed to run every 20 minutes, runs every 40-60 minutes and by the time it arrives at the parking lot it is already half full from god knows where. You should only attempt if you want to spoil your vacation.They need to add a nominal entrance fee to discourage the locals from going there everyday by the thousands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevA738
50,A must go in LA,Fabulous views. Interesting displays. The talks if you can catch one by the parks people were very informative. Crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775vickip
50,Great views,Highly recommend a visit to here. Parking is $10 but enter to the observatory is free. So much to see when inside but views of LA from the roof and outside is spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellutd
40,I had no idea there was so much to see inside,Great day out. Spectacular view over Los Angeles. View of Hollywood sign. Drive and park at the top for $10. Try to avoid buying food from there as its expensive and crap.I would love to have spent more time here as I didn't realize there was so much to see inside. Great Los Angeles activity to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozeire
30,Come early,Come early if you want to get a good free parking..hike up the hill. Check opening times before arriving.it will be crowded when it opens..and there is nothing to do before it opens.You can get a decent picture of the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360sofiam
50,Beautiful view!,I honestly wasn't expecting to be this impressed! The drive up was more than I thought also. Parking is about 10.00hr all the way around the streets and as you get up to the parking lot by the observatory. Take your time and be patient and you'll find a spot.The view all around is just stunning. You get a great view of the Hollywood sign as well. The observatory was very packed. We didn't spend too much time in there because it was hard to move about.I wish I would have had more time to go explore the park. That's okay. Just another reason to cone back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
50,Amazing experience,"Many people do not know about this place but it is worth every penny and the views are absolutely stunning. Transportation to the observatory is always easy to come by, as well! I will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbm_1990
50,"Stars, views and more","So we headed up to the observatory partly for the views and to visit the planetarium. Can not fault the trip, inexpensive and something a little different from the norm. The kids enjoyed it and the views across LA are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theboffs
50,What a View,"Go for the jaw dropping view, explore the observatory while you're at it and learn about some astronomy. Would love to go at night which I heard is a cool experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hatunes
50,The best of LA,"The Griffith observatory is literally the best thing in Los Angeles to visit, the views are fantastic either Griffith park or the sprawling roads through the city, the building is so famous from 50's movies to Star Trek. Inside is a delight and the exhibits well maintained and updated, the planetarium is one of the best with a great presenter, well worth the visit twice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
50,Amazing,This place and this view are amazing ! I really loved it and will definitely come back. The planetarium was really interesting too. Be careful when you park (you have to pay $20) and be there in advance if you want to see the sunset because you'll have to walk a lot to get to the Griffith Observatory !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morganegd
40,HIKE FOR HOLLYWOOD SIGN? DO THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE,"Don't want to walk for miles to see the Hollywood Sign? Go here instead. Uber up (or walk, up to you) to tick the sign off your list. It won't be in your face huge, but it will be enough to get a shot and say you've seen it.The Observatory itself showcases LA in it's smoggy glory, but on a good day it's worth the magnificent views from any angle.Some great instagram shots here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaniaCherie
50,Interesting place,"Best time to visit this place is in the evening hours. Late evenings will offer you fantastic city light views from terrace.Also, this place offers planetarium shows at very affordable ticket price. This is a must go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neville_lawrence
50,We stopped in on our way to hike up to the Hollywood sign,The workers were very pleasant and helpful. We did not go through the entire Observatory because we were pressed for time. But I wish we had more time as what we saw was amazing. I am thankful that the workers were able to help us plan for the hike to the Hollywood sign. The Observatory is the starting point to the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywood_Help
50,Sunset views of LA - Just awesome,"Beautiful views of the LA downtown, Beverley Hills and Hollywood symbol. The best views of hollywood symbol is from the observatory.Best time of day to visit is around sunset to see the sky turn colourful behind Beverley Hills. The backdrop is simply fantastic. Post sunset attend an informative show at the planetarium and by the time you are out of the show, you are treated with a well lit Los Angeles.The only downside at the Observatory is that the signal on mobiles are very weak and hence booking taxis can be a challenge, especially in the evenings.A must visit attraction in Los Angeles. You can cover the beautiful views and a show at planetarium, all in less than 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3vivekh
50,The most sublime views,"Anyone who has played Grand Theft Auto, you know you have to visit this spot! Literally this is the best view you can possibly get of LA! I’d suggest taking Uber up though. They have a few telescopes so you can see the city. Also you can see the Hollywood sign really close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDS
30,"Landmark architecture and location, usual astronomy stuff","Great location with views of Los Angeles on a clear day, sits perched atop a hill on its own large green zone with hiking trails, a photo opp place near the famed Hollywood sign, parking far away and need to walk during tourist season, the theatre and show (depends on the day) with live narration are nice but not WOW, theater is not very large, other exhibits are interesting. The building and it’s architecture is unmistakable from the travel brochure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reggie300

Clear day or night great view of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJ4444
30,Way too crowded!,Not worth the hype... at all. Cool views from the top and nice to walk around but nothing to write home about. Incredibly crowded with tourists. Don’t bother going here if you have limited time in LA! There are so many better things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhayno
40,A beautiful view & a cool building!,An iconic location that was worth the hike from parking.Be prepared to walk up a hill as the parking is located lower down the hillside and can be crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenaex
50,"Beautiful place, friendly staff, informative exhibitions!","Don’t know how come we haven’t visited Griffith in our past trips to LA. An absolutely gorgeous place! The scene is stunning to look out to Hollywood and city. Nice trails if you like to stroll a bit. The observatory is not big, and everything and everyone is super nice. It has a bit for everyone from every background and any age.Must do: the planetarium show! What a performance! Yes, I said performance. I have been to similar shows, usually a 20-30min video that projected to the dome. But the one here, the narrator delivered it live like an actor on stage. Super engaging, powerful!We park at the bottom of the hill and took the shuttle bus. It’s quite convenient. Get your changes ready.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanshanl2016

50,Excellent arts and view of the city,"We went 15 minutes before it opened and it was the best time to go, easy to find parking and no line to get on the tram. We spent two hour there enjoying the exhibit, the garden and the beautiful view of the city. Parking is 20 dollars if over an hour and museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/957alisonw
50,Awesome views,This is a perfect target for a visit on clear day. The building itself is worth a visit but the views - not to be missed. There are free bathrooms up top. Combined with a hike makes a perfect half a day activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
40,A Great Place to Visit,This is a great place to visit in its own right and also provides excellent views of the city and the Hollywood Sign. Definately worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OntarioPilot
40,Check it out!,"I have gone up here to prepare for every audition I've ever had, and although it's never worked, I am always dazzled by the view of this beautiful city.

50,Take the bus!,"My flight from London, UK arrived at 2pm in Los Angeles and to get over jet leg I decided to head over to the Griffith Observatory at 6pm - having unpacked my case at the hotel. As it was really 2am for my body clock; I decided to take public transport. Luckily the LADOT Observatory bus which runs all the way to the museum entrance stopped about 100 yards from my hotel and for 75 cents it was not only cheap but saved me driving tired!The cafe is very good and stocks salads, sandwiches and wraps by Wolfgang Puck. First class!The Observatory has some great exhibits including the Zeiss telescope. And with most of the hiking tours to the Hollywood Sign starting just outside, it’s well worth a visit...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jassimalkanani
50,Marvellous bequest to the City,"After many viewings of the edifice on high during our walking around LA it was great to visit it early Saturday morning. Approaching from Los Feliz we had increasingly splendid panoramas of it as we arrived.We enjoyed our couple of hours examining the exhibits and planetary modelling. Seeing the 12 inch Zeiss telescope was interesting, but timing didn’t allow peering through it.Guides were on hand to illustrate and inform, including a demonstration of the sun’s movement as reflected and measured on a metallic arc.Affording tremendous vistas over the city, it is also one of the best vantage points for the Hollywood sign. A popular film location, scenes from many famous films have been shot here, including The Terminator and La La Land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,A look into the stars,"I lived in Los Angeles area for 30 plus years. My first visit to Griffith observatory was amazing you'll see a lot of stars and a lot a people, you must be willing to wait on lines but it is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afuntravel
50,Very interesting with a great view of the Hollywood sign.,Only spent a short time here from a bus tour but would like to go back and see more. Interesting exhibits inside and great view of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brtravelfamily
50,Amazing Visit,This place is a museum that many people don't know about... the Planetarium is worth every penny and the views are spectacular. Used public transportation to get there on the weekend but the bus runs very often and don't have to wait much.We loved the gravity class related to your weight in every planet.For sure we are coming back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasming
50,Cool Free Fun,"We travelled here in October 2019, with 2 children aged 11 and 8.My son loved every minute we we're here, so much to see and experience, the shows were amazing.I am a James Dean fan, so to have my photo taken with his statue was something I had wanted to do for a long time. The views are breath taking, to be so close to the Hollywood sign was awesome.Something you should go and see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144mels
50,so worth it,"cool hike up to the observatory. nice views of the city and the Hollywood sign. located in Griffith park. spent more than an hour inside.unfortunately it was a rainy day so i could not look through the solar telescope. but the exhibits were amazing, so fun and interactive. for all ages !!they have a free show about the observatory history, or you can pay to see a movie at the planetarium as well. the do have a cafeteria and a gift shop.would definitely recommend !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacqquel
40,Interesting site seeing,Go all the way up for a parking. 10$ per hour unless you can park free and take a shuttle. Interesting shows and views. First buy a show ticket and than walk arround 1 hour throughout the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MottiS15
40,Cool spot,Visitors to LA looking for a nice hike up to a cool building with an amazing view of LA. That's about what we got. Well worth it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMROCKS
50,Amazing way to see LA,"My wife and I spent a few days in LA and this was on our list of places to visit. We were not disappointed. It was pretty cool to see all the exhibits, the telescope and seeing LA from that height is just amazing (especially on a clear day.)We can’t wait to take our kids, even if you aren’t into space and astronomy, it’s very cool. Lots of great spots to take pictures including the Hollywood sign.Parking is not too bad and try to park as close to the main entrance because the walk up the road is exhausting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarin009
40,Learn about the real stars.,Lots of free exhibits and some hands on learning. Plenty to do even if you decide not to see a presentation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennisrsmith1
40,It’s all about the views.,"Whether you want to get a selfie with the Hollywood sign, enjoy the overlook of the LA sky line or look up into space. It’s truly all about the view. The most challenging obstacle was getting to the top of the hill to enjoy it all on a busy Saturday and sunny clear afternoon when it was super busy and the parking lot was full. It’s a long hike from the lower parking lot all up hill to the top. It was worth it, we took our time and enjoyed the all the Observatory had to offer. I am really surprised they don’t charge a fee and its Free. Its a very cool place at the top of the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCoxygenman
30,Typical tourist spot,"It is a nice place to go to if you want to learn more about astrology and if you are into those kind of topics. If you are not, well you'd still enjoy it with views of the Hollywood sign and of the city. But beware, this is a typical tourist spot so crowds will definitely be CRAZY HUGE during the weekends. As what we've experience, long lines for the show and they would often even close the doors because they have reached the maximum capacity of people inside the observatory. So keep in mind it would be best to go here on the weekdays and of course off peak seasons!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zivac08
50,I must place to visit,Loved this place & to take fantastic photos of the famous Hollywood sign in the back ground great memories,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillieMargoLarkin
50,One of the best free things in life,"There is a saying that the best things in life are free and Griffith Observatory is certainly one of them. There are several interesting exhibits inside related to astronomy. Even those who are not into astronomy are likely to enjoy this observatory. There is a planetarium inside, where there are periodic shows at a nominal charge. There is an outdoor viewing platform from where one can get some spectacular views of downtown Los Angeles. Parking could be a nightmare if one decides to park the car at the upper level. The best way to avoid that nightmare is by parking the car downstairs and taking the shuttle bus up the hill directly to the entrance of the observatory. Certainly would very highly recommend visiting Griffith Observatory to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716sachink
40,Great for Sunset,"Great view of LA, especially for Sunset. It used to be one of the last free things to do in LA. Now you have to pay to park. It is crowded, so be prepared. The museum inside is cool. Favorite part is where you see how much you weigh on each planet. During the summer they have star party nights. they bring out telescopes and tell you about stars and planets you are looking at. Super fun.Would definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akw4945
50,Many reasons to visit,"A lot of people come here to take photos but there is much more then that to this observatory museum.The views surrounding are magnificent, especially from the roof.It’s the kind of place where everyone can go their own ways to explore. The history of how it came to be is interesting. There is a lot of information to be learned if you wander around the inside. The Tesla coil show was very cool.We came up on opening to avoid some of the crowds. We drove right up top to the car park no problem. Parking was $10 approx depending on how long you want to stay.It was busy but not packed. The gift shop is worth a look too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whanau_travels
50,Amazing Tour of Space,Amazing view. Awesome and interesting facts surrounding you in a friendly way. Lots of on-going sessions on site during day. Parking costs $10 per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmckennedy
50,Starbright education/entertainment,"Spent 2 hours at the planetarium(needed 3). Parking too expensive ($10/hr at the hilltop, next time park on the access road). Permanent educational presentations great for all ages(ie hall of the sky &hall of the eye) and no entry fee.; special events like history/renovation of the planetarium(free) and evolution of the universe($10) are mind expanding. Outdoor views of LA, the Hollywood hills and the grounds are an added treat. Cafeteria not bad.;",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelk265
30,It was closed but the view ;was great anyway.,"A bit annoying that it was closed but we hadn't checked before. However, the view over the city was not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imandher
40,Seeing Stars,"Went too late for sunset, but got to see the city lit up and watched the planetarium show, which is narrated live and really well done by a lady with a very expressive voice. Went to the roof for the telescope viewing but wait was 40 minutes - too long and too cold to wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moferry
40,Good place to learn,"Cons: Too many visitors in the Saturday afternoon, no safety check for admission. A bit worried when hear gun violence everywhere across USA.Pros: Very informative and easier for kids to learn. Beautiful architecture, nice view of Hollywood sign and LA. Free parking available down hills, less than 1 mile walk to the observatory is very nice. We bought tickets for ""Centered in the universe"" show at Samuel Oschin Planetarium which runs about 30 minutes, very nice show, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimzhao
50,Informative,Griffith Observatory has a lot to offer for students as well as any adult curious mind. Views are amazing from the facility and the museum contains a lot of information. I spent nearly half a day here and felt that I could have still spent more. The only downside was the restaurant with very limited food options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkshayaS1978
50,Beautiful views of LA,"We visited the Observatory because it's one of the best places to get panoramic views of the city along with the iconic Hollywood sign and the beautiful snow capped mountains. Even on a cloudy/rainy day the views did not disappoint. If you drive (like we did) make sure to park in the free parking zone and catch the Dash shuttle to take you back and forth. They charge 50c per adult and 25c for kids. We went around 2pm and if it had been a clear day we would have gone around dusk (best time for photos). For the more active crowd - the observatory sits at the peak of Griffith Park which has plenty of hiking trails, a bird sanctuary and picnic areas at the base. It would be a great place to spend an early morning to hike/run and end up at the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niavm2017
50,Amazing views,"Great place, great view of LA and the Hollywood sign. There are so many helicopters flying around LA it is incredible. I thought they were twinkling stars!! Get there early though traffic is horrendous. Parking is expensive so you might be better off getting a taxi and walking up the hill. It's only 10 minutes walk from the Greek restaurant. Uber pick up is about 15/20 minutes walk from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TurnerPatrol
50,Awesome show at the planetarium,"Well worth a trip with free entry and only $7 for a show at the Planetarium, which was very cool. We got an Uber there but there's very little internet service at the top of that hill so was harder getting one back. If you go to the drop-off area you can just about get signal there (the building seems to block it).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc3012
50,Very nice Views,"A couple of days ago, we walked the grounds of the Griffith Observatory. It offers very nice view of Los Angeles area. Plus the building is a very beautiful building that is nice for picture opportunities. I highly recommend anyone stopping by here. Its free parking too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLeB325
50,Awe and wonder,"Awe and wonder at so much excellent informative information about the stars, the earth and how it all comes together. Excellent access by public transport and a great walk down if that is what you enjoy. The views of LA are worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TUIWellington
40,Well worth a visit,"First time I've been! Pay the parking, straight to the top. Enjoy! The views are worth it if smog and haze allow",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanT701
50,Lovely place to visit,We parked at the bottom & walked the hill to see the observatory & the Hollywood sign! It was a lovely walk & worth it when we got to the top.I would recommend taking sometime to explore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomase77
40,One of the Must See Attractions,Visited the Observatory and had a chance to walk around the park. It is a historic building in a beautiful setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mark2016-57
40,You're a tourist| You saw it in a movie | Therefore it must be seen,"Uber to the observatory, then take a light hike in the area, after your obligatory selfie with a panoramic view of LA behind you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlwethuTK
50,Amazing views of Los Angeles and the stars,One of the treasures in LA. Very educational state of the art Observatory with huge telescope. Expansive views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valleysteve
50,Interesting,The Griffith Observatory is a very interesting place to visit - the museum is across two floors and provides a lot of information on astronomy etc. It also has great views of the Hollywood sign and LA in general.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AVL4
50,Over the top,"This is a place that need to be visited , cannot miss the view .... simply amazing.The best time of the days is the sunset and if you are lucky with sunny and clear day , the colors are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68TRAVELLER79
50,Stunning views,Visited on a Monday so the observatory itself was closed but still one of the best spots for magnificent views over LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomTomTiek
50,Very interesting,Lots of cool stuff here and even a mega telescope . I find this kind of thing fascinating . We enjoyed it and there’s a great panoramic view of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign . Go early or the parking is absolutely insane !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lavidal2013
50,Great Visit!,"We had no plans to come inside the observatory, but while walking around we ended up coming inside and buying tickets for a show. What a great time we had, the guy who narrates is so engaging and expressive, it was hard not to be at awe of everything he said. It even made me sad that in previous travels we never made time to come, but so happy we made the time for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyngtz
50,Went up at night,Absolutely breathtaking views of Los Angeles at night. Very crowded and lineup to the telescope was wrapped around the building. Lots to see and read in the exhibits. We Ubered right to the top so no long walk up from the parkinglots for us!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LF918
50,A Must See!,This is one of my most absolute favorite places to visit in Los Angeles... especially if you love the the stars and planets. Don't forget to see the movie either. It is amazing and will leave you wanting to learn more. Also there are great hiking trails near by. Don't pay for a hiking tour though just adventure off on your own. Amazing views of Los Angeles. Just don't stay past sundown. The animals that live in the mountains come out at night and I doubt you will want to meet them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyeAwayWithMe
50,AWESOME,just as expected and perhaps better - views sublime and a smashing tourist spot. You can see the Hollywood sign and the area is fascinating with the John Lennon tree just abobe too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffg884
50,Free and Fabulous,"It’s iconic. You’ve seen it in many films - there’s even a James Dean, Rebel Without A Cause plaque, and there’s no better spot to view the Hollywood sign. The Observatory itself is smallish, a bit cramped and it’s displays are a bit of a letdown, but it’s an historic building and beautiful nonetheless. But it’s the grounds that are the real draw. Many people bring picnics, or buy food inside, and spread out in the expansive grounds. The views are outstanding, all water, mountains, gleaming skyscrapers in the distance and, of course, that sign, up close and personal. Parking is available but it’s limited; I advise you take an uber. One of the best free things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WispyRobin
50,Amazing views,"Took a city bus up to the Observatory for 50 cents! The views were so spectacular that we decided to stay for the sunset which was stunning. It wasn’t open (closed on Mondays) but it was worth going for the view. You can see the Hollywood sign from here but it is still a distance away. On the grounds around the building it shows the orbits of the different planets which was pretty cool. Definitely worth taking the trip up there. I would have loved to have gone inside, maybe next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmanzine
50,Great iconic visit,"Great place to visit everything you see from the views are amazing on a clear day , we parked at the base and did the 1 mile hike to the observatory should have been more prepared as the weather was hot, great place to see the iconic Hollywood sign and Interesting tour of the grounds , worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9114LOandrewh
50,Greatest view on LA,Went to the observatory for sunset over the city. I love the place. First appearance of the Terminator and great view on Hollywood sign and downtown LA. Thé parking is so expansive but more convenient than walking all the way up to the observatory...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronanb349
40,"Fantastic, Cool, Crowded, but horrible parking experience","The observatory could not be cooler. The indoor and outdoor experience is fantastic, right down to the view of LA and the HOLLYWOOD sign on the hill. Great place at sunset and would like to see it at sunrise. Two issues: Because it's cool it's crowded and you will have to park at least a mile away and walk. Uphill! It was worth it to take photos, but man it's a hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conradusa
50,What do you see on a clear day?,"UCLA. Movie fans will recognize the view. Actually, it is ""views,"" as this place has quite the panorama.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronh581
50,Great observatory!,"I took my kids to the Griffith observatory after a weekend at Disney. Even though they were tired we had a blast. They loved the Telsa Coil and the giant telescopes.Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time but we are certainly going back the next chance we have.The exhibitions are awesome and I was able to educate my kids in astronomy.I recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RapiroSan
40,Gorgeous,"This is definitely a must do if you have the time. The views are amazing! And the exhibits inside are fascinating as well. I wish we’d had time to do any of the shows. I’m not going to sugarcoat it — the bathrooms leave a lot to be desired. But everything else was great, even the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecbronze
50,Amazing,"This was high on our list of places to visit when we visited LA and it did not disappoint. Entry is free and we used the local bus to get up there, the views are stunning. We went early evening and had the amazing sun set and it offers great views of the Hollywood sign. Inside there is so much to read and learn. Would recommend visiting to anyone interested in space or purely wants an amazing view of LA and the Hollywood hills",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guesty22
50,"Science and the Solar System is a great place people that want to understand how and why, pre-teen and up.",I love science and this place is about the solar system inventions and how and why they work. It is a large observatory that sometimes you can look thru the telescope and they have lazar light shows on the round ceiling with seats with head rest but bring a pillow they are made of wood. Remember the movie K-Pac with kevin spacey when they go to the science center and draw the solar system. That is what it is like but only cooler. I seen Pink Floyd the wall there which was a theme about Lazar lights with the music from Pink Floyd. They have a perpetual motion pendulum and the first light made that is still lite up. Lots of science displays and I think its still free. The lazar show cost money but it is worth seeing at least once. The view from up there is vast and really cool at night on a clear night. So go when you know it is going to be clear and the stars that you want to see may be the one they allow you to view from there telescope its pretty cool and very interesting especially if your into science and the solar system.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoastalChristi
50,Griffith Observatory is spectacular for astronomy buffs,"Great place to visit, and it’s free! (We parked down the hill for free and trekked 0.8 mi up the hill.) I was very impressed with so many displays which were really well done. The view outside is wonderful, too. Well worth your time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJHami
40,"Iconic building, especially if you've seen Rebel Without A Cause",The planetarium and exhibits are very good but the reason I've gone several times on visits to LA is simply the wonderful view of the city and the building itself. It's well worth the time to drive up to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidkP9117MP
50,Ya gotta go,"More than one person told us to go to the observatory...and they all were not wrong. This place is a treasure! The views were beautiful, and the observatory itself is a sight to see. It does get crowded, but there is plenty of room for everyone.It is a must if you are in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelley65
50,Must visit,Very interesting Observatory in the middle of the Griffith Park in Los Angeles. There is a lot to see and the view from the top of the hill is amazing! A must visit place in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-F-7676
40,Don't Leave Griffith Observatory out!,"Needless to say, the view from the Griffith Observatory of Los Angeles is amazing! It was great getting selfies with the Hollywood sign behind us without actually hiking up to the sign. There are many cool things to learn from the exhibits inside the Observatory building. There's also plenty of stuff to do on the grounds of the park from hiking and bicycling to picnicking.You can plan your visit for a couple of hours or make a day of it. Either way, when in LA, a visit to the Griffith Observatory is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler11375
50,Visited as part of a bus tour,A little traffic on the hill going up. View is absolutely wonderful! Sadly there was alot of fog on the day we visited but it was still enjoyable. Lots of interesting things inside the observatory but it was very very crowded on a Sunday afternoon so we did not really get to check them out. Our visit was mainly for the view of the Hollywood sign and city below and it is worth it just for that,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruisnfamily
50,Put it on the list,"We were 3 nights in Los Angeles. The Griffith Observatory was the highlight of our stay. With your own car you can park below the hill for free (15 minute walk up) or you can park upstairs for a fee (6-10 $ per hour). Taxis / UBER drive almost directly in front of the observatory. Admission to the observatory is free, only special performances are chargeable. Great view of the city when the smog is not too strong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterHartmann
50,Absolute must visit,So interesting and the view from up here is fabulous.Make sure you do one of the screenings. You haveto pay for the screening but its well worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/475beverleyb
50,Amazing view at night; very busy,"My wife and I drove up here with our rental car. It is very busy, but we managed to find a parking spot around 9pm. The views are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gregsky
50,Interesting Visit!,"Being completely honest, we both visited not really know what to expect. We spent around two hours looking at the various exhibits and watching one show in the planetarium. Everything was incredibly interesting!The only thing we wish we prepared for was the lack of mobile signal. After deciding to leave we spent about 30 minutes trying to find a spot where we could order an Uber. We got there in the end but was a slightly stressful challenge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adammh1
50,Take your time and see it all,"Spent an hour at the Griffith Observatory and felt like I didn’t see it all.The experience started on the ride up. The views were fantastic and when you get away from LA haze the sky becomes so clear and blue.Spent some time walking around the outside and the roof taking in the vista from every angle.Once inside, every corner seems to offer something that is not only educational but fun and exciting as well.In addition, I appreciate that the gift shop is on the lower level and not stationed at the exit. It is located in a place that you can walk through if you want a souvenir from the visit, but not somewhere that you HAVE to walk through in order to exit the building.I consider that a big bonus for people with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phohmann
40,Family friendly interesting site,Very lovely astronomical site that has recently undergone extensive renovations. Worth a visit for the planetarium and so much more. Great view of LA. A shuttle to the top of the hill on which Griffin Observatory sits runs from Hollywood Blvd to the Observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorriskinner
50,Go at sunset,A great place for photos with a astounding view of LA and the Hollywood sign. It has a gallery of explanations about astronomy. Very cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandowr10
50,Great skyline view of Los Angeles!,"Griffith J Griffith was an intelligent man with a dream that he didn’t get to see completed. But with his dream, other great people helped Griffith Observatory become what it is today.After completion, Griffith Park was donated to the City of Los Angeles. It became the largest urban park in the U.S. even bigger than Central Park!Griffiths goal to was to make astronomy available to everyone which would include a telescope open to free viewing, a science hall with exhibits, and a theater that would show educational films about science and other subjects. It’s the perfect place to view the HOLLYWOOD sign as well.Hikers can hike up to the observatory and tours come here daily to proudly show the great skyline view of Los Angeles. It’s that amazing!Next time in Los Angeles, make some time to see this magnificent area. You won’t regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808shawneel
50,The only way to see the views of LA. A stunning building too!,"We loved this iconic Observatory. A beautiful place to visit. A stunning building. I do think you need to spend a couple of hours here to fully appreciate and cover the whole of the building and encompass the views. We didn't have so much time, however we are still glad we got to see this building. As lovers of the film La La Land, this was a must do on our list...but that aside - it is without doubt is a must see on your list of things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennieB75

50,Must visit in LA,"This was on my list of places to visit as I’m a huge fan of LA LA Land & I was so glad we did. Definitely recommend going to watch the sunset & staying to see the city lit up. It looked amazing.The observatory show is worth a watch, quite cheap & very interesting. The guy doing the commentary had an amazing voice too. We really enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fran_OB1
30,if you arent into science/astrology id miss it,"We only stopped up here as we had it on an LA Pass, then learnt it was free. Very busy in side, views of Hollywood sign arents great at all. We had to park so far away due to it being so busy and as it was so hot the walk wasnt nice. If you have a short time in LA give here a miss. Views of LA were nice thoug",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traceycullen15
50,Griffith Observatory is out of this world !,"Griffith Observatory, like any observatory, is an out of this world experience, and well worththe effort and cost to enter a new world ( the solar system, etc. )Whether you are a local or vacationing from elsewhere, Griffith Observatory can also be aperfect start or finish to a journey that can include all that Griffith Park offers (golf, tennis,hiking, etc.). Also in close proximity you will find The ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign, Hollywood Bowl,Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures Studio Tours, and the Hollywood Walk Of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3964VPscottf
50,Magical,"One of the most special places I visited in LA, if not the most special. As a science museum it’s already great, but the beautiful architecture of the building, the views, and the telescopes they open at night... seriously amazing. I also paid the 7 dollars to go into one of the shows in the theater. It was the Light of the Valkyries one. Totally worth it. Explained in a very theatrical way. The only thing I would say needs improvement is the cafe. It could use some love and variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldenJoplin
40,Great place to see all of LA if the day is clear.,Parking is a struggle and don't even go on a day that there is a show at the greek ..or at least go early....Its Beautiful up here and free in Los Angeles makes it worth the trip up ....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179pamt

50,An opportunity to make the sky so much more 'visible' when you can be close and personal in education,"The observatory has so much to offer; so many parts to learn more about, and experience up close. I loved the whole view of the sky from the planetarium, and watch the movement. Great place for kids as well as adults, especially at night. Plan to be there several hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaandz
50,Its a good place to do lots of activities.,"We have visited Griffith Observatory 3 , 4 times and every time we enjoy this place. In these visits we saw Saturn , Venus , Moon , Mars and it was a lovely experience. It has big garden so people come with their food and mat and do a little picnic also. If you are more adventurous you can visit this place through hiking. Its a nice place. Everyone must visit once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krinjald2018
50,something for everyone,We parked at the bottom of the hill but there was still plenty of parking at the top. Try there first and save yourself a few steps. This place was amazing and admission free. Make sure to see the downstairs exhibits and the towers. Amazing views as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanlin916
50,Great Views of LA,"This is a great place to visit to get spectacular views of LA. It is also a great hiking trail with different viewpoints from all sides of trail.I recommend parking at the Greek Theater parking and taking the shuttle to go up. I see a lot of people taking a hike not knowing that it will take them 30 mins to get to the top. It is an easy climb but a long one. Better to take the shuttle especially if you are pushing a stroller or with elderly. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PARK AT THE TOP BECAUSE PARKING IS HARD TO COME BY. Do not waste your time in traffic cause it will take you 1 hr just to get to the top looking for parking cause of all the traffic up there and tourist looking for parking.ALSO NOTE: You will see the Hollywood sign here, but it is FAR AWAY. I always see people hike up with their street shoes or sandals and thinking that the Hollywood sign is just around the corner, but it is NOT. It is 1.5 hrs hike to the Hollywood sign. If you plan to hike the sign, there are other places closer that you can hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PremE_12
40,Free parking lot,"I went there on Sunday night, the view and light was really beautiful. At the beginning, I was worried about it was difficult to find a parking spot. Luckily, at the bottom of Griffith Observatory, there was a huge parking lot that was free for everybody and there were some guard to tell you where to park. You needed to walk 15-20 mins uphill to Observatory but it still worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/floram2013

50,Shouldn't be missed,"You will have a good view of Hollywood and the Hollywood sign. In the evening you can go on the roof and look through the large telescope, and often the are several telescopes on the lawn to look at different planets and stars.Inside are different types of scientific manipulatives. They have a movie that shows how the new section of the observatory, without changing the look of the iconic ovservitory. You can ask the docent to put on closed captioning for those hard of hearing.They also have a nice cafe with tables outside on the patio. I always recommend this to visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroler273
50,Fascinating!,"Sitting inside the huge Dome-shaped structure is visually spectacular. It is exciting, interesting, and an extremely different experience.

YES, the observatory itself is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mesmera
50,Science is alive,"Hi, Really a lot of fun. I enjoy buying a movie ticket, & pretending I am in the stars.It is very Zen & very stress reducing!!!There also is a free show on how they lifted up the entire observatory. Amazing architecture firm that handled that incredibly heavy piece of real estate.It's a great view on a clear day & you can hike to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydream698717
50,A Must Do in Los Angeles,"Griffith Observatory is a blast from the past - with a museum, a theatre and just a great place to get amazing views. It's a pain to park, and you have to walk, but it's worth the hassle because there aren't many places like it. Pick a weekday if at all possible - the weekends are crazy. Take tons of pics and share - it's an iconic place that's been in many movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracyrepchuk
50,Iconic Griffith Observatory,What is there to say that hasn't been said about the iconic Griffith Observatory. It should be experienced both in the day and at night. The views of DTLA on a clear night are epic as are the panoramic views of the west side. The Oschin Planetarium is a must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulv770
50,Griffith Observatory,We had an amazing view of LA from here and the Hollywood sign. We stopped here as part of a tour for 45 minutes and was able to see most of the displays. If we had more time it would have been good to see more. It was very interesting with lots of hands on displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie_Hitchins
40,There for the views,We went on a weekday so it was slightly easier to find street parking. My kids and I didn’t think the museum exhibits were anything very special but the views make up for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brgreen
50,Great Views,"We had never been up here despite it being our fourth visit to LA. A drive uphill brought us to the $10 an hour parking lot. As it was getting late and we had to drive back to Long Beach we just got an hour. We went in and saw all the free to view stuff. The views of LA were spectacular and a good view of the Hollywood Sign to. There’s a cafe and shop, the cafe is out on the terrace also with fab views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1las

50,Great place to visit,"It’s a must see in LA, we caught the sunset here and it was beautiful. Parking was fine and the building is an amazing piece of architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710calc
50,Spectacular,I came for the view and happened to go to a Planetarium show. Absolutely incredible - I would highly recommend catching a showing if you can.I saw their history of the stars one and it was both interesting and visually breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saracgrady
50,Interesting Place,"We caught the bus up to the Observatory, it was easy to do and very cheap. The Observatory itself is really interesting, lots of equipment to look at, in a lovely Art Deco building. We watched the Tesla coil demonstration, that was fun. Also enjoyed the exhibitions on the moon and other planets. You really do get great views over Los Angeles, and we also watched the sun set from here too. Great Place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38sallyj
40,Great Views of the City,The Observatory was closed when we went - but that didn't matter one bit - the views are stunning from here - the Hollywood sign is tiny! 10 dollars to park if you don't want to walk up the very steep hill!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WCookie
50,Very interesting information and Scenic views,"The Griffith Observatory has a lot of very interesting exhibits related to astronomy. The staff there are also very helpful and knowledgeable. They give talks and tours every once in a while. Also, from here you can go on a hike along a few scenic routes and get close to the hollywood sign. View from the hiking trails as well as the observatory is very nice and well worth the visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimmaarouf
50,Awesome,If you can get there when there is not a concert at the Greek Theater I recommend highly to go in the evening! The only thing that's not free is the parking and the planetarium. The Observatory with the telescope and being able to view Saturn was great. Lots of exhibits and beautiful view of the city in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sleepfairy1962
50,Great iconic place,I've visit this place through the years and there is some many great memories about the Griffith observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandra1939

40,A nice adventure for a few hours,"Parking was easy and is charged at $10 per hour with admission being free. The observatory opened at midday and was very busy, with the museum being very interactive.The views over LA are long but can be effected by the smog.The surfing parks have several picnic, play areas and many walking tracks. You can even see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949tg
50,A beautiful area of Los Angeles,"We enjoyed our visit to the iconic Observatory. It’s a nice ride up the hill and the views are beautiful. We were visiting the week before the current Getty wildfire. There are dozens upon dozens of photo opportunities; from the views of the Hollywood sign, downtown LA, and the Observatory building itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keystone_Traveler
40,Excellent views and good walks,Unfortunately the observatory was closed when we visited. However the views over LA and Hollywood sign are good. We had an Uber to the observatory and then walked up the hill and down to lower car park where there was an excellent cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hemel1
50,"Good attraction, majestic scenery","On our winding trek through the park to the Griffith and through the mile-long hike up the hill to the Observatory, I only hoped that the sight in question was as impressive as the journey to it. Well, I wasn't disappointed.As with the Getty, the natural backdrop of the area serves as a co-star to the main attraction. Steeped in Art Deco flourishes, the Observatory features informative and compelling exhibits - however, the only one I would say is better than most is the history of how mankind has observed the stars.The Griffith Observatory is a must-see for stargazers, nature lovers and all of those in between; make it a stop on your LA visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKB1701
50,It's worth the hike,Mother - daughter hike to the top. It was the perfect way to stretch our legs after a 5+ hour flight from Newark airport. The views were breathtaking. Good place to get pics of the Hollywood sign. Mostly free. Planetarium has a minimal charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindacNJ4
30,Good Vantage Point Plus Educational,"The 3 of us visited here on a cool sunny day in May. We arrived in early afternoon and parking along the roadway was at a premium but we found a spot (pay at the machines). We walked up to the observatory. The grounds offer a great view of the infamous Hollywood sign, LA skyline, and surrounding area below. Admission is free. We didn’t buy tickets to the planetarium show, but enjoyed the display & interactive exhibits in the main galleries which were informative / educational. We had a late lunch in the cafeteria in the lower level enjoying the outside view. We opted for sandwiches which were a bit pricey but seemed the lesser of the evils from both taste & health perspectives. If I was staying longer in LA or lived in the area I would like to visit to take advantage of the nearby hiking trails; and in the evening to actually view the magical night sky via the telescopes. Then my rating would be likely be 4 or 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JULOfrVan
30,A lot small in real life!,"Having seen this place for years in the movies and on tv, we finally made the trip. While the views of downtown LA, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and the Hollywood sign are awesome, the venue itself is so much smaller than expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joesP5732WL
50,Just out of the planet experience!!!,"Great shows, great staff at ticket and show entrance. Going again to,orroq. A must if you are in LA. Really I will drop off marlyn Monroe (no disrespect I like her but I have to move on’. And go and watch these shows n number of times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494smritid
50,Worth a visit and it’s free,"If you want something different to do in LA this is the place to go.Interesting insight into astronomy.Beware parking is limited near the observatory, get there early. You can park further away and walk up.Food and drink are expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bluegin_13
50,Great view,"I googled the best place to see the Hollywood Sign and it suggested Griffith Park Observatory. I admit the sign is much smaller than I had expected from such a distance but it was a great place to see it and take pictures. There was quite a lot of people there to view it although the observatory is closed on Monday, the day we went. It was a must see if you are planning on seeing the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speer30
50,Fascinating building and amazing views,"So, the parking. I was able to find a spot on the road, not too terribly far from the top. You have to decide how long you are going to be, and buy a tag to put in the car window. Arriving at the Observatory, I found that I was not there at the right time with enough parking to see any of the shows. Not wanting to trek back down and re-pay (you can't add time), I decided to just see what I could see. There were some interesting exhibits where I learned about Tycho Brahe's contributions to astronomy.I wandered down to a huge room with exhibits on the planets. There was a circular bench and two men in the middle wearing headsets. I asked if they would be doing a presentation, but they were docents available to answer any questions. The conversation we had was a highlight of my visit. Alex was very knowledgeable about space exploration, but we also talked about housing in the area, science education, and general geekery.A benefit of visiting after sundown was the terrace full of photographers, ready to capture the night sky and the Los Angeles lights. The view was definitely worth the uphill walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aquazoo
50,An amazing place to learn about the planets and stars!,"As well as the amazing views across LA (you can see all the way to the sea from the top) you also get a good view of the Hollywood sign and it’s free to go inside. I visited during the day and would recommend that you book for the planetarium as soon as you step in, either at the desk or at one of their kiosks, then start with the free film in the theatre that tells you the history of the building and it’s dramatic revamp. Then walk your way up and learn all about the planets and the stars. The planetarium show costs $7 per adult and is worth every penny, I wish I had book for all shows, it’s an amazing experience. I watched the sunset before heading home.Parking is available but you can also take a cab or for those who love hiking you can hike up to the top. I took a cab and there is a pick up point near the bus stop when you are coming back down (be there on time as the parking patrol will make you cab drive back down the hill if you are not there).The cafe here is small and fairly worn but you can sit and eat to a fabulous view. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melanie191076
40,Great views of downtown LA and Hollywood Sign,"Free to enter, the Griffith Observatory offers great views of downtown LA and the Hollywood Sign on a clear(ish) day.Parking is hard to come by - of you find a space, pull into it immediately or you'll lose it! We parked a bit further down the hill (I think $10 for 1 hour). You can use a credit card so no need to ensure you have change. I would recommend buying 2 hours minimum if you want to take your time to appreciate what the building has to offer, otherwise you'll spend a third of this time just climbing up and down the hill to get to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grays_on_Holiday
50,Great photo ops,Didn't actual make it to the observatory. Parking lots were full and the walk up is pretty long. Great photo ops everywhere on site tho.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8523XErobh
50,Very Interesting!,"We arrived at the Griffith Observatory around 10:30 am on a Friday morning and it was all ready very crowded. We did luck out and get a great parking place very close to the entrance! There is no parking charge until the Observatory opens at 12:00 so if you are not going to stay and go inside that's a good deal. However, I definitely recommend touring. It was very interesting and I'm not even a big astrology buff. The walk around the building was just beautiful with the added bonus of viewing the famous Hollywood Sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D-Arkansas
50,Best place in LA,I love the observatory - free entry for the most wonderful views and incredible science museum ! Recommend parking at the Greek theatre and getting the 50cent bus up the hill rather than paying $10 an hour at the observatory car park - you will want to spend hours there as there is so much to do !We also hiked to the top of mount Hollywood - hard work and very hot but well worth it !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megglepeggle29
50,Stunning Views,"I actually visited in June 2018, however due to travelling all over the world for the last 18 months, I am just in the process of writing all the reviews. The Observatory offers fantastic views of LA from the sign to downtown. It also has a lot of information plaques and pieces of meteorites on display which was pretty cool. I was also able to see the telescope; on an evening, they offer free night time viewings. Definitely worth a visit just for the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikkiBee

50,Very interesting and great photo ops.,Went with two tween boys and a teenage boy and girl plus 3 adults and we all enjoyed. Beautiful old building with so many interesting things to see...The Tesla coil! Saw an interesting show in the planetarium and the photo ops of Hollywood sign and LA skyline are fabulous. Parked by Greek Ampitheater and took a bus up to Observatory and then walked back down which was delightful. Lots of informed and kind volunteers to answer questions. Great way to spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M803HIjenniferf

50,Stunning Views,Worth driving or walking up there for absolutely stunning view of LA! We ubered up there around 8 am and it was so peaceful - very little congestion! We then hiked from the observatory to the Hollywood sign - fair warning this was a strenuous hike and about 7.5 miles from start to to finish,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmindidelia
50,Must visit,Amazing view on the landscapeGreat spots for hiking and restingInteresting info about the skyDon’t miss the view at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_S6941BL
40,Really nice view,"The Griffith observatory was a lovely spot with an amazing view of the LA skyline. Overall there wasn't an amazing amount to see, but it is located in a great area for an overview. Inside the building, there was plenty to read and learn and I feel like it would be a great place to take kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairytalus
40,Worth a look,One of our key stops during 24 hours in LA. Offered some absolutely stunning views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Would have loved to see it at night but didn't have time. Be advised it can be a little slow to park but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CB1CountyDurham
50,Fascinating and Interesting Space Information,"We visited this location and I was amazed at the significant history it holds. Not only is there a great view of the “Hollywood” sign, but the Zeiss telescope and it’s inter galactic discovery provided me with information I never new; highly recommend visiting this observatory if in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrrrr5
40,Pretty cool,I wanted to see this mainly because I've seen it in movies and TV shows. It's an awesome place to visit. But I was just going to be a tourist we have an observatory in my state as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkiah
50,Fresh Mountain Air,"These days you'd be hard-pressed to find a spot that isn't engulfed by industrialization and its by-product pollution. To my astonishment, Griffith observatory offered my friends and I fresh clean air apart from the breathtaking views of Los Angeles. Its location provides you an overlooking view of the city as well as a respite from the busy and noisy going-on of the city. There are a lot of activities you can opt for when visiting the observatory. Had we enough time, we would have hiked up the surrounding hills. Instead, we headed straight to the observatory to take in the view of Los Angeles.It goes without saying that you'd have to prepare yourself for LA traffic. It may be slow but it is moving so there's still somewhat of a silver lining to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesLarrobis
50,Hollywood sign and griffith Observatory,"If u r interested in just visiting place and return back after spending some time then Best way is to check how to reach metro red line train station (Vermont/sunset station)or by bus and u get DASH BUS which runsoutside train station it takes to Observatory for less than a 1dollar and you also get bus to return back to same train station , it has frequent bus services.This the cheapest way for Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory sightseeing .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chetanjm
40,nice place to spend for half day,"Its free entry to the Griffith Observatory but 3 different shows are $7 each.We watched the ""Centered in the Universe"" show at 1145am which was great(around 35mins)! There are different hiking trails you can do and you get a good work out and nice LA view. If you are into hiking, its a great place to visit and will take you a few hours to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/no1_rabbit
50,Well worth the hilly climb,Visited on a warm night fascinating inside and outCan see the Hollywood sign as well as the planets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ventoraisle
40,Wonderful Experience,Looking at the STARS is enjoyed by almost all humans. Griffith Observatory offers you a chance to observe stars as astronomers have been doing all along. We could see Jupiter and it’s moon through the telescope which was an awesome experience. The exhibit hall on ground floor offers explanations to many scientific facts through simple exhibits. The observatory is open till 10 pm but reach and stand in the line before sunset to be able to see the stars. There is no entry fee but parking nearby is costly- $10 per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mksobti
40,"Location and Planetarium are awesome, exhibits and telescopes are okay","I visited after sunset, there were telescopes set up outside to view Jupiter and Saturn. The staff gives you relevant astronomical information while you wait in the long queues. There is also the main telescope that lets you view the moon. Expect a long wait there. My good luck was a full moon which made for some great viewing.My highlight is the planetarium, presented by Frank Simons, who brings a theatrical energy and showmanship to the experience. If you must pick one of the two presentations, I recommend the Valkyries one, about auroras.The exhibits are alright, mostly the typical astronomical displays, but also some interesting ones about the inner workings of large telescopes, as well as meteorite samples and a woefully overlooked cloud chamber, which intercepts ionized particles buzzing through the earth.The location itself is excellent for getting a panoramic view of Los Angeles, especially at night when the city is lit up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BassemPrime
50,More stars than there are in heaven.,"One of the rare things that still function now, from the Golden Period of Hollywood. And what is more on target than a view of even more distant stars. It won't take you much time to see it all. But it gives you a great view, a touch of the past,and a window into our place in the cosmos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divagreta2016

Really can’t go wrong with this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2010mikester44
50,Best view spot,"Got to get the best view point for LA, with sweeping views in every direction and to the infamous Hollywood sign. We drive up here just for the view and it was worth it, although it was a bit overcast so on a sunny day it would be even better I'm sure. Didnt have time to visit inside and apparently the park itself is good for hiking and horseback trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceD884

40,15 minutes well worth,"When I was doing the bus tour the guide did not tell us that we can enter for free. So I just took pictures around the observatory. Thus this time , I was doing the hiking tour and our guide Taylor from bikes and hikes brought us here for 15 minutes. If you love science this place is dedicated to it. You learn about how electricity was made, the different planets and also there is a sample of the Rock from the moon which was interesting. If I had more than 15 minutes I would have definitely wonder around more to read the facts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonanureen

40,Beautiful Exploration,"The Griffith Observatory is simply a beautiful building, with amazing architecture. To really enjoy it, you need to walk around the outside and check out the views, the design elements, the beautiful balconies. It's also a wonderful gateway to the past and they have some wonderful tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610RichardW
50,Parking a hassle but worth it.,Great exhibit. Next time I will take uber from nearby rather than park. A lot of walking. . Best to time the show do not to wait,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshuap718
50,A must see if you are in or near Hollywood,"Simply iconic and a must see. All ages will enjoy this wonderful museum experience. If you want to park close you'll need to get there early, or you'll have a steep walk up the hill from a much further away street parking space. I also highly recommend a good pair of binoculars to enjoy the views and on a clear day (not often) you can even see Catalina. I highly recommend a few hours at the observatory - you won't be dissapointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngliaUSA
50,Observatory,The view was amazing and the grounds were beautiful! The park was full of people walking and jogging. And that drive up there was fun. We got to take a photo with the Hollywood sign in the background.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ortegacontractinginc
50,Mr & Mrs Ashraf,"Visited this lovely place on 8 October. A unique hybrid of public observatory, planetarium and exhibition space on the south slope of Mt Hollywood. You can visit the place by personal car, public bus or by tour bus. It's free other than parking charge of $10 per hour for personal car. One can have a complete view of Downtown LA and Hollywood Mt from the place. You will get a tranquil and restful atmosphere among the greens of Griffith park. Better to visit on a weekdays to avoid the rush of crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auleen1999
50,the telescope events are the best!,Classic LA Spot amazing location for photos all times of the day. The BIG Telescope experience is worth the wait in line for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taylor_NDiaye
50,Hike and Observing the Universe,"Great hikes to choose from! We selected Dante’s View, Mount Hollywood and Hogback ridge! Then a picnic at the Berlin Forest followed by an afternoon of observatory exhibits, planetarium, the cafe and the gift shop! At night the glistening lights are awesome! It’s free too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindatM2563YV
50,"Great views, fun museum","Visited the observatory close to dusk, at 5 pm. Views are amazing you can see Hollywood sign during the day. The city lights at night were beautiful. We saw a planetarium show about the Vikings and their belief about the stars. Fun museum. My favorite was after we climbed the outside stairs to the to you can get access to the telescope. We waited about 15 minutes in line, that night we were able to observe the moon. The details through the telescope were so amazing, it’s something like 82 years old but works so well.Parking is a hassle, so we parked near red metro station and took the Dart bus up. It takes you all the way up and will return you back. The wait can be 20 minutes or more for the bus, but very convenient and only costs .50 cents each way per person. Great time spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msuivyci
50,Great hiking.,"There are several places in Southern California to hike, but Griffith Park offers the best hiking and amazing views in Southern California. Every opportunity I have an opportunity to go to Griffith Park to enjoy a great hike and work out I jump on it. It’s not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gakmba
50,A place to see the real star in L.A.!,"Being a fan of astronomy, I love this place. There is much to learn and do. The planetarium is a favorite of mine and they always great narrators on staff for the show. At night you can look through one of the large telescopes and they always have something amazing to show you. Last time I was there, they had it pointed at the Orion nebula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jllong77

40,"Very busy, but the views are worth it","We came here solely for the views, and we're glad we did - but consider the parking. Driving up here is slow-going, you'll be following a train of cars both up and down.The parking is mostly by way of street bays, and it was so crowded when we were there that the closest space was probably a mile away from the observatory. We could walk it, but others might not have been able to.The views were sensational though, and you can see the Hollywood Sign from here, with a vantage point to get a selfie.We did enter the observatory to take a look but the crowds were insane and it was impossible to see anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tflynnuk
50,Educational and Scenic,"Took the DASH Oberservatory bus (50cents/ride) and stayed from late afternoon to night. Saw the sunset which was pretty. Saw LA light up in the dark night sky. At 7pm, they let us queue up to see Saturn with the telescope. It's only opened on a clear night sky, until 9pm I think. Downstairs in the oberservatory, there were exhibitions that are highly educational. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jq236
50,Great place to Visit !!,"This definitely should be on the list of places to visit while out in Hollywood. It has great exhibits, great views, great programs, great place to relax etc.... etc... There's lots for everyone... families with young kids or teens, couples... interesting for everyone. It is also a great place for hiking, yes they have hiking trails all around the observatory. The only thing I suggest... is take a Lyft or Uber because traffic is soooo bad getting in and out of there or drive but expect it to take awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123kariz
50,Very nice place,The observatory is very interesting place for young kids and not only. You can spend many hours there. Our kids were impressed. The atmosphere is great and the view is breathtaking. Don’t skip this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198galinam

40,Excursion,Set in acres of beautiful woodland and a good view of the iconic Hollywood sign. Interesting and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jah1959
50,Historic site with a good planetarium,"We went on a busy weekend, so we had to hike quite a distance up to the observatory. We were still able to get tickets to the planetarium show, and there was plenty to see and do while you waited.Had a good view of the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles as well.The food is expensive there, so be sure to bring snacks with you if you have kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikehU7921OX
30,Busy,"Came here on the hottest day, parking is horrendous, plenty of parking at the bottom of you feel you can walk a few miles uphill in almost 40° heat, we managed to get a space near the top as someone was leaving and then discovered it was $20 per hour, crikey! We wondered around the observatory but it was absolutely crammed with people, the roof was the same. The cafe at the bottom is very expensive and the coffee terrible. Nice veiw of the Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehan44Lang
50,Nice Observatory in a great location,"This is a very nice observatory, and the location is a must if you are visiting LA. It is at the top of Griffith Park, the views are great, and great hiking also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tirzahaviv

50,Sunset @Griffith observatory,"We went to the observatory late afternoon and could visit the observatory in time to witness and photograph the sunset over LA, which was a special atmosphere. The observatory is free to all and really interesting for all ages to visit. parking for us was along the road down, so a good climb up and back in the dark (parking fee per hour). well worth your time and detour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/668suzyc
50,Amazing views,Bring comfortable shoes as you will be walking a while from the car park all uphill. Once you get to the top the views are incredible over LA and also the Holywood Sign. $10 an hour parking is reasonable as you only need 1-2 depending on how fast you walk and how long you stay at the top. Conveniently placed toilets and water fountains are at the top as you will most likely need them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesgood97
40,The top of Los Angeles,"The prefect place for stunning view to city of Angels. The Greek theater which is free for entrance , near to park. Beautiful place for relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andranik1974

50,Planetarium show worth standing in line!,We visited from out-of-town and the Griffith Observatory exceeded our expectations. Art deco architecture and the view are wonderful. The exhibits are put together well--both children and adults were enjoying them the afternoon that we toured. We particularly liked the Planetarium show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GardenVisitor_11
50,Beauriful,"My mum and I went to visit Griffith Observatory today now we knew the parking would be hard but we drove around for ages, they weren’t allowing anyone that wasn’t handicapped to park in the actual car park right next to the observatory so this involved driving around, there’s parking you pay $10 an hour for, now if this was close by that wouldn’t be a problem but we kept on driving and found out that the paid parking would’ve been further away than the free parking!! My advise park near the Greek theatre which is free, then hop on the dash bus $1 per person each way which drops you off at and picks you up outside the observatory. The views are just mind blowing such a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign absolutely amazing!! Inside the observatory it’s really beautiful too, I’d reccomend getting a map because the place is a bit of a maze!! I’d reccomend seeing one of the planetarium shows, they cost under $10 a person and are truely amazing. We also watched in a different theatre about the observatory and the history around it. Beautiful place absolutely loved it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauzR_12
50,Amazing!,"Griffith Observatory is awesome. It offers great views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. It’s free, but you do have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdeberry2
40,"Nice view, but those crowds","We were heading for the sunset, unfortunately same idea had thousands of other people. At the same time there was a big event in the Greek theatre nearby, which resulted in solid traffic jam. Observatory itself offers nice programme combined with impecable views. Next time we are in LA, we will come back, but will plan our visit more carefully.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero
40,Great visit,"The observatory is really interesting and has a great deal to see, you could spend a long time here especially if you want to see any of the shows. The observatory itself id free to get in but where the sting you is on the parking, at $10 an hour it's a bit steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ali622
10,"Rubbish, only a nice view","This so called observatory is terrible, has nothing on the Greenwich Observatory in London. When I visited the planetarium was closed due to some repair works (foolishy I did not check the website before hand)! There is not much to do here, the exhibitions are very poor!!!Parking is terrible, $10 an hour! We spent $20 on parking, madness.The only good thing about this place is the view. Amazing view of LA and the Hollywood sign.Save yourself the parking costs and go to Santa Monica beach, much more enjoyable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/james_ghost_patrick
40,Great views; Observatory dated,"This is the place to photograph the Hollywood sign and downtown LA. The observatory itself is interesting historically, but the exhibits needed some updating as most were over 15 years old. We paid for a movie. It was a waste of money. Not at all what we expected from the title. The pay to park at $10 per hour is expensive but understandable to keep people moving since parking is limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9368YZandrewb
50,Interesting place with great views,I visited this place as part of my trip to LA. What a great and interesting place to spend the afternoon and it’s free! Great views of LA from the outside balcony. Staff were really helpful and took time to explain the science behind some of the attractions. The only downside for me was $10 per hour parking!! Other than that I really enjoyed visiting this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakD8895ED
50,Summer Vacation,"A great place to visit for information and great views of the city! There are hiking trails along with the observatory to view. Best part is that it's all free - except for parking! I was surprised to find out that Griffith Park is the second-largest city park in California. It has been called the Central Park of Los Angeles but is actually bigger than its New York City counterpart. I didn't have time to see everything - there is so much to do! Griffith Park is home to the Los Angeles Zoo, the Autry National Center, the Travel Town train museum, and the Los Angeles Equestrian Center as well. My time was spent at the Observatory and hiking trails, which were great by themselves. There is a cafeteria and gift shop connected to the Observatory. I loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debradD1853RY
50,Iconic place and view,"This is a mandatory stop when visiting Los Angeles. The view of the city of Angels during sunset is beatiful, as you see the sky changing colors and the city lights turning on, making the city grid visible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cafriger
50,Still nice to look around,"We could only fit in a visit on a Monday when the museum is closed but glad we did as the place was so quiet. We had a wander round the grounds and through some of the telescopes dotted about. Great view of the Hollywood sign, I'm sure it would be even better if only we could get in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatiePen1991
40,Observatory,Visited the observatory and had the bad luck the theater was getting repairs. the exhibits themselves are nice to go watch and the view of LA is just amazing.Its also a very nice place to start your hikes through Griffith Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerodkey
50,Do not miss!,"This was the highlight of my recent trip to LA. We arrived around 5pm and enjoyed the exhibits in the museum, the staff were very knowledgable and friendly. Then we watched the sunset over the Hollywood Sign. Then we were able to view Saturn and Jupiter through some telescopes that the staff set up outside the observatory - it was AMAZING!! So much fun, incredible views over LA and all completely free. Do not miss!!I would recommend arriving just before sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crv1993
50,GREAT EXPERIENCE!,I love going up to the observatory! The 360 views of LA are breathtaking. My family and I like to hike the trails on the weekends and usually revisit the museum a couple of times a month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chopimatics
50,Brilliant !..,"Well worth a visit, a must for any budding stargazers very informative displays great views from the top and all free.Planetarium was an add on $7 adult.great value the light show was amazing the guy doing the live commentary was brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henrardo
40,Interesting with views of the Hollywood Sign,We went as part of a tour so only had half hour. There are walks from the Observatory which would be really lovely if you’re not time limited. There are telescopes and lots of information within the observatory itself. Fantastic views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailG701
50,"Iconic architecture, great views, AND science. What could be better?","After decades of seeing the Griffith Observatory on TV shows, I decided I had to see it for myself. It did not disappoint.First, the bad news: the traffic in LA is terrible. The drive to get there took way longer than we thought it would, and we arrived about an hour later than expected, so we missed the daytime views (which others say are marvelous and I don't doubt it). I was hoping to see the Hollywood sign from the observatory (it's supposed to be a great view), but the sun was down. Oh well. Parking is tough - my LA-native brother-in-law bravely volunteered to stay in the car while we hiked up to the top. He joined us almost an hour later after he found a spot. In addition, the observatory was VERY crowded. Everything had a line, and a crush of people. But we all wanted to see interesting things, so we were all calm and enjoying ourselves. So plan for all this, and don't let it stop you from having a great time.The observatory art deco architecture is beautiful and interesting. Even the bathrooms are beautiful.And, oh, the science! There's a Foucault pendulum (the pendulum swings all day long, with a circle of objects around it. As the earth rotates, the pendulum will knock down the pegs one-by-one. I didn't count the pegs, but usually one falls every 30 minutes or every hour...be patient if you want to see something knocked over). There's a VERY large Tesla coil. Check the sign for when the next demo will be, then stake out a good place to stand. You will want to see the neon sign (you can see it from the front from one side, and from the back from the other 2 viewing sides). Then, get ready to geek out. My poor sister got to see me in all my science nerd glory. Great (and brief...stay alert) demo.As we were there at night, and because it was so crowded, I didn't see most of the exhibits, but the staff had three 8-or-10-inch telescopes set up outside to view Saturn (yes, you could see the rings), Jupiter, and another planet (I can't recall right now). The lines moved quickly and we had fun seeing planets, and seeing others seeing planets. Great.The view of LA at night is spectacular.Admission is free. Plan for traffic and crowds and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loribbb
50,Amazing views great half day out,If you hate science there are still the views we got great photos and the short show about the universe on the 365 theatre was well worth the 7 dollars each,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/313carl
50,Amazing sunset views,Make sure you get there before 4pm as the top car park can fill up and you have a steep hike up (we struggled in the heat). Worth it in the end with some amazing views of then city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmsincla
50,Great views from the observatory in Griffith Park,We took a cab up to Griffith Park and enjoyed some lovely sites from the observatory and surrounding area. The Hollywood sign is located in the mountains opposite the park. There is a golf course lovely park to walk around and a great place to see Los Angeles from the highest point in the city. Well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirley16061954

50,Better focus on the observatory,"Tye view is amazing. Yes the better time of the day to visit it, it is before sunset. But not due to the sunset. The city lights as they are turning on as the night falls make the scenery majestic.

50,Great View,"The Observatory has some great displays for all the space geeks and is free. However i found for myself and what seemed like most other people was the fantastic views you can get from all around and on top of the observatory down to LA, the surrounding mountains and a closer position to the famous ""Hollywood Sign"". There is a bus you can catch from the train station that takes you there or you can drive yourself. Next time i would like to do one of the many walking trails that originate here also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livetotravel747

50,Loved it!,"Spent a few hours here this week. Had heard that parking was free but there’s only a handful of free parking at the bottom of the hill, definitely worth paying to park at the top. It’s $10 per hour & must be prepaid so you have to guess how long you intend to stay.Lots to see & do & great views of the Hollywood sign. We took a picnic & ate outside on the grass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plunk23
50,Griffith Observatory is a Los Angeles Landmark that everyone needs to go!!!,"When family visits from out town and you want to impress the sheer magnitude and size of Los Angeles, then a visit to GO is a must. Best of all it is FREE!!! Tour the observatory and don’t forget to go out and see the $1,000,000 view of L.A.Check out the Tesla Coil display, touch some the meters on display.

50,Zoo,"A wonderful popular location with locals and tourists. Avoid the weekend it gets really busy. Superb views to the south. Interesting free permanent exhibitions.Word to the wise, there is little or no internet reception once at the Observatory. It is extremely difficult to make an Uber booking at the pick up point, so make the booking on the steps, wait until the car is almost there then meet at the meeting point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL8442JB

50,Amazing Views!,"We were here for the views, and this place does not dissapoint. You can see the city of Los Angeles below you and the Hollywood sign above you.

We would have gone into the observatory, but they are closed on Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglesFan27
50,Must do activity. Try and arrive before sunset.,Incredible placeThe observatory centre is fascinating. The sunset was beautiful. The stars views were mind blowing. I just wish we had brought a picnic. We got an uber there and back but after sunset the traffic going up was gridlocked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mataverall
50,Great place to spend a few hours easily! Be wary of the crowds,"It is probably one of the most visited attractions in LA. One can easily spend a few hours absorbed in learning about space and the starts. However the the time we visited a weekday evening, the number of people here was just overwhelming. The parking lots on the top were all taken and we had to park along the hill near a meter where we were lucky to find a spot! Almost all shows were either booked or had serpentine queues to buy a ticket. we settled for a walk around of the observatory(eavesdropping on guides taking other groups on a tour, uncool I know) and were out in under 45mins.The kicker is that you can get an amazing view of the behemoth that is LA on one side and on the other you can see the hollywood sign! Would love to come back here when it is not as crowded",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolf668
40,Great place to learn,The place tells you about space and time. The human science behind it.they try to do the same through interactive study. Like how much you will weigh on each planet. You can live asteroid rocks.Good place to learn. View is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/649ishas
40,Must Do!,You must go to the Griffin Observatory if you visit LA. The views are amazing and the best place to see the Hollywood sign. I would recommend going at 5/6ish and stay as it gets dark to get the most of the views. Traffic to get there is awful!! I got an Uber up but couldn’t get the signal to get one back down however there is a bus every hour which I got down to the first stop then got an Uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sroberts1991
40,crowded at night but worth it,Finally made it here on a Sunday night after an aborted attempt on a Friday. Traffic is c-r-a-z-y at night. We took a Lyft there and took the bus back down. Really enjoyed it and the views were amazing. They had one of the telescopes set up on Saturn where you could actually see the rings around the planet. Mind blowing. Interesting exhibits inside as well. If you're willing to brave the crowds you will be rewarded. Best of all it is free unless you go to one of the shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfeur66
40,Probably one of L.A.'s major tourist destinations,"If you come for the view it may be good to arrive early in the morning, the evening light over L.A. may be attractive but then the number of visitors is enormous",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Amazing views of city,We visited as part of a day tour of LA and for me it was the absolute highlight. Forget the walk of fame the shopping the stars homes etc etc this is the real deal. Land and Observatory given to the city by a Welshman with stunning views down onto the city and up to the Hollywood sign. If in LA go for it you won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836
40,A classic,"Who hasn't seen movies shot there. It is always magical to visit such a famous place. Whether you like astronomy or just the site, you will enjoy the visit. You won't have the palce to yourself though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FM6565
50,Light Hike - all ages,Hike/walk to observatory (opens 10a). Enjoy the view of LA!. love Trails Cafe at bottom but there is a also a terrace restaurant on 2nd level. The old abandoned LA zoo is on the other side of the park so that is a sep drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJ226
50,Very nice views!,"Very nice place, fabulous views of the city and Hollywood sign. Free parking options downhill with a 15 min walk. Have water and a hat with you as the sun hits hard. Be aware that Mondays the observatory is closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcosC969
40,"Good view of LA, way too crowded","Parking is a small fortune and the crowds are crazy. They are open late and close to town so that;s a plus. If you have time and gas, check out Mt Wilson. It's worth the extra drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449jaredw
50,Science with a View,"We went to Griffith Observatory on a relatively clear day. The parking lot at the observatory was full so we parked at the lot at the Greek Theater one mile downhill from the observatory and took the shuttle up ($.50 for most, $.25 for students and seniors. What awaited us at the top was fascinating. The telescope at the observatory was the largest in the world for many years. In addition, there are lots of displays (some interactive) explaining astronomical facts/issues and a very nice Planetarium with rotating shows during the day. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fletch1946
50,Educational and beautiful,The Observatory is educational and very interesting. There are beautiful mountain and city views as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimelaM
50,visit at least once is worth it,should be a bucket list place to go if you enjoy universal and planetary sights and education. a must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885howardl
50,A Must Do Just for Its Historical Significance and the VIEW!!,"I had visions of the dance scene from La La Land and so many other movies when I walked into the Griffith. Just it's place in cinema , science and LA history alone is worth the visit. And the view...WOW! The Griffith itself is also enjoyable with many science displays, exhibits and information to enjoy. It is truly an LA must experience to take a trip to the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hermuslj
50,Great views over L.A.,"Got an Uber up to the top because it’s a long way up! Got a bus back down to the city.Once up there the views over the city are great and the Hollywood sign can easily be seen.We wanted to stay to look through the telescope after dark, but there were so many people there that we decided against it.Very popular with families so expect LOTS of kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andalucia02
50,Must See for Terminator Fans,"I'm a Terminator fan and so I needed to see this place as the location where the terminator arrived in the opening of the first movie. Besides that, I'm an astronomy and science fan and this place didn't disappoint. I took an Uber from the closest Metro station to get to the top. There is a very small amount of parking available so driving wouldn't be my first choice. There is also a hiking trail to walk up or down from the observatory from the neighborhood below. There are also connecting trails for hiking and to the Hollywood sign. I decided not to make the hike because it is 3.8 miles to the sign and I didn't have enough time. The observatory has some nice exhibits including a cloud chamber and a cosmic ray detector. There is a cafe and gift shop. The views of LA were nice though it was a bit hazy the day I went. I recommend this as a place to visit if in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guinness_Mike
50,Beautiful views and fun exhibits,"Watching the sun dip down and the lights of the city grow bright was so beautiful from up in the observatory. It was a bit crowded at that time so members of our family wandered around on their own, skipping some exhibits. We got some of the best pictures of our trip from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyCalifornia1
40,Great place to take the kids,An LA landmark still worth a visit. Good science exhibits for the kids and an excellent view of Los Angeles during the day and the stars at night.Take the time to go over to the trail for the Hollywood sign and walk up to get an up close view. Time well spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirk500
50,A must-do when in California,"We visited with out 11 and 6 year old daughters during a 2 week tour of California. Such a beautiful building in an awesome location, you can see the Hollywood sign from the entrance.Lots to see and learn about astronomy including the Foucault Pendulum which demonstrates the earth's rotation, lots of exhibits including seasons, the sun, planets, weather, and the Planetarium where you can watch a show. Our 6 year particularly enjoyed this as she found it quite engaging. We watched the Water is Life show and highly recommend it.Parking is a struggle: arrive early if you want to park at the Observatory (and expect to pay lots), or catch a bus from LA or surrounding areas for a much smaller fee. We parked nearby for free and caught the bus up the hill which was easy.If is busiest in the evenings but we visited during the early afternoon and it was still quite popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamsind2014
40,Solar Eclipse Headquarters,"Went there to watch a solar eclipse and it was awesome, as well as educational. Far to dangerous to do on your own. This was great for the kids too. They had fun learning. It wasn't total August last year, but close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrR4144SG
50,Plan to arrive WELL BEFORE sunset for best parking. Not fit to walk? Just drive the area to see the views,"WISH we had planned the timing for this better. We headed there about 1 hour before sunset - that's put us in the thick of traffic with almost no parking option available. Still we drove through and was happy to see the sunset. INSTEAD / NEXT time I would plan to arrive at least 2/3 hours before sunset. The area is beautiful. Very curvy roads in the surrounding area, but we found that enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TereseB_12
40,Very interesting observatory,Great views of LA and Hollywood sign. Visited in summer and got there late afternoon so parking at the top was full and had to park down and walk up. So keep in mind can be hot and steep. Parking is expensive at $20 but the observatory is free. We were not there at night to look at the telescopes. Lots of interesting exhibits if you are into astronomy and physics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75adinar
50,One of the best things to see in LA,I really recommend it to anybody as a first attraction when in LA. It is free of charge place but be prepared for crowds and no parking nearby the peak especially at sundown. Wear comfortable shoes . And note that it is closed on Mondays and open on some days until 10pm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag

50,"Fabulous visit, lots to learn","The observatory offers what it says -education, fun, family time, inspiration, hands-on activities. However, lots of traffic to navigate just to get to this attraction, but that'd fairly standard on LA highways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reena_Ch
50,Just WOW!!!,"always wanted to come here cuz of movies and more but busy till now. My god i love the awesome view of the Hollywood sign, the city, the mountain tops, etc... This place open up my knowledge about space, earth, solar systems, and more... gotta make time and swing by here for ur stop in LA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildborn39
50,FUN AND STIMULATING BUT CROWDED,"Behold a whorl of stimulation and outdoor adventure - whether its a museum, the views, or the trails all around, this is definitely a landmark place to check out in Los Angeles. But just be prepared - it can be very crowded. Lots of tourists, families, kids, etc. Parking can be a nightmare. Try to get there early or later in the evening and avoid the weekends if you don't want to deal with large crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felicityxfeline
50,Plenty to see,"Was impressed by all the art, it’s really a full day to get round everything as you don’t want to miss anything . Only thing negative is trying to get back out the car park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howat67
50,The observatory,"Great walk, interesting stuff inside, too bad the view of downtown LA was ruined by the LA pollution",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ishouldstartlifting
40,Enjoyable visit.,"You’ll be wrapped in messy traffic detours, the roads going up are the same roads that bringing you to other event on same route, probably every night! The people that should help to go up are possibly one extra level of confusion added...once up, you have to hope to find a parking space or else the road will send you all the way down again! Saying that, after all the routing issues, the place worth, you’ll have great view and a close up with the sky over us. Be there before sunset and remain until down, this will be a great option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robye144
30,Disappointed in the parking situation...,"I grew up going here, but was so disappointed that they charge $10 an hour to park here now. Just doesn't feel right...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristinaO535
40,Worth a visit,"We visited with our 3 children aged 17, 12 & 9It’s free to enter but you pay for the planetarium shows which we didn’t get to see as we had to be elsewhere. So we spent about 90mins at the observatory. The views are great of LA and the Hollywood sign but my favourite part was the pendulum and the periodic table. The timeline of Earth is interesting as is the solar system section. The restaurant is overpriced (probably compensating for the free admission to the observatory) wish we could have stayed longer to see the other exhibits and the planetarium shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Basi5
40,great views and very popular,"The observatory is free if you do not do the planetarium show. We took an uber so did not have to contend with the parking situation. In spite of the challenges of getting to the top, the place was packed when we visited in the morning. There are some interesting displays but the sheer number of visitors made it hard to appreciate. The gift shop was decent but the restaurant/cafe I think needs to be expanded and renovated. I would recommend eating elsewhere based on our experience. Overall, an ionic location that was surprisingly crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1
50,Amazing views,"I went with my family on august, on the day of the public star party. Its a must! You can see the moon and different stars not only from the telescope of the observatory, but as well on different telescopes on the garden from privates.They are very friendly and explain everything, even if you dont understand astronomy.The views from the top are awesome, you can see the city as well as the hollywood sign. If possible, go during the afternoon, so you can see during the day and night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3093TXcarlas
40,Enjoyable visit,"We got to the observatory at around 4 and found it pretty busy. On the way up the views were amazing it’s also great location to take pictures with the view of LA in the background.We were recommended to go there and we were glad we listened to the recommendation and moments after entering we went to a presentation about life in the universe - It was very factual and entertaining for my three eldest children and still entertaining for my youngest who is 6.BTW, if you see a sign saying that there’s not enough parking at the observatory, try it anyways, I didn’t try and there was plenty (it does cost $10’an hour)In short, a very nice place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronnenb
50,Fantastic Views!,"One of my favorite places to visit in LA. Park at the top for $10/hour. Well worth the visit! Excellent views of the city, ocean, and Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillg175
40,Worth the drive!,"You can spend a whole day here.This is a great spot to take backdrop photos of the Hollywood sign and enjoy the great view of the city of Los Angeles. Hopefully, it’s not a smoggy day when you visit.This is also a good spot for hiking.It’s free to get in and check out the exhibits.It would be nice to visit both day and night to get to experience both. It’s better to visit at night if you want to check out the observatory.The only downside is that everytime we visit, it’s always packed and its so hard to find parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413bellep
50,Loved this,LaLa land meets Hollywood. A lovely view of Hollywood/La. I was particularly relieved to be able to see the Hollywood sign and save me from the tour my family wanted to do. The Griffith Observatory is full of interesting facts and was used in the film LaLa land. All free unless you want to go inside the main section of the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanjo1389
40,"Great views, HORRIBLE parking","My wife and I were here with 3 relatives from NYC around 2pm . They enjoyed the views of Los Angeles, Hollywood sign, and learn about the solar system, how the planets move and rotate around its stars.Due to time, we did not stay for any of the shows.One serious problem: Parking was ATROCIOUS. When we arrived, a few of the parking lots were CLOSED, even though there were empty spaces for cars. Thus, we could not park the car and take the shuttle bus to go to the Observatory.I continued driving up and when we arrived at the UP/DOWN junction to go up to the Observatory itself, there were very limited parking spots, and I managed to snag one somewhat close. Parking sign and meter seemed to state that it was $10 an hour, BUT ... you were limited to only ONE hour at a time. This seems to imply that you have to come back to the parking spot within an hour!!! I'm not sure WHO thought up this logic, but it sure needs a lot of improvement - never had this before at any sight . . . you normally could put in a credit card and just pay however long you stay at the parking spot. Unbelievable situation and took a lot out of the enjoyment of visiting the Observatory.Normally, I would have a lot of photos, but with the going up/down to the parking spot ...Based on this experience, it is doubtful I will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8522EAleec
50,Visit with friends,"We made a visit on 27th August 2019 to the observatory. Its a great place to learn the movement of the planets, the solar system and other connected areas. It also provides a panoromic view of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255ainsleya
50,Brilliant! Go to shows,We visited due to being recommended by an uber driver and seriously thank goodness he did because it was great! We saw 2/3 of the shows on offer and they were really great and only $5 for student and $7 for adults! They’re 30-45 mins and really fun with the whole ceiling acting as a screen. The views of LA are spectacular as well. Highly recommend and is a free attraction too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eb0802
50,Amazing...,You should visit the observatory during the nite time so you can see the lights of Los Angeles itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leoniea56

50,Great visit with a nice short hike,The Griffith observatory is definitely well worth a visit. Beautiful views of LA and an interesting and free exhibit.

30,"Very busy, hard to park, but exhibits great for kids",I'm giving a low rating due to the difficulty we had with parking. It wasn't even the weekend and we arrived before opening and still couldn't find a space. We waited for a space and then it was $10 to park per hour so were limited on our time there. That said the views were great and the exhibits and history were fantastic for something free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996Chrissy
50,A fantastic free resource,"Worth the slight difficulty in getting there as it is a little out of the city. But once you are there the views are great and the observatory itself is a fantastic resource, full of wonder and for free.When we visited to see the sun set, there were 2 telescopes set up outside so you could see Jupiter too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshAdvisor
50,Get there for opening,Visited as part of a tour. Glad we arrived early before too many crowds. Beautiful views of the surrounding area and of course the Hollywood sign. Fascinating place in its own right.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClanClark
40,Lovely views,We went here on our last day in LA as we needed something to do as our flight wasn't until late evening. I'm so glad we went. We stayed for about 2/2.5 hours and that was plenty of time to get around the observatory and get some pics of the Hollywood sign and LA. Really good view of the Hollywood sign and overlooking LA. Inside the observatory was great. Lots of information that I had never knew worth the trip up. There is free wifi there too for anyone travelling. We needed the wifi to order an Uber back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caoimhenorthrop
50,"Busy Place To See A Billboard, But So Much More","OK so straight away I will say this is the place everyone goes to get the “Hollywood” sign pics. As such it is pretty much always busy. But there is so much more and you should really take the time if you have it to explore the Observatory.My wife and I stopped here as part of a LA Day Tour, obviously for the sign pics and vast views of a sprawling LA. Sadly we only had around 45 minutes to explore but we both agreed it was somewhere we would like to come back to. Inside the Observatory there are many interesting displays and a Planetarium. I would say you could easily spend a few hours here.I would also say the best tip is to get here early to avoid some of the madness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prw05
50,Great views. Great observatory and exhibits.,Parking can be expensive ($10 an hour) and suggest 2 or 3 hours if you want to make the most of the observatory exhibits which are great.So much to see inside.Check out the pendulum!Leonard Nimoy theatre had a science presentation which was 30 minutes so take that into account when planning.I could have stayed longer but only paid 2 hours.Walk up from (and down to) the car was 10 minutes and the views across LA include sight of the Hollywood sign.Can tick that off the list now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardBSutton
50,A day at Griffith Observatory,It is a beautiful place especially if you are traveling with childrenYou will see the city from above if the sky is clear.You will learn a a lotAnd you will also see the hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValRal77
30,A good view,There's really not a whole lot to this place other than a good view. It has nearly 360-degree unobstructed view of the city of Los Angeles. Nothing you want to do more than once but you should do it at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldProChef
50,Great place to look around with good views to the city,"We went here while doing a day tour of LA and it was one of my favourite stop.

50,"WOW, incredible. And free!","GREAT spot for so many things - terrific place to catch the Hollywood sign, beautiful grounds, and entry to the observatory is FREE. So many cool programs going on all day -- if you're interested in those, check the website and plan your visit accordingly.Parking is pricey, and navigating your way up that road while others are looking for parking will take some time (we visited on the weekend), but that wouldn't stop me from visiting again. I recommend going all the way to the main parking lot (unless it's confirmed full), as you will pay the same price for parking along the road, and since we were there in summer for a day that was 100 degrees plus, that would've been pure torture. Shorter walk = better visit. We only stayed for a couple of hours, but we easily could've stayed for several more, especially to see the special presentations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beakertroyd
40,Nice,This place is nice but very busy. Trying to find parking is impossible. We had to park close to the entrance and had to hike up to the observatory. The trail was not difficult to hike up but there are not street lights. How do they expect us to get back to the parking lot after sunset???,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StonedAngel

40,Neat to See,"Took my 5 year old here on a Thursday right as they opened. The parking situation was a little intense. We parked in the upper lot and paid $10 for an hour, which I thought was steep but didn't mind since the Observatory is free. My son really enjoyed the views and the museum. He didn't want to leave. Be prepared for steep prices if you plan on eating in the cafe. We only bought an ice cream but the man in front of us had a plate of food from the buffet and the price was $30!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBennett82

30,Overrated,"It is fine if you want to be a typical tourist and get your picture. Although it is crowded, the light when the sun sets is beautiful. But be aware the parking costs 10$/hour. There’s a free parking before driving up to the top but it get full very fast and it gets tough to hike or walk your way up with young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NourHos
50,Great hike up the west & east trails,"Awesome hike, although seriously warm (bring water)!

There are lots of people in the afternoon so early morning is probably a better option(the view can be a bit hazy too early though). If you're in a private car the flow of traffic is reglamented so don't expect to be able to stop,even if you must have a pic of that view! Parking may be a small problem as well and you may have to park at distance and walk back. Worth the view and the pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyinparistimestwo
40,Head to the lower level first!,"My husband, 20s daughter and sons and myself visited on a Sunday morning in August. The Observatory was extremely interesting and worth a visit (no fee to enter). The entry and first floor is very crowded and hard to maneuver. Hint: purchase tickets for the planetarium and then head directly downstairs. The exhibit downstairs includes comparison of the various planets, computes your weight on each and shows actual photos.We watched two shows. The tesla coil exhibition is in the first floor foyer. It got very crowded and hard to see through the two small windows, but worth checking out if you've never seen one before. The planetarium show we saw ($7 each adult), called Centered in the Universe, was great. The live narration was impressive, the padded, comfortable seats reclined and the information fascinating. There is a huge telescope on the roof, but nothing is visible during the day. There are a couple more free shows but we didn't stay to watch them. Note: The bathrooms on the bottom level were nearly empty but on the main floor there was a line going out the door.We drove our car to the Observatory. By 11:00 when we arrived, the parking lot nearest the observatory was full, but there are many additional (free) parking lots you can choose from. There is a public bus ( 50 cents pp) that runs up the hill and is worth taking since the walk from many of the surrounding lots is quite a distance.A fun and affordable science centered outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAbelini
50,Science — and scenic,More memorable than a trip to the beach; terrific family or couples activity. The walk up from parking below as intimidating at first but easy enough and well worth the effort due to views of L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SibylB_12
50,"Visiting the Griffith Observatory on the 20th July 2019, the Golden Jubilee of Apollo 11","The excitement, the curiosity and the atmosphere on the commemoration of the Golden Jubilee day of Apollo 11 mission of 1969 was the motive of visiting the observatory. I expected the program in the Planetarium would be devoted to that milestone event but the actual program was about ""Centered in the Universe"" which projected the Astronomical concepts of Universe as they have evolved over the ages, with the message how tiny, insignificant our solar system is but what giant steps Man has taken to know and map the Multiverse around us. The icing on the cake was the Apollo 11 pin that was presented by the staff to every visitor who attended the show. The show was an eye opener for the children with us and they were amazed by the message.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandrer2015
40,Great but busy and not organized well,"This is a magical place, especially for my older son who wants to be an astrophysicist. We saw the movie at the planetarium and even looked through the telescope at Jupiter which was super cool. With that being said the place was SUPER busy, parking was a nightmare. We literally drove between parking lots for over an hour and there was no one to direct traffic. The line to the telescope was over an hour as well and there were long lines to get tickets for the movies. It felt like there was not any effort made to organize the masses of people and make the experience a bit more fun and the flow of pepple a bit more efficient. Overall recommended but try to get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/964navaa
50,PB from New Jersey,Great view of the city and surrounding area wonderful educational experience for all ages recommend as a must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeggeBoden
50,Beautiful views inside and out,Amazing that such a treasure is free to the public! Parking is a zoo and EXPENSIVE! Recommend taking public transportation up to the Observatory. Views of LA and Hollywood sign are breathtaking. Exhibits are top notch! Lots of great hiking trails all over this amazing park. Suggest spending at least 2 to 3 hours at the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SRCali
50,Must visit place in LA,"Parking can be a bit challenging but doable. Normally, people plan for spending one hour, so you will have your chance. Magnificent building and what a view of greater LA area! You can see the Hollywood sign too, but to put it as your photo background, I would suggest a SLR, cell phone camera just do not have the depth of the field. Normally, one hour visit should be enough. Next time, we will visit during the evening to see the night scene of LA city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haitaoj
30,Great view but it wasn't open,I was really disappointed it wasn't open when we got there. It was 11am and I didn't even consider that it wouldn't be open. I think it opened at 12pm. The view from there is really good but smoggy the day we were there. I think it would be spectacular on a clear sunny day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataleighs
40,"Lovely Views, Worth A Visit!","My daughter wanted to see the HOLLYWOOD sign, so I put it in Google Maps, and it took me to the Griffith Observatory and surrounding hills! Sure, one can see the sign from here, but barely! Actually later we realized that we had a better view of the sign from the rooftop of the Airbnb apartment on Cahuenga Blvd where we were staying!In any case, the views of the city from the top are quite lovely. Additionally, the observatory is worth a visit, which houses a planetarium, telescopes, exhibits and a large pendulum depicting the rotation of the earth.I believe it is always very crowded, and we parked about half a mile away on the roadside, but when we walked uphill to the park, we found that there was sufficient parking available there, despite all the crowd. The parking fee is $ 10, which is rather expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShoaibShawoo
20,Very crowded,"Very crowded, a lot of traffic when you arrive there, just to park far far away and have to walk 15 minutes to the top.The view is stunning, but the crowds make me not want to return there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikosM1661
50,Great Views,"Can't beat the views. Gets a little busy, but what do you expect. Didn't go inside but went everywhere else on the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmsparks88
50,WOW!,Amazing view! A must place to visit if you are new to Los Angeles. The view was breathtaking! Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ecoteam2367
50,A Must See,"The Griffith Observatory is a must see. The views are awesome; the astronomy shows are awesome.But be warned. You aren't getting a parking space near the observatory - so be prepared to hike up a mile along the road. But its worth it.Also, parking along the road costs $10 - it used to be free. But you can park down enough to get to the free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricWTraveler
50,View of Los Angeles.,"I was glad that this was part of our LA tour package as parking was very long and the parking lot was full. We were dropped as close as we can get to where buses were allowed to drop tourists so we didn't have to hike uphill. The views here were magnificent. We arrived mid-day so it was high noon. It was very crowded so hubby and I decided to stay in the grounds, set up our tripod and get excellent photos of the Hollywood sign as well as downtown LA.It was nice to be away from the busy traffic and just be a little removed from the fast pace of city touring. It sounds ironic but this was how hubby and I felt when we arrived at the Griffith Observatory. There was no other structure taller than the Observatory and we felt like we're on top of the world looking down at a different world we just left behind us. Despite the crowd, it was actually peaceful and it was nice to have fresh air to breath. It was very windy and can get hot up here so don't forget to bring water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimieW
30,Come here for the view,"We came on a very busy day when parking was expensive and cumbersome. There are parking alternatives, but then be prepared for a rather strenous walk uphill. The main benefit from the visit was the views, including the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannaBragberg

50,Very Grand,It was a beautiful day and a beautiful place to go to take advantage of the Hollywood weather.The view from the place was so nice and going inside the observatory was amazing. There was a lot more to see in there than I would’ve guessed! They have a nice gift shop too! There were a lot of people but the place is very large and accommodating. A nice place to bring the family especially if they are into science.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/upinthesaddle
50,Beautiful views but...,"Get in before all the tourists come! Parking is attrocious, I will definitely go back late or early to watch a sunset or sunrise and get a chance to see some stars.The views from this vantage point... simply Spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiaora-Cali
40,Great at night,"Brilliant!! But be prepared for a huge trek uphill to get to it. Car parks are always full so you have to park a good mile away at the bottom of a big hill. It’s well worth it though especially at night. Bit weird though that compared to all other high profile tourist attractions there is ZERO security. Not that we could see anyway. But the sheer volume of people descending on it every night I don’t see how it could possibly be done, you’d have to book months in advance!! Amazing view of L.A., very romantic, beautifully kept and felt very iconic. Just amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782ruthj
40,Quick trip for the view of LA,"Well worth the time to take a trip up for the amazing view of LA. Great place to see the famous ‘Hollywood ‘ sign too. We tried to go up one evening and arrived too late to get near the place so went back at 10am the next day with no issues. Drove straight to the top, paid $10 to park and had an hour to mooch about. Gets really busy and I think it’s closed on Mondays from memory. Check it out before you go, there is a bus service which will take you right to the top, or you can walk, although it’s quite a hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367glo

10,One huge traffic jam,I have attempted to visit the Griffith Observatory on three seperate occasions. Each one was at a different time of the year (two in the winter) and each one has been a disaster. On each occasion all I've done is sat in the car for over an hour only to find out there is no parking at the top and had to come all the way back down again. The views from the car whilst sat in traffic were amazing but the third attempt will be my last - I won't be trying again. Unless you like sitting in bumper to bumper traffic then I'd avoid at all costs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinrQ7509JA

Near the Hollywood sign and right down the hill less than an mile away is a great diner called House of Pies. Love this place and hiking area is incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971sheriem
50,Loved it! Ideal for hike and sunset view at top!,The road was closed to the top so we were told to park in the outdoor car park where we could wait or hike up. It was a mile to the top so we chose to walk. Great views along the way. Not too steep. Saw people with prams coming down. Keep young children close as no barriers until you get to the road and steep drops to the side In certain areas. It took us about 20-25 minutes to walk. You can park at the top and on the road leading up. We made it in time for the sunset and it was just beautiful. The observatory has lots of things to see and little information booths. Toilets available. Recommend taking water.They had a huge telescope to view Saturn and Jupiter at the time which was brilliant and kids loved it! Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simmonsadventures
50,Best view of the Hollywood Sign,"We parked for free in Parking Lot G and then took the short ride on the free shuttle up to the Griffith Observatory. The Griffith Observatory is absolutely FREE! It is a beautiful building and area with lots of educational and interesting exhibits on the universe. We purchased discounted Planetarium tickets for $5.00 each, but the regular price is only $7.00. It was an excellent show with live narration. Our favorite part of the Observatory was the exceptional views of LA and the iconic Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AATrenton

50,"Great View, Great Building!","Visiting Griffith Observatory was one of the highlights of our visit to LA. We began on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ( okay but not very clean and a bit underwhelming.) We then walked to Griffith Park and up to the observatory. If you do this make sure you are fit as it's a long walk and some of it quite steep. However it is so worth it. The view at the top and as you climb is breath taking. Lots of opportunities for photos with the famous Hollywood sign in the background and views across LA.. The Observatory itself is a beautiful building with loads of astronomical facts to learn as you walk around.It is also free to get in, an amazing experience, don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simon682015

50,A Must See!,This is a must see when in LA! You'll usually find parking at the top regardless of what the signs say. My favorite(s) here are the view of LA and the scale model solar system that surround the observatory itself. I also am reminded of the James Dean classic Rebel Without a Cause that was partly shot up here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepC8412RT

50,Best views of the LA Skyline at night!,"LA sparkles at night. And Griffith Observatory is the best place to see the glimmer of what appears to be thousands of stars blanketing the ground. There's also so much to see and do inside the observatory. The only drawback is the parking which has become a nightmare over the years. My advice, park at the entrance to the park on Fern Dell and hike up around sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5919QHanthonys

It took 20 minutes to reach the entrance. The Observatory is free. It was very busy inside so we bought tickets for the planetarium show right away and got in a short line. 5 and 7 year olds thoroughly enjoyed the planetarium presentation but were not so interested in the great exhibits inside the Observatory. Great view of downtown LA and you can see the Hollywood sign. Food on site in cafeteria but pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njoythejourney

30,Oh my the crowds!,First timers in LA. We looked forward to a leisurely drive up to the observatory at sundown to get a picture of the Hollywood Sign and downtown LA. Not prepared for the hordes of people trying to do the same thing. Not sure what time you would have to get there to actually drive up top but we were too late. Ended up missing the sunset (and getting the picture of the sign) and took a shuttle bus up to the top to at least see the lights of downtown at night. Be warned. Shuttle bus is $ .50 and exact change only. Not sure if they charge going down the hill as it was late and we decided to walk it back to the car.It was a nice view and had some interesting information in the Observatory but the crush of people did not make it very enjoyable. Perhaps we will try again off season sometime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffg475

50,GREAT VIEWS WITH A TOUCH OF SCIENCE,"(Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) It seemed the majority of the Griffith Observatory crowds were there for the outside views and not the observatory itself. However, the views outside are freakin’ awesome (beautiful during a clear sunset), and having the observatory as a photo backdrop is iconic. But not once did I have to wait in line inside to read a plaque or touch an exhibit… Sure there were crowds, but not for the galactic features.THREE LEVELS OF THINGS TO DOAll for freeeeee!! It took me a while to realize there was a relatively new basement level which really, really felt more like typical, natural museums around the country. It was much emptier than the above floors, but still packed with entertaining visuals of space.AROUND THE OBSERVATORYGriffith Park itself is huge with many trails, various elevations, parks, playgrounds, etc. I highly suggest taking a rideshare up because the observatory’s parking lot is pretty small. In heading up the winding road there, we passed scores and scores of cars parked in a conga line (starting from a half-mile before the observatory itself), and their riders huffing their way up the street to the building. I highly enjoyed this place and was more annoyed with disrespectable visitors than with anything at the observatory itself..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pyra-Danny

Loved the views, the Tesla demonstration and the Planetarium presentation - the live commentary was special. We did not join the telescope queue. We all loved our visit - would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbZ3999ZG
30,MIght have been good.,"My three star rating is an average. Five stars for how much I probably would have liked it, and one star for the fact there there was absolutely no place to park so all I got was a nice drive through the park.I've always been interested in the sky, and at 68 years old, I figured it was time to take my first look through a telescope. So I was rather disappointed when we were turned away from the lot and then drove all the way back down the mountain looking in vain for parallel parking.Tip: Go on a night that there isn't a show at the Greek Theatre. Parking must be easier to find on those night. Sadly, that wasn't an option for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingMemphian

And there are trails through the hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009
50,Very interesting,"I spent a good hour at the observatory with my family. It has a lot of interesting information and my favourite part was learning about the different planets. You can go to the top to take pictures, I recommend going during sunset time because it was absolutely gorgeous. The parking was hard to find and it was quite crowded so you have to park along the road and then walk all the way up. Overall it was an amazing experience and I would recommend it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhaindoyle
50,Beautiful view and lovely facility.,"The views all around are fantastic, and I loved seeing the Tesla coil. There are trails and it's free (except for parking ). The one draw back is parking and crowds, but once you get past that it's beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobbCoGA
50,"Very interesting museum, great view","Museum is very interesting, spend 1-2 hours. Add the magnificient view over LA and to the Hollywood sign. But - Heavy traffic, lots of people on busy days, and do not expect to park your car close to the site. Use bus or taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelgeE_13
50,A must in LA,Visited Griffith observatory at sunset. An absolute must in LA. Easy to find parking and then a short walk to the top with great view over the city. Nice free exhibition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959mattiasb
50,A great find,"We decided to visit the Griffith Observatory following the recommendation of our guide on the Big Bus tour & I have to say we were not disappointed! We decided to take the hike route (approx 1 mile). It was very hot so water is needed but it was a great way to get to the observatory. Once there we loved all aspects of the galleries, we learnt lots & our teenage boys loved it too. There were great views of the Hollywood sign to boot & a wonderful cafe serving fresh & tasty food and beverages at a reasonable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jomZ7561ZD
40,"Great views, crowded","We went there at opening time (noon) and it was already packed. Nice views and some cool exhibits. We paid to see one of the planetarium movies. Kids fell asleep during the movie, but it was still nice. Our Uber dropped us off at the observatory at noon, but at 2:30, we could not find an Uber that would pick us up at the top. We took a 1 mile trail down to the Greek Theater and then called an Uber from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjtex2016
40,Awesome views,"The views here are awesome, but the facility doesn't open until noon. Still worth it for the views--and because it was featured in the movie Earth Girls Are Easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdRockster
50,Amazing view!,"The views are incredible, but then go inside and so much to see and learn about. Drive all the way up and part in the top lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nwp72
40,Worth it for the view despite the hassle of getting there,"One of the biggest deterrents to visit anything in Los Angeles proper is the traffic and parking. So we opted to visit during the day when that would be somewhat manageable. We stopped for lunch near West Hollywood at Joan’s on Third which offered a solid selection of healthy tasty salads. Despite looking like a simple salad bar, service was slow although staff were friendly.We visited the observatory when there wasn’t a show at the Greek Theater so the parking was free at the Greek parking lot. On show days, I wouldn’t even know where one would park the car as the paid lots can only handle a few. A 50 cent shuttle service went between the lot and the observatory but the hike up was pleasant and offered good views along the way.As the observatory doesn’t charge an admission, it was crowded even on a weekday. Exhibitions including the Tesla coil and the pendulum were interesting and well presented. The amount of tourist traffic inside made it difficult to really get a good look at anything though.We paid seven dollars to watch a film in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium. We were surprised there was a live narration to accompany the film. The seats were a little too comfortable making me doze off right away but regardless of what is being shown, watching a film on the planetarium ceiling is impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelonious22
40,"Beautiful Views, terrible traffic","So getting here was the worst traffic we encountered in LA and finding parking a nightmare but that said, it was worth it for the beautiful views. We managed to see the sunset and stayed long enough for the stars to come out. I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable without the crowds but we still walked around and got to see the mountains as well as downtown LA. Also, save yourself a trip to the Hollywood sign as you can see it from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitaLyC
40,Gorgeous views!,"This place is beatutiful, sitting on top of a hill overlooking LA. However, it is very crowded, and trying to see some of the exhibits was challenging. Parking is extremely crowded and expensive ($10 /. hr).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keltik01
40,Great views of downtown LA and Hollywood sign,We went early so managed to get a free parking space near the top on the one way loop road. The view of downtown LA was rather obscured by a layer of smog but the view of the Hollywood sign was clear. Unfortunately everything was closed but the views were worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honeybun51
50,Well worth a visit,Went here one night not knowing what to expect. A brilliant night. Cheap for LA.. The view is incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryGalDove
50,Brilliant place to visit,"We had a great time, a wonderful old building, fantastic views of LA and a show in the Planetarium is a must",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdm66
40,Evening visit,A great time to visit is 6.30 pm ish. Enough time to see the sights before sun set but also be there for the spectacle of the City lit up after dark. We were thrilled to see Jupiter through the telescope and the knowledgeable staff enrich the experience. We took an Uber to the door and then a taxi from the rank back as one of our party had health issues that would make a walk up the hill too difficult. We would recommend this visit to all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lprestleigh
50,"Great attraction, lots to see","This was a great museum. It had loads to see and many fascinating exhibits, though not a lot of it was interactive. It is free to go in but parking costs $10/hour, so it kind of pays for your admission. Set aside at least 2-2.5 hours here. Must-visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanM7105
50,Out of this world!,Loved this place. We went up around 7pm but I’d recommend going earlier as it’s very busy. It’s free to look through the telescopes but we waited almost an hour for the big one and it’s not much better than the smaller one near the museum entrance. It’s free to go inside and there’s some really cool stuff. We missed getting tickets for the planetarium show by a few minutes which was disappointing but still a great trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IainTwaddle
50,FREE!,Beautiful view of LA and the Hollywood sign. Don't miss it.Come early in the day as parking fills up quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaraNelly
40,A must do,Wonderful views of LA and one of the ideal photo opportunities for the Hollywood sign.Free parking outside the actual Observatory in the morning (the Observatory itself will be closed).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkRandA
50,Well worth the trip,We were in Hollywood and decided to take Uber to the observatory. It happened to be during the 50th anniversary of the moon launch.It was really busy and I was glad we took Uber as it is 10.00 per hour to park there.The views are great and fir the amount of time we had to spend there it was great. Another must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorktownVickie
50,Wonderful observatory visit,"We happened to go on an evening when the observatory was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the moon landing and when volunteer members of an astronomers club gather out front every month and they let you look through their telescopes if you ask nicely. Inside, there is a lot to learn. The views outside are stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THD
50,Amazing city view during the night,"That was possibly the most amazing view of the city during the night. Luckily the atmosphere was crystal clear that night due to winds and the view of the city was magnificent! The inside museum of the observatory was educating and the content fascinates not only science nerds but kids and families as well. It is a place to visit for all ages! Definitely a must see. During the day, the view of the Hollywood sign is limited as it is quite far. Please don’t rely on Griffith Observatory as your only view of the Hollywood sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerasimosdo
40,Astronomy,"Located 40 minutes from downtown LA, parking can be a bit tricky. Its a free attraction with lovely views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roryjdoyle
50,Good stop along a hiking trail,"When I saw this building, I knew I was far from my Midwest home. It’s such an iconic building in Hollywood. I especially enjoyed it in La La Land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellymQ868JN
40,Beautiful Views,"We planned to go to Griffith Observatory on one of our nights in LA to watch the sunset and see the views. We didn’t realize until we got there that it was also a “star party” night, so there were tons and tons of people everywhere. We ended up having to park almost at the bottom of the hill, and just followed the crowd up a really steep hill through the brush/woods. The parking attendant watched everyone park and go up this hill. We get to the top of the hill and there are signs to avoid the trails because of rattlesnakes - PLEASE PUT THE SIGNS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WHERE THE TRAIL STARTS! It was dark when we went and we just followed the crowd and had no idea of the danger until we saw the sign at the TOP of the hill. Other than that, we had a great time and saw a beautiful sunset with lots of pretty pictures of LA. The grounds were packed, but they had a lot of volunteers there with telescopes so you could look at the moon and stars - really neat! Wish we had planned in our trip to go back during the day when it wasn’t so busy to explore all of the stations inside of the observatory. What a great place for people to visit in LA to learn more about nature (for free!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosieJadeG
40,Take an Uber/Lyft,"We took an Uber there and saw people having to hike up the hill in sweltering heat as they couldn’t park close by. We also took an Uber back down which was just as easy. Remember to factor that into your cost.The Observatory itself is free, if you want to watch the show at the planetarium, it’s $7 each adult. This is the first live narrated planetarium show I’ve been to. It was informative.The views of LA are unobstructed and you can see the Hollywood sign.The information in the exhibits were fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Netster11
50,Fun and free,The observatory is free unless you do a couple of specific activities. It was really fun and educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rawband
10,Absence of thought or planning,"If your idea of a fun family day out involves- Hiking up a hill in 100+ degrees to get to the observatory- Having nowhere to park your car despite crazy exorbitant parking charges- Crisping your children in the baking sun while they wait for the non-existent public bus service which cannot cope with the numbers of people visiting- A tired and overcrowded mediocre observatoryThen I would highly recommend the Griffith Observatory.For a city clearly keen on the automobile without any viable public transport alternatives, it seems a surprise to the Griffith Observatory that people may visit by car. 5-6 complimentary shuttles from the bottom of the hill to the top would transform this experience from one to remember for all the wrong reasons, to one highlighting some memorable views of LA and the Hollywood sign.Unless you like arriving at your tourist day out with a mild case of heatstroke, drenched in sweat and covered in dust, spending more time walking to and from your vehicle than in the observatory...avoid at all costs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrGilds
40,Iconic LA sights,No visit to LA would be complete without a trip to the Observatory! The views are second to none and the observatory is both educational and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6743NGjessicak
50,Amazing sights but be prepared for a walk!,"The sights at Griffiths are amazing and some of the best we've found of the city. There is quite a walk to the observatory (which is to be expected) and consider parking costs when going as these are high...however, the observatory is free to enter which makes up for it. Only other suggestion would be to take a drink with you - we purchased 1 large water which was approx $7!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochellee400
50,Best views...,Parking is $10 per hour. Seriously. The entrance is free. The views are unbelievable. The Hollywood sign and all of Los Angeles are yours.Visit the planetarium. All shows are amazing. Plan on three hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubten
50,Perfect for any space enthusiast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"So much to see - make sure you plan out your visit. Night time is the best time but get there early because it gets very busy very quickly!! It is truly amazing to look down on Hollywood and it being all lit up at night. Very interesting visit, absolutely gorgeous - a must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235nickit
50,Great views / Uber there,The views and planetarium shows were a great escape from the heat. It is crowded and a long way up. Best not to drive and Uber or Lyft there and back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cooper12
50,"Lovely views, fresh air, free","Worth the hike up the hill! We parked at the Greek Theatre area in Griffith Park for free and made a 15 minute/0.8 mile trek uphill— totally doable in the fresh mountain air. At the top, you’ll see gorgeous views of the city skyline and the Hollywood sign. There are nice free museum exhibits, as a well as a cafe and free restrooms. This is a must see stop if you are in this area of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeggySATX
40,Great time passing place,"It is a really nice place to visit at night, very good view of LAin day time you can see via telescope the stars which is amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen1124d
50,So Close to the heavens,"The hike up was SO WORTH IT. No you don’t have to hike all the way up. But you can’t replace the experience or the view if you don’t. (My daughter disagrees lol!)Amazing city views (plus you get up close with the (Hollywood) sign. Be sure to 1-sign up for a show (we saw Valkyries) 2-Visit the lower level of the museum.If you plan on parking at the top, be prepared to pay and wait. Lines are long when exiting time happens. Also, Uber/Lyft can assist but they too are at the mercy of all the various vehicles going up and down the hill up to the observatory area.Very beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatGuyJP
50,Take a ride-share!,"Gorgeous place with beautiful view, but don’t bring your car. There’s literally no place to park. Luckily my friend had a ride-share app, so we used that. It’s up a big hill, with lots of curvy roads. Cars were parked down the side of the road for miles and miles... our driver warned us that people sometimes steal from these cars. So beware! Also it’s quite a hike, so try to avoid parking here. Otherwise, the observatory is stunning. We walked around the observatory, and watched a really cool show in the planetarium. Everything is free except the presentations... I think they’re about $7.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smarttraveler30
30,A One Time Thing,"Great views of LA. Parking is a challenge. It’s an iconic spot and worth doing once. If time is tight, I’d make a different choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3993SYtomc
50,Beautiful views of LA!,Make sure to get here early like we did before the crowds! Beautiful views of the LA area and Griffith Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellietalley
40,"Parking is hard to do, but worth seeing","We ended up parking at the free lot at the base of the hill and taking the safety path up rather than paying to park on that winding road with kids. I think if we did it again with someone unable to make that walk, I'd do what others suggest and take a ride share. It was very busy and I was tired so I spent a lot of time on the verandas. My kids enjoyed checking out the exhibits. I just wish we'd known the telescope wouldn't be available during the day before going. We bought bottles of water at the cafe for our walk back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boilermish
50,A must!!,"It's definitely worth going, just take a uber or lyft if from out of town. The place is free, and going on nice day, you can hike down. There is lots to see indoors, and the hike down provides a nice view of the city. Go to the cafeteria, have a meal outdoor and you can check out the hollywood sign from afar. It is quite warm on a sunny day though! make sure to wear sun protection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/memeh613
50,Amazing Hike and view!,Definitely worth the hike up the mountain to capture the spectacular view of LA and the Hollywood sign. Being plenty of water and wear appropriate shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/704frequelc
40,A great view of LA and the Hollywood Sign,"We arrived here an hour before the observatory opened after hiking up through Griffith park. The views are great, and walking around the outside of the observatory offers different vantage points of LA, the Hollywood Sign, and even the Pacific Ocean far off in the distance. It’s free to enter when it opens, and it’s all exhibits about space and astronomy. If you want to pay for the imax show, there’s usually a line to get the tickets. A nice way to spend the morning on a clear day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmill42894
50,Last minute trip was great,I visited here on my last day in LA and was surprised at how great and informative it is. I'd highly recommend the show in the big dome and the views are truely amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mashlie
50,Nice walk through a lovely park,"We mainly did a walk through the park so that we could see the Hollywood sign but the observatory is a wonderful building with some really fun/insightful exhibits, I particularly enjoyed the current exhibit they have displaying a snapshot of the universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LancasterLads
30,Great location but too busy for little kids and nightmare parking,"The observatory itself is great.if you are local public transport is good but if you are coming from outside the city like us then the parking is a nightmare. Free parking at Greek theatre but a steep walk uphill with little ones is tricky. Appreciate that we went at a weekend in summer but thats the only time my husband can take leave. Inside upstairs is very cramped and lots of written stuff means it's not super engaging for the younger kids. Lower level is much better. Planetarium is brilliant but as usual ruined by people who continue to use their phones and smart watches despite clear instructions not to do so (not the observatory's fault that the public is so disrespectful these days). Also the show we saw (about water) was voiced by a woman who had a ridiculous intonation, it sounded like she was trying to sing the words but ended up resulting in a very soporific effect. Also for my elderly mother very difficult to understand her. Choose your show carefully!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenanbuk
50,Great views of the city,The view of the city is great from the observatory is great but parking fills up fast so get there early so you don’t have to walk far or take the shuttle which was packed when we were went here. The exhibits are very informational and exciting. The place is very clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sp4102
40,go on a clear day,"if possible to choose, go on a clear day, you get better views. definitely recommend show about water, which we had in the grand show room. i really enjoyed it. park just straight after the great entrance on the hillside, no need to walk up all those kilometres from lower parking lots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275marleent

50,One of the best kept secrets in LA - and it's FREE!,"When you're here in beautiful Griffith Park, you don't know which to do first, look up at the stars above or the sparkling lights of Hollywood below. We've always taken the shuttle form the Los Angeles Zoo parking lot. Catch this place on an astro event, such as an eclipse. The staff is great and awlays helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/concettah667
30,CAREFUL OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BUSHES,The observatory itself and the displays are fascinating as is the film presentation. However I could have done without gay men having sex in the bushes.Very tacky of them and definitely not for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer780991
50,Awesome!,"We went here Tuesday and were blown away by the views of the city, and by how well maintained the Observatory and its grounds were, a deffinite DO NOT MISS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwy1
30,Just OK,Typical visit in LA bucket list but not meet our expectations. Next to West Hollywood I will recommend to visit when you are going to Hollywood sign. A long drive (or walk if you dare) to find a parking spot (8 $) to check some views to LA (observatory is not good).I strongly recommend visit Getty for views instead of Griffin.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acivipam
40,Good views,"My family isn’t big into museums or educational attractions. So while we didn’t care a ton for the actual observatory, we loved the location as it gave breath taking views of LA and the Hollywood sign.I gave this location 4 stars as there was no refreshments of any kind. So after a hike up a mountain, sweating our butts off, we got no relief as there wasn’t anywhere to buy a drink. Seriously, someone needs to monetize this and make a killing selling bottled waters/drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fizband
50,Commanding place in Griffith Park,"There is plenty to like about this site. First, the views of the surrounding areas are excellent from the grounds and on top of the roof of the observatory. Second, the science displays are enlightening. Third, the history and architecture of the building is worth exploring. It had multiple levels and walkways and stairways. It’s like a maze at times. I kept finding more to look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkus1968
50,Awesome views and great show,Great views of the city from up here as well as the hollywood sign. They offer a great free show inside on tons of things about space and the telescope and things. As well as you can pay a very reasonable price for a really great planetarium show! definitely worth the trip up here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hunter84_327
50,Enjoyable,"The observatory gives a great view over the entire City of LA and of course the famous 'Hollywood' sign.It is a 15 minute or so drive from the City but the view, on a nice day is worth it.We did not indulge in any star gazing but did not need to ad it serves it's purpose just for the excellent vista it provides. Well worth the detour from the gliz and hussle from the streets below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigaitch27
50,Lunar learning in mega-awesome space.,"Another must see in LA. The observatory is as professional and family friendly as any venue in LA, it is situated tip top of Griffith Park. You will drive up the mountain, look for a parking place, pay $8 an HOUR for parking, make sure you pay for your stay, but the observatory is free. Give yourself at minimum two hours of parking, three if you plan on seeing the planetarium show, etc. Food is available at the Cafe at the End of the Universe, pricing is not bad for museum food $$. Plenty of outdoor space for relaxing or letting the kids romp. Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces591872
40,It wasn’t open but park is awesome,Views by far are awesome. Make sure to walk around front to get a real vastness of the city. I felt safe and restrooms were ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baybug2012
50,Daytime Visit,"We visited the Griffith Observatory to see Los Angeles from a distance, to see the Hollywood sign and to look inside the Observatory.We travelled by Metro tram and then on the Dash shuttle bus to the park which dropped off outside the observatory, we spent 4 hours in the observatory and grounds with views across Los Angeles and a good view of the Hollywood sign,also a visit to the cafe for a pastry and drink. Excellent visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8357ECalang
50,Great place to visit,"The observatory is a great place to visit, both for the science and the views. There is no charge to enter but a planetarium show will cost $7 per person, which is good value. The staff are very helpful and the building & it’s exhibits are great. Parking is $10 an hour if you choose to park near the observatory but you can (subject to availability) park in a free car park (car park G) at the bottom of the hill and catch a shuttle bus, which runs every 15 to 20 minutes and costs 50 cents per person, each way. You’ll get some of the best views of LA and, in the distance, the Hollywood sign. Check their website for opening times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertP872
50,"A must see in LA, you won't regret it!","We weren't really sure what to expect, but this place was better than we imagined. There are many things to do inside, much like a museum with exhibits and activities. Outside you can walk on the roof and get amazing views of the city. It's free except for the planetarium shows.Be prepared to pay for parking and deal with crowds of people, but it's totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieD7902014
40,Good views,"Good views but not very close to the Hollywood sign if that's why you are going there, it looks tiny. If you are able drive or take a tour and get closer or hike it like we did to above the letters, it is a real hike though, so be wary. The observatory itself was really interesting and well displayed, I even saw a real piece of the moon which was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LightPacker279606
40,Bring Your Hiking Shoes!,"The views here are amazing, but be prepared for hills and crowds. We visited on a Sunday in July and it was PACKED. There were people everywhere, inside and out. The show in the planetarium is an excellent way to cool off; otherwise it's a pretty small space inside for a lot of people. The real attractions is the area around it, including the Hollywood sign and the valley. There are many trails to choose from to hike around the observatory, so be sure to bring hiking shoes and water. Even the walk to and from the car is a hike, unless you get there early enough for the actual Griffith lot. Bottom line: Pretty views and an interesting visit, but it's not for people who don't want to do a lot of uphill walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239jacquic
50,An LA must see,This is a beautiful location! Amazing views of LA. Just avoid if there is a major act at the Greek Theater near by!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonbourassa
50,Must do!,Amazing views to see LA and Hollywood sign. It was busy so we didn’t do any of the exhibits inside but the views alone made up for it. Had to park down the block a bit and walk up about 10 mins but wow!!!! Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMannersF
50,Wonderful visit,Griffith Observatory is a beautiful location to see a 360 view of LA. The planetarium was really cool and the host was so engaging!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigMamaCheri
50,great view from this place,"Really climatic place, I think you can feel Los Angeles/Hollywood from this place.Highly recomended especially during sunset and after sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InfinityRoad
40,A very interesting place,"We headed up here after spending the day at Universal. From Universal, it can be a little tricky to get to by public transport, so invest in an Uber ride.Our trip here was inspired by La La Land and 100 other Hollywood movies. The scene from up here is straight out of the movies - a superb view over Los Angeles.The Observatory itself is a marvellous museum of all things astronomy. The highlight is the telescope - but caution here, it closes about half an hour earlier than the rest of the place, so check this out before looking through the exhibits. Even so, get here at dusk for the best experience.At the end of the night, there is a shuttle bus down to Sunset, but once Griffith is closed the shuttle becomes infrequent. It drops you at the Metro station, in an otherwise lonely part of town. My advise is to check your transport options before you head up here.This place is very worthwhile visiting and if you have a couple of hours up your sleeve whilst in LA, a visit here is rewarding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pablo02061959
40,Best free spot in LA,"Best to park near Greek Theater and pay 50cents for shuttle to top. (Also need 50cts for return trip.) Live show is worth the $7, but not required. Lots if interesting free and educational exhibits. Get in line well before 7pm if you want too enjoy telescopes. Bring a sweatshirt for eveningtime. Great not view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JENNIFERS367
50,Extremely interesting and accessible!,"The whole drive up, we planned to be in paid parking because we had a disabled member of our party (with handicap permit). The traffic was extremely slow to get up - all lots were full closer, so they directed you to free parking, where you were to walk. We were prepping to have to do the (extremely) long trek up, when they moved the traffic cones to allow us through! This continued over and over again, with people directing us up and up until we got to the handicapped parking right in front of the observatory. Literally nobody else was allowed through. This accessibility continued through the whole museum with staffers going out of their way to help us and direction us toward elevators, special seating, et cetera - even though we weren’t fully using a wheelchair, just a cane. It was a heartwarming experience, because honestly, we hadn’t expected this level of accommodation. The views from the observatory are extraordinary, as are the museum exhibits - the whole family loved them. We spent a lot of time (23 minutes plus wait) for the Leonard Nimoy “then and now at the observatory” showing - which pointed us to other hot spots there we missed. Overall it was a lovely experience and can’t be missed for families of all ages and accessibility levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizamarsh
40,Amazing view,"If you want a godd view of LA, this is a perfect place. There is a lot of people and the cafe is not the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/407iselinh
50,Great view and great start for hiking,Nice and interesting view. Beatiful surroundings. I walked to the Signs from the Observatory. I do recommend that!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thor77777777
30,Not impressed but I didn’t do any of the additional shows,We visited the observatory to get a good picture of the Hollywood sign. No such luck. I had a better picture from the car driving to the observatory. But there were other attractions or events that we did not participate in.Be prepared for slow moving traffic up the hill and parking lots at the top to be full. However the bus ride from the lower parking lots were great at only .50 per passenger. Please have exact change.I don’t believe I would visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mendez5plus1
40,Worth a day trip.,"Interesting little observatory with great views of LA and possibly one of the best places from which the HOLLYWOOD sign can be viewed and photographed. The exhibits are interesting and the auditorium shows are good viewing. Parking can be a problem. The observatory is free but parking and shows require payment. If you park in the free lots, there is a 15-30 mt walk up a gradual incline to reach the observatory or you can wait for shuttle buses. The cafetaria is reasonable and adequate for a meal. All in all, it was a pleasant half-day visit ( 3-6 hrs depending on how many shows you decide to see and the timing of these shows).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bbbass1
40,worth a visit,fantastic view of LA and the Hollywood sign however parking is a pain we were directed away from the parking lot to roadside parking and it was along walk up to the observatory and expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoT199896
40,Observatory Has Grown with New Programs,"I remember my first visit as a little girl to the observatory, our family drove up from Salinas, California - Steinbeck Country home to the California Rodeo. Looking through telescopes and going into the building was like entering a space station - much to what it must seem to little kids today except they have Star Wars and so many other Sci-Fi films behind them it's probably not the same.The programs here offer a wide variety of experiences and you can join a friends of the Observatory to attend for a lowered fee. The changes continue to be greater and of benefit to visitors.Beautiful grounds but the parking can be really difficult to get in on the busier times. Well worth seeing at least once in your life and even bringing along someone to explore it with you again.Hiking up there is not fun, did that once and won't do it again. Too steep and the ground is too dry - ripe for rattlers. But that's below the winding road up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMFredric
50,Worth a visit,"Walked up here, worth a visit! Car parking is however expensive $10 for 1 hour so your time is limited, nice views and good atmosphere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jadeymc
50,MUST go!,Iconic structure - a feast for the eyes! And educational too! Simply Stellar!! Leave some time to walk around the “park” and try to catch a show. Worthwhile for kids of all ages. Went with toddlers and they were spellbound,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765anamaric
40,"Great views, good hikes","During a recent visit to LA, took some time to drive around Griffith Park. Loved the drive and the park is huge. Get there earlier to avoid the crowds, otherwise you will be looking for roadside parking and will have to hike up to the Observatory. Plenty of hiking trails to get away from the crowds also. Saw a ratllesnake on one of the trails so watch your feet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BRADJOE72
40,Great place,"Take note, as you are driving up the park towards the Griffith Observatory, try to check out nearby parking first. Parking on the street is USD8/hour regardless of where you are at the park. It's better to park nearer the Observatory, than farther away, especially if you have kids in tow that don't want to hike up. The Observatory itself is free, except if you're going to watch a planetarium show. There are many nice exhibits about planets, moon and tides, sun, etc. The actual big telescope doesn't open until after dark, so if your main plan was to look at the stars, it's best to arrive late in the evening. There are lots of great photo opportunity. Overall, it's a great place to chill and enjoy the breeze and the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyeson
50,Awesome,I absolutely loved my evening visit! Great views. The planetarium show was amazing. I found a parking spot near the entrance with no problem. Cost $4/hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghw1968
50,Excellent,"I didn't realise that this was a museum too, so if you are going, get there earlier so you can fully appreciate it! You can learn about space, the galaxy, planets and asteroids, and finish off by looking through the huge telescope, which unfortunately was closed when we got there. However going up the looking pints you have a wonderful view of the city. You can also download the free app Sky View Lite , which helps you find the constellations and see for your own eyes the stars, which is magical! <3 loved it! wish we had more time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sephirothseviltwin
50,Fun Time,"We were on a family vacation (wife, two kids ages 11 and 10) from Florida. First advice: Take an Uber, trust me. You do NOT want to hike that hill up to the observatory. The Uber will drop you off and pick you up in front of the museum.Second advice: Come early. The place gets crowded, and at that point viewing the exhibits can be tough.We spent half a little over four hours here, and it was well worth it. The observatory has some excellent exhibits that actually caught our kids attention (a rare feat these days). It's not a large place, but it's thoughtfully done, and the outdoor views are AMAZING. This place should be on your agenda if you're visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seungl2015
50,Wonderful Place to Experience,"A beautiful location. The facility is great. A family of 4, we enjoyed the 30 minute planetarium movie, which was $7 per adult. The female narrator did the show live and was amazing. You also have a great view of the Hollywood sign on the hill. When we were there the parking lot near the building was full and cars needed to turn around. Luckily, we didn't drive, we were dropped off which allowed us to be left off by the building. Definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreywC5729YI
50,Must visit when you are in LA,"Visiting Griffith park and ubservatory can be fun during day or night .The movie scene from La La Land made this place for even more popular destination.It's fun to hike in the morning through park trail and get to the observatory or drive and park on the lot to enjoy LA city view at night.Also, inside of observatory has lots of things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmazingLucca7
30,Better at night,"We went at 11 am and parked up the hill at $8 an hour. We had a hard time finding a spot and had to walk a long distance to get to the observatory. When you get to the observatory, you can see the Hollywood sign and is great for photos. We watched a 30 minute show $7 per adult and it was ok. I believe it was called centered in the universe. The views of the city was nice but not all that great during the day. I couldn't go later in the evening so we missed out on the city view at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trev209
50,Serenity and Peace,"What’s more rewarding than to hike up the trails and end up at the Griffith Park Observatory? Iconic Los Angeles building buzzing with the curious faces of children and adults. Awestruck wonder at the view of the Los Angeles basin, nestled in nature. Simply fabulous. No trip to Los Angeles is complete with a visit, and once is never enough. Simply love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bldavis64
40,Griffith Learning Experience,Great place to learn and explore the heavens and its heavenly bodies if you are into that thing... but most people just go there to have their pictures taken with the hollywood background over the montainside....good luck using your cam perfecting background and foreground clarity....but aside from all these....this is really a great place to learn fact and unlearn fiction near the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravenclawph2000
40,Must See at least once.,Very cool stop. Family friendly. Stayed a short time then ate a local restaurant. Made for a great day with Family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephjmiller
40,Griffith Observatory ~Great View of LA,"A fantastic hiking area, view of the Hollywood sign, and fantastic scientific observatory. It can be hard to park here. I like to go for walks here, occasionally, earlyin the day, mid week, to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a1hanson
50,Like walking into the past,"The place is wonderful for photo opportunities, the grounds are amazing and the planetarium is quite the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2BradH2
20,To do,Amazing place. View of the Hollywood sign. And downtown. The view is really incredible. Crowded. Come as early as possible. Many hike options in the Griffith park. Fee Parking. They tow very refuel alley so don’t forget to pay! Must do in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clem90024
30,Don't know what all the hype is about,"There was traffic congestion on the way up and when we left. Finding parking was difficult and pricey - $8/hour. You have to decide how many hours you plan to stay and prepay for parking by the hour. It was extremely crowded inside. We couldn't buy tickets to the planetarium because we had a 3-year-old and the minimum age is 5. The views were okay, but we had similar views in other areas of LA. The areas inside weren't enough to keep us there for the 4 hours of prepaid parking so we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnsGirl87
40,Nice afternoon,It’s a fun and educational experience at the Griffith Observatory. It’s a nice spot to take visitors and get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBEM
40,Interesting place to see,I’m not really a science type of person but it was very interesting to go to Griffith Observation.Even to see the view from there and take photos is amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cswiston
50,Incredible,"Incredible place but expect it to be crowded. It's free to go to the Observatory, a few exhibits cost money but it's reasonable.The park is wonderful and huge. It great to just walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayleAV
50,Beautiful inside and out,"On a clear day, there is a beautiful view of the wide expanse of Los Angeles. Inside there is age-old pendulum demonstrating the Earth's rotation and multiple exhibits to create enthusiasm for new and older adventurers into skies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lemesq1947
50,To see the city,"I had a bucket list... that list consisted of all the places that I needed to visit in LA! I was immediately amazed how effortless & easy finding parking for this attraction was! Even with a large crowd... I did not have to wait in line, or anything! It was a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loridl2011
50,Great view of LA,"If you want to see LA in all its beauty, you better visit this place. Its always packed however so parking a bit difficult but it is worth it as part of your tour. Do not miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raytcha
40,A Part of Los Angeles history,Every tourist ought to make this one of their stops of interest. The iconic symbol of Los Angeles is in the movies and in the news all the time. On a clear day the views are incredible and the historical exhibits inside are incredible. This is LA at it's best. Try not to go on a weekend or holiday. then the parking and traffic are LA at its worst...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roblanz
40,Fun but crowded,I enjoyed the exhibits at the observatory. The area downstairs was my favorite. I liked listening to the docent talk about the different projects that were displayed. The lines for the main telescope were too long for us but they have other smaller but nice telescopes set up on both terraces with more manageable lines. There is a very nice view of L.A. from the roof or grounds of the observatory that make for some good pictures. We were there for sunset and it was pretty. You are also close to the Hollywood sign so you can get nice pictures of that as well. Be sure to check out the parking situation before you go. There are different lots with different distances to the observatory. You may have to walk a very long way uphill if you’re not careful. We took a rideshare and were dropped off close. It was a nice way to spend an evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennclack
30,Great views,"We caught an Uber to the Griffith Observatory from Beverley Hills, it was about a 45min ride. We went mid week, it was so busy!Didnt get to experience the trails around the park, but they looked good for a walk or run.The Observatory is interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leannew486
50,Great Hiking from the Observatory,"We enjoyed hiking from the Observatory. Note, however, this is not where the trail to the Hollywood sign begins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zfamilyvacations
50,Highly recommend!!,"You can spend as much or as little time as you like in this park like setting at the top of the hill. Nice view of the Hollywood sign and the city. Wonderful science and space museum inside, walk up the steps outside to the top for more amazing views. Clean restrooms inside. All is free unless you pay for a planetarium show. We recommend driving right past all the signs that say Parking Lot is Full, we did, and there were plenty of parking spots along the road and at the top. Otherwise it would have been a loooong uphill walk. Kiosks to pay for parking all along the road",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MACVirginia
40,A piece of history worth visiting,"Even though it was a cloudy night, it was a very pleasant visit. It was very interesting and educational to see the site where so much discovery of the universe was made.Traffic was tough, so patience is required. Free parking is available downhill and a bus ($1) takes you the rest of the way (only the very fit with lots of time walks up).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKTraveler2012
50,Must Do,"The panoramic views from the Observatory are spectacular, and on a good day, you can see the ocean. We self toured through the building, and then caught the short film in the planetarium. Word of advice- do this before hiking otherwise the show may induce sleep. Big that it was biting, on the contrary- the guy who voices it has one of those voices that just relaxes you and when it’s dark and your reclining, well, zzzzs are difficult to stop. We also walked some shorter trails to get s better pic of Hollywood sign. Great way to spend a few hours of all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd
50,Best view in LA,"I’m a local and love going up to the observatory at night. If you haven’t been, go see the planetarium show and then spend some time walking around the grounds and taking in the view. The outside east observation terrace offers the most incredible sweeping views of LA. Just being in the hills and above the city is a treat unto itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilltarinw
50,Bring a picnic and relax on the grass,"Ive gone here many times and have entertained my nephews for hours on end. We typically stop by a grocery store and get a few sandwiches to eat on the lawn before we make our treck in. They're happy walking through the observatory and looking over the city on the rooftop. If you can, I strongly recommend going on a weekday as its much calmer than the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soapypants
50,Great,My first time back in over 17 years and it was just as great as the first time. No need to pay for a walking tour when you can park a mile away and hike and nice easy trail through the woods. While it was hot the views were great and the observatory was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2service
40,Great Views and Science,"The observatory is a very popular destination, when we visited there were signs lower down telling us the observatory parking lot was full but as other vehicles were continuing to head up we followed. We were glad we did as there turned out to be plenty of parking close to the observatory as there was a constant flux of visitors.The views are worth a visit alone, but we also took time to take in the planetarium show which was a great experience and very informative. The show we saw went through the formation of the universe and the history of astronomy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WiseTreeOwl
50,Best view in LA,"First recommendation is to try to get there a few hours before sunset to be able to get a parking spot: the place gets more and more crowded approaching the sunset. If you are able to get a spot, you will be rewarded with a fabulous view: LA skyline in front of you and the Hollywood sign on your right. The view gets better when the sun goes down with the lights of the city turning on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoV2670
50,Amazing views!!,"We were in the area, so decided to visit Griffith Observatory. It was tough to find parking, and it is kind of pricey to park, but the observatory was really interesting and the views are amazing (city and the Hollywood sign). We saw the free exhibits and there is so much to take in! We would go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanteamtravel
40,Views views views,"Great views of the Hollywood hills!!! Can be difficult to see the actual Hollywood sign with any fog/smog, but still worth it! Parking can be very far so prepare to enjoy the views on the walk up!! Actual observatory was small but had great physics info and more great views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passportlove09
30,Great view.,Get here early if you want a parking spot close otherwise you could have quite a walk all uphill. It was very crowded when we got there. The inside displays were hard to read and get to because of the crowds. The out side was not a problem to walk around to the telescopes and see the views from the observatory. There were scientists available to talk with and ask questions. It would have been a better experience if it wasn't so crowded but still glad we came.(Christa),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjensen399
40,Kinda cool.,It is a little out of the way as you would expect. It is worth the visit as some of the stuff there is kinda cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewAus2085
50,The views are worth it,"Amazing views, this is a place to visit if you like those, it is free and enjoyable, there was a lot of people but that was ok with me, parking was not free for us cause the free parking was full",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvaTurner
50,Well worth a visit.,"My wife and I drove there from Santa Monica and were very lucky to get a free parking space at the bottom car park almost straight away. It was a steep climb up the hill to the observatory but the views you see and the wild life was just amazing. It's free to get in and it's very interesting to see all the items inside which can show you all the amazing information about the surrounding planets and the universe. It was to be fare very busy and crammred at times which isn't much fun, but you have to remember that it's free and a very popular place to visit. We still enjoyed our visit there even though it was particularly a long one due to the crowds and it was a very hot day too. Still it gets a thumbs up from us and you get to see the Hollywood sign in the distance aswell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanandkate6
20,Extremely busy,"Unfortunately, we did not even get to the Observatory as it was extremely overcrowded and there was no parking spaces for several kilometres from the Observatory and people were simply dropping cars in any places they could find along the road. So it would have taken a great hike up to get there. Considering we spent all day on feet we did not want to suffer any more. Better/bigger parking facilities with shuttle buses (even if moderately priced) would have transformed the experience completely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaximT5586
40,Amazing Views,Went there about 6:00 PM to catch the sunset at 8:00 PM. Parking here is crazy. There was a area for Free Parking. I highly recommend this spot and ride the shuttle up for .50 or $1.00. I did not and wish we would have. I ended up spending 16.00 to park for 2 hrs and still had a hike to get to the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145missyr
40,Busy Sunday afternoon,"We parked down the hill because the upper lot was full--they had signs out to that effect so that we didn't waste time driving up. There is a bus that will take you up, but we walked. The observatory was packed--it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Really liked the Depths of Space exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575mege
50,The Griffith observatory amazed me,"The Griffith observatory amazed me, there were so much to see and learn (inside). Take your time, and check out the whole thing. It is educational for both adults and children.We walk the Ferndell trail up in Griffith park, it was a great way to get to the Griffith observatory, however it got quite hot, so I would recommend to bring some water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillaorkide
50,So Fun!,"I have always wanted to visit the Griffith Observatory and it did not disappoint. We arrived 30 minutes before they opened and we are so glad we did! The parking was very limited and by the time we left it was hot and crowded!!! One of the fun surprises that we discovered was the rotation of the planets engraved in the concrete in front of the Observatory. It’s amazing to see the perspective of the distances of the planets in our solar system. Also, we saw the Water show in the Planetarium and loved the live commentator. She was factual, fun for kids and did not taint the science with her opinion. She was a highlight!!!Also, there seems to be an amazing hike up to the Griffith Observatory and we will take it next time! Amazing day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy_Travels_CA
30,Interesting,"Worth a look, but there seems to be a lot of people there too!Take time looking at the place and it might be of more interest,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CazzaCazza
50,A must see when you visit LA,Great view of the city and Hollywood sign. Took a Uber from downtown and was able to get a ride back from the top. Cell coverage is a little spotty on top but go over to right near free Wifi outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twinkie09

50,The Only Stars You Need in Hollywood,"If you're visiting Hollywood you have to go here. The architecture of the building is spellbinding. And although you can't really see the sky (light pollution and smog in LA) the historical elements of the building are so beautiful, it feels more like a museum than an observatory. Its also super romantic if you are planning on an adventure with a special someone. Hollywood has its highs and lows, these are the stars i'd make time for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateradartist
30,Great views.,Parking is nightmarish. Views are good. If your kids like science it’s great. If not boring. It’s hard to see the Hollywood sign in the evening with the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColbyHannah
40,Great views of L.A. and the Hollywood sign.,We attended on a Monday and the observatory was closed. We knew this going in but wanted to see the view at sun set which we were told was great. It did not disappoint. The L.A. lights at night were amazing. It also has a really good view of the Hollywood sign so if that is on your lis then you can knock out 2 things at once. The drive up was scenic as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferdP938AH
50,One of the most energetic and beautiful places on earth,Definitely must see. Views are breathtaking. Mountains make you fall in love. Very romantic. Can look around forever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizkaf2017
50,INCREDIBLE view,"Walked up the mountain to Griffith Observatory. Paying for parking at the top wasn't on our list, and it was a small parking lot anyway. There is free parking at the bottom with the offer of a shuttle up there (not sure if it costs $). Being the adventurous people we are, we took a walking path up into the mountain to get to the top. It was super tiring, but well worth it. There is a sidewalk many people walk on from the lower level parking lots for the less adventurous types. The view at the top was awesome , though that is dependent on the L.A weather. We watched the sunset over the Hollywood sign. The Observatory is 100% free and open until 10 p.m. It's a space museum inside with lots of cool info about planets, moons, and the solar system. There is a huge telescope on the roof open freely to the public, but there was a huge line that we didn't want to wait in. It does get chilly up there as the sun goes down, so pack long sleeves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200brianq
50,Educational and a great spot for views with summer breeze,"Lots of interesting things to see and experience inside the observatory, quite interactive, good for families with kids or inquisitive minds of any age. And of course the views on a clear day are superb. Take a wide angle and long lenses if you want interesting photos, and plan your time around sun angle etc. And then sit down on the lawn and have a sandwich or something. Public transport DASH is easier than trying to find parking on busy tourist days (cash).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psufcak
50,Great views,Had great views of L.A and the Hollywood sign. Was a lovely sunny day lots to see and do. Come ealry as the crowds get very big. Take the Dash bus up for 50 cents.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasha_china
30,Good but too crowded,"The Los Angeles weather turned sunny this Saturday morning after a couple of cloudy days. We decided to head up to the Griffith Observatory for a quick look around. And, as it turned out, so did thousands of others! We had to park miles away and walk up which was not bad in itself but once we got there we could hardly move around the science exhibits. This a good place to visit but maybe best left for a weekday morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcmooreiii
50,Worth it for the views,"Took the Dash bus from Greek theatre (free parking on non-performance days) up to the Observatory. The visit is well worth the effort just for the views of greater LA, Hollywood and around. Great photo opportunities. The Observatory had plenty of exhibits and lots of good information. Some of it is a little too scientific and overall it’s difficult to take in much flow to it due to the huge crowds inside the building. Classic landmark that has to be visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig1961_01
50,Amazing place for a hike and view!,"I’m perhaps the only person in town who actually comes here for the astronomy exhibits instead of just for the view of DTLA. I really recommend taking some time to explore the amazing exhibits and information in the Griffith observatory. There’s also an astronomy show that you can watch every 30 minutes or so, quite expensive, but it’s still nice. There’s also a nice bookstore in the observatory with space themed merchandise. And then, of course, you have the view :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natesmith1016
30,Be prepared to hike up the hill AND pay $8/hour parking,"Good to visit once, but that is enough. Way too crowded during summer, holidays and weekends. Observatory is only open in eve for obvious reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFBayLuv2trvl
30,Not as much fun as several years ago.,"We visited this same place several years ago ( and in the fall), and had a pleasant time. This time, it was during the summer, and what a zoo. Had to park at least 1/2 mile away and walk up hill. I will not come again during the summer. It just isn’t worth the hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766donalds
40,Great views of LA,This is definately a worthwhile activity whilst in Hollywood. We did a walk towards the Hollywood sign and then had lunch at the Observatory. We had a quick look through and enjoyed the views. I was shocked at the smog issue but that is LA at its finest!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673ritam

50,Nice view of the city,"We visited the Observatory today, after a hike from the Hollywood sign view-point.It offers a great view of the city of LA And the Hollywood sign from up there.You do not need a car to visit the place - there is a DASH route that takes you all the way to the Observatory and brings you back. The dash costs $0,50 per direction.Car parking costs $8,00 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FromBR
50,Great Hiking,The observatory is free and so are the hiking trails all around it. The views of Los Angeles are excellent and the breeze was great too. Loved my time there - highly recommend but don't go just for the observatory - be prepared to hike!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYC86
50,Do the walk,"What a stunning view and interesting observatory. I would definitely suggesting walking it as parking very busy- it’s just over a mile on the road or 0.8 miles on the hiking route- note this is steep in places but not overly challenging, pack water if hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179lucyb
50,Great views and worth a visit,Went on a private tour with 7 of us. Great views although was a little hazy still at 12pm could see Hollywood sign and great looking walking trails... interesting place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholer377
50,"Great, free activity in LA","My brother took me here while I was visiting LA. It's a lovely, well-kept place with beautiful views of the entire city. Admission to the building is free, which, on a hot day like we had was much appreciated when it came to getting out of the sun. Pro tip: The sign at the bottom of the road said there was no parking up top, despite there being lots. I visited while pregnant, so I was relieved to discover this as there was no way I could have walked up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifergU2474SH
40,Afternoon visit,Very interesting place to learn more about astronomy and stars. Children-friendly. Good view on the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4050CEsarahf
50,Great spot,"One of the best spot in Los Angeles to view. Amazing spectacle, great greenery, fab hills with lots of very expensive house propably some notable actor or VIP!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4808FLcarlog
50,Stunning views,Well worth the visit to the observatory to see the views even in 30 degree heat! They have shows inside but we didn’t get a chance as hiked up to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pollyscrypt
50,Best part of our LA visit,"Our whole family loved the hike up to the observatory (burned the calories from In 'n Out Burger) to watch the sunset. Great photo opp of the Hollywood sign. The science museum had great interactive exhibits and, most of all, it was free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845steph
50,Excellent View,Love this Science Museum. Great Hollywood sign view. Lot of people in the museum. Go early in the morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheyssa
50,A must while in LA!,"Aside from the obvious “let me look at the telescope a d see the moon” experience, the Observatory is just a great place to spend 3-4 hours.Park at the free Greek Theatre lot and walk up - may be 10-15 minute walk, depending on pace.Lots to do here - read and learn about astronomy and geology, see the famous Tesla invention live, catch a show or two at the planetarium. Stay up and gaze at the stars, if the sky is clear. Highly recommend that with a free star gazing app, as it’s much more fun that way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelfromOhio
50,Amazing view,"The observatory is located at uphill and this privileged site gave us amazing views of LA. Besides, it is a nice place for those curious about astrology and this kind of stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777robsons
50,Lovely observatory in a beautiful park,"Visiting Griffith Observatory is something of a no-brainer if you're on holiday in Los Angeles. It's a beautiful Art Deco masterpiece of a building and the museum aspect is very nice. It's situated in a wonderful park, and it overlooks much of Los Angeles, with views (on a clear day) of Downtown LA, Century City, Palos Verdes in the distance, and the Hollywood sign. It also ties in to LA's cinematic history as several famous movies have been shot here. As a result, it tends to get pretty crowded, and parking at the top right by the Observatory can be tough. My advice: park by the Greek Theatre and take the free shuttle bus up to the observatory. If you have time & energy you can go one of dozens of lovely hikes through Griffith Park from there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1737YZjohnh
50,Amazing views!,"The Griffith Observatory is great! I love the free exhibits and the city views are just incredible. Absolutely worth a visit.We visited twice during our trip (once in the afternoon and once at night), and did not have any issues parking near the building on either occasion. Be aware that parking can be tricky, though. Free parking is available near the Greek Theater if you are willing/able to walk a mile to reach the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margarettravels1
50,VERY INTERESTING PLACE,"This is a very interesting place. Plenty of things to see and learn more about astronomy if you are an amateur and like the subject. It has a wonderful view of L.A. and surroundings areas. You can spend hours just doing that. Before we go I saw many reviews warning about the parking problem, but sincerely, unless you want to park right in front of the building, there is no problem at all, always there is somebody leaving the place. After visiting the observatory, you can find good souvenirs at the shop inside the building, and after that, you can rest and enjoy the view while eating and drinking something on the patio of the well-equipped buffet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luiggi_Caselli
50,Sunset at the top of the hill,"We saw this observatory in several movies - and had the opportunity to visit. What a view! The skyline at sunset was remarkable. Inside the observatory, there are displays, telescopes, perpetual motion pendulum, all very interesting science based but fun. I recommend it highly for its many attributes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyBCooper
40,Great trip despite Almost stranded,"I took my son to the observatory for his spring break. It’s a beautiful and educational place. I think everyone should visit. The views of LA are breathtaking. But make sure you eat before you go. The food options were awful. Also make sure you take cash and have transportation figured out ahead of time. The metro pass we got (as suggested on the website) wasn’t accepted by the shuttle bus that day, I didn’t have cash and there are no ATM’s and there was no reception on my phone to call an Uber. We had to walk halfway down the mountain to get reception to call a ride. The customer service staff were less than helpful. But the exhibit staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. My son loved all of the exhibits and there were some things we didn’t get to do (because I was figuring out the transportation situation). I’ll probably take him back but drive and take cash next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misscanley
40,Worth a visit,"we were part of a tour group - gets very crowded, but worth a visit to be able to look across the skyline",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angiewW7051FP
50,Go early and enjoy the view,"Great spot to hike to the best view of the Hollywood sign and to Mt Hollywood for a great view of LA. Get there before 10 for free parking and good temps. After your hike, start your paid parking and check out the observatory. Even if it’s not open yet you can usually walk all the way around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spikethecat68
40,CA Trip,"What a beautiful observatory location. So beautiful that you have to visit to see it for yourself. The view is just stunning and if you have not had a chance to view the Hollywood sign up closer, you will definitely have a chance to view it here (again, not as close but with good zooming, you’ll get it in your pictures). Again, a must go location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnMTripReview
50,Great Views,Visited the observatory and found it full of interesting facts. The views outside of the Hollywood sign and the hills were fantastic. A well kept and well presented place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertM950
40,Something for everyone!,"Took an Uber to the Observatory. Walked around the outside and took the mandatory photos, including the Hollywood sign. Then went inside and put the brain to work with some excellent astronomical exhibits. Overall, a very good afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bst0002
50,Star gazing,A great place to visit with lots of hands on experience to see and do the views our to die for .A must see is the star gazing talk in side the dome .Its a bit of a hike to get there but well worth it in the end,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404christiner404

50,Great View of LA,"Awesome views, free viewing from telescope of the moon and other planets. Clean, well lit, organized and packed with people on a Tuesday evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcdeligirl
40,Interesting educational place to be.,The Griffith Observatory provides a great view on Hollywood and LA. It is an interesting centre for gaining knowledge and insights on the positioning of earth in space. Professional staff members are available to share their knowledge and inspire people to increase their knowledge in space research.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
50,See the other stars in Hollywood,"Familiar to fans of ""Rebel Without a Cause"", the park includes a bust monument to James Dean. We didn't get to experience much of the actual observatory functions because of time demands. Still, the photos of the city and the Hollywood sign practically make the trek worth it. Be warned, though; parking is at a premium, and if you don't make it early enough to be in the actual observatory lot, parking along the road leading up the hill will guarantee a STEEP hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyMartin
50,Great infotainment. Superb theatre .And great views of the city,"We had a superb half day - spent in the lap of science and astronomy. The exhibits are wonderful - the planetarium shows were brilliant. The LA city views are stupendous, specially the sunset, as it lights up the downtown LA skyscrapers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hornbill07
40,LA Icon that you have to visit.,The is another location with awesome views of L.A. be prepared to do a lot of walking. The Observatory itself is not that large but there are some cool exhibits. Good way to spend a Thursday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noeplaya1

40,Awesome LA landmark,"I have been visiting since the 50s. Coming back 30 years after moving from L.A. was “moving”. The views are great, “on a clear day”. The exhibits fascinating. Bring your family and share in space and time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMasonNashville
50,Amazing place,It an amazing place to visit. We visited here with kids and they loved it. Displays are very nice. It is a very good informative place. You can get a nice view of Hollywood sign from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaithiliSave
50,Amazing vista,Wonderful views across the whole of the City and of course the view of the Hollywood sign. It is very hot up there so take water and put on the sun block. We got free parking until 1 am and the observatory is closed on Mondays!But still worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nenners56
50,See the planets and stars,Known world wide the Los Angeles observatory at Griffith Park is a fun and informative day trip. There are interesting exhibits for young and old with many interactive hands on things to touch and see. This telescope is one of the most powerful in this hemisphere. There is a planetarium show not to be missed. A great day for family and friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrk9789
40,Great spot,"This is a really great spot. The drive up to the observatory is fun along a steep and winding road. Get there early in the morning and avoid weekends as parking is limited and you may end having to park on the hill. It’s a steep walk up. Also, this is probably the best place to have that tourist photo with the ‘Hollywood’ sign in background.The observatory itself is fascinating and well work a few hours tour round. There is a cafe there for food too. Lastly, try and find a clear day ( well as clear as you can in LA) as this is located in Hollywood and you can look down on the LA city. It’s likely to be hazy or smoggy but you will make it out. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craderm1961
50,Amazing views over LA,"Stunning views from the viewing deck. This is a must see attraction if you are visiting LA. Would recommend visiting around sunset to get the both the sunset and night views.We took a 360 video of our visit. It doesn't fully capture how amazing the view is compared to in person, but hopefully it can give you a preview.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360AdventureTours
50,About the galaxy,"A great place to see and understand more about the galaxy, the planets and meteorites.On a side note, there is limited connection to the internet. Hence, you can enjoy the place without disruption. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaselynnnn
50,Must See if in LA,This is one of the must sees in LA. The observatory is interesting and the views are wonderful. The views are also great at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq

40,Worth a short visit even for those not interested in the science,The views from this place are amazing. Be sure to go early as weekends this place seems to be very busy. Make sure you go downstairs also. We were on a tour otherwise I wish we Copenhagen enjoyed the planetarium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qv09vvp
50,Might be the best observatory I've ever been!!!,"Ohh, the views of most of LA, the Hollywood Sign, Beverly Hills....were just amazing!!!We were lucky we found parki g all the way to the top since we saw hundreds of cars parked along the road all the way up as well as on the way down!!!On the outside the planetarium was beautiful and well kept...on the inside every exhibit was very informative and creatively designed to explain the wonders of our universe.Awesome experience!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueShoesAdventures
50,Observe the views,Absolutely amazing views. Worth the trip. Check out the viewing deck on top. All free except the planetarium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcA744
50,5 stars for the view alone,"This is a must see for tourists in LA. If you're interested in astrology, inside the Griffith is a haven of fascinating information. If not (like me), just enjoy the stunning view of both the vibrant city and of the famous Hollywood sign.Hint: There's a new Dash bus from Vermont and Sunset that takes you up the hill to the Observatory and brings you down too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V5689PZroberts
50,Worth it for the view alone!,This is a must see in LA. Get there early or late in day to make parking easier. Planetarium show is a must see with live storyteller.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTaxidia
50,Great hike,"You can park either at the Observatory or at the bottom of the hill on the street,or anywhere in between. If you have more time, at least one and a half hours I would suggest you park at the bottom and hike all the way up. They are also building what looks to be a decent sized children's park, with playground equipment. I think that is great for kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckahk1961
50,Amazing,"The place is awesome. Good for any age. The view is beautiful from sunrise to sunset. Although parking is not free anymore but affordable.You can also do the following:Hiking,strolling,picnicor just site seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annc185

50,Definitely need to visit when in LA,"The views are awesome at this place. The building is also very pretty. You can do some hiking around there or just drive up & park, but get there early before the parking fills up. You can also go at night & get good night views of the city. You can see the city & the Hollywood sign pretty well. You can go pretty much anytime to check out the views, it doesn't just have to be when the building is open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekr308
50,Gem of LA,"This Historic Observatory has so many layers that many people only visit the top Floor! However, if you go downstairs there is not only another museum taking you through space (great for kids) there is also a lovely lunch cafeteria/outdoor seating. If you are wanting to get more of an outdoor experience, then try parking at the bottom of Griffith Park and hiking up the back end (25min-30min hike) of the Observatory, it not only beats the traffic, but you get the scenic view of LA! Oh and don't forget to get tickets to the amazing 3D show! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/actaylor82
40,Beautiful views!,We went as a family and it had beautiful views. Wonderful new areas. Difficult to park (long wait!). Worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dang9973
50,Great views during sunset,"Great views all around. First view is The Hollywood sign, then you will probably encounter a few telescopes were you can view a planet or moon (for free!), then you can sit on the lawn and watch the sun set. Once it sets you can step in and explore all about the cosmos (again for free). When you reach the outside terraces you will get a spectacular view of downtown.I easily found staff in every place I went to guide me to restrooms and cafe area.IF LOT IS FULL OVER THE HILL NEXT TO OBSERVATORY, YOU WILL NEED TO PARK BELOW THE HILL AND CATCH A BUS -- DONT FORGET TO HAVE CHANGE FOR THE RIDE. ITS NOT A FREE SHUTTLE!!! WE WERE 4 AND GOT LUCKY PEOPLE SPARED SOME CHANGE ON THE WAY UP. ON THE WAY DOWN WE WEREN'T SO LUCKY AND WE WALKED ALL THE WAY DOWN ( Some areas we had to walk on the street because there are no side walks)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josaiahjan

50,"Free admission, Pay to park close to the Observatory",What an unexpected gem! Beautiful facility with amazing views.Admission is free. Additional charge for live programs.Parking was $8 an hour for parking near the Observatory and on Western Canyon Road . There are parking machine/meters where you can pay in advance by the hour with a credit card. A ticket prints out that you place in your windshield.

Renovated a few years ago and with free entrance (some shows and presentations have a fee), Many interpretive displays with staff to direct and explain. On-site parking during busy times like weekends and holidays is impossible except for handicap placard vehicles, and parking down the hill has a shuttle service to take you up to the building.

50,Something for the Whole Family,"Aside from having one of the best panoramic views of Los Angeles, the observatory is L.A.'s foremost example of Art Deco architecture. Just walking into the building brings you into the past. The exhibits are fascinating and the observatory show keeps getting better with each passing year. We brought our grandchildren, ages 4 to 8, and they all enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139herbk

40,"A ""must"" to visit for Los Angelenos and their out of state guests","I have lived in the LA area my whole life and never tire going up to the Griffith Observatory since I was little. The real thrill was after their major remodel. There is so much to see there for all interests: Science, history, city views, nature walks, and movie set history. Make sure you take a picnic if visiting in the daytime. If going at night, buy tickets to their shows and look through the telescopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamblingBusiness
40,A must see but take a ride share,"The Griffith Observatory is a classic historical location with great views of the city. But driving up there and parking is nearly impossible. They have small buses that run frequently but I suggest a ride share hire instead. Keep in mind you want to avoid the place in the morning during school season because of student field trips and you want to avoid it on any weekend. It's just too packed with people to enjoy. Also, cell coverage there can be spotty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monkman2226
50,GREAT VIEWS OF LA FROM THE OBSERVATORY,I love hiking up to Griffith Observatory and enjoying the stunning views amongst the greek like architecture.

Great tourist location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelapU4228LH
50,Beautiful,"It is a public observatory, very pretty itself, and offering stunning views over LA. You can see the Hollywood sign on the side of the hill.

Admission is free, and you can drive directly to the Observatory and park in its lots and roads. Go see Tesla coil inside - pretty spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MildaLeo
50,I love this place!,"I tend to visit the observatory when I know it won't be too crowded. Parking can be a nightmare otherwise. It's a perfect view of L.A. after the rain or at sunset. You have to pay attention to details, like the James Dean statue or the sun clock dial. Take your time and explore, look everywhere, enjoy the view, catch a show in the planetarium, visit the telescopes and stop at every.single.display- it's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TereInTheWorld

50,Views are spectacular!,"We saw this while taking a tour during the day time. I hear it's beautiful at night. So many cool things to see inside like the phases or the moon and the sun. You can see the Hollywood sign. We were on a tour bus, but on the way up I saw people that had to park and walk up the winding mountain and it was $8 an hour to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liondalou
40,"Nice views, interesting, and informative","My family and I visited on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. It was, unfortunately, an overcast, cold day but since the Observatory was not open on Memorial Day we had to visit on Sunday. There were many exhibits that were hands-on and lots of people working there to help explain the various exhibits. It was very crowded that day but I assume it always is. The views, overlooking Los Angeles were nice but it was not a great day weather-wise. You could sit outside and have lunch and enjoy the views! It would have been much better on a nice day but that Sunday was the only day that we could go.There is no admission charge but there is a charge to park the car.I am handicapped and use an electric scooter when traveling. The Observatory is fully accessible and the parking lot has handicapped parking spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueAx57
50,A neat place overlooking the city,"Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign. The Observatory is beautifully built, easy to navigate, and very interesting if you're fascinated by the cosmos. Live shows, telescope for viewing, and cool trails all around. A great family outing or to visit solo. Lots to take in. Length of time spent there depends on how busy it is, but if you take your time, it could be a good 2-3 hour visit, if you spend some time outside taking in the landscape.Parking can be a pain, so get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JourneyIM
40,Astronomical gem,"Honestly, we went to the observatory to view the Hollywood sign, but we enjoyed the site. Our boys love astronomy and Greek mythology and there’s an amazing ceiling mural depicting the latter. The observatory is free, which is a definite plus, but it is extremely crowded due to people like us who go there to see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeggerPJs
50,Great views across the city,We came up here to enjoy the sunset across LA. The observatory itself was closed as it was a Monday. This was a shame given it was the memorial day holiday and there were a lot of people there so maybe they could have made an exception.The views and the sunset over the Hollywood sign were excellent. There were a lot of people up there but there is plenty of space for everybody to get their picture or view of the sign or the magnificent views across the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marklG5856VA
50,Really interesting visit and a great walk up the hill,"Firstly, wear a hat and meet at the cafe at the start of the hill. This is a great place for lunch ahead of your walk and visit.Wear stout shoes and take some water, as you will probably need it.After lunch, start the walk up the hill. It will probably take you the best part of half an hour and it can be quite arduous. Taking a hat is really important as the sun can be strong. . The views are amazing and eventually you will reach the Observatory. There are some really interesting exhibits such as the demonstration why the seasons exist, as a consequence of the Earth’s rotation brings slightly off true but the best parts are the live images of the sun.Best of all, it is free of charge and you will continue to work off your lunch with the walk back to your car.Definitely worth a visit and a great way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryB147
50,Awesome all-round place to visit,"It's clear now why this is rated so high as a thing to do in LA. Great views (cityscape, Hollywood hills & sign), beautiful architecture, and interesting science displays. The planet exhibit had interactive displays and excellent descriptions of our solar system. Rooftop we went into an observatory and learned about the telescopes and had a demo of how the observatory rotates. We heard the shows in the planetarium were excellent but decided against waiting in line, so that's something we'll have to do another time. Try to go when it's clear, but it's was a bit overcast and lightly raining when we were there and still worthwhile.It was a busy Saturday evening when we visited. We took an Uber from Hollywood Blvd which dropped us off right in front of the observatory and saved us parking below the hill and hiking up to the observatory. For our return to DTLA the ""Dash"" bus service was a great option which connected right in front of the entrance to the Vermont/Sunset Red Line and got us very quickly downtown.Loved going as a couple but would come back with the kids also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFamFun
40,"Best views in LA, good for science and space enthusiasts","Views on all sides are amazing. Look down at downtown LA, out to Santa Monica and the mountains and up to the Hollywood sign. Fantastic views at night.The interior is interesting but unless you are interested in space you may not find any of the exhibits or information that enjoyable.The people with telescopes on the lawn at night were only looking at stars not planets which is pretty boring to be honest as they look just like they do with the naked eye.Would go again but only for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer819390

50,Must visit at least once,Beautiful spot. You may have a bit of a walk depending on how busy it is but it’s beautiful there and a great view of the sign. We enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adyn0511
40,Very Cool Place to check out,Checked it out after seeing it on a sightseeing bus. Very cool experience. Wish we could have spent more time there. The views was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertdinallo
50,Take the bus,"I could have gotten a bus bus I figured I would be driving nearby later in the trip so I’d go then. Unfortunately, the top car park was full so I parked at the Greek Theatre. Poor signage from there but easy to find the observatory because you have to walk up the busy road - I really thought a park like this would have better paths. The observatory is worth it though, a gorgeous building with some of the best views in L.A. and a good exhibit about astronomy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
30,Hassle to get there but views are worth it.,"Parking, either at the top or in a lot below (then you need to take a bus 50 cents reg or 25 seniors) is a true mess. Empty lots were blocked for no reason. The bus schedule was off by more than an hour. We ended up driving around the entire loop, then lots that had just been closed were opened up. Took bus up. Spent more time in transit than at the actual observatory! Got some great photos. I am sure the actual shows are cool to see, but with such a parking/driving fiasco, not sure I would take the time to get there if on a tight schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UAprofessor
50,On top of LA,"Go straight to Griffith and see HOLLYWOOD sign, sprawling Los Angeles underneath and clear blue skies overhead. Mesmerising and panoramic views. Visited on 20th May 2019 with a group of 27 people including children.Ideal location for photography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PPadvisor
50,So much more than we were expecting,"A fantastic place to visit. Make sure you go inside and see all the exhibits, some of them are a little tricky to find down some winding corridors, but they are excellent, very interactive and informative. There was a member of staff there with a telescope so we could see Jupiter. Main tip: get there early! We took the shuttle bus (which is excellent value for money), but he struggled to get through to the top because of all the cars. I'd say if you arrive any time close to sunset then parking is a no-go. The telescope is well worth queuing to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pathfinder627418
40,A must in Los Angeles,"Beautiful grounds and an even better view from the top.Can drive/Uber or for the adventurous type, hike.I didn't stay long - just enough to walk around, take in the views and take a few pictures. Lots of room, could spend hours all day - maybe a picnic ect. Definitely worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyW3
40,Free and great views,"Plenty to see if you don't want to pay, given the popularity you may end up waiting longer to park than explore though.Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnHCrewe

40,Lovely visit,"Had a good time here, the fact that its free is even better, theres a small cafe, and a large lawn area to have a simple picnic if you wish as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990jennifers
50,Amazing place,"A must see when visiting LA.Lots to see and do, with loads of interesting information.I came late in the evening (due to poor transport links) so only had an hour to dash around. I also missed the talks and presentations that go on.Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fibarn
40,Awesome sights,"We had so much fun checking this place out. So much to see, Hollywood sign , overview of downtown la , and the observatory. Definitely a place to stop when your in California. Wear comfortable shoes, depending on the day you may have a hike from where you park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Showchoirdad
50,It is free.,Great place to go on a sunny day. Took the Metro Dash bus so didn't have to worry about PARKING. Pro tip: check the schedule of the Tesla coil demo as soon as you arrive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostinTransit10
50,Great visit,"Educational and interesting visit, came for the Landmark picture and came out with a lot more. I specially recommend the show",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriqueg974
10,Now basically a ripoff,Tried to go to Griffith Observatory and it has changed for the MUCH WORSE! I went a few years ago and it used to be free to park. Now parking is $8 an hour and that includes parking down one of the hills like 1 mile away! Thanks but not thanks on being ripped off and gouged! Not only is it now much more crowded than it used to be but it costs you an arm and a leg just to park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasbR6194LQ
50,Fabulous spot to visit and great view from the hill top,"The Griffith Observatory location is fantastic. Such a lovely park and building and easy to get to by public bus, car or ride share. We caught ride share to get there and then the 50c public bus back to the city area. So easy. Loved the interior and interesting information inside. Worth a visit. The view from the hill was fantastic looking all over LA and across to the Hollywood sign nearby too. There is a caffe there also if you need a snack or drink. Great spot. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinnaCraig
50,Awesome experience,Even if you don't like astronomy this is a great place to visit. The drive and down the mountain is awesome. You can also hike it. Great views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFloFlyer
50,Great free activity,"Amazing views, great if you are looking for a something to do for free. You can even get a coffee and something to eat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessjessm
50,Great,"It was brilliant getting a chance to visit this grand old lady . The people of Los Angeles are blessef to have the use of this facility and the massive grounds , unfortunately I was on restricted time as on a tour bus but I dashed around it and had a few minutes to get some tat from the gift shop .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littledawnski
50,Unique and educative place,Starting from the amazing view to the entire city and ending with Mendeleev table in elements this place is a must visit in Los Angeles. Definitely recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sofie_sofie2000
40,Views wowsa!,Very quick stop yo take in the city view and skyline. Also Hollywood in the far distance. Definietly pack your zoom lense if this is only stop for sign photo opportunity!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimem408
40,More to see than I expected,"I'm a space nut, love everything about it and am an avid stargazer and heavily into the science too. I hadn't, however, expected to get my geek fix on this trip as my friend and I found the observatory by chance - we were looking for the Hollywood sign! Rarely do you get such good surprises, especially as the sign itself was a little underwhelming (what was I expecting from a large sign?!)We only put an hour into the parking meter which, in hindsight, was about 25% of the time I'd have needed to fully absorb what the place had to offer. Very accessible exhibits for people with less understanding of space, but alongside staff with detailed knowledge and plenty of extra depth to uncover if you know what you're looking for.We didn't have time to see the show, which was a shame- but I only have myself to blame for that.Well worth half a day of your time when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSully80
50,Great afternoon experience,Decided to take a day trip to visit the Observatory. It was really worth the time and effort. Adequate parking and the displays are very interesting.Allow your self about 1-2 hours to view almost everything.My children really enjoyed the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GARYW478
50,Best views in L.A.,"The balcony has spectacular views of downtown L.A. and the car park has a great view of the Hollywood sign if you don't have time to visit it separately. It was a hugely popular destination when I visited in February so I can imagine it gets very busy in the height of summer. As well as this there is plenty inside of the observatory to look, there is plenty of information to learn and keeps kids entertained for a number of hours. Probs avoid if you are a flat earther. In my opinion is a must visit in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattt379
50,Beautiful view,"Great view of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. The observatory was closed, which they said it is on Monday’s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishb771
50,Wonderful Museum,"A great place to visit. Renovations cost $93,000,000, which is also the number of miles from the Earth to the Sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seahawk200
50,A MUST,"""On a clear day you can see forever!""Our grand kids always love to visit the Observatory andon a clear day, which is most often, the vistas are spectacular.Be advised, parking may be a problem.The visuals are well presented and interesting.A real LA landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShiHu
50,First Visit,"A beautiful place to visit. I’m so happy that I did. The views are amazing. It’s quite a drive to get to it, but it is AMAZING!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsMorris15
50,Great experience,This is a mighty place. It has been filmed in so many movies that being there for the first time it's like magic. Inside there are tons of things to see and experience for adults and children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vf71
50,Amazing place with outstanding views and a great planetarium.,"Totally recommend a visit here when you’re in LA. Get tickets to the ‘Centred in the Universe’ show, what an amazing experience watching the universe unfold overhead in comfortable layback seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margnisbet23
50,The Sky Above and the World at Your Feet,"The Griffith Observatory has wonderful displays, is very educational, fascinates the mind--and the setting is a beautiful view of the LA Basin, right down to the ocean. Don't miss it and take the kids! It will be had to decide who enjoys it more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless730216
50,Well worth a visit,This was a great morning out. The views are fantastic. It was a little busy but still enjoyable. There is free parking at the bottom of the hill and you can take a bus to the top for a dollar each. If you are feeling adventurous you can walk up which takes about 25 mins (with children).We walked up and took the bus back down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huggybearversion1
50,Suggestive,Very suggestive place! Here you can dream with open eyes and understanding we are almost nothing. Very professional staff can help you for an amazing experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686smithp
40,Great Place to see L.A and the Hollywood sign,"Great place to escape from downtown L.A. but don't expect to be alone! The Griffith Observatory combines a spectacular view over L.A. and the Hollywood sign with the option to look through telescopes, explore exhibits and to enjoy the Samuel Oschin Planetarium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontyStoller
50,A sight to be seen ...is the view from Griffith Observatory!,"Before reading this review, you must watch the 4minute YouTube clip ""La La Land - Planetarium scene"" and then you may not even need to read my glowing review on the Griffith Observatory as the stunning movie footage shot here at the Griffith Observatory will sweep you away and slam dunk this onto your LA trip list!WOW! This landmark was a standout on our 4-day trip LA trip. We caught the Dash Bus from the subway station nearest to the GO (Griffith Observatory) and the trip from door to door was $1 each, one way - no parking hassles! When you alight from the bus at GO you feel literally on top of the world! You're a very high and commanding landmark point in LA, and it is laid out like a colourful quilt before you..stretching as far as the eye can see. Our photos below give you an idea of that. We were so lucky, it was a clear day in LA, so the city sparkled!Once we had ohh!'d and ahhh'd from the various outdoor viewing platforms of the GO, we moved inside and enjoyed talks on the pendulum which was fascinating, strolled along through the stunning interior to take in the many and varied indoor displays. We caught the $1 bus back down the hill to the subway and continued on to our dinner venue. The public transport was outstanding and made the visit carefree and easy. It was very chilly in January - a coat is a must to enjoy the outdoor areas of the GO.As I mentioned, the movie La La Land filmed famous scenes here and it was really magical to be standing all the same places. It was sensory overload in the greatest way.. we will remember our visit there, always. Don't miss this off your LA list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquiSydney
50,Nearest to the stars,"This place is amazing, great for kids and adults alike and it’s free, you only pay for the shows and at $7 each for adults its a cheap day out, $12 in an Uber from the Chinese theatre or a very long walk up hill trails, may be good for the very fit and active. Good cafeteria, very well priced and a very good gift store, get the NASA baseball T-shirt, the planetarium has multiple live shows, I went to see the “water is life” show and it’s worth the journey in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nathanearl
10,Appalling parking arrangements,Drove up to the observatory on Tuesday 4pm. Having driven all the way to the top for the paid parking we were told there was no room and so had to drive all the way down again.it was traffic chaos. The traffic wardens should be at the bottom of the hill or leave a sign to indicate no room. Totally disorganised disinterested amateurs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988rich
50,Good viewing spot for LA,Parking is impossible at the top at Griffith Observatory. They opened up some lots at the bottom of the hill and it was an easy stroll to the top. Shuttle comes infrequent and always full as it circles around Glendale area. It’s best just walk up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GintamaZ
40,Fantastic View,"This place was amazing, very interesting, and the view over LA is just amazing. You can take a long walk around the park and enjoy a little picnic as we did.I think we would be back again for another little picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandPaOnTheTour
50,Science made easy. Must visit place in Los Angeles,"Food for mind and soul. A beautiful place, superb location. Good for all ages. Park your car below and take a shuttle to up. They just charge 50 cents one way. When you reach do visit every level. Basement, first floor etc. Need minimum 1 to 2 hours to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drpragneshmv
50,One of the coolest places we visited in LA!,"Going to this observatory was beyond my wildest dreams! The entire space is amazing - the views from the locale can't be beat. The access to hiking and walking trails was awesome! Seeing the TESLA coil operate was so nifty! The artifacts and educational exhibits were interesting. IT's free (except for the parking fee of $10/hour). We went in the evening, but didn't stay to see the lights, which I would do if returned. AWESOME!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987mollyl
50,"Great Place,",But very crowded. Id like to visit when there are less people so that enjoying the exhibits would be possible.I truly enjoyed the views and the thought that James Dean filmed here is the reason I visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188rickm
50,Worth A Visit,Just for the view it’s well worth it. Parking can be an issue. We parked at the meter for 2 hours that cost $16. There is free parking available with a free shuttle bus 🚌. Be sure to visit the lower level. Recommend a weekday and allow 2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460terryb
50,"Learn, explore, hike.","Day or night- it's a great place to enjoy the views, spend time with family or friends, bring visitors. The museum and planetarium shows are great. Park downhill and walk or take a bus, or visit during the week and you'll have no problem to park. This is one of my favorite LA's attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tatianng
50,Excellent views,I did the trail walking until the observatory. If you can is the best way to visit it. You can drive your car until Ferm Dell Drive and Red Oak Drive. Leave your car there and then take the trail until the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuanPabloTraveller
50,Great place to see LA,"The Observatory has some of the best views of LA I have seen. You can really appreciate how large and expansive the place is! The Observatory itself is a great place. We did not manage to see the show, but we saw the exhibitions and they were all very educational and informative. We also saw the Tesla coil in action and that was AMAZING!!! The person doing the voice-over explained well how it worked. I would definitely recommend going in the building as well as spending time outside. BTW, we went near sunset and the place was packed - if going by car, you might not be able to find a parking space at that time, and even with an Uber or something like that (that they allow up to leave and pick up visitors) the traffic is really heavy at the time and you should be prepared to spend a lot of time just going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999olympiab
10,Two visits and no parking!!,"We drove up this mountain two days in a row, late afternoon and early morning. There was no parking anywhere. The “free” parking lot is over a mile away, and that walk is not doable for some members of our family. There is parking up the road from the observatory but nothing was ever available. We traveled two miles up the road and still couldn’t find anywhere to park. There is a large lot just in front of the building that was blocked off, and at least three dozen spots just past the observatory road which were also blocked. Seemed to us that they didn’t really want visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazdragonfly
50,You have to visit if you go to Los Angeles,"This is a must visit place if ever in LA great city views and interesting place to visit, go as early as they open since parking is limited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mfloresgc
50,Views,The views are a must see. You can litrally see the whole of LA up there. Really a must. We parked at the park and Walked up the hill which tool around 10 minutes. Absolute must do in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375chloes
50,Iconic Building,This is the iconic observatory in LA from the movie Rebel Without a Cause. They offer planetarium shows for the great price of $7. The museum is wonderful and the views are great. Parking can be challenging as the only options are on the side of the road for $8 an hour and with possibly long walks. It is definitely worth the visit but go early and prepare for a long and steep hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiketoeatCincinnati
50,Go for sunset!,Go for sunset and its a great view. Def. busy area though. Eat before though because the cafe is $$ !! 10/10 would go again!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurentaylor802
50,"Amazing, but come early and bring comfortable shoes!","My boyfriend and I came here after dinner to look at the stars. They ended up closing one of the entrances, then parking was full and we were re-routed to parking that was further away. We had to walk for quite a bit - which is fine, given the views were beautiful - but comfortable shoes would be a huge plus. I'd also give myself plenty of time as there are many interesting displays to look at and the lines for the telescopes are long and close around 9 or 9:30. There are also observers out on the lawn with their own telescopes and often they will let you look through them as well. There is also a planetarium show. If you are a space/science nerd, I would give about 3 hours to this place and try to go before sunset so you get day, sunset, and night views of LA. This is great for everyone - though I have to say, if you're a couple and are looking for a romantic lookout, this is not it. It sounds more romantic than it is. It's VERY busy, people everywhere (which is totally fine!). Overall, a must-see in LA, beautiful and interesting, I wish I had more time than I allotted. Definitely go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisabethm684
50,One must Visit here if visiting LA,"It's was an amazing experience to get back all my memories back from school days, very informative. We loved the location, view of LA , proper location to take catch your cam with Hollywood hill. I ask all who visit LA should make time out to be there. Thanks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary586318
50,Beautiful location & educational too,"Positioned on Mount Hollywood over looking the city, this wonderful art deco building sits in Griffith Park. Not only is the architecture stunning, it has amazing views of the surrounding area. It also houses great exhibits that bring space to life. Certainly well worth a visit and adding to your LA itinerary. There's certainly a lot to see & do so make sure you give yourself plenty of time. There is an excellent planetarium. If you want to avoid walking up the mountain, use the Dash Bus which will pick you up at the carpark near the Greek Theatre, & drop you off right by the observatory overlooking the Hollywood sign. The route goes beyond this so check out if there is a stop near you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/an-old-pup
50,Great View of Los Angeles & hiking for young kids,"This is my favorite place to bring all my visitors. Anytime is a great time. There’s meter parking closest to the observatory and it’s $4/hr. I like to park along the bottom and walk up, people always ends up driving back down to park because it gets so pack at the parking lot closest to the observatory. Near the observatory is a nice short hiking trail that was very family friendly. I went with my 2 yo and I could’ve bought the stroller if I wanted to on the hike. In front of the observatory is a nice big open grassy area, you can picnic or just read a book. It’s free admission to enter the observatory and about $5-$9 to watch a short clip in their theater. If you drive up behind the observatory (fern dell drive), there’s more trails and plenty of picnic tables. I got to enjoy the Curping of birds. I also got to hike from that area with my son and he loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ktown213
40,"Great hike, good views, beautiful building.","This is a great spot to stop in LA. It'll give you either a base or destination for a good hike along the Hollywood Hills, with the Hollywood sign visible in the distance. The observatory inside is beautiful. Worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacayInADay
50,Gorgesous place for views of Los Angeles.,You are being able to see all four valleys of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Lots of incredible exhibits in the observatory. Fantastic experience for a family trip. The observatory in itself is very impressive and the staff as well. Highly Recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zdenek2013
30,It was Just OK,"I was disappointed to find that there is a charge for parking, so I took the local DASH BUS to the Observatory. I walked throughout the Observatory, and found it to be OK. The most interesting thing for me, was the view of the City of Los Angeles. It was quite something to see. There is NO CHARGE for entry into the Observatory, yet within the Observatory, there is a charge to watch one of the shows inside (I did not go to it , so I can't comment on it). I spent about two hours at the location, and I was glad I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomas692017
50,Great views and a simple hike to spend a sunny day in SoCal,"We did the show inside the dome auditorium, walked around the whole exhibit, walked around the outside, got coffee and a bite to eat. We even did the free showing insdie. A really cool place to go if you're into science and space. Nothing will make you feel smaller and put life into perspective.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/champlow007
40,"If you have time, it's worth a stop on a clear day","Make sure you plan this right. You need to go on a clear day to be able to appreciate the grand sweeping views of LA, the hills and the holywood sign. I think we put the wrong thing into waze - the park instead of the observatory - and ended up driving miles and miles through the park to finally get to the observatory. we parked at the closest lot, despite all the signs that said the lot was full - we took our chances and lucked out. The building itself is beautiful, the pendulum was very cool, as was the telescope. the grounds are nice and the views amazing. inside was shoulder to shoulder packed so we did not linger. it was $10 to park and we were there maybe 40 minutes, but I can't say it wasn't impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhuvos
40,very interesting,"You could see for miles, being able to see all four valleys of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Sundown was so beautiful to look at here. They had great things to see inside, like the shows and the exhibits. Loved going here. although next time I will not go on a Saturday. Very busy. Take an uber or do a shuttle bus though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennys720
50,Out of town friends,"Love bringing friends here. We usually take them later in the afternoon so that they can see the ""Hollywood sign"" and then spend rest of the time going through the exhibits. The ""Tesla coil"" is cool to see. When the sun goes down, we go back out and look at the city lights.Parking used to be free, now they charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stormco2
50,Fabulous views. Take a hike.,This is a must-see for first time visitors to Los Angeles. The observatory offers shows and you can wander the displays at your leisure. The views are incomparable and you can grab a sandwich or salad and eat outside. Hiking is the best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyandIan
50,Great learning experience and exercise,When I came to the observatory it was beautiful from the view over downtown to the Hollywood sighn. You get to see wild life and also knowledge about science and space.There are places to eat aswell but expensive but wonderful people all around .around the side is a great hiking trail(only go during the morning or the day time)And do not be close to some of the edges or you may fall there are no rails so just be safe and you will be fine. you will need to pay for parking if you drive but if you go by bus they have a shuttle or dash bus that goes from western all the way up to the observatory only 50cent-$1.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kennyisawsome

50,Great day out in L.A.,As always Griffith Observatory and park are a perfect day out anytime..Alot of history and science to be learned here..looking thru the main telescope is always a treat..picnic on the the grounds...walk down to step into the original Bat Cave from the batman tv show..movie history is all over the groundsfrom shots of Los Angeles to the observatory ledge where Rebel without a cause was shot..and the Greek Theater is right down the hill...this place is not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stargroves

50,Gorgesous Views all around,I love this spot because it offers one of the best views of Los Angeles. Great parking and a wonderful place to picnic.

50,40th+,"Only reason I’m writing this is because yet again I took out of town friends to visit. This is an awesome LA secret. I say secret because it is always overlooked. Everyone knows it’s there, shoot you can see it flying into LAX, but no one goes. With full disclosure, I’m born and raised LA, not that that matters.People need to. You can see the entire city. From Catalina to Pasadena. All the way down to Long Beach. And the observatory itself has an amazing show, exhibits, and a giant swinging pendulum that lets you visibly see the earth turning.Granted if it’s overcast, that’ll effect the view but otherwise it’s spectacular. Now a bonus. If you can catch a show after at the Greek theatre, just down the hill, you can grab a pre-made picnic basket and have a pretty amazing day/evening. (We happened to see the Gypsy Kings that night)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BacchusLAX
50,Perfect spot!,"The Griffith Observatory has everything you want to see, learn, and take part in regarding our universe. Set in the Hollywood hills, the site is breathtaking. Bring a camera! There are hands-on exhibits for both children and adults. Parking is usually adequate. A place not to miss if you are visiting L.A. A place to visit again even if you live in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsR5337VK
50,Griffith Observatory-views for days,"In a relatively recent vacation to L.A., I planned a trip to the Griffith Observatory, and the views didn’t disappoint! I was truly amazed by what I could see, and I didn’t want to leave because the views were breathtaking! Would highly recommend this scenic overlook to anyone who’s wanting to see L.A. from a very unique perspective!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TannerParker
50,100% recommend!,"I hiked up here last night around 7pm just as the sun was setting, by the time I’d hiked to the observatory ~30 minutes the sun was setting and the scenery was incredible. You can see the Hollywood sign from there - it’s 4 miles away. Would definitely recommend. Also, it’s free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M5080CSalexc
10,Closed for refurbishment,"Went to the Observatory on the 24th April but to my dismay it was closed for refurbishment. I was extremely disappointed but what was more infuriating was that I had checked on the official website their opening hours before I went, but nothing to say it was closed, infact it said it was normal opening hours. The large signs outside said it was closed until mid May so double check before travelling if it has re-opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4241VTlouiseg
50,A must to see!,"Quite a hike up there, but it's a wonderful hike. You can drive to the top and see LA and Hollywood and everything in between. Awsome views. A night everything lights up amazing!!Did not go to the planetarium. Next time we hope to. Definitely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dennancy
30,‘Better’ of the Hollywood sign,I expected to be much closer to the sign or was lose as possible to the sign and this wast the case.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lele1432
50,Highly Recommend,Fantastic experience for a family trip. Lots of incredible exhibits and an excellent view of downtown Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamack2019
50,A place you want to visit in LA,The Griffith Observatory was so much fun for our family. We visited on Easter Sunday and really enjoyed. We sat through a 30-minute presentation on the planets which was interesting. The outside offers magnificent views of Downtown LA and we got some great pictures of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558marisolo
40,What a hike to the Hollywood sign,Beautiful area even though it was closed the day we went so we walked to the back of the Hollywood sign. Take lots of water. Pretty cool and a great work out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cindy2013_13
50,Wonderful inside and out,"Beautiful views over LA and an amazingly educational building, well worth a visit.Some wonderful exhibits which I'm sure would be of interest for all and the BEST view of the iconic Hollywood sign. If you want to listen to the 'talk' give yourself a little longerAs a quick aside restrooms are clean and tidy and there are no beggars on site",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4421YArebeccaa
40,Must!,"Very romantic and magical atmosphere up there! Wow, amazing landscape, try to be there before sunset and enjoy all the golden hour from that point! Please pay attention: very expensive parking all the way and so crowded. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andretapp
50,My GTA V Live Experience came true!,So our tour bus took us to the Observatory and my first reaction was 'wow they made it so real in GTA V'. My wife and I play GTA a lot and we were overenthusiastic seeing the actual location and how we roam around here in the virtual world.The observatory in itself is very impressive and the staff as well. I liked the Infrared body monitor which detected our temperature and heat exchange prints when touched!The top section is nice to view LA Skyline on a clear sunny day. Also one can take some selfies with Hollywood sign far behind!We spent most of the time taking pictures and videos. Overall it was a nice trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akhilpwalia
50,Awesome Observation both inside and out!,"The Views overlooking LA and surrounding areas from the outside of the Observatory are awesome! Even at night, you can just relax and take it all in. The staff set up telescopes at night time for you to view thru and see maybe a planet or a star. The ground and trails around can be challenging but worth it if you can handle it.It's free to get in the observatory with many exhibits, interesting for all ages, even children! There are shows inside the observatory that you purchase tickets for. We opted for the Light of the Valkaries because of time, would have preferred a different show.. Try the Centered in the Universe.They are closed right now for construction but will reopen May 7,2019, and observatory is closed on Mondays, so plan accordingly. It will be worth it! We'll plan another visit when back in the LA area. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2016maryG
50,Beautiful Views,"The first time we went to the observatory, we hiked up the trail which was enjoyable but you do need a certain level of fitness to complete this however is worth it as you get some amazing views on the way up. Second time we took the DASH (local bus) for $1 which took us straight there in about 15-20 minutes. When you get to the top, you can see all around Los Angeles and is even better at sunset. Once inside it is packed with information and interactive exhibits including the planetarium show which is around $7 per person. This is a great activity to do if you are on a budget as it is free and easy to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Willow2585
50,Great Destination,"I have visited LA twice and had to come here both times!The first time I visited, parking up by the observatory was free but now I believe they charge by the hour to park. I highly recommend not parking here because you are guaranteed to spend more time than you think! There is so much to do between the interactive exhibits, taking in the breathtaking views, and the great hiking trails around the Observatory. My recommendation for parking would be down next to the Greek theater then there is a shuttle that costs $0.50 per person which depart from across the street of the lot. We took the shuttle up and then walked back down. It is a really easy walk back down from the observatory to the parking lot going on the hiking trail. Just be careful to check the concert schedule at the Greek theater because they restrict parking there when there is a concert going on.The planetarium shows are really interesting and captivating. It’s a nominal fee and there are discounts for students! The theater is large enough that you shouldn’t have to worry about capacity, and as long as you aren’t on the far end of the rows there is pretty great viewing throughout.If you’re looking for a good view of the Hollywood sign this is a great spot as well! It’s still off in the distance a bit but as long as it’s a pretty clear day it makes for an excellent photo spot.If you’re going to LA the Griffith Observatory is a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottS728
50,Evening visit,"Beautiful views from the grounds and from the top of the Observatory.Very interesting inside - there was an earthquake seismometer where you can create your own marks on the earthquake measurer, weighing scales for each planet to see your weight on each planet, little areas that have specific information on how the moon affects the tide, daylight savings etc. It was fairly busy when we were there but it didn't feel overly crowded when you were in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquelynR60
50,Interesting and knowledgeable!!,This place is awesome!! So much to learn in a fun and interesting way!! The view of LA from Griffith is amazing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pal09
50,Great for hiking and astronomy,"The Griffith park observatory is a place everyone should visit , for the love of the stars and all the beautiful hiking trails around the observatory it’s a great Los Angeles spot !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opal_unicorn
50,Great views of greater LA and the multiverse.,"Fairly accessible. Parking at the bottom of the small mountain/hill the observatory is on. Parking close to the top and at the top is fairly affordable. Transit service to the location as well. Most of the Griffith is free. There is tourist items you can purchase and some shows about the cosmos. If the weather is clear, you can see quite a distance, especially if there is a good breeze to clear out the smog. You can also see the famous ""hollywood"" sign on the hollywood hills. This place should definitely be on your visiting LA list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmicTami
50,See lightning strike!,"A most wonderful place to visit Griffith Observatory has been the backdrop for many movies, most notably 'Rebel Without A Cause' starring James Dean. Much to see and do including the Tesla coil which when turned on throws out lightning bolts and causes neon lights in front to light up. There are telescopes you can visit and look at the heavens after dark. There's a whole room where you can find out your weight on each of the planets and the moon. There's a planetarium with wonderful shows, a pendulum that shows the rotation of the Earth. A whole wall showing the periodic table and various pictures of the sun in different stages of its evolution. That's not to mention the spectacular views of the whole Los Angeles basin as well as the Hollywood sign. A very special place in Los Angeles that's worth a visit for anyone of any age. Go see lightning strike!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piquet49
50,One of LA's Most Distinctive Attractions,"If the Griffith Observatory looks familiar to you, it's because it was featured in the James Dean movie REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. If you're driving, it's a little tricky to get here: Note that there are DASH buses that can shuttle you to the Observatory from a nearby Red Line MTA Metro Stop. The quality of the exhibits is high, the planetarium shows are fun, and you can't help but learn when you visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimP988
50,Great views of Los Angeles,"Really nice views at the very top overlooking LA, particularly at night. Would definitely recommend as a must-see whilst in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamieb15
50,HISTORIC AND EDUCATIONAL,"The Griffith Observatory should always be included in a trip to LA. The exhibits are always entertaining and the view is spectacular. Check out the planetarium and the journey into the cosmos, and then journey outside to look at the lights of LA and the Hollywood sign. A beautiful place to take a date or the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerNate
50,Great View,A great view and a nice place to take photos if you want that HOLLYWOOD photo.Lots of people all the time but the place is huge so it's not a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erin40
50,Go for the views,"This was the best spot to see the Hollywood sign.We arrived early and still had to park in the lower lot and hike to the top, it is steep but worth it.We spend more time outside than inside the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcisinthehouse
50,Went for a hike,"We did the hike around Griffith Observatory to the Hollywood sign, however, we did not actually go through the observatory itself. The only comment I can make is that the transportation around the observatory is great. Just make sure to look it up and ask questions. We found parking super easily and we could have taken a bus to the main spot trailhead if we wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereIsAshley
50,Beautiful views and great learning experience,"My 4 year old son and Mom were in the LA area for a day and we ventured out to the Observatory. It was my second time here, and I loved it as much as I did the first time I came. My son and Mom also really enjoyed the observatory. Super cool activity to do while in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhi21
50,Great views,I loved this observatory and the views were breathtaking. I recommend going just before sunset. Hard to find parking. I recommend taking a taxi or an Uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieistage
50,"Beautiful views, perfect for anyone and everyone!","Came here in the late afternoon with a friend and stayed a couple of hours to watch the sunset!It was beautiful, saw all of LA including the Hollywood sign which was brilliant!Inside the Observatory they have fun and interactive information about space, planets, the sun, the moon, the weather and seasons! I really enjoyed it. Downstairs they have a large area all about the planets in our solar system, including a seismograph which moves if you jump near it which is fun. There are also platforms which you can stand on to weigh yourself and it tells you how much you'd weigh on all the different planets, I thought this was quite a fun feature. Downstairs also features parts of different asteroids and meteors as well as a piece of the moon! If you're into space and like astronomy then this place is definitely worth a visit, if you're not, you will be after this!!!Perfect for any occasion! Super interesting and great fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bon_fooddotco
50,Attractions,"The Observatory in Griffith Park is one of our local places for family outings. Highly recommend, if you want to see a cool 😎 view of the LA and Hollywood basin below from the top and not to mention of the best places to view the Iconic Hollywood sign.A must do place when visiting LA and Hollywood. Remember it’s closed Mondays, but you can still visit the top for the views, just the Observatory is closed. The only negative let down is that parking meter fees are expensive silly. Little gritty in that regards. Happy 😃 Travels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelingmaderas
50,Magical,We went on the busiest day as it was Easter weekend and the place was mobbed but we managed to do the tour the building is stunning and the views phenomenal .Really enjoyed it and there is a good coffee place in there as well .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/827martinob
40,"Parking awful, great views","Well unless you head here for opening good luck parking. The parking setup is awful and they have guys giving tickets all day. Parking isn’t cheap and you have to pre pay for the time you need (which could be a while if you track for over 20Mins up the hill to the observatory).The ice creams inside a ridiculously priced but the views there are superb.Also if you are British don’t drive down and back up and pull in to park facing the other way as being a first time driver in the states I was lucky a kind man said I’d get a ticket unless I parked facing the same way as everyone else so quickly turned the car around.Also I must add the payment for parking has to be by credit or debit card, cash is not accepted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10carlh

50,Los Angeles Landmark,"I have visited this place various times through the years, but moved from So Cal over eight years ago. It was great fun to revisit. This time, we parked below on Ferndell Dr. where we accessed the trails from below. It was a pleasant hike, although I am sure on a hot day it might feel more tiring. It was pleasant weather in the 70's, and the view was fantastic. We stopped several times to take photos of the far reaching city sprawl below. At the top, it was rather congested at the observatory due to the weekend crowds. We could see the parking lot was packed, and cars lined the side of the approach road for a long way down. It was much more pleasant a hike up the hillside, than a cement road. We looked around a wee bit inside, but due to the crowds, decided to just make the most of the views and hike. I look forward to visiting again and taking in the indoor exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardengal61659
50,A spectacle to remember....,"When we arrived, at approximately 7pm the sky was a delightful colour and the Hollywood sign could be seen at a distance. This masterpiece of architecture is an asset to the city of L.A. The ticket prices to the planetarium were extremely affordable being about $7 a ticket and to walk around the observatory was free also. We were unsure of what to expect during the show (as my teenage stepdaughter insisted we go here due to her seeing the observatory in the film La La Land). The queue system was organised and efficient and the seating was comfortable. Without revealing any spoilers this spectacle of a show is a must to see when in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StewT57
50,Great view,Great view of Los Angeles and a nice and quiet place. But of course a lot of tourists. Absolut a visit worth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PiaSkovfoged
40,A lovely walk and view.,After a very nice walk up the hill through Griffiths Park trying to ignore the rattle of snakes nearby. The view from the observatory is magnificent you can see over a large part of the city and also a good spot to see the famous Hollywood sign. Please take this walk if your visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingman9118
40,"A good experience, carpark very busy.","A n interesting place with a view over the City, haze permitting. Good displays of geology and planet formation. Decent cafe. You may have a way to walk on a busy day but the carparks turnover quickly. Site of La La Land scenes of interest to movie fans. Do go on a quiet day and early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatHel7

20,Extreme access issues,"Well, my teens were bummed. We could not access the observatory or grounds during our visit to Burbank, despite attempting to go on a Tuesday. Not spring break, no strange holidays, but completely overcrowded. No parking available anywhere but at the bottom of the hill, turning away cars. If you could ever find a place, even on the hill, there is a high hourly parking rate. Long lines of cars to the top and then you are turned away - no communication or warning. We heard of a shuttle service, but it is poorly advertised and no signage tells anyone what to do. I would recommend the facility take a page from the Getty and just close parking up top and operate an efficient shuttle that runs constantly...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNW2010
50,Great Place with great views!,"The Observatory is totally free, and a great place for families.Parking varies from $4 to $8 and hour depending on the day and it could take you 1/2 hour just to get walk to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AustinRichardHermes

40,Great view...the bus service must improve,The place and view were great...the bus service needs to be improve as it took us a long time to go up to the observatory and lot of time to go down... the cars at the parking lot in front of the observatory were blocking the road and the bus took a long time to get to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinaH848

30,Bust,"There are some good exhibits here. However it was packed with people so it was hard to read things at times. The parking is $10 per hour and there is a small parking lot by the museum. There is additional parking on the road (same price), but you may end up having to walk a mile. There are great views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971louisep

50,"Iconic, fascinating","To my immense embarrassment, I'd never even HEARD of the Griffith Observatory until my wife mentioned that she would like to visit, as we drove through LA. We parked at the bottom of the hill because the top car parks were full and used the shuttle bus; much easier, inexpensive and recommended, as you can easily walk back down and enjoy the view.And what a view! A deco masterpiece, modernised and extended underground, packed with accessible science for all ages, from where to can see to the sign, the Pacific and the mountains, with LA laid out below. Even if you have no interest in astronomy, the location and the history make it well worth the detour. The planetarium show was disappointing and the low point of the visit; don't pay extra as there's plenty to enjoy elsewhere in the building. In contrast the Nimoy Theatre presentation was fascinating and free. The traffic getting both in and out is hellish, but I suspect that's ""just an LA thing"". It's good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardpA2538KF
40,"Great view, expensive parking","The beautiful Art Deco observatory in Griffith Park is my favorite In LA. It is on top of a hill with a great view of LA. It is so popular that parking on the road up there is $10 an hour, pretty expensive. One can take a dash bus but the traffic is awful. There is a waiting area at the top to wait for Ubers and places to get free WiFi. It’s possible to hike up the hill to it as well. A good place to go for astronomical events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyemlucky
50,"Fantasic views, very interesting","Visited the Observatory, a very interesting place. It was very busy and no parking at the top (we got a taxi there, and the red DASH $0.75 back to the metro). Great views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA from here. We paid extra to watch one of the planateriam shows which was really worth it. As we were exiting to look downstairs we were told they were showing the feed of the SpaceX launch in the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater which was a real bonus. Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siz_123

40,Fantastic views,We visited on a Monday so the observatory was closed but it was still worth going as the views were spectacular! It’s particularly worth it for the clear view of the Hollywood sign. Parking is expensive at $10 an hour. There are toilets which are open even if the observatory is closed. We had a picnic in the surrounding Griffith park which was very enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathSP
40,Great views. Be aware that a hike is necessary,Our family was excited to visit the observatory for the great views. We did not know that we had no choice but to hike a mile up the side of the mountain. We were in dresses and sandals which proved to be difficult. Definitely suggest finding out if parking at the top is available when you would like to go or dress appropriately. The views were definitely worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunFoodFamilyFab5
50,Something New and Exciting Around Every Corner!,"Great view of the Hollywood sign! There is an outside star chart that, at certain times in the day, is lit up by the sun shining through a lens - very cool!

And lets not forget the Leonard Nimoy theater - so much to do that can't all be fit in this review!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBar1214
30,Beautiful views! Very crowded. Less than helpful employees.,I would recommend this place based on the views alone. It was VERY crowded and we couldn't even look at the museum area. We arrived toward the end of the lunch time in the cafe and they were out of ranch dressing. We asked for some and were refused because they didn't want to bring us any at the end of the lunch time. Parking is TERRIBLE so be sure to take an uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanz1432

50,Awesome place for Families,I took my family here to see all of LA and it was definitely worth it. We didn't stay very long but did get to see the Egyptian section of the observatory. I would go back if I was ever in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/696oliverf
50,Always mesmerizing and interesting,"If you are looking for a beautiful, interesting place where you can take your family, go alone, go for a walk, go with a company or just enjoy the beautiful view of the Californian slopes, the Griffith Observatory is one of the best places to visit in Los Angeles.Besides, for those who like science and astronomy this is a great place to understand more the dynamics of our wonderful planet and for children, a plate full of good information, practical and easy to understand. The display of educational films and other samples of scientific experiments are also a great reason to visit this place with children from 8 to 80 years. :)Do not forget that to park there is always very difficult, and on weekends to find a place to park is always a task that takes a lot of time ... I recommend leaving the car in the lower part of the mountains and ask for a Uber, it will be cheaper, easier and more pleasurable your ride. There is also a bus service from Griffith Park (Los Feliz area), where you park for free and take the bus. In case you decide to drive up there, know that the admittance is free but parking is paid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marccorrone
50,Awesome View,"It is worth the drive up the mountain for this view. It was popular with many wanting to enjoy the view. We were in a tour bus, so we were dropped off at the top and picked up at the top, but we all said we would have walked up. If you enjoy hiking take a few hours here and hike up and use the trails around. Beautiful area with trails. Amazing view at the top. From 7pm-9pm you can view the telescope from the very top. It was cool in April after the sun went down, a sweater is recommended if going late in the day. A late picnic would be a suggestion. If you enjoy views and have time it's worth the trek. The homes below and Griffith Park are stunning. It's out of the hustle and bustle. There are interesting facts in the observatory. We enjoyed the planetarium show too. Educational and entertaining 30 min. presentation on our solar system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsvtexas

40,This a must: view LA after sunset from the observatory,"We drove up here to see the lights of LA after sunset and were rewarded with an amazing view. We were not the only ones with this idea, so a sound advice is to plan to be here early - just before sunset should do it - in order to beat the crowd. The drive up here is beautiful as well and the road of good quality. The drive back in the dark is just that: dark. No streetlights until you hit the foot of the hills - it is an observatory so darkness is a prerequisite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelBG
50,Curious Stars and much more,"The Griffith observatory is a must when in LA not only do you have the opportunity to see stunning views of The Hollywood sign and Griffith Park below in front of the observatory you also have the chance to visit the observatory itself.I watched the Water is Life show which was really wonderful, a bit dazzling really, all those stars! The guide was really good at explaining things and it made you feel like a kid again the way he explained and it was fun to hear and see everyone get so involved in the show.However I would miss the cafe, it's pretty overpriced. You're on a mountain. nowhere else to go except back down.I followed the path along the road coming out at the junction at the bottom through the park to the main road.There is also a path taking you back to the bottom, there are signs to follow.The views were very memorable and inspiring, you can see the mountain's on the left with the snow peaks and smoke maybe from a forest fire somewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyb8176

50,Special place,"I expected to see an empty old building on the top of the hill.Unexpectedly what I found was a very fascinating place that had astronomical displays, a planetarium, a place to dine and a great gift shop. Parking is first come first served eight dollars an hour. Good luck getting a spot. Wear good walking shoes. There is a shuttle bus from remote parking . Spectacular views across LA. Well worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeyBoy12804
50,Hollywood tour,"Today was an awesome day to visit the observatory because it was the one Saturday in the month that astrological enthusiasts bring their high powered telescopes and allow visitors to view the galaxy. Our tour guide, Gary allowed us sufficient time there to enjoy the experience. It was an awesome experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2nurse2
50,Always a great trip,Great view for Christmas! Went up there with my boyfriend for his first visit. Always an amazing place to gisit and take in a show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479dianneh
40,Worth Seeing,"We have visited the place before, but love to return. We happened to visit ther when there was a monthly event.It was education and fun.This place was not as crowded before the movie La La Land was shot here. Now, it is hard to find a parking space during the weekends. It has definitely become a must- see place in LA.Prepare to spend a whole day here with your family and friends.One thing I don't like was the cafe there. It was not very clean, especially the outdoor seating area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Differences
50,"So many displays, very cool. Downstairs was our favorite","It was so crowded when we went here, we actually enjoyed the downstairs where the planet models are, the best. This is a lovely place, and a beautiful location. We hiked to Hollywood sign from observatory and that was really enjoyable! (It's not a short hike)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathert612
30,"Beautiful, crowded, and not open all the time","Expensive parking, so crowded it is sad. A stunningly beautiful place but even when the building is closed there are way too many tourists.....busloads who push and shove everywhere. Loved seeing it but wish there were a way to do better crowd control.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhDRN
50,Amazing,This is the most amazing thingSo much to explore and the best thing it’s FREE to enter and go aroundExplore and see the sun with special telescopeDid the hiking up to the mountain and enjoyed the viewSo much good energy to breathe in!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aulkerfamily
50,Science at its best,"Amazing museum with astonishing attractions and a great place to get in contact with nature.The observatory is very near a park with picnic areas and many different trails to explore the nature.I’m passionate about city views and in the observatory I found certainly one of the best views of LA.If you are with kids this is definitely your place. The museum provides amazing staff that explain experiments, science discoveries and are ready to explain scientific phenomena at any time.The best of this visit the admittance is free and you are only charged if you want to see specific activities such as “the sky view” (which I totally recommend)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuaViajante
50,CaliGirl,This is the place to go if you want see the best view of Los Angeles city and the Hollywood sign. Great place for pictures!!!! The observatory is also very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliGirl501115
50,Views of LA,Nice museum inside the observatory as well as good views of Los Angeles and the Hollywodd sign. Make sure you hike up to the sign and take close up pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51hiteshp
50,Hiking trip,"The hike was amazing and when you get to the top the observatory it’s a lot of people, friendly environment. The hike is great for exercise and safe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lashay1martin
50,A Surprising Heritage in our Backyard,"I heard about this place multiple times but was never here because it was not close enough for a convenient pop in visit, neither was it far enough away for a special ""trip"". We finally came here and I was blown away by the surroundings. There were trails all around that you could make it a day of hiking, picnic, AND take in the wonderful exhibits and shows at the Observatory. Definitely ask around when you get there to find out all the different show times and special exhibits if you are like me and don't like doing too much research on your own. :) The history behind the place, the way it was restored and preserved, etc are all great additional bonus to the scientific information on display. Definitely recommended for family outings. There is not really any dining options so do plan on eating off site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerg435
50,A Crown Jewel,"What trip to La La Land would be complete without a trip to the Griffith Observatory. Not only do you get to see where movies like Rebel Without a Cause and La La Land filmed iconic scenes, you can make your own movie while taking in breathtaking views of downtown LA, the Hollywood sign and more !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inck67
50,A wonderful day trip,"Take time to see the forests around the observatory. The view is stunning. The show (universe) is great, it’s like flying through time and space. 6-year-old daughter loved it too.Tip: park at the bottom of the hill and take the bus to the top, saves you waiting time, there are not many spaces close to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51georgk
50,"Amazing views, picturesque, and great knowledge","I love Griffith observatory and park! First of all , it caters for everyone: astronomy lovers, picturesque landmarks and amazing view finders, hikers, tourists...It’s a must visit if you are visiting LA county. I also visit this everyone I come to California. Parking can be difficult on weekends and public holidays but you can park near the theatre and walk (15 mins)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citrocity
50,Recline back and let your worries go for 10 minutes,Not only is this a great place to go on a date while learning it has an amazing theatre where you recline back and watch the story play above your head.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMJ007
50,Touring LA,Nice scenic view of Los Angeles on a clear night . Very informative display of scientific facts and theory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zerixxxxx
40,Amazing hike to it Griffith Observatory,"We decided to visit this by hiking up to it. There was various ways to reach it so research which one you would like to do. It was a great hike up, and when we reached the top it was well worth it. It is a beautiful building with fabulous views of LA and the mountains surrounding it. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MPoulos
50,Beautiful Place,We tried to make it to the Observatory at night to see the lights of LA but it was way crowded and no parking. We did sneak some good views and pics as we were driving though. Decided to return the next day and it was totally worth it. Beautiful views of the city and the grounds were very pretty. I love getting glimpses of the observatory on various TV shows. It’s an iconic place. If I remember correctly if you get there before noon parking is free. I hope we get to visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobbi111
50,Good Spot,Tooked my kids here. The place is great. We opted to pay the $8 dollar parking fee. The parking machine only takes debit or credit card no cash. My kids had a great time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcunanan03
50,Great views of LA,The Griffith Observatory had great views of LA and the Hollywood Sign. Was beautiful there. Would love to do the hike sometime,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristyn02019
50,"Great place, great views","What an interesting place. I saw the show in the planetarium which was really good and the Tesla Coil working. So much information, just great.Outside I could see the whole of LA I think, plus the nearby mountains and of course the large Hollywood sign. All kinds a ways to get there and surrounded by a park with loads of footpaths.Well worth a visit, probably taking the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainebE7332KR
50,Love it!,We visited from FL and it was such an amazing experience. We both love everything related to space and seeing all the cool things they have was great! Definitely recommend to stay until night time to see downtown LA lit up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLMario7589
50,Amazing views,Visited with a tour bus with plenty of time to see the beautiful views of LA and the Hollywood sign. Very interesting building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationer780914
50,Gorgeous views of the LA area,"I had no idea this was even here, but our friend who was driving us around that day suggested we go and I'm so glad that we did. You don't have to go in - we didn't. You can just walk around the grounds, which are on a high hill and offer amazing views of the city on one side and mountains and greenery on the other. It is up a steep hill - you don't have to hike the whole thing, you can park higher up on the hill which I believe cost $8 per hour. I highly recommend it for free scenic views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastrada
40,Views for miles from a place of height and history....,"Went on a beautiful day. It’s changed in 10years. It was very busy and parking was tough but was able to get a space at the top luckily.Got al the famous Hollywood sign pictures.Took a walk around the observatory, quite a good planet exhibit on lower ground.Gift shop has normal tat that is of course overly priced but complete novelty for the tourist trap. Also gift shop had changed many items and didn’t have anything that would be of a memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamMac_1991

40,Nice place to vew the hollywood sign but too crowded,Very crowded during summer. Nice view of the Hollywood sign. Child-friendly tour in the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EveWyy
40,Locals say this is the best place to view the Hollywood sign,"*Be aware of the road construction and increased traffic congestion!* Since the traffic was bad, we decided that my husband would drop the kids and I off and would go find a parking spot. We got a few hundred feet from the observatory and the parking staff would not allow my husband to drive any closer. We hopped out and hiked the rest of the way up the hill. My husband tried to call us but couldn’t get through for quite a while because we had no phone service until we got close to the building. He couldn't find a parking spot so we didn’t go in but just walked around the outside to take a few pictures. We then walked back to the spot where we were dropped off to get picked up. It would have been nice to spend more time here but it didn't happen. We did enjoy the views from here! The website stated that construction will continue until 21 April. It also stated that the observatory itself will be closed from 22 April - 6 May so you may want to consult this site before making your plans to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravelTerrie
50,Griffith > Runyon,This is one of the better hikes if you’re choosing between Runyon and Griffith. Griffith is less of a scene and it’s prettier in my opinion. Runyon also great but I’ve hiked both of them many times and I definitely prefer Griffith. The observatory is beautiful and is one of those things that doesn’t disappoint in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthetravelingboy
40,Views & science,"We went on a clear saturday, saw San Gabriel mountains & Hollywood sign. Interesting building and science displays. There's a planetarium show which I didn't see. On a clear weekend day, parking lot @ $8 an hour was full. Needed to park in free lot & take dash bus. Might as well take transit all the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faye57
50,Amazing views,"I have not been here since before they reopened it . I use to go back in the 80""s. They have changed it a lot. It is still a beautiful neat place to go. It is so crowded . It was never crowded back in the 80""s. We had to park down the hill. Parking is $8 hour. Be ready to pay the meter. They are easy to find. I did not mind paying for the parking since it is free to go walk around the observatory . Allow at least 2 hours to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939beverlyk
40,Nice place to see the Hollywood sign!!,I took a 6 hr Tour and the company took me here the first place. It was partly cloudy but the views are unbelieveable. It isn't that big. So parking is a problem when all the tour buses and school buses drive up the narrow road. Plus construction makes going up the a little problem as well. Other than that is is a nice stop on a tour or on your own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRMD31
50,Great views and exposition,"Took a 1 mile uphill walk to get there (you can use shuttle buss as well). Views of LA offers great variaty - from LA downtown and sub-urbs to hills and ocean.Lot of different explanatory stands (moon phases, eclipses, sun real time view, e.t.c.). Would suggest to wait for Tesla spoil demonstration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbaiza
50,Must visit!,No trip to Los Angeles would be complete without a visit to the Griffith Observatory. It has amazing 360 degree views of the city - no matter the time of day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orcadas
40,Great view,"Plan this trip carefully! When the sunset is approaching traffic gets crazy up there! Took us forever to get up there, but it was worth it. Beautiful view.There isn’t great service up there so it’s difficult to call an Uber",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delbuonon
30,"Be prepared to Walk, Walk, Walk & pay for parking","The views are amazing and beautiful as reviewed by others.What I would say is we had to pay $8 an hour for parking and we had to park very very far down hill. It took almost an hour to make to walk, maybe it was just a busy day or we didn't plan properly but just a word of advise.The park is worth a visit but we found a better view elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/femster
30,Beautiful sun set scenery,Fabulous place for a nice picture of the sun set. It seems that lots of people congregate here at more or less the same timing which makes it very crowded. But definitely worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oscarsee
50,Stars everywhere!!,"The building itself is impressive, but once inside there is so much to see, we got there later than we wanted to, but still saw a lot of things, downstairs they were giving a talk and it was very informative and we had been able to talk to them after, and it is very enlightening, I loved it and would go back again, I just wish it had been open later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrwidow
50,This is where you want to be at Sunset,The trails leading up to the observatory are absolutely gorgeous. The view from the observatory is equally beautiful. There really is so much to do here. It's one of my favorite ways to spend an afternoon if you don't mind crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandi3lle
50,"Go in the evening for the crowds, sunset and spectacular night views of LA","Planetarium show was great, Don't miss the Leonard Nimoy exhibits on the lower level, much larger and more comprehensive than the 'main' floor exhibits.Free looks through the observatory main refractor scope were fun: expect long lines on nice nights, but lines move quickly.Don't miss the portable telescopes set up outside of the main building with entertaining and informative staff.If it's a busy night, do not hesitate to park in the more remote lots. There's a 50 cent public shuttle bus which stops right in front of the G lot. Really saved us a lot of hassle looking for non-existent parking places nearer the facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MplsStPaul
30,Parking a nightmare at Griffith Observatory,"The Observatory is FREE, and a great place for families. Be prepared to WALK or ride the shuttle bus. Not very well marked and poor signage for getting to the actual Observatory. Parking varies from $4 to $8 and hour depending on the day and it could take you 1/2 hour just to get walk to the observatory. No idea what is happening with the shuttle buses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocationVacation
40,A nice place,"A very nice place which gives a very good view of LA. I visited it today, which is spring already, so the weather was just fantastic. One could see the HOLLYWOOD sign pretty well from there. There is a cafeteria there and there food is fine, but very expensive. So unless you are starving I wouldn't recommend you to eat there. Inside the observatory you will find telescopes and much about astroids and space. There are guides which will give you information and are very nice and helpful. For those who use Uber for transport, please note that the GPS signal up there is very weak so I would suggest you use DAST shuttles to go downhill. They are available for 50 cents, every 20 minutes till 22:00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685mahdia
50,When in LA....it’s a must see...,"Talk about location location, when in LA you must visit G.O. It’s spectacular location makes for a stunning view of Los Angeles. Not to mention great shows on the insideMy advice don’t miss this destination 😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garyg1962
30,Hollywood sign,Went to see the Hollywood sign and were short on time by the time we found parking (was getting dark) so only saw the observatory for about 20 minutes. Took the 1 mile hike to get there as there was NO parking anywhere!! Guessing sunset is a more popular time to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajcoco
50,Observatory Visit,We had a wonderful visit! Here is what I suggest if visiting:1. Be there when they open...maybe go early to walk around outside.2. We took an Uber up and back. Book your Uber ride back in advance.Parking is hurrendous!! I can't stress this enough. It a long incline walk up.3. We had 2 hours and did not have time for any shows. I really wish we had!Take your time and enjoy! This is a huge piece of history!3.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sid11258
50,Exceeded our expectations,Visited as part of a hiking tour and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of scientific content and educational materials presented.The views from this location are fantastic and we enjoyed a beautiful sunset.Would recommend this free experience to everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyWanderer
40,Beautiful inside and out,"The parking lots were very busy, buses were available to transport us to the observatory, for a fee of .25 . Which is well worth it because it is all up hill and very long walk. Bathrooms are readily available once you get to the drop off point. Then a short walk over beautifully manicured lawns, and sidewalks, to the observatory. There are 3 floors to the observatory.The are presentation inside, movies. There is several interactive activities. The exhibits are pretty amazing.We spent a couple hours there and then took the bus back to the parking lot, another .25 cents. There was no charge for most of the observatory, but there was a gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnaR1
50,An exquisite Musem / Observitory,"Beautiful architecture, interesting exibits and open spaces that don't overcroud (weekday visits). I went during the week in the late afternoon and was overwelmed by the Observitory and everything it offered. I will go back and take friends when they come into town for a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhotographerJames
30,Great place for astronomy enthusiasts but parking is a hassle!,"After reaching within a mile of the observatory, it took us almost 90 minutes to actually get there. The observatory itself is probably 2-3 hours of visit. The surrounding scenery is absolutely exhilarating. Although we didn't stay there after sunset as we were just tired, but am sure the scenery would have been more beautiful. Do plan o visit this place so you are there during the day and also after the sunset so you can actually do some night gazing. A must to go place if you are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haalio
30,Nothing Thrilling,The observatory was okay for a quick visit. I think it was a bit over-hyped. There's no point in mentioning there's a parking lot at the top because it's insanely small. Just accept you will need to climb a steep mountain to get up there (took us 15 min. Parking was free.) or you can Uber up. The surrounding area seems like a nice place for a picnic/ enjoying the outdoors. There's a decent view of the Hollywood sign but you can get closer to the sign elsewhere for better photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieCrev
50,Beautiful place for sunset and night view + Learning about astronomy,"Beautiful place for sunset and night view + Learning about astronomySuggest to come at 4pm/5pm to visit the observatory exhibits, followed by watching sunset and night view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennyvectra
40,Night view is fantastic,We went at night and the view of LA was unbelievable. Wished we had brought a camera to take night time pictures as your cell phone won't work very well. Highly recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drcwalker1
50,Must See Attraction!,"Whether you’re into star gazing, hiking, or photography, this spot has something for everyone. The observatory (free) is home to many interesting exhibits about science and the building itself is gorgeous. The grounds surrounding Griffith are perfect for hiking and/or posing in front of the Hollywood sign and looking at the stunning scenery in the hills. I wish we could have come back at night to see the telescope in action. What a spectacular place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843hilaryh
50,Great View of LA,"This place is not to be missed. It’s up in the hills of LA. At night you can see the stars, during the day you can see the entire city. Good parking, friendly staff and visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaharris773
50,Don’t Miss This,Exceptional museum with spectacular views. Lots of interesting exhibits and a telescope. The building is an architectural gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rantall
50,The View,"This was a beautiful view. We went during the day so I would imagine at night it is even more special. This placed is closed on Monday's. If you have a handicap plaque bring it because it would be a very long hike up the hill as parking is limited and $8. In the spring it was very green but I was told in the summer the hills are brown. We seen a coyote on the winding drive back down. I recommend this activity very much, I enjoyed it as one of my favorite places to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196anns
50,Great view,Great place to check out Los Angeles you can see everything up there. Come early to avoid crowds. My grandparents got engaged at the observatory in the 40’s!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyZGJ
10,Could not get near it because just nowhere to park .,My title pretty much says it all . I tried to get into paid lot ( I have a heart condition and walking uphill is not a great option ) . They directed me down the hill to the free lot which apparently has a shuttle . It was totally full . This was a Thursday around 2:00 . So I just could not get in . I don’t know if there was a special problem but I was very disappointed .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdmiller_pcj
50,Amazing Place to learn more about our history and place in the universe,"A must do for every LA visitor. Fantastic views on the city and the Hollywood signs, interesting and engaging science as well as an amazing show with a fantastic host: centred in the universe. When you leave Griffith you feel humbled by the nature of human existence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingMark2014
50,Don’t miss this!,We went up to the observatory on a whim. It was fantastic. Their staff is extremely knowledgeable and is great at helping you understand the science behind the exhibits. Best of all it’s free to go through the observatory. You only pay if you want to see a show in the planetarium. It’s also a great place to look over Los Angeles and see the Hollywood sign. We parked for free at the bottom of the park and took the shuttle to the observatory. It’s only 50 cents per person each way. If you park at the observatory it $8 an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651kevinj

40,Great View. Beautiful place. Very interesting,"The positives. Very interesting museum, especially if you like space. Some great exhibits and awesome views. Sunset was breathtaking. And LA at night is spectacular. The negatives. Terrible parking. Went on a Saturday and couldn't find a place to park, came back on a Sunday and lucked into one. The place was packed, and I mean some places were wall to wall people. And did I mention the parking? lol Overall enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boyntonhaus
50,Great views!,"Great place to see the Hollywood sign and to look out over the LA area. Busy on weekends so get there early! Parked in the free lot next to the Greek Theater and took a shuttle to the observatory for 50 cents per person each way. Husband loved the views, teenage daughter loved the indoor museum. Great place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimV447
50,Amazing at night,"Apparently Uber's GPS has a hard time finding this place as our Uber driver had us in a neighborhood in the hills but once we finally got there, it was amazing. In the daytime you'd have a great view of the Hollywood sign and a night a fantastic view of LA lit up. Many of the exhibits are interactive and the free show in the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater was cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyN516
40,Great view of LA,Great destination. Very busy on weekends. Can Uber but beware signal is weak up there. Impressive observatory and equipment. Would be nice if they had shuttles from there to various points in the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLCote
40,"Great view, nice museum","The up side of the Griffith observatory is that it affords a great view and has a nice museum. There is friendly staff to answer your questions. The down side is the price of parking and throngs of people there for selfies. Try to come early on a weekday if you can, although night is best to see the skies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nand150
40,Busy place and hard to park,Going on the weekend you need to plan on how busy the facility will be. There is tons of parking but don't plan on getting close unless you go very early. We went midday and the cars were parked down the hill and in surrounding neighborhoods. The walking paths and trails are great for all levels and the views are hard to beat. It had been a wet season so the hillsides were a verdant green with wild flowers dotting the landscape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptTed61
50,Excellent Place to Visit - a MUST SEE,"Gotta admit, i am an Observatory, LA, Architecture Geek, and this place didn't let me down. Even if you are not into Observatories (don't science much, dude?), you should come for the views. Expansive 360-degree views from the San Fernando Valley, to the San Gabriel Mountains, to Downtown LA, to Santa Monica, the Ocean and beyond. If you come here on a clear day or night, you will be awed.The architecture, grounds, and views, all combine to make this a very worthwhile visit. Great for families and couples alike. Take time to enjoy the exhibits inside, but if you don't, there is enough to learn and see just by walking around.My suggestion is to park down the Hill (Lot G), and be prepared for the little-over 1/2 mile walk uphill to the Observatory. Face it, you probably need the exercise (it is not that bad), and your kids could stand to burn off the energy so that they don't grate on other people's nerves at the top.There is a city bus that goes to the top, and that costs .50 cents. That said, why wouldn't you walk it?Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SledMan
40,Great Views of LA,"It's worth the $8 to park further up closer to the observatory, unless you want to hike before getting there and park for free at the bottom. We had visited on one of the first sunny days after a week of rain. The views were fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478gladysg
10,No Parking,"Parking is 8 dollars an hour. We tried to get the free parking in the park below, but the girl directing traffic wouldn't let us in (I don't know why, it was only about half full), and directed us to paid parking. When we got there, the only space available was the last parking spot about a mile down the hill. We had a handicapped person, so that was out of the question.So, the only thing I know about this place is the bad management of the parking situation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArkansasJohn
50,Great View,We parked at the bottom and walked up the hill Great walk and the wither was brisk but clearThe view is spectacular and it just a great place to walk the grounds. when you get inside there a lot if good thinks to see inside Great place for all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garypK3165RD
50,Wow! What a great day with the kids!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the observatory with our kids aged 6 & 8, and stayed much longer than anticipated. We parked near the Greek theatre and caught the shuttle for $0.50 each- very convenient! Views of the Hollywood sign, downtown LA and sprawling Griffith Park were fantastic. Kids loved the museum and were fascinated by the telescopes and info on planets, stars, etc. The Tesla Coil was a highlight! It’s hard to believe such a great museum is FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylacassidy

50,Always a must for our out of town guests,Evening or daytime activity. Right after it rains the sky is so clear and you can see so much of the skyline. The hours are always posted accurately and there is a calendar with presentations or viewings. Parking is usually easy on street with small fee or in the lot at the top of the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollys393
30,Crowded and confusing!,"My husband and I were told to visit at night. Views were spectacular but getting there was nightmare! Main road was closed and had to detour around to alternate entrance. Staff not helping with mass amounts of people, buses and Ubers. Chaos! Trying to get around was challenging even for the best in health (I am disabled) No one offering direction other than a sad staff person behind a stack of maps. She offered no smile or assistance. The only person offering assistance was to tell is about buying tickets to the hokiest planetarium show ever! Sadly disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hippiechickwoman
40,Too crowded these days,I love the Griffith Observatory but I remember when you could park close and not have to walk for miles to get from your car..... the Observatory itself is still fun but there are so so so so so many people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343eddiew
30,"Meh. Lots of interesting space stuff, but gets kinda boring","If you're really into it, that's the place to go. It's packed with info and demonstrations, which is really fun, but I don't really care how much each planet weights.Definitely go, but plan on other things as well.Food was minimal and not sufficient, gift store was pricy and small (but it had Einstein dolls!)* Observatory has free wifi + outlets to charge phone, NO CELLULAR CONNECTIONS between observatory and greek house (which is about 15-20 minutes down the road), important if you're in need of an Uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miryeh
50,TAKE A TOUR UP!,"I really wasn't interested in seeing the observatory, but after going up as a part of a tour (L.A. City Tours) I am glad I did. It was awesome! The view is incredible and worth the trip up. The best view of L.A. ever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmL4445OZ
50,"Educational, with a great view","I took a couple of friends here and we really enjoyed all the exhibits. the planetarium is magical, as is the view from the balcony.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelgriffin
40,Super Grounds,"We didn't get a chance to see a show, but the exhibits were good and the grounds were beautiful. And a great view of all sides of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dxlake
30,Great for astronomy buffs!,"My daughter and I took the trolley from the Greek theater( free parking! Bonus!!) to the observatory for $.50 a person. If you park up by the observatory it is eight dollars an hour. We chose to hike from the Griffith Observatory to the Hollywood sign. It was such an amazing walk, 22,000 steps! The views were amazing!!! We chose to take the front path to the front of the Hollywood sign. The back path is kind of pointless since there is a big fence surrounding the sign and you cannot get close to it. When the sun set we walked back using the flashlight from my phone to find our way back. We did not plan well. The sun set earlier than we realized. Watch out for the horse poop!! I did not realize they gave horse rides up to the sign and believe me there is poop to dodge! 😂 We then visited the observatory, interesting, but not really our thing! We are more into architecture, landscape, physical activity. Science ....not so much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3754IIannettem
50,Interesting,Excellent car park free and good place to see Hollywood Sign. Use Uber to get there. You can take as we did the Hike which stopped at viewing points. Made it interesting with our guide Kate giving us history during walk. From the Conservatory you can take a shorter walk to viewing platform. Lots to see if you ar3 a star gazer .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bangor321
50,OBSERVATORY SHOWS UP IN VARIOUS MOVIES!,"THE OBSERVATORY'S PARKING LOT IS A GREAT PLACE TO VIEW THE FAMOUS ""HOLLYWOOD ""LETTERS ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE.THE OBSERVATORY HAS AWESOME VIEWS FROM ALL POINTS ON THE OUTSIDE!!AND inside- You will be even happier you went.. You can google it for a sneak peek.!When you go,.give yourself a couple of hours. And I didn't even tell you about the mountain trails!!! Great for all ages - something for everyone. Take snacks like for a theme park.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730terryf
50,Beautiful View of the City,Griffith Observatory has been seen in a lot of movies and is probably most recently known for LaLaLand. You can get nice pictures with the Hollywood sign from here and of the city itself. I recommend going as the sun is setting. The Observatory itself is free but you can make a donation and you can pay to see the little shows they have about the universe. Parking is a bit pricy and hard at the moment since there is a bit of construction in the parking lot but they do have other lots where you can park and get shuttled up. Some people also choose to hike up but it is definitely very inclined and not a hike for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeekeyGee
50,Not to be missed,Fantastic views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign but also a very historic place. Make sure you have a clear day. Tour of onservatory was excellent and received a live presentation downstairs. Amazing place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willieb2019
50,Great Views!!!!!!!!,Hollywood sign is in plain view. Over looking the valleys and hills of LA. If you are afraid of heights you will still have a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbooker82
50,Excellent view over Los Angeles,"We were lucky to arrive on an open day with many telescopes focused on the sun and on the moon, and a guided tour of the main telescope. It would be worth walking up there through the natural landscape, with a rewarding view at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitesurferPerth
50,Griffith Observatory- more than LaLa Land,We had someone drop us off at the top which I highly recommend since parking is limited. We had a clear day for our tour. We explored on our own and took advantage of the knowledgeable guides inside who were highlighting parts of the observatory. My teen daughter was impressed that it had so much to offer since her only exposure was from the movie LaLa Land. Next time I’m bringing hiking shoes to take advantage of the trails nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emfuzer
40,Very informative and educational,"I always enjoy going to the Griffith Observatory. Always fun and interesting information. Never get tired of what you see there. You can watch movies, some with fees, some free. I like the way they have arranged the way you can see the exhibits without missing any. There is a nice restaurant or you can bring your own picnic lunch or dinner. Watch the sunset from the top.Parking can be very difficult but you can park for free in the parking lot down below and ride the DASH bus (not free)This place is for everyone. Young or old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marycflowers1430
50,The View,"If you are in shape at all, park in the lower free lots and walk up the paths. Fewer people more views and a little exercise. The paths are pretty well marked and when you get to the top you can hit the restrooms, grab a snack, learn some amazing facts about our universe and when you tired of that, soak in amazing views of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744Dmack744
50,touch the moon and mars,"fantastic way to increase your knowledge of the universe, from what you would weigh, on different planets and heavenly bodies, to their make up, their moons, a geographical wonderland, a place to touch moon and mars rocks.selfie with Einstein dont miss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoiz110
40,All about the view!,Beautiful view of LA. Go before sunset.Parking is not easy (lost a star here).Planetarium is good for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKX71
40,A great place to view the Los Angeles panorama,The building itself is an iconic beautiful structure with many fun and interesting science exhibits and activities. Great for kids-watch out for school field trips during the week. Sundown and evening give you especially awesome views of the city.Traffic may be an issue as well as parking but it's worth it if you're in the neighborhood and have got the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacastro4
50,Forever Views,"Iconic 100 year old architecture, looking over the entire L A . basin , this is a beautiful family (or Not ) attraction that lets you wonder. Lovely all year this might be especially enjoyed in the spring -( very clear ). This treasure is in one of Los Angeles 's most historic Neighborhoods, Los Feliz , and in these hills are an abundance ofArchitecturally Significant Houses by the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright and Hs Son Lloyd Wright , Shindler , Neutra , Paul Williams , and countless others and ... of course the Film Folks that have always lived in this historic piece of Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjanik
50,The View....,"#Amazing.....The drive up is scenic as the route is through residential Los Feliz neighborhood. Beautiful homes and landscape. Traffic depends on what day you go, so wknds and holidays are the of course going to be busy. Sadly my trip up there was not as long and meandering as I would've liked it to be, But that just motivates me to get back up there sooner than later. As I said tho.... #THE_VIEW is glorious, especially on one of those Beautiful, Clear Sunshiny California Days. I will be making a trip up there at night as well as I'm sure those twinkling Los Angeles Lights will make for a postcard worthy picture as well. To be continued (-:",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32irisa
30,Challenging visit and not worth it,Used to be able to drive up and park in lot right next to the observatory. Now you have to park on the side of the road and pay EIGHT Dollars per HOUR! Really? What a rip off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewOrleansBenmo
40,Great View of LA,Great experience.I arrived after sunset parked in the free lot by the Greek Theatre and took the shuttle bus up. Apparently payment $0.75 is optional. Plenty of free telescopes and I didn't pay for the planetarium movie and don't feel like I missed anything. Next time I'll arrive earlier and have a picnic lunch and watch the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q4813BIangelag
50,Bike ride,"I always ride my mountain bike up here at the Griffith Observatory because of the winding uphill road and the view was amazing,you can see the Hollywood sign on the background and downtown LA and widen your knowledge about our Solar system and nice place to hangout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilfredof707
40,Amazing views over LA and the Hollywood hills,Amazing place but can be busy especially at weekends and evenings. Go in the evening if you want too look through a telescope. Parking can be a nightmare at busy times. The café when we visited had a limited range of food and drink,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhW3123GU
30,Come in the morning or you will struggle,"Tried to get there the previous afternnon, the traffic and queues were so bad, vehicles were only allowed halfway up the hill you had to park and walk the rest of the way. Not my style. So I came back early the next morning, and though moderately busy, the winding road up the hill was much clearer, and we managed to get a parking space right outside the observatory building.So word of caution - don't leave it till later in the afternoon.Good views, good looking building, but nothing too special - reminded me of the Greenwich Observatory in London.On the way up by car you can get a clear view / photo opportunity of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389judee
50,Beautiful day outing,Saturday was sunny and the perfect day for a hike and a picnic. Also saw the show in the observatory to top off a wonderful day with the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45candik
50,Amazing place for nerds and children,"There are a huge planetarium and many scientific experiements that every kid you study about it someway along life. So, it's a must go place in LA. And on top of all the science, you can watch a beautiful sunset and see the city lights of the whole landscape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guilhermehott
50,See space from Earth!,"It's free, and has many different exhibits. Lots of interactive stuff. Plus a telescope that's always aimed at something and they'll tell you what you are looking at. We saw the planet Uranus when we were there.Parking is a problem though. A LONG winding road up to the observatory and parking on that road by the hour. If you underestimate how long you might be there, and have to walk down the hill to buy more parking, it's close to a mile round trip.We got there before sunset, so had a little daylight to see the city views, then watched the sunset, then saw space after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieAmy2014
50,don't miss it,if you wanna see a real piece of the moon or if you wanna touch a real meteorite you cannot skip the visit to this museum. there's also the explanation of the wireless invention from Mr. Tesla and many other attractions. The museum is modern and innovative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family_around_world
50,Fabulous views,"An unusually clear day revealed snow covered mountains, the Pacific Ocean, Hollywood sign, Beverly Hills and Downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennieK963
40,The views are amazing,"Pretty standard observatory/planetarium, great art deco interior. Exhibits weren't super modern, feels a bit dated in that respect, but maybe with kids as the audience it feels different. The location makes up for it, with the most amazing views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-MCMLX
50,Unbelievable Location,"Solar System, Space, Planets, All the Science at its best for the price of parking your car. Great for Adults, older kids and teens that are into science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise-Joe1
40,"Beautiful park, beautiful views",Absolutely stunning views. Interesting historic observatory. Great for kids as well as adults. Only problem - traffic & parking. But worth the bother!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834patriciaj
50,Great visit,"Griffith Observatory is a spectacular place to visit, inside and outside. It is something you can't describe, just visit you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaDee2013
40,Outing to Griffith Patk and the Observatory,"Took some out-of-state friends here to see a show and see the views...and we all enjoyed the time! Experienced lots of traffic driving up towards the observatory on the weekend late morning, with no available parking on the roadside, so drove down the hill and parked on one of the Greek Theatre parking lots (there was no event going on). From there, we were able to take a relatively short hike (approx 1 mile, I believe) up a moderately steep trail to the observatory.We had dropped one of the group off at the top before we drove down the hill, and he had gotten in line and got tickets for the Centered in the Universe show. (Tickets are only available onsite and day of show.) Travel through time and learn about our cosmic origins, with images displayed on the interior observatory ‘celing’!Stroll inside and see planetary related exhibits and then walk outside for expansive views from the property...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/945vala
50,"Griffith Observatory, observe Hollywood, the word and the place from here.","This place may not be easily accessible during the weekends, however, this can be negotiated with a good tour bus Team like 'A Day in LA Tours'. 60% also depends on luck too. The Hollywood sign may not be as accessible as Griffith Observatory and about a 2hrs hike on foot to the sign itself from here. This Griffith Observatory's focal point of Hollywood is beautiful, be it in the day or be it at night. Remember to travel here only during cools weather as the scorching sun will give you a different experience otherwise. Most importantly, the tip would be to avoid weekends and extreme summer period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vellone
50,A great place and a great view of LA City,"I went to this place because I’m a huge fan of Lalaland and the truth is was stunned by the show at the planetarium, it really was like watching the stars , so is a must to booked a show , there’s a special time for buying the tickets , the staff is really nice and helpful! I would recommend to take the Dash but If you don’t like waiting Uber is cheap too , there’s a cafeteria downstairs but it’s very expensive, you get an amazing view of the city , i went during the day and night , both are worth it ! I expected the place bigger , but it was okay , I would go again to a show !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodrigoSoberanis24
50,Breathtaking Views and Informative Observatory,We hiked up to the Observatory after parking in the Greek Theatre parking lot. The sunset views from the area are not to be missed! And the exhibits are well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DallasLadyT
50,Hike and view of Los Angeles,I love this place and got engaged here. There is a great little place for coffee and to start your hike and for the best avocado sandwich end your hike. It's called trails cafe. I recommend weekdays better than weekends and love an early hike or a sunset hike. Its a great place to bike ride if you are good as there are major hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandramK1219TF
50,Fun and interesting.,My kids enjoyed it. Take an Uber because parking is a nightmare. Try to plan around one of the shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mamagoose75
50,Beautiful views,"If you want an outing in the sunshine, this is a great place to go. Up high in Griffith Park is the Griffith observatory where you can learn about space. Admission is free and you can look around at the many exhibits as well as look a beautiful views of Los Angeles from up high. We had a great time. The cafe is lovely too and there is plenty of room to sit in the sun or indoors if it becomes rainy.You can pay $7 per person to go to the planetarium show and it is well worth it.Just a word of warning, if you are doing Uber to collect you, signal is bad so try to connect to the WiFi and call the Uber when inside the observatory and not at the Uber point, all signal is lost there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12sarah34
40,Stop along a tour,Very good visit. We enjoyed and highly recommend a stop to view the exhibits. It was very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller79Turks
50,Free and Fantastic,"Unbelievable that this is a free venue. Outstanding views, excellent staff, interesting exhibits. After dark, they brought 4 telescopes out to view the moon and various stars. Incredible experience. The staff working the telescopes were really helpful and friendly. Loved our time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KierstenB77
50,Educational & Entertaining,"We watched 2 back to back movies at the planetarium in addition to touring the exhibits. I highly recommend as a rainy day activity. The building is a stunning Art Deco masterpiece, the view is outstanding and the pendulum inside is mesmerizing. Only draw back is bad cell phone reception which makes connecting with an Uber driver difficult. Also, parking is extremely limited, so Uber is viable option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hillgarrison
50,Great view with so much to see!,"Our son took us here when we were visiting him in Cali. Since it was during Spring Break, it was so crowded even later in the night. We took Uber to go up to the observatory instead of free bus since there were so many people waiting! The cost was only like $5 one way to the top. Gorgeous night vista of LA, totally worth the trip there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schatz66
50,First time to LA with kids,We took them to Griffith observatory and it was a great experience. First it was a great spot to see the Hollywood sign AMD take pictures. Then we went inside and walked around a bit and did one of the showings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationmama23
50,A walk to the top and much more,Walked up to the Observatory and partook in one of the planetary presentations which was a delight. The walk up and down was well worth the effort as you got to see a wide range of views over coastal LA and the Hollywood area. You also got to appreciate the precarious foothold some of the population has in the properties spanning the many ridges and valleys in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Fires are an ever constant reminder for people in such areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwhzzi
50,Historical location with views of Hollywood and grounds are nice walk by the Hollywood sign,"The Observatory has been used in countless films, we used it when shooting Disney's ""Rocketeer"" many years ago and always a great place to go on a date, family trip or destination for a motorcycle ride. The large grass areas are great for some frisbee action and picnic on a sunny afternoon. Look for special events and observation times when things are happening in space, like eclipse or meteor shower months! Are Deco at it's best on old world LA, tons of hiking paths too all in the shadow of the iconic Hollywood sign. Instagram spot of the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grunden23
50,Worth it for the planetarium,"Great place to spend an afternoon. The views of the Hollywood sign and the hills are second to none and worth making the drive or hike up alone. Inside there's so much to see that it can get a bit overwhelming but it's well worth persevering. I highly recommend the planetarium show. It's worth checking the description and times of these in advance. They have three different shows which rotate throughout the day so if there's a specific one you want to see you can time your visit with it, otherwise you're waiting around for a couple of hours for the next one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaH932
50,Great Views Nice Hike,"Had a great time. Hike from lower parking lot was slightly strenuous, but manageable. Views were amazing. Museum was a lot of fun well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidkRNNP
50,Amazing view,"We did not get to go inside the observatory, but the view from outdoors was amazing. Great view of the Hollywood sign and of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onefrzldmom
40,"Great spot, very busy","I'm giving the observatory itself 4 stars with the caveat that the park deserves 5 and you can get most of the views that the observatory is famous for from other places in the park. The observatory is nice, it's a gorgeous building, the walking areas are great, but it is also perfect for selfies and other photos, and on any temperate day you will find it nearly impossible to get a space to yourself. The museum itself I find a bit dated but there are a few cool things in there, and it's free. I did not go to the planetarium or any other shows.The other problem with it being busy is that the parking lot overflows quickly and you have to make a long walk up the hills from whereever you can parallel park your car. So, if you are traveling with people that have some mobility issues or if you don't want to corral your kids for a 3/4 mile uphill walk bear that in mind.Certainly if you are doing any bus tours of the Hollywood Hills, etc., find one that includes this, on a tour you don't have to worry about your car or the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X975TUstevem
50,Unbelievable Views,"Went here as part of our tour and got to see some unbelievable views of the Hollywood sign.Without going to the sign itself, this is by far the best place to go to get a good shot of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgilly1980
50,Worth the detour,Featured in numerous movies this is a great place to visit not just for the observatory but also for the great views across LA and across to Santa Monica. There are also some pleasant walks to be had in the surrounding hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithMyHP
50,Yes Yes Yes See It. Here are Some Pro Tips,"You go here for epic, and I mean epic, views of LA. Day or Night. If it's clear you'll take home a memory. Here are PRO TIPS. It's on top of a hill. It will be windy, hot, or cold to whatever extreme rules the day. Parking is tough. It costs 8 bucks. If it is busy and you park downhill be ready for a walk. It does not appear long on services. So don't go looking for ice cream. There is a public toilet. There are a ton of trails for hiking. Be ready for a little LA chaos. Dive in and get your LA LA on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGaucho1987
40,Peaceful,"This is a peaceful place to be with your family and friends. It’s nice to take a look around and observe LA from a different view. The only problem it’s the parking. It’s very hard to find parking around. And most of the time it’s far away. But other than that, I definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soraias370
40,"Great views, disorganised and expensive parking",Arrived about 5pm on a winter weekday and most vehicles being turned away from the parking entrance. We were sent down the hill and managed to catch another car leaving a space. it was an expensive $8 an hour to park and it took 30 minutes to walk from the parking space to the Observatory and back with poor pedestrian walkways for much of the way. When we walked up to the Observatory we found more than 20 empty parking spaces at the top lot. It was strange that the distant street parking was the same hourly rate as that on the doorstep.The Observatory inside was overcrowded. There seemed to be lots of tour groupsOutside was a super view of greater Los Angeles and more room.The Observatory exterior is looking much more renovated than my last visit quite a number of years ago. It's popularity has also increased a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clifton123

40,Fantastic views of LA and the Hollywood Sign,"We went on a 7 and a half hour day trip of LA, which included Griffith Park. So much to see inside the observatory and fantastic views of LA. You really appreciate the sheer size of LA and the great distances between areas. More importantly it’s totally free to visit, Brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SagaloutsTour
50,"Great views but the Observatory is fun, too",I think most people come here for the views of LA but the Observatory itself is very good. We arrived late in the morning and people were stopping to pay all along the drive up. We kept going and got our pick of a few paid spaces next to the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S463LQmikee
50,Family Hike!,We found a great parking spot near the top and walked the rest of the way up to the Observatory. I would recommend 1 hr to see and take pictures. We did not do the show as it was really busy on Saturday. The views of the city and Hollywood city are wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532martyp
40,Amazing views!,"If you want one of the best views of the Hollywood sign, then go up to the Observatory! The rest of the views over LA are spectacular too. The observatory is a must visit as well, with the different areas and planetarium show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ian1811

50,Wonderful view... Freebe,The observatory is an wonderful overlook of the City of Los Angels and the Hollywood sign as well. If you drive up before the observatory opens there is plenty of free parking. Parking is normally $8/hour but only when the observatory is actually open. You have outside access to the whole outside of the observatory. Please check the hours of operation prior to driving up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poingdexter

50,Beautiful Views,"Nice place to view the city of LA and also the Hollywood Sign. There's also a vast amount of information and cool things to see & do once inside. Would love to go back to see the views at night. Of course, if you go during a busy time, you may have to trek up to the Observatory (which sits ontop a mountain) or catch a shuttle bus (highly recommended for about $1).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadeeVee

50,Interesting,"Went on a tour in LA because the weather wasn't very good which included a visit to Griffith Observatory. Very very interesting .... it makes you think that maybe we aren't the only ones. Loved the weighing machines which tells you what your weight would be on a certain planet - I'm going to live on the moon (I was lightest there). Definitely worth a visit and, as a bonus, a good place to view the Hollywood sign. Apparently at 8 pm they open the telescope - the clouds were thick so we didn't return in the evening - but would definitely do it on our next trip to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954suzanneg
50,Updated equipment and Displays in a Vintage Building,"The Griffith Observatory can get crowded, so if it's best visited on a school day when most kids are in class.

50,Great view of LA,Nice free place to visit. Advise getting there before it opens so it is easier to get parking and avoid the crowds. Can get a really nice view of LA and the observatory itself is interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WCL1982
50,Great views of LA,"Excellent exhibits for those interested in science and astronomy. Great views of Los Angeles for those who don't. Admission is free but there's a fee to enter the Planetarium.You can get there via Uber or Lyft or via DASH bus. But if you're bringing a car, you have two choices: Park for free at the foot of the hill and ride the bus for $4 / person or walk. There is supposed to be another parking lot that's closer but you have to pay around $8 at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hizonfire
50,Great place to roll into,"The observatory is on a hill near central Los Angeles and if you are lucky to have a clear day the views and perspective are wonderful. From the Hollywood sign to the off shore islands and high rise island at City Hall all the way to Westwood, the panorama is fantastic. Allow plenty of time as the exhibits are great and the presentations are well worth the price of admission. The full facility is wheel chair friendly and the staff are super helpful for show seating as well as well appointed ramps and access to all of the major view points. As a born in LA but long displaced Angelino, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the whole of the facility. Whether you are new to LA or homegrown like me, this is a great venue like no other. We spent five hours there but I would allow at least three. We saw several of the shows and the domed presentation and the ""scripts"" were both entertaining and informative from the science perspective. I would put this one on your must see list. Lots of wheelchair friendly parking and again a multi-faceted facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeaH8025ZL
40,Day trip to Griffith’s,"Great place for all ages to explore and also enjoy the scenery. The parking is limited and can be difficult to find. But admission is free and the exhibits, although old, are interesting. There is a show, which has a charge, but it’s interesting and the seats are very comfortable. If you go visit the lowest floor, there are some cool exhibits and a free movie narrated by Leonard Nimoy, which discusses how the observatory building was built and later updated. There is also a snack bar, you can have a meal or just a snack. Plan on spending several hours at least, or if you have a lot of free time, after visiting the observatory, drive on over to the zoo, which is nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anniversarytrip10
50,It's worth it just for the view,"I love the educational aspects of the Observatory. But if you don't wish to go inside, getting there at sunset is a spectacular way to see the City of Angles from a high vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer649924
50,Best place to see The Hollywood sign!,"Plus Griffith Park, the observatory and the view of downtown LA is unrivaled. After noon you have to pay parking so save your money and visit in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ky_traveler2010
50,A Learning Experience at the Griffith Observatory,"I really enjoyed the morning excursion I took to the Griffith Observatory. One highlight is the free documentary which tells the history of the observatory and land around it. There are choices of other movies to watch also. We weren't able to reach the upper level due to rain, so I can't comment on that, but walking around the outer perimeter of the building provides excellent views of Los Angles and the hiking trails below. Exhibits within the observatory are most interesting: one can spend more than one day to take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmdeb777

50,"Great Place to visit, “must do”!","This was awesome! Park at the bottom of the hill, it is free parking next to the greek theatre, then take the bus up the hill ( or walk if you like a hike uphill!) to the Observatory. It was super busy this day as it was a blood moon. It has a great educational aspect with interesting things to see and learn. Great architechture too. You have terriic LA views and can see the Hollywood sign in the background, which you can hike to if you wish. Definately a good half day trip or whole day if you hike the mountains. ENJOY!!

40,Nice views,"Decided late in the day to go Griffith. Being a bit of a cheap skate we didn’t want to pay for parking so parked at the bottom car park which is free and hiked the 1 mile to the observatory. I later decided that the $8 per hour parking was reasonable and the hike was a bit of an effort as there were many signs that said we were only able to park there until sunset which was about half an hour after we arrived. I asked the information staff at the top who confirmed this but I’m still not sure this is the case. Anyway we got up and back down the trail, had a good look around at the top with out mishap. Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mummied
50,"A ""must see"" L.A. attraction.","A great educational experience for kids and adults alike. High above the city, views from here extend across the city to the ocean beyond.

50,Stunning views of LA - just avoid the smog,"This place is spectacular in terms of the views across Los Angeles - actually took my breath awayWhat made it even more brilliant was that above the hustle and bustle of the city you get relative silence...apart from a bit of wind and natureI visited here about 330pm and it was just starting to get busy with families - but there’s so much room it doesn’t get overcrowded or congestedOn a smoggy day it can be a pain to see anything apart from clouds, so do your best to avoid those days as it’s a wasted journey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongreladam
40,Recommend when visiting LA,"Visited during our first time trip to LA, it was a weekday but extremely busy, if you have your own transport may have difficulty parking. Unfortunately we didn’t have the clearest of days but still great to see the different views across LA. We were slightly timed as our taxi was waiting but noticed some hiking trails I would have liked to have walked if I had more time. Would love to watch sunset on a clear day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmlreviews

40,Good for budding astronomers,"After the steep but satisfying climb through Griffith Park, we made it to the Observatory - which opened at midday on the Wednesday we visited - and looked around at the astronomical and interactive features inside. Impressive displays include pieces of meteorites which you can touch. Worthy of a visit as admission is totally free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09

20,Grat Views,"Dissappointed after walking all the way up the hill to get there, the telescopes were closed! Great views though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347MariaG
50,A beautiful view of the Los Angeles area,The planetarium opens at Noon but you can visit earlier and parking until Noon is free. We visited at 10 a.m. and was able to walk around taking pictures of the Los Angeles area and it has the best view for the Hollywood sign. We spent about an hour there but there is a walking trail right near the parking lot that looked easy to navigate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaSue24
50,Beautiful views of the city,"Went here twice during my trip with my cousin, once during the day when the observatory was closed and once during the evening. Being there during the day meant we were able to see the city as a whole and how vast it was, along with the Hollywood sign though still pretty small in the background. There are a couple of hiking routes that you can take too.When we revisited during the evening and the sun was setting it was amazing to see the lights of the city and the sun setting.We paid about $8 to head in to watch the show inside the observatory which was definitely worth it.Parking was free, but the walk to the top was quite long and steep so anyone in a wheelchair or who struggles to walk long distances might struggle. There is parking at the top if you're lucky.Would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amiehs9
50,Great site to visit when in L.A.,Highly recommend a visit to Griffith Observatory when in L.A. The exhibits are well done and informative if you have any interest in astronomy. The planetarium show was also excellent. The only downside of our visit was the unavailability of the main telescope due to maintenance. Park for free in the Greek Theater lot and enjoy the views during the 20 minute walk up to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerekGittoes
50,"Educational, fun and free",Fun evening trip you get to see the LA city lights and about planets all for free you can give a small donation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anarP3422CR
50,Views and learning,"The Griffith Observatory is an amazing place to visit for so many reasons.1. You can learn a lot about space! The exhibits inside are amazing. They have a Tesla coil demonstration every few hours where they turn it on, it’s amazing. They have a shadow-box periodic table of elements with almost every element shown- I couldn’t get my son who is taking Chemistry away from it. There’s a planetarium, and a whole lot more.2. The 360 degree views of LA are amazing. You can see the Hollywood sign pretty close (in the daytime, no it’s not lit up at night).3. At night they have telescopes set up outside on the right hand wall, set on different things to view (Mars, star clusters, a nebula...). There are brilliant people there to explain things :) The famous rooftop telescope is under repair for the next few months, but they say the outside set ups are actually stronger, it’s just that people get disappointed because the rooftop one is famous!4. The building itself is architecturally amazing! There are Greek designs all over it, the domes are impressive, there are winding stairs up to the roof, and there are viewing balconies that stretch all along the back.5. Don’t worry if you have to park down the hill. You can either get some exercise or pay $.50 per person to take a bus up (and down) from right next to parking lot H (Greek Theater). By the way, there’s a bathroom in lot H also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenRed2014
50,It's worth the hype,"So on our first trip to LA every Lyft driver recommended Griffith observatory. We wanted to be outdoors and we weren't sure what to expect when coming here. Omg...the drive up the mountain you see such amazing scenery then getting up it...omg the sights are outstanding and it's FREE! You see the Hollywood sign, all of LA pretty much everything! Just beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9487JPstephaniea

50,"Wonderful views, science too","We went at dusk on a Saturday evening- we drove and I have difficulty walking. Signs indicated that the top car park was full, but we persisted to the top hoping to find a disability spot. Our patience paid off and we found a spot in the top car park very close to the observatory- not specifically disability- but it didn’t matter.Paid for two hours parking- which was just the right amount of time for us.The views were magnificent as the sun was setting- we were just a few minutes late for good photos of the Hollywood sign as the light was fading.Inside the observatory was very packed. You only need to purchase tickets if you want to see a show. Otherwise everything is free.Lifts available and enough seating to rest if required.Only strange thing was that the telescopes on the roof top weren’t functioning- yet the signs were pointing to them- so we went up there - had a great view - but were a bit lost as to how to get in to the telescope observatory- to find they weren’t working.Nonetheless inside there was a giant moon, lots of exhibits teaching about- literally- everything under the sun and beyond.Kids were enjoying themselves, lots of couples and groups.Definitely a very busy place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiC7

50,Worth the Drive !,Came here as we were looking for another way to see the famous Hollywood sign. The sign was definitely farther away than the neighborhood route but what a find !! Very popular attraction with free admittance. Packed with stories of the solar system and cosmos. A centrally placed pendulum that proved the earth turns by knocking down tiles as it swings. Many exhibits but the views. The views !! LA in the distance ; the Hollywood sign and the San Bernardino mountains ( I think !!). Covered mountaintop with the heavy recent snows. Paid parking in the lot but the rest was gratis.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celticcutie

Not only do you get to breath in all the natural and man-made beauty that LA has to offer, but you also get to take in as many scientific facts as you can handle inside the observatory. This is really a place of awe and wonder. The periodic table with actual elements inside was probably my favorite part of the indoor exhibit, the scientist in me loved this!

50,The Griffith Observatory...ROCKS!!!!!!!,"This is one of the few Amazing places in my home town! I feel like it is the Guardian of The City of Angels.It is our Sentinel...protecting us from our enemies, ensuring that we will always be able to gaze up to the heavens without hesitation and welcome the celestial spirits to come visit L.A.The experience will change your life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gruvmusic
50,Beautiful views and architecture + Free parking 👍,I parked at the free parking lot. I think it was Lot G. There is a mens/women's rest room there. I walked up the hill and it took about 10 minutes for a average build 45 year old Male. The views were spectacular! It was busy for a Frisay morning. Traffic around there ro go on the 5 south was brutal. Great free attraction with great opportunities for selfies 🤩,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yorkie1552
50,A Must Do Experience,"A great place to take out of town visitors. On a clear day you can see downtown and the surrounding area. Park at the top near the observatory. $6.00 for 2 hours. Otherwise you park on the road up to the top. It can be a long steep walk. Big crowds especially on weekends. Admission is free. Once inside there is a lot to see. If you have ever wondered about the history of the universe a great place to visit. Also free shows,though some require a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616howardm
40,Beautiful City Lights,"This is a beautiful place to be for a romantic evening. At night you can see all the city lights. The Observatory is also beautiful inside. It is a great place to also see the Hollywood sign.Parking is always challenging here. The fact that they charge for street parking is just something that doesn't seem right. Theres never parking in the lot and the last few times, its just better to park on the bottom and hike instead of visiting the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhplaskett13
50,Must Visit,"Griffith is just one of those places you must visit whether you are a visitor to LA or a resident. The views from there are incredible and the observatory exhibits are interesting and educational. We have taken my young granddaughters to visit twice since the new exhibits downstairs are finished. Great family outing. If you have time and are in shape, hike up the trail. It's a great hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8683ODlindab
50,A Must See in LA,"If you do nothing else while in LA, take a trip to the Griffith Observatory. If you have some hutspah, you can take a hike up to the observatory or you can drive right up to the site. The views are spectacular on a clear day and the observatory itself is full of information on celestial navigation, and all things planetary, including our space ventures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljlavender
50,The Place!,It is a magical place with incredible views. You can visit the interior and attend the functions that the planetarium offers as well as learn about the sun and our neighboring planets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ric-litvi
50,Walk up! Worth it,"Getting to Griffith is awesome -- gives you a great view of the city, and the architecture and astronomical offerings at the observatory are a beauty as well.There's a case 'The Trails Cafe' down near the bottom of the road. You can easily park here, for free, on the side of the road and take either of the foot paths through the little park/past the bathrooms for a 'hike' up to the top.The paths are pretty similar, but I normally take the route on the left. Makes for a more active, more scenic, more involved and grounded way to experience Griffith (and avoids all the cars, buses, tours, and parking mayhem up at the top).It makes the view at the top feel deserved. Make sure you walk up with enough time to walk down when there is still some sunlight (although watching the sunset from the top is very nice) .. or make sure you have some light. The path up/down is not well-lit otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpedicone28
50,Proposal with family,Great Views! Great hiking trail right next to it. I proposed to my now fiancé at the top of the building! It is family friendly just not stroller friendly. I had to carry it up the stairs myself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary814862
50,A must visit for all in LA,"Last Month I took my wife to the Observatory. I have been many times taking Boy Scouts and other youth groups but this was the first time my wife had been even though we have lived here 43 years. We when in the day and she loved it. You get to see a great view of the city plus the observatory. Beware that there are many tours so be prepared to wait, park long distance away and walk. If you have handicap parking it is close. I recommend that you have someone drive everyone and drop them off then schedule a pickup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simimike
50,Amazing Views of the City and the Hollywood sign,This is one of our favorite destinations when we host visitors in LA. The views are amazing and the Observatory itself is a beautiful testament to Astronomy and Science. The weekends are crowded so I recommend going on a week day as early as you can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phadrus00
50,Majestic view of greater LA skyline!,"Wonderful view of the city from the property. Great part of a city tour when on vacation. Recommend for single travelers, couples or families. Driving through a beautiful neighborhood, too as you get to observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318ilenes
40,Beautiful and interesting spot in LA!,Been to LA lots of times and never visited before. You can drive up and park and it might be a hike to the observatory but it's a nice hike with a bit of exercise. Great views of LA. It was crowded. Been in recent movies. Interesting exhibits and well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zach84Jake62
40,Hollywood sign,"Went here because it was near the hotel and is a tourist destination. It was closed today (monday). But you can still walk around the outside and the park. There was plenty of parking up top, but also on the road going and leaving. You can get great views of the hollywood sign, city, ocean, nice homes, and mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chevyjlewis
50,A great view,"The observatory itself is interesting, and has a lot of nice features, but the trip is worth to just observe the view over Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirjoe676
30,"Good, but very crowded","The Planetarium show was excellent, but we had to stand in line for about 20 minutes. The entire observatory was so overcrowded that it was difficult to view exhibits. We went the last week of December, so I would expect the overcrowding situation is not a constant problem. The hike to the observatory should be skipped. Due to recent fires the scenery is not ideal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellensvacation
50,The best views of LA!,"We arrived at the Observatory not long before sunset, by that point there were a lot of people but it was worth it for the views across the entire city. I can’t think of a better spot to take a photo of LA as the sun goes down.The planetarium is also worth making time to see, the shows run for about 30 mins and were less than $10 for a ticket.The only caution I would give is that it’s a bit of a pain to get to, whether you drive or take a bus or an Uber so keep this in mind when you plan your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowellyBear
50,great!!!,"one of the Best in the world ,not only for science.Best for children between 8 and 18 but for adults too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hamstersdoc
40,"Small science center, nice park",Went and visited this observatory. The outside has some great views of Los Angles on a clear day. Luck for us it was. Could see the ocean. The inside is mostly free you can get tickets for the planetarium show. Was a little crowded and the parking lot was filled right by the Observatory. There was parking down in G lot and the bus cost 50 cents a trip(exact change only) arrives every 20 mins but the line was crazy long. Chose to walk up the 4/5 of a mile trail and beat the bus up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnako

50,Wonderful experience.,"I requested information , to the Hotel Concierge where I was staying, for some interesting place to visit and they recommended me to visit the ""Griffith Observatory"". I did, and I loved the experience. I have been many times to Los Angeles and I had never visited the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piquisr

50,Amazing views!,"Such an amazing place to visit! We took the 1st bus up there, and the road to get there is also worth the ride! Once on top, the views are spectacular! Well worth the time to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie
50,Amazing views and really educational,"We visited intending to see the Hollywood Sign, but wow what a learning experience the Observatory is. Our kids learnt soo much visiting here, this was a great experience as we are home schooling our kids on our travels. Highly recommended and free. An absolute must do if you are visiting LA and want to see the Hollywood sign, the only thing you need to do is pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787bevang
50,The best view of LA!,"Seriously, this is the best view of Los Angeles, especialy when a weather is pretty good. Parking is not for free, you hve to buy time ticket at the machine. Monday is closing day, so if you want to come in, choose another day. Also, nice walk is by Charlie Turner Trailhead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinperina
40,Great views!,"Managed to take some really good photos of the city and the park from here, the observatory itself is also a really cool building in itself. Quite busy, expect to queue for the toilets if you need them. No general parking so expect a walk or get a tour/public transport to take you up. We parked down near the theatre and had a walk up, would recommend but the roads are steep!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattS921207
50,Aweome art deco masterpiece,"always a must visit whilst in LA. make sure to spend some time hiking in the hills behind the observatory. a favorite thing of mine to do is to hike all the way up to the hollywood sign from here, and take the path of the ""tree of life"" (western side of hollywood mountain) down to the hollywood reservoir and then uber back to my car at the observatory. nice little adventure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695giacomos
50,Nice hike with rewarding view,"Though very dry and so dusty it's a nice hike up to the observatory. Along the way you may find beautiful spots to take pictures and on top you can rest, drink or eat something and stroll back down. Must do when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/503elsj
50,Top of La La Land,"Since the movie, all our visitors from out of town want to come to the Griffith’s Park Observatory! And it really is quite worthwhile. You can walk all around the Observatory and see Los Angeles spread around below. The building is interesting in design and can be toured inside. The Hollywood sign is clearly visible and quite close from the parking lot, and there are many hiking trails in every direction. We enjoy the hikes especially in the Spring when there are many wildflowers in bloom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wonder80
50,Amazing,"Beautiful site to visit, whether it's your first time in L.A. or a lifelong resident. It's a spacious area simply hanging out and enjoying the sights. Without a doubt the best time to visit is at sunset, an experience like no other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
50,So surprised!,We hiked up and back from Hollywood Blvd - and 6 miles in good neighborhoods. We’re so surprised!! Can’t wait to take the kids back to explore this amazing science center and planetarium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravlLuv
40,Beautiful views of LA and Hollywood sign. Great to watch the sunset.,"Visited Griffith Observatory 2x, once during the middle of the week in February and once on a Saturday late afternoon in December. Definitely not as crowded during middle of week, no issue with parking etc. On the Saturday we went it was very crowded and only by sheer luck did not have to park over a mile away and walk. The views during sunset are fabulous but crowded. I am not a big fan of museum inside but science is over my head. Nice that it is all free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianebQ5995ZE
50,Good for all ages,I'm a middle-aged Southern California Native and I've always enjoyed this place as a kid as an adult,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7232OZkathym
40,Top of the World (in LA anyway)...,"A quick visit for the first time since I moved to LA. Happened by accident when I was visiting the American Film Institute, looked up and spotted the Observatory glowing in the early evening sun; been to AFI lots of times and never realized it was so close. Had an hour to kill so I ventured into the park and wound around the two-mile road to the top. You get several looks at the Observatory on the way up and down but there is no place to pull over until you are coming down. I didn't have time to go in (besides it cost $8 to park) so I turned around at the summit and came back down. There is free parking down below and hiking trails but it's a long way up. The park is nice, some picnic tables, but only porta-potties. The Observatory is open after dark and it is a great place to view the night sky, like during the recent wolf blood moon eclipse. You can see all of downtown LA from up there (if it's clear) and the only higher place in LA is Mount Wilson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardJ3
40,Best Views of LA,The Griffith observatory is such a great place to go and hang out day or night. No matter if the Sun is up or down you have great views of Los Angeles. It definitely puts the whole city into a different perspective. The inside is also great for those who have interests in the sky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalguy7979
50,Too cool not to miss,"Even if the Observatory is closed when you want to visit, it’s worth popping up to view the Hollywood sign on s clear day. But bring a zoom lense as the sign is a fair distance away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDNinHK
50,Day visit,"Full of loads of interesting, interactive facts & information. Really great views of the city skyline & fantastic hiking all around!DEFINITELY visit when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamessM3795FY
50,Iconic landmark with an amazing view of LA,One or the must places to visit in LA. It is one of iconic places to visit and the views of LA and the Hollywood sign are worty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/463pedrof
50,Beautiful View of LA,A must visit in LA. Great exhibition and displays. We hear Parking can be a hassle but we got there early and there were no problems whatsoever. You get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign and a beautiful view of Holly Wood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseRSC
50,Brilliant views over LA,"The views are stunning, and plenty of tracks to go hiking. Didn't get much time to see the inside of the observatory, but the little I saw was interesting. Would like to go again and spend more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sukhjiwanh
50,Amazing views,There is a cheap bus up the hill to the Observatory. It is worth the visit. The views are amazing so make sure to go on a clear day. You can see the Hollywood sign in the distance. There's a cafe and lots of places to sit and lots to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda454
50,Iconic place,"For sure you want to visit this place, as it grants you unforgettable views over LA, which literally lays all over the valley around you. Great hiking trails all around, and beautiful nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddykgbs
50,"A Fun, Free Activity!","Griffith Observatory is a great place to visit with family and friends, and especially with people visiting LA! It is free to enter and free to park. There are some pretty cool, informative astronomy exhibits and they do a demonstration of their Tesla coil every so often in the building. You can purchase tickets to one of their planetarium shows, which are $7 each for adults.Parking can get full quite easily, so be prepared to park a little way down the hill and walk up to the building. Otherwise I believe there is a shuttle that you can book on the observatory's website.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aleenaluisier
50,Amazing overview of LA,"If you're bored easily by science exhibits, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if finding out how much you weigh on Neptune or getting a live view of Venus through a powerful telescope sounds like an interesting way to pass your afternoon, definitely don't miss the Griffith Observatory. First off, admission is free, but it's $8/person to take the shuttle up. You need to pre-pay for your shuttle online at Griffith's website before arriving. We chose the L.A. Zoo/Observatory satellite parking lot (free parking) instead of Hollywood/Highland (mall parking fees). Definitely arrive EARLY for your shuttle. We were 3 minutes late and our shuttle had left already. We were told we could take the shuttle scheduled for 20 minutes later IF there was space. We got 3 out of 6 onto it, the other 3 of us had to stand for the whole ride. It's about 20 minutes to the Observatory. We got there around 2:30 on a Saturday and immediately went to buy Planetarium tickets. It's $7/person, $5/student or senior. Overall, $15/person total (or $13) is pretty cheap for the entire experience. There was no significant line for the planetarium tickets at this time. However, when we left the place closer to 6pm, the line was HUGE. I guess it was everyone coming in the evening to see the sunset from up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherylyTT
30,Great for those who love science and astronomy,We were tired after our hike to the Hollywood sign and then back down to the Observatory so we didn't have a ton of patience for this place. Also we went during the day so there wasn't as much to see in terms of stars. We walked through the first floor and the things we saw were interesting but not super kid friendly. It felt more like a school trip to my kids than a family vacation. We have been to science centers and museums in the past that kept them more entertained but again that may have been their exhaustion talking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tziviar
40,Great spot,The views are great and a perfect opportunity for a shot of the Hollywood sign if you do nothing else,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outalot307
50,Awesome views of Los Angeles,Worth a trip. If you go on the weekend take advantage of the shuttle buses from the lower parking lots. You can see the Hollywood sign off the side,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdbauder
50,Excellent free displays,You could spend a lot of time looking at all the free space related displays here. We visited after dark and there was a nice view down into the city. We did have to park in the lower lot and wait for the bus (50 cents per person) up to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nrk_13

50,Excellent,Arrived here after a long day hiking. The sun was setting and the observatory was very interesting .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barnicleLondon
50,"So much to like: the views, the exhibits, the trails and more","While not easy to get to the Griffith Observatory is not easy (there is public transportation but parking can get full very quickly necessitating either a long walk or shuttle bus ride) it's absolutely worth the journey. The iconic Art Deco building is not only the site of many famous movie scenes (Rebel Without a Cause, La La Land and many more) but it has great exhibits on astronomy, the sun and planets and more. There are also the views, which are stunning, and the many trails that snake through the surrounding park which also offer great views over Los Angeles. Entrance is free as is parking but there will be crowds (on weekends).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
50,Nice ride - great museum - mesmerizing vista,Pretty everything is in the title. Take one afternoon to enjoy the museum the view and to ride in the valley.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSiward

40,Nice views from there,"We went there on a cold but sunny day. The views from there are fantastic. We parked for free at one of the parkings and then took a shuttle bus that took us until the observatory. The observatory has nice exhibits and shows at the planetarium. Great destination. It's usually crowded, specially on sunny weekends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robsonjordao
30,You can see Hollywood Sign here,"We drove to Griffith Observatory to see the Hollywood sign from there. We bought an hour parking pass ($8 per hour in 2019) from a machine on the road up to the Observatory. You leave the ticket on your dashboard while parked. There is a small lot for parking right at the building and then more parking along the side of the road on the way up. At the bottom of the hill is a park and ride lot ...you park and pay a smaller fee to ride up to the building on the bus. If I had known of that option, I probably would have done that instead to save money. If you wish to take your time and enjoy the Observatory and the spectacular views, I would recommend longer than one hour of parking. The main telescope I wanted to see was closed for work on the day I visited. The Observatory opens at noon and stays open until 10 pm, so the telescopes would really be good at night. Worth a stop for a quick visit at the Observatory and for the great city views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2doglady
40,its a pain to park but its worth it,"we were there on new years eve weekend so it was a bit crowded. Thankfully we entered on the other side of the parkway so we didn't have as much traffic but it was a pain to find a parking spot. Took a mile walk from our spot to get up the the observatory but it was worth it, the views were breathtaking. The science museum was fantastic, some great exhibits. Oh if you are a woman there is a huge bathroom on the very lowest level so you don't have to wait as long as some of the other floors which only have a couple stalls",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staceyo721
50,Touring the Observatory,"We visited the observatory and toured the museum section. We would have liked to take in a planetarium show, but the timing wasn't right. The museum displays are great...VERY educational and fun. The grounds are well kept. We were amazed to see how close this past summer's fires came to the structure. Well worth the walk up the hill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giwpriestap
40,Great View of the Hollywood sign,We went to the Griffith Observatory during a time that was considered off peak and it was still crazy busy. I would suggest going earlier in the day. The views were awesome. It was worth the time and effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndianapolisSunshine
40,First Visit,"Relatively small but lovely facility.Strongly recommend that you go late on a weekday so you can see Los Angeles at nighttime which is quite spectacular.You really can't spend much more than a couple of hours there so depending on the time of year, I would get there by sunset and stay until moon rise as a bright moon interferes with viewing of the stars by telescope on the front lawn.The paid shows are quite good. The 30 minutes 360 degree performance is worth the $5-$7 admission. But one show is enough for me.Small exhibits are quite interesting but there are not a lot of them. Tesla coil demonstration is cool.PARKING: Unless you are fit for a mile plus trek uphill to the observatory, I would suggest foregoing the free lot and drive up to the top. Roadside or observatory lot parking is very expensive but it allows you to skip the painful walk. Parking fee is $8 an hour from a ticket machine enforced regularly by park rangers. So just pay for the ticket and call it admission since it is otherwise free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965keitht
40,Great attraction,"One of the best attractions in L.A, the admission is free and there is a parking just outside for $8,Definitely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalimDZ82
40,Good Hike,"We got lost trying to get to the observatory, but the hike was still great! Wish they sold waters throughout the trails/at the observatory but they do not so bring lots of it. Get really good views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmf417
50,A unique place,"This is one must see destination for everyone. The observatory has many exhibits. Not only is the telescope often available for visitors to see through, but there are many exhibits explaining in easy to understand ways, all about our solar system. There is a solar telescope too, and a real periscope from a submarine. The views from the observatory are spectacular, both during the day as well as after dark. Best of all, everything is free except the planetarium. Parking can sometimes be problematic. There are also hiking trails that are quite nice. This is a destination that one enjoys coming to, again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrchestraConductor
50,Awesome visit. And it’s freeeeee!,"Loved our visit to the Griffith Observatory. We took an Uber up. We were there about an hour. There’s plenty to see and lots of cool photo oops. It’s free to go, but it was rather busy even at closing time. Phone service is poor so be aware of that when you call your Uber to go back down!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815maryz
40,Well presented exhibits,"My sister (visiting from Michigan) and I toured the Observatory, saw the films, and ate lunch in the cafeteria. It was a good afternoon. Having a scheduled time for the show helped us to plan out day. I recommend reserving that as soon as you arrive (for a fee at the booth to the left of the entry doors). The space exhibit and entry way jewelry display were the highlights for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitan434

50,Best view over Los Angeles,"I first learned about this place from watching Rebel Without a Cause years back and I always wanted to see it. Roll forward 30 something years and it happened. Our initial attempt at visiting was on a typical late summer evening in the hire car but this turned into a poor choice as hundreds of others were doing the same thing. The steep approach road was jammed so we decided to bail. A jet lagged 04:00 wide awake start saw the next attempt the following day at 04:30 in the early morning cool. Only two of us walking around with a just a few serious photographers taking in the shimmering vast expanse of Los Angeles. The building inaugurated in 1935 still looks like new, maybe because of the Mediterranean climate. Hang around and watch the sun appear from the East. Beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4942JBjohns
50,A great view of the city,"We visited the observatory for the infamous Hollywood sign to take pictures. The observatory itself was nice, full of space exhibits and shows to watch if you buy a ticket. We just walked through to see everything. Took alot of pictures for the views. Would recommend more so for the views, the observatory was pretty crowded with school groups on a Friday- weather was really nice after 2 days of rain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandaRenee84
50,A must stop while visiting LA!!!,We went to the Observatory today and had a fantastic time. There is so much to see and the view is just amazing. We parked down by the Greek Theatre and they have shuttle buses that will take you up to the top for 50 cents for adults each way.We saw the short film In the theatre but unfortunately didn’t have time to watch one of the Planetarium shows. We will definitely come back again some time. This is really a must do while visiting LA.There is a cafe as well as a nice gift shop you can stop in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieNH
50,The Real Stars of Hollywood Hang Out HERE!,"Maps are not necessary, but good walking shoes will help you ENJOY this hilltop view of the city and beyond.

50,Nice clean park- see the Hollywood sign and look down at LA,My husband and I visited Griffith Park and walked down the trails. Park was very clean and bathrooms were nice. You could see the Hollywood sign and look down on LA to see everything! A great visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaC2370
50,Not To Be Missed,"On your tour of LA, the observatory is iconic from many movies you have seen as well as educational if you have grown up in SoCal.On a clear day the view is amazing, you are able to see downtown to the ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zapprint
50,Cant get any better for views!!!,Just breathtaking. Loved it. The breeze was great. Great place for hike and picnic. First time in LA and it was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khristinaa2013
50,Great views,"Great spot for watching the sunset - we came in Jann around 5pm and managed to catch beautiful views of Los Angeles - you really do feel like on a movie scene. Some scenes of La La Land were filmed here (dancing scene), so worth a visit for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoLdn
50,Griffith observatory educational and breathtaking view,Beside seeing the stars u can see the Hollywood signcloser and the whole city view. Relaxing and windy. There are educational exhibits about astronomy and science. There is a show so worth checking it out !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirleyho13
50,First time,"We arrived on a Friday night in January to a full moon and clear skies. The view was spectacular and the crowds were manageable. Unfortunately all the car parks close to the observatory had car park full signs so we parked a long way away, paid our $10.00 parking and set off for the hill. It was only as we got to the very top did we see a shuttle bus pass us 🤣I enjoyed it but would do it differently next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carisbrook77
40,An L.A. area must,"Not an OMG place, but always a good trip and always something a bit different to see. Great for families, for hanging out with friends, and even for a date night. Beautiful views of the city and the skies, plus you may learn a thing or two about the universe in which we live. Viewing a planet through the main telescope is fun, but you can usually see about the same through the telescopes set up on the lawn, plus you get a bit more background from discussion with the astronomers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwX2677ZI
50,Free and awesome!,I visited the place with my wife and little son and we all had a great day. To start with how beautiful the landscape is at the Griffith park. Entrance at the park and the observatory is free and they also offer free parking spots (not very close to the observatory - 0.4 mi). At the observatory level you will also be able to see and take very nice pictures with the famous HOLLYWOOD sign. If you are expecting to park at the entrance of the observatory be prepared to pay 8$ per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minardi_C
40,I love coming here!!,"The Observatory is the place to go if you want the best view of Los Angeles! You can see the Hollywood sign, the city lights, and a killer view if you go at sunset. Inside the observatory you can check out all the cool gidgets and information they have about astronomy. You can also see a cool show in their planetarium where if feels like you're actually in space! The experience is mostly free unless you plan on seeing the show which is about $7 for adults, $3 for children under 12, and $5 for college students with an ID.The only bad thing I will say is that parking is a pain in the butt :( other than that it's an amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferfix

50,The most exciting place I´ve visited,"When I got to the observatory I saw a lot of new couples, maybe on their first dates. After the visit I could understand why.

30,Very crowded and bad parking,"It has a nice view day and nite. Try to go on a clear day with no smog then you can see more. Very interesting things inside to see. The lazer shows are great, but don’t know if they still have them . Check first. Parking is really bad and limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goshop58
50,Who knew learning was fun!,The whole family went. It was our first time all going together. What a beautiful view and so much to learn.

50,The real stars are here.,"What a true pleasure it was visiting the Griffiths Observatory. From its history (donated and privately funded and FREE!) to the beautiful grounds and paths to the helpful and totally engaging staff, my experience was, in a word, magical. Pendulums proving the rotation of the earth. My weight on other planets. Meteorite education. Telescopes on the lawn pointing at different celestial objects nightly. I left grinning and feeling my inner geek completely content. Didn’t pay for the one show that cost something, but I’m sure it was cool.Parking was about $15 / hour I think, and you will get a ticket if you don’t feed your meter. Well worth the cost. The bus is only like $1 from the bottom of the mountain so that’s a great alternative. So much fun. Don’t miss your chance to take a pic with Albert!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamilia2018

50,Fun way to spend the day!,The views are stellar and the exhibitions are really great! Loved the room with all the planets in sizes in relation to each other and scales that tell you how much you would weigh on each planet. See the movie that is screened on the ceiling!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381KarenH
40,A lovely view,"A great place to visit, very pleasant and generally informative, though could do with a bit of updating and some more interactive element for children and bigger children. Would strongly advise going to see one of the Plantarium shows, they make the visit all the better. From the outside not only is the building stunning but the views over LA are really beautiful and there are local walks through the nearby hills. Just be aware that you can’t park on site and though there is a bus service you might be more inclined to get a taxi or Uber up and back for speed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_Naga
40,Parent,Fantastic view . Inside excellent on space and earth parking ample . Shows were great 👍 🌒🌍🌏🌙🌔 time it takes to do all in the observatory is about 2 hrs and walk around to see the city of Los Angeles from heights,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mahomedg2014

40,Iconic Hollywood Landmark w Awesome Views of LA,"I love to park near the Greek Theater, and hike up to the Observatory using the many winding hiking trails. And now with the trails marked on the various internet maps, that's easy to do even for tourists.However, you don't want to be all sweaty if you're going to go into the Observatory and see one of the great Planetarium shows up there. So if going to the Planetarium, I'd suggest have breakfast or lunch at one of the great restaurants down on Vermont, and then taking an Uber up the the Observatory, so you don't have to bother with the limited parking up there.The Planetarium shows are great for mature children, and adults alike...and are particularly notable for the fact that the entire entertaining lecture about the creation of the universe is NOT pre-recorded, but is instead presented by a LIVE actor, who has the entire complex script memorized. It's really incredible to hear them do it. Only in Hollywood! LOL!And often at night, they have musical laser shows up there, which young adults really like, especially if partaking in some of our now legal Californian cannabis. And sometimes even small rock concerts up there. (the bigger concerts play at the Greek, lower down the hill, which is one of the best places to see a show on a warm summer night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpH381RS
50,Fun afternoon activity for whole family!,"Griffith Observatory is the best for an afternoon in LA, either a date, solo, or a family outing you can tour the building and grounds, see amazing views of LA, and see an amazing show of Space and the Stars! there is alot to learn and take in.Space is the last frontier afterall....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawaiianIrishgirl
50,The Planetarium inside the Griffith observatory is s great experience,"The Griffith observatory is along the hillside from the Hollywood sign. There is car parking available at the observatory but it’s not so big. However, you can also park on the road leading up to the Observatory for free.There is no charge to get into the displays and exhibits inside but there is a charge to experience the planetarium. This is well worth paying for as you lay down on comfy seats and learn about the stars, sun and planets along with some history which is projected onto the curved ceiling.Other exhibits include a pendulum clock, big telescopes, van de graff spark machine (man made lightning), and loads of other cool stuff.The cafe is a bit boring so taking your own food and eating outside might be an idea, then go to the cafe for coffee:)The views from outside are truly stunning, from Glendale in the east though LA and around towards the Hollywood sign.I suggest taking a car as close as possible as it’s quite a steep walk up to the Observatory.Anyways, have fun, it’s a great place to spend 3-4 hours:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beverlyhillsdude
50,Worth to see over & Over again....,"I been living in LA since 1980+ ask me anything and hopefully tell you, incl train AMTRAK. you can do hiking with kids, bike, small trains for kids at lower level at the Griff.Park etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerkQ8083ET

I'm proud to be a native.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevem449

50,Beautiful Views and Interesting Place,"We hiked up from a lower parking lot and saw beautiful vistas in several directions. Once at the top the Observatory was so inviting. It is open for visitors with many interesting displays and outdoor rooftops to see more of the area. There is a lovely (though pricey) cafe and gift shop to round out a visit. We enjoyed walking the grounds, engaging with the educational exhibits and chatting with other visitors. A beautiful place to get away from it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryP1843
50,The Griffith observatory,"Great location on so many fronts .educational and vistas galore ..also great walking paths.

50,Cool Place to See LA,"It is sometimes a pain getting up to the Observatory, particularly around sunset and on the weekends, but great views of LA and perfect spot for pictures.

I don't recommend it unless you have LOTS of time on your hands!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenghisKhan
50,Great Hike and Beautiful Views,We had an excellent time here again. We always enjoy going hiking here - I think everyone else had the same idea!

40,A Great Hike Up,"After a big day of driving we stopped here to view the Hollywood Sign. The hike that is all uphill felt good after a long day of sitting. Seeing the Hollywood sign was a bucket list item for a friend in our travel group. Although it was disappointing the distance between us and the sign, the overview of the city from all directions was amazing. We toured around the observatory as well, but it was quite busy with people. The break and the exercise was a good for us all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanen456

50,Brilliant ... and it is free!,"Just go here!Even if you are not into science, it is just an awesome spot to sit and see a huge view of LA from an awesome vantage point.We got an Uber there from Universal ($15) and then walked back down the well used trails to Griffith Park and our hotel In Hollywood Hills (about 3 miles), which was an amazing experience.The science show inside the dome (about $7 each) is visually spectacular, but the narrating was a little bit over the top ... not to say that the content was bad, just the delivery was a little bit overly dramatic and cheesy 😬Still, a great spot with lots of cool space information and history and brilliant views.Note: Parking was a nightmare and cost $7 an hour ... just Uber it 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MendozzaMagic
50,"Beautiful views architecture, star gazing/learning about space.","Must see if you like beautiful views architecture and star gazing and learning about space. It’s walking distance to a bird sanctuary, and the Greek theatre where there are great concerts.The Observatory is a fun way to spend an evening or a few hours in the day time.There is a cafeteria, and a gift shop that sells interesting trinkets and space related toys.The audio visual shows and the presentations as well as the museum exhibits about space are very interesting. Tesla coil is interesting to see in action.The grounds around Griffiths Observatory have perhaps the best views in all of LA. Famous scenes from Rebel Without a Cause (James Dean) were shot up there.Only bummer is that parking used to be free, and is now $8 per hour which sucks cause it was free last year.Nice place to walk around in good weather.

We where fortunate to find parking close to the top as parking is on the right side of the road and the road is one way. The parking cost only $8 for the hour and we took about 1 hour in all. Despite lots of people being around pictures come out good because it's very amazing up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingshahid
30,Meh....stuff we learn at school,"I know its an iconic stop in LA and the views are amazing, especially on a clear day. The observatory is interesting and an impressive place to visit, but don't go expecting to learn anything they don't teach in school. It was busy and hard to get to see everything, but nothing really made me want to queue up.I'm sure when it was first built it would have seemed very futuristic, but in 2019.....Public transport down and out was sporadic, but efficient enough once you got on the right bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMiller1967

50,“If all mankind could look through that telescope… “,"With over 1.5 million visitors a year, Griffith Observatory is a very popular spot in Los Angeles for residents and tourists alike. While it is one of the leading public astronomy facilities in the US, it is also just as visited for the extraordinary views it offers of Downtown LA from its vantage position on Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park.It is one of the most favoured locations to see and take photographs of the legendary Hollywood sign. For the avid hiker and biker there are also miles of trails available right across Griffith Park.The park is named after its erstwhile owner Colonel Griffith J Griffith. A Welshman who migrated to the US in 1865, he made his fortune from South California real estate and Mexican silver mines. He put down roots in Los Angeles and purchased a tract of land in excess of 4000 acres.Apparently inspired during his visits to Europe, Griffith was convinced that great cities must also have great parks – this prompted him to generously donate 3015 acres of his estate as a Christmas gift to the people of LA in 1896. At the time, the land he bequeathed to the city was a mile outside the then city limits of LA.Colonel Griffith’s vision was: ""It must be made a place of recreation and rest for the masses, a resort for the rank and file, for the plain people … I consider it my obligation to make Los Angeles a happier, cleaner, and finer city. I wish to pay my debt of duty in this way to the community in which I have prospered.""Griffith Park has since expanded to 4210 acres. Nestled in the eastern Santa Monica mountain range it has the distinction of being the largest urban park in all of the United States.Colonel Griffith also held the view that looking at the cosmos through a telescope could actually alter an individual’s perspective of the world. He exclaimed: “Man’s sense of values ought to be revised. If all mankind could look through that telescope, it would change the world!”.Thus it was that Colonel Griffith decided to build and gift an observatory to the people. While this dream remained unrealized in his lifetime, after he passed on in 1919, his will provided trust fund finances to build this observatory on Mount Hollywood, overlooking Los Angeles.Once the observatory was constructed, it was handed over to the City of Los Angeles in 1935, with the only condition that no admission charges must ever be levied from visitors to this facility. To this day, it remains a facility where admission to the building and its grounds is always free!Living up to Colonel Griffith’s vision, when the skies are clear, public telescope viewing of the evening sky is free – reportedly, more people have looked through this observatory’s Zeiss telescope than at any such facility anywhere on the planet.Similarly, people throng to see the live programme in the 290-seat Samuel Oschin Planetarium at the observatory that boasts a state of the art projection system, sound system and theatre lighting.Griffith Observatory is designed to be so user friendly that after seeing and interacting with the space and science exhibits here, even a lay person like me leaves much better informed about the cosmos and where our planet fits in the infinite galaxy. This is a humbling, inspiring experience to say the least – and one can better appreciate what Colonel Griffith meant when he spoke of astronomy changing one’s world view.If you wish to buy souvenirs of your visit there is a wide range of merchandise including books, clothing, toys, magnets and so on at the Stellar Emporium Gift Shop.In a nod to Douglas Adams, the imaginatively named Café at the End of the Universe by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck offers casual dining - wraps, sandwiches, soups, a salad bar, beverages etc. Preferred seating if you can get a space, is outdoors on the Sunset Terrace with enchanting views of LA and the Hollywood sign. If not, seating is available inside the café too.In case you are as piqued as I was by the bust of James Dean on the grounds, that’s because Griffith Observatory featured prominently in two sequences of the 1955 movie Rebel Without A Cause starring the iconic star!Free parking, though limited is available on the drive up to the observatory. The parking lot at the observatory charges a parking fee of $4 per hour.Griffith Observatory is closed on Monday, open between 12pm-10pm Tuesday-Friday and between 10am-10pm on Saturday and Sunday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon

We tried in the afternoon and couldn't even come close to parking, so we did a few other things first and came back at night. I think the grounds would have been beautiful during the day, but we didn't get to experience that. The view at night was spectacular. We had a great time. We didn't get to see everything inside because of the crowds, but what we did see was very well done. If in the area again we would try again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmykids2

We enjoyed the live shows in the planetarium; they weren't incredible, but they were well worth the $7/adult (30 min. long). There is a lot to see and learn about astronomy if you like that sort of thing. The restaurant was quite good and not terribly priced ($40 for a full lunch for four adults) - hot food and salad bar by the ounce. Be aware: Most parking is well below the Observatory, and a significant walk up nice paths is required. One could have driven up, dropped off and then driven back down to park, but we enjoyed the walks up and down. It was a great decision to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessepisors
50,good sights,Always a good place to visit to see the city of LA from high above and to see the starts above in the sky,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitcho399
50,Definite to do when in LA,"The Griffith Observatory provides a fully immersive experience with so much to do and learn. With a wide variety of tours and lectures, and so many interactive exhibits the observatory is great. Definitely make time for this in your trip.Tips: From the car park you get the best views of the Hollywood hills including the infamous sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SelSoma
50,A Must See,A magnificent view of Los Angeles. A real treat for the eyes to see. A must do when in Los Angeles. Low cost - nice area. The best selfies can be taken Here. Los Angeles view like no other. Stars - and space galore. Telescopes are easy to access and helpful in maxamizing the experience. Take the bus .. unless you feel like trecking up. Go see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adnana_Mendieta
40,Worth one time visit,You drive up the hill n park your car only to be told that your friend can not make it to the top coz of an accident mid way. A 1 lane drive to the top and $10/hr parking. If you want to park free n hike to the top u are free to do. Interesting view of Hollywood sign n LA downtown...Good time visit is during sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crdebata
50,Great view and nice drive,"Have been to LA so many times but never been to the observatory till recently. Great views, amazing history, definately worth the beautiful drive up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airlinesimulation
40,"Nice view of the Sunset in LA, California",Expect a big crowd of visitors.Simple enjoyed the view of LA as the sun sets with cozy weather to chill and relax and observe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DauntlessSyera
50,Incredible views!,"Before travelling to LA this place came up on all of my google searches as a must visit...and they were right! You can find the most incredible views of the whole of LA from up here as well as see the Hollywood sign. We visited in the afternoon and stayed until sunset, which was so stunning. The observatory itself was really interesting and mostly free aside from the planetarium. Although fairly busy the place still had a sense of peace and calm about it. Truly unforgettable :)P.S unless you want to struggle up a suuper steep and long walk I suggest you get yourself a taxi to the top!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireyyyy182
50,Must see!! Hollywood sign views!,This was one of the stops on our tour! It is definitely a must see and the best place to get pictures of the iconic Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelswithdanielle
50,Beutiful place worth visiting,"Griffith Observatory is one of LA's top sightseeing spots for a reason. The views are fantastic and the visit is very educational. It is always very crowded, so be there early if you want to put an eye to Griffith Observatory's original 12-inch Zeiss refracting telescope, which is amazing.The parking can be a nightmare, so arrive there early (especially if you have booked tickets or want to enjoy the sunset). However, considering the parking tickets and the time needed to find a parking spot, I would seriously consider catching an Uber to get there!Well worth visiting it and a nice chance to enjoy great views of LA (I was not impressed with the Hollywood sign view, though, it is quite far away!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maikol77
30,So Crowded,"We have been here before, but came again with family during the holidays, and it seemed that the entire population of LA had the same idea. Parking was a nightmare, and the lines to board the shuttle were extremely long.Normally, it is an educational visit for us, but this time it was so crowded that we could hardly move or see anything over the heads of the people. So, we just went onto the terrace, watched the Sunset and captured some amazing photos of the shining, sparkling and twinkling city below. Also got some nice pictures of the Hollywood sign on the hill across the valley.Will come back during our next visit – on a weekday when there are not so many people around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheExplorerFamily
30,Very busy/chaotic and the show is average,"Despite having booked in advance and had tickets to the show, we couldn’t causally get near the observatory due to traffic restrictions in the area. We went on Dec 27th and it was manically busy. The place was manic and disorganised and getting into the show was like fighting through a battle. Once inside, the 3- minute show was interesting but not amazing. It seemed geared towards a basic audience and didn’t tell us anything we didn’t know already. Overall it was ok, but we wouldn’t come again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evalu8
50,Well worth visit,If you want access to the observatory don’t go on Monday as its closed (as we discovered.)Despite that we really enjoyed the great views of Los Angeles there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizab750
30,"Went on December 30th, so crowded we couldn't get in!","We had to walk up the steep hill due to parking lot being full. We couldn't even go in the observatory to use the restrooms, due to crowd size. Don't go on busy vacation days! Not sure if it's even worth it then. Our adult kids and grandkids were not impressed, maybe because they were tired from walking up the hill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648dianep
40,Beautiful and Educational... But Crowded,"We headed up to Griffith to watch the sunset on our vacation to LA. It's definitely worth the trip on a clear day. Be prepared to sit in a lot of traffic. We nearly missed the sunset because we didn't realize the line of traffic that we'd sit in with everyone else trying to get up before sunset. Allow yourself PLENTY of time, both going in and out. Parking is tough and you may need to walk a bit. I would suggest going a couple hours early to see the Observatory first, then watch the sunset. Great views of the Hollywood sign, too. I would definitely go again with some better planning and will spend more time in the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swagmom
20,Disappointing,"I'm glad we caught an Uber to the Griffith Observatory, because its a long busy walk up to the Observatory from the car park. Once there it offers expansive views over the City & nice photo opportunities of the Hollywood sign. Beyond that, there was nothing else.it was very disappointing.Big crowds of people, huge queues for the toilets. Glad there wasn't an entrance fee, or I'd have been asking for my money back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72
10,Packed and boring,Not a place I will re visit took ages to get up to the top and then found the whole thing boring probably ok for kids. Queues for the toilet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birdsofafeather1
40,Beautiful nighttime visit,"We went on the day after Christmas....super busy. But we parked down below and took the shuttle up, I don't know if this is always running but the parking at the top was a disaster, we ended up driving back down and doing the shuttle. We mainly wanted to see the views outside. And they did not disappoint! Just gorgeous. We went inside for a little while but it was so crowded. Another time for the inside visit and I'd like to see it in the daylight. Worth a trip for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elligta
50,wonderful place,"It's crowded, but worth the walk from parking and navigating all the people. Nice exhibits, but the best part are the wonderful views from the roof and garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNguy123
50,Excellent Visit,"We drove here and got see some great views of the Los Angles area. Unfortunately it was a day when the observatory was closed. Nonetheless, it is worth visiting the grounds as there are many interesting things to see. For example a statute to James Dean has an interesting history. From here there is an excellent view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448bobc
50,Day Trip and Engagement Pictures,Went with my friend to enjoy the sites. Great view overlooking the city. My friend loved it so much she got her engagement picture done here several months later. They are stunning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdthebread
40,Evening visit,Visited one evening in December. Parked on lower parking and walked 1/2 mile to the observatory which was quite a strain on the old bones. On the top noticed that there was a transfer bus from the parking... The view of Los Angeles from the observatory was magnificent and can be recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kim1307
40,Magnificent view of L.A.,"We went during the holidays. It is free entrance unless you want to see the show. Lots of people, parking lots were full.However, the visit was good. Very informative! A lot of interactive activities for children so they can enjoy while they learn. They have 2 floors with plenty of display. We enjoyed the lower floor with the Planets display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millionsstars
30,"4 for views, 3 for inside",Amazing views on a clear day. One of the best places if not #1 for views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. Parking is limited and challenging and $10 per hour. Inside the observatory it's so crowded you can barely move and can't hardly see anything. Entire families take up entire walkways and viewing areas. The outside views are stunning though. The telescopes were closed when we went so all we can review are the inside and the views. Go and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryan8underwood
50,Worth the Hike,Visited with a local friend which helped. Parking is limited so we parked in a lot down the hill and walked. Well worth the effort as the views were amazing on a clear winters day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OceanAnt
50,On a Clear Day,Before going home we enjoyed a stop at the Griffith Observatory. It happened to be a very clear day and we could see the tall buildings of Los Angeles. The Hollywood sign also stood out very clearly. Noticed there are a lot of trails to hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleyfoemmel
50,Spectacular views and amazing gateway to our cosmos,"We really enjoyed the spectacular views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign from the Observatory grounds. Also there are a lot of cool educational exhibits explaining the changing of the seasons, day/night, moon phases, eclipses and other astronomical phenomena. We were not able to see through the actual telescope the day we went but we did enjoy the show ""Centered in the Universe"" in the Planetarium which takes visitors on a journey of cosmic exploration and discovery. The observatory is free but the show tickets costs $7.We took an Uber to reach the observatory and that seems to be the best way to reach there. The parking situation is not very good. The parking lot is at the bottom for the hill and visitors need to either hike up the hill or take a bus to reach the top of the hill and lines to get on the bus can be pretty long on busy days. The bus ride costs 50 cents (need to have exact change as the driver does not have any).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chak1014
50,Beautiful views,"Simply put, the Griffith Observatory provides beautiful views of the Los Angeles area...the downtown area, the famed ""Hollywood Sign"", the surrounding hills and mountains...the Observatory is a great vantage point for all. Of course, I lucked out and there was minimal smog, so I had great views!!Parking here most certainly can be a challenge. There is a small parking area at the top of the hill, but depending on the timing, this can be completely taken up. There is some curbside parking on the road up to the hill, with an associated short walk up hill, which is a feasible option. There is some additional parking at the base of the hill, which would require a much longer walk up.Definitely expect crowds. Cars, bus tours, and people! It seems to be well managed, though. There are some restrooms at the top, but be prepared to wait in line.The observatory itself wasn't open to the public when I was there, but the views and outside grounds were definitely worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matts23
40,Very nice vantage point,"The views from the observatory is simply amazing. One could see the whole of L.A basin, you could even see the Pacific Ocean. The only con is the lines where so long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DellonB
50,Breathtaking views!,"We were in town for the weekend and visited the observatory during the day and at night. The views are breathtaking. You can see downtown L.A., Hollywood, surrounding areas and the Hollywood sign. The observatory is full of interesting exhibits that are very informative. At night there are a few employees with telescopes set up, and visitors can view the moon and stars. One thing to note is that we didn’t have any cell phone coverage up there. We took an Uber up there and couldn’t get a ride back down. So we took the shuttle to the parking lot by the Greek Theatre, then had to walk down the hill through the residential area until we could get coverage to call an Uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/704jessiec
50,Moon 🌙 and ⭐️ starts.,"Great family place, Beautiful and relaxing place with a great view of Los Angeles and Hollywood It’s the perfect place to take the family to use the telescope also to visit the observatory Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1005BBrosam
40,For Rebel Without a Cause.,"Visited the Griffith Observatory for a tribute to ""Rebel Without a Cause"".It is from one of the top tourist attractions in Los Angelas, therefore, expect it always to be very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BilgeSonmezer
50,Unique visit,Free admission. Incredible views of downtown Los Angeles. Powerful telescopes. We also got to see a cool “electricity demo” inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285darinc
50,Favorite star gazing location,"The Griffith Observatory is one of my favorite places to visit. It's just a fun place to walk through, check out the unique architecture and enjoy the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary746155
50,Interesting,Visited here as part of a tour. Had a really good time. Good views of the Hollywood hills . Would definitely recommend a visit if in Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865kathrynt
30,nice views,very nice hikes and free parking as well to get to the observatory. fantastic picturesque views from all angles. great shows to see about the universe. we enjoyed our time spent here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samsafron
40,Prepare yourself for a long walk,This museum was really cool. Loved the planets observation stations. My children also liked it. The only downside is if you can't take the tram you will have to walk a very long uphill hike to the museum. Usually it wouldn't bother me much but it was extremely cold out when we visited. Also was a little disappointed that the Hollywood sign wasn't that visable. The city should add lights up there. But I would go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jellibean011
50,A must see in Hollywood,"Beautiful place to visit, high up in the hills and such an amazing view from the Observatory. Very educational and fun too, with excellent views of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rose21
10,Griffith observatory over crowded,"Just wanted to see the Hollywood sign. No parking and too long of a walk UP the hill. Very crowed and the guys directing traffic were not nice. We googled, and found another street to see it on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellenrE2619VL
40,Uber there!!,Great place to visit with amazing views!!Kids didn't like it and it was soooo hot with this tiny sweaty cafe :(Gentleman in gift shop was amazing with a lot of knowledge!!Definitely uber up the top and save yourself the dreaded walk in the crazy heat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greciangoddess
50,Best view of LA,"There would always be sunset stripe in LA, but view from Griffith Observatory of LA beats everything. We have seen the city both in day light and in moon light. And awestruck by both views. There are two parking lots to this observatory one little farther hardly a mile and half away we had to park there because the one near was full. We hiked, weather was good. Opt for the hike if you have time to spend in LA. Observatory is known for showing the moon through their telescope. However long the queue might be for this, please wait patiently. Seeing moon with your own eyes beat any picture,view of moon you have seen on screen before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam3011
50,Gorgeous views on clear sunny day,"The views from here are amazing!!The drive & parking were heavily congested at 10am on a Saturday. We kept going despite signs saying the top parking was full and lucked out grabbing a spot as someone was leaving - parking is $10/hr using credit card pay station. Short walk up hill to the actual site, but if you park in free areas expect a long long up hill walk.We never paid the admission and simply enjoyed the general exhibits & views from all sides. There is clear view of Hollywood sign but it will appear quite small in photos.I did research the hiking trials but got out voted by the teens. I would highly recommend dressing in athletic gear & head here early for a gorgeous hike! Multiple choices!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681lizs
50,View!,Part of our all day tour and a must see! However the traffic was terrible. But the views were breathtaking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558harrietb
50,Multi use visit with awesome view,"Visited the Griffith Observatory to meet friends for a walk, trails great but need sturdy shoes. We brought a packed lunch which has lots of grass areas and some public tables to eat at. Cafe has basic options, not great, but light refreshments available.Planetarium was great and informative, bring a camera for outlook view over LA but try to visit on a clear day. Clean public restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globaljake
40,Nice Grounds,"Did not have time to go in, before sundown. Did enjoy the grounds and walk around exterior of buildings. Beware parking can be horrific if the lot beside the observatory is full/closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porter_osborne
50,"Busy, but beautiful views","A must-do whilst in LA. We went to a show in the planetarium about Water. The lady doing the talk had an amazing voice, and carried us through a journey to the universe. We didn't stop to view the exhibitions inside, because outside the views were just too good.The only downside for me was the hike up the hill to get there, but at least we caught an air conditioned bus on the way down! Awesome views of the Hollywood sign too. A must do when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiaambutler
50,A great place to see LA city view,The Griffith observatory has a spectacular night view of the city. We went twice in 3 days’ trip. Bring your jacket with you since it’s pretty windy out there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnonroad
40,Good educational but also a scenic spot,"We did the visit expecting to see lot of objects in space. The observatory's Zeiss telescope which is the main attraction was under maintenance when we went(which we knew through their website). The show titled""Water is life"" which costs $15 per person was quite impressive which was an excellent and immersive experience for us. This costs $15 per person. We had done a similar show in the Museum of natural history in New York. This was equal to that experience. On the educative side, it showcases several artifacts/interactive objects relating to basics on planets, starts, time calculations, moons , seasons. Yes , these are all available on google, but physical and tangible , interaction is a different world together which gives you a welcome break from staring at the screen. Kids will love the place and parents also need to be involved in explaining/prodding kids to interact with the objects. There are various telescopes mounted in the balcony through which you can see the places far from the hill. We loved the surrounding nature and also the views of HOLLYWOOD sign. There are plenty of parking spaces below. You can board the DASH observatory bus( 50 cents or so for one way) to take you to the observatory and down. You do have a functional eatery there. Typically you spend about 2-3 hours , if you opt for the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srivathsa_kn
50,Amazing views,Perfect place to get a glimpse of DTLA and Hollywood sign. Very clean and organized area. Great place to get the perfect picture with the hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prirajbhandari
40,Worth a trip round,The place contains lots of interesting stuff to try and get your head around. Went on an evening to take a look through the Zeiss and lawn telescopes. This might sound a little ungrateful but I'm not sure it's worth queuing up to see through the telescopes as we didn't see a lot. The image that you will see through the Zeiss telescope is shown on a monitor screen before you get to it and is arguably a better view of the thing being showcased.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WednesburyRoad
50,A Must Visit,"This is the place for those who have an interest in astronomy. I happened to visit at the right time when the amateur astronomy club displayed their telescope and allowed visitors to look at the space through their telescopes. The view for sunset is amazing, you could see the sun reflected through the Hollywood sign. One of the minus and vital thing in here is that it's so hard to get a phone signal here. Me and my friends have the same story when we lost connection with the uber driver hence they arrive but we already cancelled because of the poor connection. It is better to go downhill on the bus and get the bus from there. I used this way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/destinationnone
50,Superb,"The best way to see LA from atop this observatory's hill...can walk all around and take great photos of the surrounds..iconic spot featured in LaLaLand and other films...lots of hiking trails and vistas to enjoy...was pretty crowded...didn't even get inside the observatory, which is free, but parking is $15...restrooms quite a line!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,Beautiful view,"One of most-go places in LA. Great view of the city. Was not crowded when I was there, so it was a nice and relaxing tour of the place. Good place to take a photo of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adikartono
30,All time favorite,"This place has always been a favorite of mine to visit when I'm in LA. However the population boom of Southern California has left this place worn and in need of upgrades especially the public facilities. Additionally, parking is now an even bigger challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vmusarvss
50,Great views,"I came here with my husband and two daughters 3 & 1 year old. We parked for FREE at the Greek theatre and took a bus for 50c per person to get on top of the mountain. The sign says that the bus goes every 20 minutes but we think it’s more often. The views from the observatory are beautiful, you can walk around outside and inside. Remember to visit the lower floor and the show costs $7. The workers are very polite and girls enjoyed playing on the grass in front of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaykate
40,Great view over this sprawling city.,"Make sure you go as early as possible after the marine layer overcast or fog has gone otherwise your visibility could be cut in half or more. Remember that this is a huge tourist attraction with people from all over the world coming here so the earlier you come the less you'll have to fight the crowds. On a clear day you get a fantastic view of LA and the Hollywood sign. You can take the Dash shuttle from the free parking areas for only 50 cents per person each way. Make sure you have exact change, because the driver doesn't have change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blues4us
20,Do it go here to see the hollywood sign,It was recommended we go here because my wife wanted to see the Hollywood sign from all the movies. From here it looks like a white spec on the hill. It cost $6 an hour to park and the observatory may have been nice. We were just here to see the sign. Disappointing if that's your goal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gissocrates3
50,My favorite place in LA,Watch the shows. They’re amazing. The view is beautiful itself and if you want to you can hike all the way up through trails. The museum is a must. And again: watch one of the shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebecardourado
50,Beautiful view!,The view from the top of the observatory is awesome! The inside has a lot of information which you will enjoy if you’re into astronomy. The only thing about our visit that we didn’t enjoy much was the amount of visitors. The place was very crowded but it’s understandable since it’s a nice place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arodzull
40,"Show amazing, observatory chaotic","We visited during Christmas break /Sunday during the evening. The parking lots were full and waits for parking was long. Thankfully we took Uber and saved a lot of time. The observatory, grounds and every exhibit was jam packed with people. My teenager is not fond of crowds. We couldn't read or have a proper look at any of the exhibit. There were long lines even for the loo and nothing to eat in the cafe. The only life saver was the show at the planetarium. We watched the show on northern lights and it was mind-blowing.This place was amazing but unfortunately crowded. We did not get any phone signal/wifi even on the ground. some people did. We too the shuttle till the Greek theatre and took an Uber back. The shuttle fare was 50 cents.In case you are someone who likes to read and understand each exhibit, you should probably prefer a regular weekday .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shikiri
50,Nice view on the Hollywood sign,"We parked our car halfway the hill (near the golf court) and made the rest of the walk up by foot. The walk was pretty hot so make sure to bring enough water. From the balcony's, you can see the Hollywood sign. If you bring your binoculars, you will even have a better view. You can walk all around the observatory to have an overview on the city of Los Angeles. Make sure to check the opening ours of the observatory if you want to visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mijo39
20,Not much to see,This place is nice but there isn't much to see here! Everything is in one big circle! It's nice too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/somethingn
20,New Parking and Security Issues,"I used to love this stop. I arrived on a day where the observatory was closed but there was still staff roaming and managing the parking lot. All the excess people here today, just takes away from what I used to love about visiting this quiet gem. The managing of this landmark IS a PROBLEM. Staff loitering about and getting paid made me more uncomfortable than panhandlers. It is no longer a top spot for me to visit AT ALL. There are so many other great places in Los Angeles this is OFF the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charissetylr
50,You can easily spend half a day,"We spent half a day on our last day in LA. Nice views (Hollywood sign), several stuff to see on site, shows are also nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim611
40,Family of 5 with teenagers,"Opened at 11am, definitely catch a show. If you plan on hiking the trials wear appropriate shoes. The Hollywood sign is still a good distance away unless you hike up a little.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josieg622
50,"Beautiful, educational, great views",We visited the observatory with a Day in LA tour. It was a beautiful place. The educational exhibits were interesting and interactive and the views were amazing.I was glad to be with a tour. Parking was scarce and people were parking single file along the side of the small road and walking up and down to the site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellesL9051CS
50,From George Vreeland Hill,The Griffith Observatory has breathtaking views of Los Angeles and is a place where you can learn about history and science.It has a real seismograph that measures earthquakes.A museum with a view.George Vreeland Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
50,Interesting both inside and outside,We stopped here as part of a tour group so did not get to see all the exhibits. The staff is helpful and friendly.The displays are on two levels inside and there is a planetary diagram on the concrete outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emerald1125
40,Lived up to the hype,Getting to the observatory was no small feat on a Sunday but we were glad we persevered. The observatory is worth seeing and the exhibit about the sun is very interesting. The 360 degree view is amazing even on a less than ideal day.Parking close to the observatory is $6/hour and is worth paying for unless you are up for a long steep walk up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h_e_tompkins
50,Excellent view of LA,Amazing views of LA. However when leaving we couldn’t get an Uber because there was no cellphone network coverage. We had to walk down the hill to the parking to call an Uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justnats10

50,Griffith Observatory,"The Griffith Observatory is excellent for star and planet gazers. It is fun and educational. If you're in Los Angeles, be sure to plan time to visit the Observatory. It is also close to the Los Angeles Zoo, Great for children and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsofla
50,Foucault pendulum is mesmerising,"I've been to the Griffith Observatory several times over the years, and the Foucault pendulum is always the one spot I spend the most time. If there's one great illustration of inertial frames of reference, this is it. Oh and you can stand where the terminators had a fight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436andrewf
40,Viewpoints,"The observatory wasn't open yet as we got there early. I do think they should open early rather than in the afternoon. However the views from outside was great to look at. You can see a lot of Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign and the Yosemite mountains. The scientific information is also quite fascinating to learn about.It's free to park around before 12 in case you want to go only for the views.There are also restrooms available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shenizm
50,Highlight of LA,"I went to LA to see a hockey game and a studio taping. This wasn’t on the agenda but was definitely the highlight. Because it was last minute I didn’t give it the time needed to really appreciate all of it. Give yourself at least 2 hours here and definitely see a show in the planetarium. Even if you’re not a science fan, the view of LA from here at night is incredible and the view of the stars is unreal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimh839
40,Beautiful and Educational,"I happened to go on a very bright and clear day. It wasn't too crowded and I was able to navigate in and out of the observatory with ease. The Observatory is free unless you want to purchase a ticket for the show. I did not since I was pressed for time. Throughout the observatory, there were many stations demonstrating the solar system, the galaxy, etc... I wish I had the chance to come to the observatory as a kid, it would have helped me in my physics class. The telescope itself was smaller than what I imagined. The outside grounds were beautiful and the views were spectacular. Make sure you go on a sunny and bright day otherwise you will miss some of the charm of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldnAdvice
50,Great views,Great views of Los Angeles with Hollywood sign. Convenient parking with reasonable traffic to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDecruz
50,Great evening out!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our evening here; looked at the exhibitions, looked through a number of telescopes. The best bit about this place are the views of LA at night, the view is stunning. The place was busy with many families and groups of friends enjoying what was on offer; we even witnessed a marriage proposal! All in a great night for little or no expense really; you just need to get up there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OriginalSoulGirl
50,Spectacular!!,"The view if the city was incredible! The skies were sooo clear that the ocean was visible. The observatory is incredible. The kids were amazed (6,8,10) by the way the solar system was displayed. A must for everyone. You learn so much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrustratedWolff
50,Awesome place to be in,A must visit. Surely it will enlighten us with Never known knowledge about space and astronomy. A lifetime experience it has been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indrajit2002
20,Too crowded now,Used to be a great place to visit and hike now is a nightmare to get to the top and park anywhere. On weekends don't even try.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick77431
40,Very accessible with lots of free parking a little down the road.,This is the first time we have been to an observatory. The parking arrangements are very good but have to walk a little bit. Very good informative displays and exhibitions. Great for kids and the young at heart.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarnetHondaman
50,Best view of LA if you are not into hiking,"Best view of Los Angeles without much walking. Although, depending on the time of the day, weather, and luck you may have to part 5-10 minutes walk away from the attraction. Most locals don't necessarily go inside, but there are a couple educational exhibits which will delight both kids and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellO5456LF
50,Most amazing observatory.,Had to see the NEW rebuilt Observatory and was not disappointed.A must see in Los Angeles is now even better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevensC6641CP
50,A Visitors 'Must Do',"Visiting the observatory is best done on a clear day. There's no better place to get a true feeling of Los Angeles than the ramps, walkways and lookout points surrounding this building. We spent as much time outdoors gawking at the views as we did exploring the inside of this fascinating place. Film buff that I am, I especially enjoyed revisiting the actual locations where James Dean and Sal Mineo shot their outdoor scenes in Rebel Without A Cause. Entrance to the building is free so it's a great place to bring the entire family for an inexpensive and entertaining outing. The interactive exhibits are instructive as well as fun for both children and adults and you'll probably wind up spending the better part of the day here. I highly recommend spending the nominal fee to see the Planetarium Show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dbozz
50,Not to be Missed,"Such an interesting place packed with fun things to see and experience plus a view. In the lower level, the wall of stars and galaxy's is stunning. Such a small part of the sky and yet so much is there. It definitely calibrates your/our existence in the vastness of space. Don't miss this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Number9
50,Classic LA Destination does not disappoint!,"It's got the views from the Pacific to DTLA and beyond. It's got the compelling Art Deco architecture. The observatory galleries are interactive, and the observatory telescopes are always interesting viewing both for stargazing and admiring the actual equipment. Make sure to take your guests up the stairs to the top observation decks and walk around, exiting on the other side. Visit on a celestial viewing night and enjoy the amateur astronomers who set up their telescopes.After finishing the galleries, exhibits and star gazing (during the day), take a hike up adjacent hill and admire the additional views of Griffith Park and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linkcotmc
40,Family Fun,"We always visit the Observatory when in California. It had been closed the times before this, but we were finally able to go in. It was so neat to look at all the attractions of the museum. We love the view of the Hollywood sign from here. Even though it is always busy, we have never had a hard time finding parking.

40,Fun and Educational !!,"Best place to see ""Hollywood"" sign. Shows are great and they are cheap too... I was able to spend a whole day with my family there. I recommend you to take uber/lyft/taxi as opposed to driving yourself as parking infront of Griffith observatory is tough to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeeva_A_123
50,Cozy High,Nothing like being snuggled with the one you love on a cold crisp February night. Taking a lil food a bottle of wine makes the visiting the Griffith Observatory twice as fun and twice as romantic. They have the best view in the city. Go enjoy! Romance! Think! Get away!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianewD8760IK
50,MUST GO LA Attraction,"I love this place, not only does it serve as an observatory but it also acts as a observation point over historic Korea town and of course the Los Angeles Skyscraper.You also have an option to do a small hike up which I did with my girlfriend and it was pretty easy. Took about 10 minutes to get to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UItimateTroll
50,Magnificent at Sunset,Arrive before the sun goes down to benefit from the full experience. Take pictures of the Hollywood sign before sunset. You will still have time to visit the exhibits inside. When you come out later on the whole of LA is laid out before you in lights.Take a torch or mobile phone to light your way back to the parking areas. You will need to purchase a ticket from the machines along the road as it does get busy in the main car park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444martinu

50,One of my favorite LA attractions,This is one of my favorite LA attractions and it free with lots of free parking space and hey you might even be able to spot some coyotes while heading up the hill to Griffith,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dodulate
50,Let's see LA,The Observatory is definitely a place to visit. Although I visited during the week it's best to arrive early due to many people visiting when open. Many things you can learn of our universe and the displays and photograph are excellent. Parking can be difficult unless you are on a motorcycle or bicycle which have close parking to the entrance. Parking is free and plenty of handicap parking available. Within the area you have many restaurants offering array of many cultural foods.

50,"star wars, golden hour, escape from it all","A must visit spot in Los Angeles. It is a very special place. An escape from the hustle and bustle. Quiet, magical, feels like you are at the gate of a different dimension. Walking around it you would expect one of the Star Wars characters to appera. Smooth round shape, on top of a hill, overlooking all Los Angeles and its glory.The golden hour is much appreciated by photographers. The shapes, the architecture, the curves, the lines. LOVE IT. Inside you can see the permanent exhibition with some scientific experiments and inventions. The spirit of Tesla is there. It just has a very magnetic feel. I cant quite put my finger on it. You wont regret it. Go around 4:30 on a week day and hang till 6. That's when the magic happens! On a clear day you can see as far as the ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TzvetaS

50,Visited from UK,We were in downtown LA for a couple of days and wanted to do some tourist things. This came reoccmended and we were not disappointed.The views to the LA sign but best of all over Los Angeles are stunning. Admittedly we only looked inside briefly but who cares we went for the views.And as a UK visitor I can't believe it was free and only 50 cents to get the dash bus from the top all the way back to Hollywood. Amazing and not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdeWotton
50,Los angeles from top,I visited LA on first week of December for two days . On the second day i went to Griffith observatory it was Magnificent and deserve to give it priority . From there you can see LA and LA longest street 110 and you can sea the highest sky building in LA . My surprise to me was to see the holywood sign on the mountain and you can take photos with holywood sign . This park is excellent for hiking lovers and peoples who loves astronomy science this astronomy life you can see inside the observatory .

50,High Above the City,"I enjoyed this event very much (I have a science background). The grounds of the observatory, the view, which includes the Hollywood sign, the telescope, the show, etc. were all enhanced by a beautiful day-I saw why it's rated so highly. I don't think young children would get too much from the experience, but what the heck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miamiredskin1968
50,great views of the city,"found the observatory very interesting and the views were stunning ,we left our car parked down at the bottom and hiked up the canyon ,we found this the best option as if you drive to the car park at the top you can spend ages driving round trying to find a spot as it gets very busy ,that aside its an excellent free day out in la and some of the best views of the Hollywood sign are had if you take the hike round the back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smittyshooter
50,Great views and cool building,"Great views of the Hollywood sign and the building is really cool, inside and out. Avoid the weekends if you can because it gets packed with tourists. Would recommend taking the hike up, if only to avoid the crazy parking lot. The hike also has great views and isn't too difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristine4412
50,Best view of LA,We visited this place before the Observatory actually opened as we ran out of time but the views alone made up for missing seeing what was going on inside!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackieFitz2305

50,Best place to meet the stars!,"Best place in LA to meet the starts... Arrive after lunch to see everything, and at 7 PM join the line to look with the telescope. At the first Friday night of every month they hold a ""All Space Considered"" lecture which is VERY cool to, I got to meet a NASA geologist who worked on the most recent probe to Mars. One of the very few must-sees in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cedesilva-brazil
30,Great Views of Hollywood sign,"My 3 star rating is based solely on the fact I never got to do all the attractions.I visited the observatory on a Sunday and it was really busy. It’s definitely a place to check out and if you are brave enough take on some of the heights.The exhibits were well set out, very informative and certainly impressive. You can probably wander round the whole attraction in an hour on a good day.Definitely make sure you are properly attired unlike me because it was really windy and quite cold because a lot of it is in shade. Plenty to see though and worth a visit if you are looking for something free to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djchakafinchos
40,surprisingly wonderful - The griffith Observatory,"Its a great place to visit ..the collection is really good and very informative ..from telescopes to meteorite sample, periodic tables etc..we have spent around 3 hrs..the views of LA from here are absolutely stunning especially at night...definite visit at LA and on the way you can get the pictures of HOLLYWOOD sign as well..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Premchand_N
40,Just as good as ever,Since my last visit here a couple years back the car parking has changed. Very little parking entering from the West Canyon Road until near the top where charging exists for $6 an hour - but don't panic because if you cross to the North Vermont Canyon Road through the tunnel (heading down to the Greek Theatre) there is free parking and a short walk back to the Observatory.Such a great informative place and fantastic views of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jony644
50,Amazing,This place is amazing. The views over LA are stunning - especially at night time.We saw the show “Centred in the Universe” and that was awesome. The lady gave a live narrative of the history of science behind everything from the solar system to the creation of the universe.The Tesla Coil was awesome and we highly recommend watching when they light it up!Was also really cool to see all the planets and how big they are and all the stats about them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalita8888
50,Griffith Observatory,Great place to visit. Great information and exhibits as well as beautiful grounds and buildings. Also great place to overlook L.A. and probably the best place to get pictures of the Hollywood sign. Nice drive up the mountain through beautiful Griffith Park. (It does cost for parking but worth it.) also there is a dood amount of Handicap parking available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankmP5839KI

40,Griffith Park,"Nice place for knowledge of Space Exploration and Astronomy 101.

50,Breathtaking Sunset,"My husband and I made this a priority during our trip to Los Angeles upon being told that we had to see it and you should too! Between the off season for tourists and it being much colder than usual in LA, it was not very busy, which was really nice. We were able to have a perfect spot on the upper observatory deck to watch the sunset over the city line. It was unbelievable! If possible I suggest going during the late afternoon and then watching the sunset.The Observatory also has a few hands on displays along with a lot of other exhibits about our solar system and space.They also offer 3 different shows running separately throughout the day. There is one dome theater that projects the show above you. Don't miss out on doing this! It's only $7 a ticket. I know there are trails you can hike around the Observatory through the park too.Griffith would make a perfect family friendly trip too. There is no admission charge so, if you don't do the show, eat in the little cafe or shop in the gift shop it can be done for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ApolloBitMe
40,Instructive and enjoyable,Free entry but pay for lecture which is well worth it. Car parking close is quite expensive. Food choice good but variable quality. Views are spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmysol
40,Kind of cool!,"Just a neat place to visit. The view of Los Angeles is great as well. We went over the Thanksgiving weekend and it was VERY crowded. We had to park at the bottom of the hill and take the bus up. Advice, just walk up! It would have been a lot faster! Once there, the displays are excellent and very informative. The history is fun to look into as well about how astronomy started in LA. All in all worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerfromArizona
40,Interesting visit,"Busy, lots of tourists, but that’s not surprising. Not easy to park close by, fortunately we had a disabled permit, otherwise would have been a long walk. Many interesting displays to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/has2bperfect
50,IT'S FREEEEE!,"This spot is great for so many reasons. The view is amazing as you get to overlook LA. Whether you go during the day or at night, the view will always be stunning. I would suggest going at night because the view is a lot better and they sometime allow you have to check out their gigantic telescope on their roof. If you check online, they sometimes have star gazing parties where a ton of people take their own telescopes and take a look at different stars.Also -- if you go during the day, there are many great hiking trails in the area. There's a lot of different FB groups that you can join so that you have people to run with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsnancyestrada
50,Wonderful place,"We really enjoyed going here. We took the bus, it was easy to get to. The view is amazing. There is a restaurant and gift shop. Nice park areas for picnics.

40,Pretty cool,This place was pretty cool to visit. You get a great view of the Hollywood sign and view of LA. And if you have the time to walk around the surrounding park it's lovely. It can be hot though. Worth the time to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campgram
40,"Good layout, modern","Was in this place for a short while 18th November. Took the shuttle to the observatory. 50 Cts each way, shuttle was clean, and driver polite though it was crowded. More crowded up at the observatory but everything was modern and well organised for a free attraction. Renovation was done well lol. Bought some tumblers from the gift shop and the folks there are Friendly and helpful. Cafe food didn’t look too appealing so we ate elsewhere lol, bad point - Long waits for toilet so ya gotta get prepared, but the toilets are surprisingly clean for such big crowds ! Overall, it’s indeed a place to go in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/74basilt
50,Very interesting visit,A little difficult to get to but worth it. Has a lot of informative exhibits and the views are awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billpW1998QX
50,Captivated Before Entering the Door,"The view from the parking area captures your attention as you first drive in...Then the flooring of the outdoor entry which I will leave as a surprise except to mention the sundial. Upon entering, the swing penduleum....downstairs- the planets and weighing and machines... let's not forget the exciting and informative films. Probably our family's most visited place as we can hit the trails before and after our visit. Both fortunately and unfortunately, this seems the case for all the tourist buses so be prepared for traffic and parking delays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raqs2015
50,Observation of City and Stars,"Ideally, spend the late afternoon hiking along the trails(dog friendly), then at dusk make your way to observatory for magnificent views of the city. Once a month on Saturday, astronomers set up their telescopes outside and allow you and the family to get views of the moon or Venus or Mars.The observatory itself has had a renovation and now is totally upgraded. It’s free. Huge telescope inside, models, the building itself is very Art Deco.Drawback is parking and traffic. If you go early for hike, well before dusk, you’ll be ok,but as sunset time approaches the parking situation gets dicey and there is a line of cars snaking down to the Greek theater.Take advantage of shuttles that shuttle you up from lower park area parking lots.Romantic place for views and stroll or perfect for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrylQ3610HY
40,Great sights and science exhibits,"It was a short walk from lower parking lot G, a little hazy but good view of the Hollywood sign and enjoyed the exhibits and demonstrations in the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hey888
30,I assume a great view when not smoggy,"Visited the Griffith and was somewhat disappointed but not the venues fault. Was extremely smoggy so there really wasn’t a view to speak of. Someone told us on a clear day you could see the Pacific Ocean however the day we were there you could hardly see LA.If going I’d check the “smog rating(?)” and if high skip it for a better day. Also, parking was a fiasco. If crowded be prepared to park a distance away and, as usual, pay for parking. If you see tour busses in the lot also be prepared for crowds at the viewpoints, just be patient for your turn to see the view (if the sky is clear).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826lt
50,Great night time views of LA and the stars,"A different way to see the stars of Hollywood... this place is great! Come at night time for spectacular views of the city, and you'll get to use the telescopes to see the stars too. Brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dr_Engineer_Adelaide

40,Really good way to spend an afternoon.,"A good way to pass a few hours, the observatory itself was interesting but the best thing about it is the views! This is the perfect place to get a photo with the hollywood sign in the background and in the other direction, looking down on LA is stunning. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danniranger
20,Bus service is awful,"While this place is pretty interesting, with good informative shows and fantastic views, the bus service from parking to the observatory is just ridiculous! We had to wait for the bus 1.5 hrs going each direction. This is BEYOND crazy. I really don’t understand why more buses cannot be added!Would not come back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allag471
50,Amazing view. Must visit @ LA,Amazing view to Los Angeles. Main room have interesting shows. Do not miss TESLA effect and telescope view at the roof of the observatory. Nice pictures was taken with Los Angeles general view and Hollywood sign.Do not miss that!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66kostasp
50,Spectacular views of the city and fascinating exhibits,"This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles to come as a resident and when showing visitors around town. No matter the time of year, you're sure to enjoy the visit. The views of LA, including downtown and the Hollywood sign, as fantastic. The interior of the observatory is equally as impressive. There's no entrance fee so you can stroll around and learn more about the Universe. I highly recommend purchasing tickets to the planetarium show as that's incredibly well done. It's also worth waiting in lines to look through the giant telescope to see planets. And check the calendar for special events like public skywatching nights where people line up their telescopes on the front lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecovegangal
40,"Pretty good view, soo many people","We did enjoy this and the view is stunning, but it is so busy and quite hard to get to in an Uber depending on when you go.

40,more popular than it should be,"The Griffith Park Observatory is a very nice place to go, BUT... This is a classic example of something made over popular by written tour guides. If you have ten days in LA i would not put this on your list as it is clearly not in the top ten things to do or see Los Angeles. It is not in the same league as Universal Studios, The Getty Center, Disneyland, The Warner Brothers lot tour, Knotts Berry Farm, Malibu Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, or more.. and, if you have two weeks in California, and you are choosing destinations, Carmel, Yosemite, Sequoia, Monterey Bay, Death Valley, the Muir Woods, Big Sur, Lake Tahoe, and many more would all clearly be better to visit than this nice but fairly insignificant place and LA View.. get the view at the Getty Center, or from The Bonaventure Hotel bar downtown.. if you are a Space enthusiast, schedule a visit in advance at JPL Jet Propulsion Library in Pasadena see where the spacecraft are built.. but really, the griffith Park Observatory is not even in use as an observatory... Mount Wilson yes, Griffith park no. perspective from a local.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdBannister
50,The site of a dozens of films...,"This is a must visit in Los Angeles because it is so definitively iconic. It's perched on the edge of a Hollywood Hills promontory so the views are spectacular! I've been in 40+ countries and still recommend this. And spend some time inside. If you have a curious mind, the science stuff is wonderful. Do rent a car and go for a leisurely visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MediaByte
50,Free,Beautiful views from Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign.My friend and I were surprised that the entrance was free!Amazing things to see inside.Great to spend an afternoon after a walk to the top of the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvyDrum
50,Great view and interesting exhibitions,"Let's face it, you probably come here for the view from high up on the hillside and it's definitely worth your while. But the observatory also has a very interesting exhibition on astronomy and physics, with some fun experiments for kids. The café is a bit boring but do visit the gift shop. Also: Follow parking instructions on signs when you get closer, because likelyhood is it's even more packed than you think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnseverinson
50,My favorite place!,I love this place especially at night! You get to see the whole city lit up at night from above it’s amazing! If you haven’t visited I highly recommend you to do so. I have been here during the day time but it’s not the same as during the night. Just a heads up it does get packed during weekends and holidays so be prepared to hike up or wait a decent amount of time to find parking. But either way it’s worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edgarskates
50,The many facets of The Observatory,"Interesting info on time and space, great view of LA, and if you are into the movies, fun to think of all the scenes that have taken place here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaylecue
40,Fantastic place in LA,"We visited Griffith Observatory in October on our short trip to LA.Must say this place is amazing. Kids enjoyed the visit, this place is full of information.If you want to take picture of Hollywood sign then it is a good place and a good place to take pictures of Sunset as well.The traffic is bad to go up the Griffith, we took Uber but there is a bus service as well.Highly recommend to visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poojak979
50,Breath taking views,"Stopped by on my last trip in oct 2018, well worth it. Parked for free about 1-1.5km down the hill. The on site cafe had some nice food. The views of LA you get from this place is unbeatable. If u have time, make sure u visit, you wont regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopstar87
50,1st visit,"Wow the views are spectacular you would not be disappointed to add this to your must visits,we went just as the sun was setting against the Hollywood sign it was magical & yes you can take great photos perfect name the city of lights as that’s all you can see for miles around this is a must see visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659is
50,Fabulous visit not just for views,"Our visit to the Griffith Observatory was not just about the view from the top but we explored the Observatory and enjoyed the exhibits which are free and we watched two planetarium shows which were brilliant, these are US$7 per adult and each last 30 mins.We spent about 4 hours here and yes the sunset was worth the wait.We parked to park at top at US$8 per hour, the machines take a credit card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/654samr
40,Plan a sunset visit to the Griffith Observatory,"What an interesting place to visit. The Griffith Observatory has wonderful space and science related displays, including a planetarium. The building itself is a beauty built in the Greek revival style. We chose to visit in the late afternoon, so we could see the Hollywood sign in the hills beside the Observatory, watch the sunset, and enjoy the night lights in the LA basin below. But, a heavy fog came in & it was a white out. So we inspected all the displays inside. And we were very lucky the fog lifted to enjoy the city lights below, but we didn’t see a sunset. I’d recommend taking an Uber rather than a bus. The other thing - go early, as this is a very popular tourist destination, and the roads are narrow with limited lanes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatsonwatsons
50,Awesome view of the citg,Came here during the day and it was totally worth it. The view of Los Angeles is to die for and there are trails nearby where you can hike towards the Hollywood sign. Great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CostasDaGreek
50,Great 1/2 day attraction close-in,"This is a very interesting attraction and science buffs will love it. My only gripe was trying to find the hidden cafeteria and gift shop down stairs. Stay for the movie presentation if you can, well worth it. Even small kids will enjoy if you can keep them from talking during the show. Many interesting static displays. Parking is a problem if you come later in the day. Go early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesodonnell
40,Movie Magic in Real Life,This beautiful building is a must seek for movie lovers & romantics alike. With a lovely view of the Hollywood sign & other gorgeous views of LA the few dollars it costs to park your car near the building and walk over is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreeMonahan
50,Amazing,The view is incredible not much to say really apart from the view. You can see all of LA which is great. Parking is okay not to expensive. I'm pretty sure I paid 4 dollars for an hour. Not great but not too expensive. If you think of it as a car full of people paying a total of 4 dollars to see a breath taking view then it's very good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonsGoth
50,what a wonderful surprise,"I went there just to get a view of the city during the fires, but what I found inside totally surprised me. I truly wish I would have allowed more than 2 hours for this visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottn774
50,Amazing panoramic view!,"Amazing panoramic view of the city and nice hikes. The ob has a pretty cool gift shop too, and an exhibit about the planets in our solar system. Sometimes the view can be obscured by clouds/fog which kinda puts a damper on it, but still worth seeing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lowgurl
40,Amazing sunset spot,"Cool planetarium with loads of movie history, helpful staff and amazing sunset spot. Gets a bit busy, but the vibe stays nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonm754
50,Hollywood hike,This is a great place to start a lovely Hollywood hike walk - you can use the toilets and grab some lunch before hiking! The views are amazing and we managed to get uber there and back to our hotel! Good afternoon in Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessPanoullie
50,Out of this world...,"A perfect place to spend an entire day! Outside, there are hiking trails galore...some more challenging than others. The scenery is spectacular! Climb the stairs of the Observatory building for great photo opportunities and take a look at the giant telescope. Inside the exhibits are well curated and understandable. Admission is free but there is a charge for the shows ($5 seniors, $7 adults). Shows are one half hour and appropriate for both children and adults. The moderator has a magnificent voice and clearly loves what he does. You can only buy tickets at the facility for the day of the show, but there are plenty of seats. There is a cafe with pre-made sandwiches, clips, ice cream and such...prices are reasonable and food is as you would expect (not great, but ok if you are really hungry). And you can eat outside. Go! You will have a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loisv980
40,Star gazers abound atop Mt. Hollywood at Griffith Observatory,"Griffith Observatory is always on my list to show visiting friends and family. The manicured grounds of the observatory provide photo ops from downtown LA to the Pacific ocean (on a clear day) -- and it's free! Visit in the evening to hear music wafting up from the Greek Theater during the warm months or grab your telescope and join the many star gazers who congregate there.Inside, for a small entry fee, the exhibits are amazing! Then take a seat in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium for one of many live shows offered throughout the year.Worked up an appetite? Wolfgang Puck's got you covered!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patburkhardt
20,Never got there,Impossible to park now. It’s got a lot busier since my last visit.If you want to pay $6 an hour to park on the side of a road which is giving way under the weight of cars. Then walk a couple of miles up a hill to get there while dodging cars racing to get a park!Go right ahead because I didn’t,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardT680
50,You've seen it in the Movies: A wonderful excursion for both children and adults,"Aside from the scenic view of LA from the Griffith mountaintop, the observatory (so famous in films like Rebel Without a Cause, Bowfinger, Earth Girls Are Easy, and The Terminator) has a fascinating planetarium show that not only intrigues you but gives you comfortable chairs to lie back on for a while and rest your weary tourist feet! The kids will love it and so will you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eggcreamer
50,Astonishing!,"I have been to LA many times, but never managed to make the time to see the Observatory. I did the last time I was in LA. The line up was too long to wait for the telescope, but I had a chance to see all of the other displays. The staff were really helpful and happy to add context and historical background to all of the exhibits. It's a must-see when you are in LA. I will go back again and hopefully, have the chance to look though the telescope. Holding a billion year old piece of rock was well worth the expedition!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryluz2015
50,Excellent Attraction,"The Observatory was one of our favourite attractions whilst visiting California and I would recommend to anyone in the LA area. The views from in front of the Observatory are spectacular and are worth travelling to the top for alone - great city views and views of the Hollywood sign. The Observatory is free and kept us interested for a couple of hours (we would have spent longer if we'd paid for extra parking!) and spent a total of about three hours at the top. Even if you don't have a special interest in astronomy I think you will find the museum interesting, and if you do have an interest there's a good level of information.We paid $7 each to see a 45 minute film in the observatory theatre which was well worth the cost. Again, even if you're not very interested in astronomy the admission is worthwhile for the theatre experience. Would recommend the film to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcglassa
50,Up in the hills this pace is worth a visit,This historic Observatory sits in the hills above LA. There are great trails and walking paths around the area and displays inside the structure are very educational. Great thing to visit to make sure you know that LA isn't all traffic and concrete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spertronic
50,Great observatory,"We came at a great time, not so much tourist. It was a nice sunny day and it came with a great view. Parking was easy, but it would be hard when its busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruentes

50,Wonderful Family Adventure,Great place to explore with the kids! Many displays and lots of science for the geek in you! See things you cannot see anywhere else in LA! We have two boys 10 and 12 and they had a blast! Worth every minute and the view of the LA basin is terrific!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3982LWrichardb
30,Don’t pay for parking before 12!,Great views and easy to find.Worth the visit if you are in LA.Lovely cafe at the bottom of the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/01Emrah
50,Amazing!!!! So good we stayed! But watch the traffic/parking!,"Visiting from the UK we joined FOTO (Friends Of The Observatory) in advance so we could book ahead and get reserved parking as we only had 1 day to commit to going.OMG. Best thing we have done in a long time, beautiful approach as sunset is the best views we have seen, building is amazing, just such a joy! We stayed for the next show it was so good.They are not kidding about traffic, from entering the park to get to the building ‘for supposedly reserved parking’ it took 40 minutes.When we reached the summit and our expected parking, the not so helpful parking attendant told us to drive back to the beginning and get a pass the first attendant had neglected to give us (my incredulous reply at another 40minute trek!!).The parking guys really had no clue and weren’t inclined to help(I feel a complaint to FOTO in the pipeline).Just be prepared!However, don’t let it deter you, it’s such an amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshBush
50,Like in a movie,"One of the must-see attractions in LA.Highly recommended for lovers of astronomy and cinema :)Admission to the building and grounds of Griffith Observatory is free.From there, you also have amazing views of the Pacific Ocean, the Hollywood Sign and Downtown Los Angeles.The observatory was featured in many famous movies",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ale_15B

And it is a great place to take good pictures and grab a bite to eat at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielleD357
40,Great view! But take the bus.,"We figured, around 3km walk. Yes we can! Well, it is up hill constant and mostly under burning sun. We arrived at the oratory quite tired. At our surprise, most people around us were fresh like roses. Including some older people and younger kids. We went to the information center and found how to take a bus on the way back. For the rest it was a great place to visit with beautiful scenaries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylvainr325
50,Wonderful Day,We had a great time with our grandson visiting all the science displays. Plan on returning with our remaining six grand kids soon... parking easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottmA4201QV
50,Awesome place to visit,"You can drive up there and enjoy the views, it is free. In a clear day or night, you can see all the way to the Pacific Ocean and see Catalina Island. You can also hike up there if you feel strong, there are plenty of paths. You can enter the Observatory and enjoy the exhibits., the talks or the looking through one of the biggest telescopes you will ever see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63beatrizm2015
50,Local Gem for Multiple Visits,"This observatory is more than just a one time visit location. You can walk up to it or take a shuttle bus and then take a hike up the mountain trail. The place not only provides observatory experience, but the vistas from the location never get old!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EatPicky
40,Everything they say it is,"Got to The observatory 30 minutes after they opened and parking was full, so you had to park down the hill and hike up, but luckily we had handicap parking and was able to park at top. Very beautiful place. Would love to go there at night and get a chance to look through the telescope. The day we went, LA was a bit smoggy, so our view was obscured by the haze, but still had a great time. If you go, go early to get parking close to observatory. What a good way to spend a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidB4U2013
50,Great views beautiful place,This place is perfect for a hike with the kids. Pack a picnic. The observatory has a big beautiful lawn to have a picnic. The views of the city are amazing.

50,Great Scenic View,Recommend to anyone who visits Los Angeles... You can wait till sunset. Don't miss to watch stars on their telescope.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christP3300PN
50,Spectacular View,"Best place to get an awesome view of Los Angeles. Take a picture of the Hollywood sign and check out the observatory. Parking at the observatory could be a pain during weekends because a lot of hikers, bikers and tourists are visiting. You can park at the designated parking areas near the entrance and just ride the shuttle, it will take you up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaileysMum1
50,Great Hike and Views..!,"GPO is a great place to hike to..You get the benefit of the amazing hike up from Griffith Park and the Observatory is an amazing piece of history-there's an acceptable cafe there too and cold water available for free which you will want!!!On the way up the trail I have seen woodpeckers, lizards, squirrels, and even a rare and incredibly fast California Whipsnake ( this is unusual- they are super shy....! And NOT venomous..)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rufusp2017
50,Something for everyone,"Awesome place and the re-modeling has made it even better. Be sure to view the movie in the Leonard Nimoy Theater. Parking was not a problem for us since we arrived late in the afternoon, but it does get packed. If you came to hike, you may get to just going from your parking spot up the hill to the observatory. The views are also amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46markt

40,Captivating even for the non scientists,"Something of interest for everyone and all ages, great views over LA. Food in restaurant is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleLola26
40,Not only worth for the science,"The only thing why we give not the 5 points is the mass of people coming up Griffith Park to enjoy the views. We did as well, it is a great place to enjoy science and learn more about our universe. The views on the city is amazing and the Hollywood sign seem pretty close. The best thing about the park, the amazing hikes you can do in the middle of town. There you are lucky, because the masses of tourists rather don’t do them. Good for us from Berlin is the Berlin forest, you can’t miss it on the way to the hiking trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43georgk
50,Spectacular sunset view of LA,"Perched above LA, on a clear night the Griffith offers a spectacular view of LA. Parking is difficult, but the Observatory is wonderful. A favorite destination in LA that we visit whenever we are here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/340StephenM
50,Educational with great views of LA,you can spend hours going through the observatory's exhibits and displays or do a quick visit and take in the panoramic views of metro LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joecH4652GB
40,Great for sunset views,We went here to watch the sunset over LA. It was beautiful views looking out over the city and at the Hollywood sign and made for some stunning photos. It was pretty crowded (we went on a Sunday night) but we were still able to enjoy it. The observatory inside was pretty cool too. It's worth a stop for the view if nothing else!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaelaceleste
40,Cosmos and space,Must go for any Los Angeles visitors. If you’re into space and the Big Bang then this is definitely for you. Some interesting information about how the universe started and life in other planets. You can actually touch some comets and feel the density of the rocks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MahmoudAGD

50,Fantastic!!!! well worth a visit and its free..,"A must see in LA, a lot of History, great views and fantastic walking trails.We dropped in on our last day in LA and will return next trip to spend more time there. 2 hours was not enough time to enjoy all it has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate59246077979
50,Highlight of LA,"On my last night of 6 months travelling a friend and I headed across town for a good view. We got so much more than we expected!The grounds and museum are FREE!! Amazing! There are three floors too is the historical telescope and lookouts, middle is the museum and bottom we ran out of time for but is more info, a shop and cafe. The museum is very informative and interactive which engages everyone from5-65 years old!We allowed 2 hours here and it was not enough! I’d highly recommend getting some snacks and having a sunset picnic before heading into the museum and looking at the stars. You can also see and hike to the Hollywood sign if you want. The hours of the observatory are midday to 10pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gsum8
50,Great free museum and easy access to loads of trails,We went twice - once in the morning as we wanted to run on the trails in the Hollywood hills. We ran up to the top of Mount Hollywood which was about two miles from the Observatory. We went again one evening to see the sunset. The views were amazing as all the lights came on across LA. parking is really busy at sunset so plan ahead. It's only half a mile walk up from the lower car parks though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad784261
50,A Must See!!!,This is truly a must see in LA. The architecture alone is worth the visit and of course if you have seen Rebel Without a Cause you will be reminded of the movie. Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign. There is little parking at the top but just recently they added a shuttle bus so you can park at the Greek Theater and take the shuttle. Worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donmS7158RS
50,Absolute must!!,This is an absolute must visit if you’re in LA!! We went at sunset and then stayed to watch the lights of LA come on!!! The show is incredible and extremely informative and very interesting!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669katys
40,So much to see,Visited as part of a LA day trip. We admired the views of LA and the Hollywood sign. The observatory is on a couple of different levels. We enjoyed the moon display but didn't have time to stay longer. Would definitely return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Highlander950
40,Beautiful spot for amazing views,"We visited on a VERY hot day in early September so this slightly hampered our experience as there was no where to park near the observatory and it was a bit of a walk to get there in the heat. There isn't always a path either so we had to walk on the road or the side where it's very dusty.However, it's a beautiful view from the observatory and it's lovely to visit something that's free of charge. There are places to fill up your water bottles and go to the toilet too.It was very smoggy so the view included that but it is a great place to see the Hollywood Sign. It's quite a long way away but I think you can walk to get a bit nearer it if you want to, it was way too hot to consider this when we were there however.I recommend parking on the upper level rather than at the bottom of the hill if you don't want an uphill climb. You'll probably still need to walk but it's a bit flatter. Sunscreen definitely needed if it's hot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atravellerobserved
40,Worth the hike up the hill,"I parked near the Greek Theater (parking at the observatory itself was full) and walked up the rest of the way. It was quite steep and not exactly a short walk, but was worth it for the incredible views at the top and the visit to the observatory. The observatory is free and has lots of interesting exhibits/information. I paid a small fee for a planetarium show, which was worthwhile. Had lunch at the restaurant there, which was kind of expensive but decent food and lots of options. Next time I would visit in the evening so I could see the views through the telescope after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/957marielt
50,Fantastic!,Definitely worth a visit. Lots to see here and the views are fantastic. I would highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
40,The view,"An awesome view and about an 8 mile hike to the Hollywood sign. I however, did not make this hike because we hadn’t prepared for that we did other things that day and didn’t have our hiking shoes or water! But the view of LA is amazing and the history behind the coil and seeing it in action is pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murpmatt
50,Love it!,"Griffith observatory is awesome and must have on bucket list if you're new to LA. Rich history and gorgeous views, great shows to entertain and engage mind. In the evening you can enjoy the great music from nearby Hollywood Bowl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678mvi
50,Best of LA,So many different experiences - the incredible outside view of downtown from the architectural beauty of the building itself. I highly recommend attending a show in the planetarium - you lean waaaay back in the seats and storyteller narrates for you the show that is projected on the ceiling which is the inside of the dome. Check the calendar to see when the telescope is open. This trip is several hours. Bring a sweater because the AC can be cold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDSTJ
50,Free to visit but parking is tough,As a southern California native this is one of the places I take visitors to very often. Entering the observatory is free of charge and the views of Los Angeles are amazing. There’s always something interesting to see and you might end up learning something too. There are fees to go into the shows but they’re not very much and can be really interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmharrod
50,Better than expected,"Griffith Obeservatory is worth a visit just for the views of L.A., and if you also happen to be interested in astronomy, this place is a total win.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexkQ2068ZN
50,Great views!,"The Griffith Observatory is definitely a must see! Great views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign is right there! Inside it’s like a science museum and you’ll definitely learn something about the moon, tides, etc!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ffraioli
50,Wonderful Views,"Day or night, preferably both, the sites around Griffith Observatory are gorgeous.We went there after a month of studying the solar system and different elements of the Universe.The observatory is vast and full of things to do and learn. They have a restaurant where you can sip a drink or chow on something while looking out onto the setting sun.They have a large gift shop worth stopping by and dropping some cash down for fun gifts and clothing.If you attend at night you can line up and look through the large telescope. We saw Saturn. Awesome!Make sure to pay for a show in the planetarium. We saw a show on the Vikings and their astronomy. Loved it SO much!!Griffith Observatory is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whoops27
50,Top of the World,"If you are like us, you go for the view. We really wanted a good look at the Hollywood sign and all of the LA area out to Catalina Island which we certainly got up at the top that hill. We walked all around the crowded walkways and stopped to get something to drink in the cafe. We took some time to look at a few of the exhibits as well. All in all, we were glad we made the trek. Fascinating place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickyO100
40,Time well spent,It was a clear day and we had a great view of the city and the Hollywood sign. We attended a presentation about the universe that was fascinating. A great way to spend a couple of hours seeing and learning about our planet and it’s place in the cosmos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda8788
40,Prepare to walk!,"Observatory itself its really nice, awesome view from the city! But if you arrive in the afternoon, be prepared to walk at least 500m uphill, as there will be no parking lot available and you will need to leave your car in the middle of the road, downhill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcosVellinho
30,Wanted to do this for years....,"and now I don't understand why. The actual Observatory building on the outside looks beautiful but inside exhibits were more aimed towards kids.$6 an hour parking - views or downtown LA were fine, nothing to write home about, thought it would have been closer to the Holywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiveAtc
50,Wow the views,All I can say is “WOW”. The views from the roof were amazing. This was a great observatory spot. The Hollywood sign can be seen with great pictures from every area. It was a great way to see the whole city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorim585
40,Beautiful!!!!!!,"This is the place to visit to see the famous HOLLYWOOD SIGN. Inside the observatory you learn about the Sun, Moon etc. Different shows to see too. A wealth of information regarding the solar system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971annettea
50,On top of the world well LA at least,This place has the best views of LA and the hollywood sign.Take a hat not much shade.Walking trail from the bottom for those who are fit.Paid parking gets busy so go up before midday.Worth a look another thing to tick off your LA tourist list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deesimone
50,Great view to see Hollywood Sign,"Seems plenty of parking with a shuttle to take you to the Observatory. Great views of the sign and over the city and I would imagine a good place to see the sunset. We didn't do any of the tours, but plenty of people were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epic9990
40,Can't wait to come back at night!,"Some shady spots to sit w. a baby on a blanket. Pretty views even in the daytime. You can see the Hollywood sign and the city. See George Harrison's tree and James Dean's plaque. Clean area! Parking is $6.00/hour during the week and was crowded along the roadway. The huge telescope is a sight to see! They let you look through it for free at nights when it is dark out. Since my daughter lives in the area, we will be doing this in the future. And we will go in the planetarium, which is reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tericloth
40,Great View and Educational Inside,"We found parking ($6 per/hr) in the Observatory lot around 2pm on a Friday. We took some Hollywood sign pictures and headed inside. The kids loved all the exhibits. The Zeiss telescope is open to the public during specific hours (I believe 7:30pm - 9:30pm). There is a cafe and planetarium shows which we did not do either. We stayed for 2hrs. It gets busier around sunset which if I was going to do it over again, I would probably come then, wait to see the Zeiss telescope, and do a planterium show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelleyA15
50,Not just for La La Land lovers!,"Yes, I am a big La La Land fun, but this place is truly magical! The view is outstanding, you can see the whole downtown from the park! We just loved it. It is definitely worth a visit. Not just for La La Land lovers :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jofee14
50,Worth a look,"Suggest getting there at dusk to enjoy the lighting up of L.A. The observatory itself needs a few hours to enjoy it completely. It can cool of up on the top of that hill, so go prepared with something light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASRSKSSS
50,A Long Hike but worth it!,We had to park about a mile away as the parking was blocked as FULL and cars were being turned away - it was not. ($6 parking on the location or a mile away) It was worth the hike once we reached the top. Beautiful views of LA and the HOLLYWOOD sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Page1977
50,View the entire valley from the highest point in the Hollywood Hills,"Beautiful view point of the entire Los Angeles area from the famous HOLLYWOOD sign to the ocean. Air conditioned observatory offers fascinating hands on exhibits for children and adults alike.Cafeteria offering cold salads, sandwiches, wraps and snacks at reasonable prices.Paid parking. Be prepared for a bit of a hike up the hill if parking lot at the top is full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyBain
50,Must visit,"This place is so under-hyped and is never mentioned among the best places to see in LA. The observatory is high up on a hill and you can practically see the whole city from there. And it is breathtaking at night. While you are at it, catch one of their shows on astronomy. You sit leaning back looking at a lit up, curved ceiling and the optical illusion takes over. It's like travelling up to space or gazing up at the night sky. The exhibits are great too. There is LA's first telescope, different models that show change of seasons, day and night, phases of the moon and a life size periodic table with all the available elements in tiny bottles. A couple of hours is enough time to cover all the activities.Remember to wear a jacket in the evening since it gets quite chill at that altitude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rovingeyes
50,Beautiful scenic place,Wonderful and interesting place to see. The view is beautiful and very calming. You must see the show its educational fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheler586
50,Outside view only,"We just drove up to the observatory to see the city lights at night, so I cannot attest to the interior portion, but the view was outstanding. Parking isn't too fun as everyone else wants to see the pretty lights, so maybe a week day or certain day of the week is better than when I went (a Saturday).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyj466
40,Views of Greater LA,"Many visitors are here for the view, bring binoculars if you can. If you are interested in astronomy, and it is a clear day, you will be thrilled. Even on a weekday afternoon we had to park at the Greek Theater and walk 20 minutes uphill to get there. There may be a shuttle, but the nearby parking of yesteryear is no longer available. Free parking and admission, and suprisingly crowded on a Wednesday in the fall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbmb310
50,GREAT VIEWS of Los Angeles,"Historic as well as FREE, the Observatory gives the visitor the BEST views of LA possible. A must see before GOD destroys LA like he destroyed its biblical counterparts Sodom & Gomorrah!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2015tanuki
50,Great!,"Quite apart from the wonderful panoramic views on what was a beautiful day, the Observatory itself is well worth a visit with a lot to see for your free admission- for example we were lucky enough to catch the Tesla Coil in action which was a great spectacle. We also paid(but a nominal amount)for entry to a half hour show “Water is life” in the Planetarium which was very good and not least because of a very good live narration from an enthusiastic lady presenter but it was surprising given the number of visitors on site how sparse the audience was.All in all well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirMRH
50,Beautiful Place With A Lot To See And Great Views,Another great place to visit if you are into science and astronomy. The entrance is free. When I was there it was crowded but still worth the visit. You can see a telescope. Plus a lot of the history of the place. They teach you a lot about the night sky and have some pretty good exhibits. There is a film in the Leonard Nimoy theater that is pretty good. Outside you can see some incredible views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign.It is easier to park at the lower level and take the bus up or if you are feeling adventurous you can walk the 7/10 of a mile. They have a cafe if you want to spend a lot of money.It is a great place to visit. Definitely worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Beautiful evening views of downtown LA,Take a short hike up into the hills above the observatory north of the main parking lot and you will be rewarded with wonder views of the observatory and the LA skyline.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryk441
30,Extremely crowded,It was extremely crowded. We parked far and walked alot. The view is pretty nice but I was not that impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackson321
50,Very nice view,If you are visiting LA this is the best place with an awesome view of the entire city. Better if you are visiting by night because you can see the lights glowing over the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702roxanad
50,Fantastic views!,"This place is amazing!! Views all around, from the Hollywood sign, to downtown LA and everywhere in between. I learnt a lot of history there and how the tides and space works. Will definitely be back at night time to view the telescope in action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammi_sinister
30,Is that it?,This is a hill overlooking Los Angeles. The fact that it's #2 on Tripadvisor's list of attractions tells you all you need to know about LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenanneTraveller
50,What a great afternoon,"So we thought about heading up on a day off, what a delight it was.Stunning views of the city, the Hollywood sign.. and just everything!We paid our $7 to see what the show was all about, and it was brilliant, it was a very insightful, and educational half an hour experience/lecture teaching about the stars and patterns.After it finished, we instantly went and got tickets for the next show, which was also great!Definitely worth the couple of dollars.Once the shows finished, the sun had set and the skyline came to life.With incredible views for miles, we had a competition among ourselves to see who could get the best photo of the Hollywood sign, clearly I won.But the whole place is great and well worth a few hours of your life if you’re in LA.FREE WI-FI!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simondrumstyx
40,Great stop!,This was a beautiful end to our time in LA. Highly recommend stopping here to see the fabulous view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaoV3991YI
50,Good View!,"The observatory looks historical. There is a lot to do in the observatory itself. Able to spend a good 2 hours. Able to see & take a picture of the Hollywood sign as well as a glimpse into LA from the peak. You can see the lens of the observatory during its operation hours but there is a specific timing where someone will show you of how it works up close.If you’re driving, you might want to get there as early as possible as the parking lots at the observatory are limited. You might have to park at the side of the lots available on the way up to the observatory; you would have to walk up hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalpreetHarvi
40,Nice view of L.A. and the Hollywood Sign,"Accesible by public transport, the Griffith observatory is placed on the top of a hill providing great panoramic views of L.A. and the Hollywood sign. The observatory is closed on Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWorldMap
50,Top 5 Favorite Places in LA,"Highly recommend place to visit in LA, close to Hollywood. There is a spectacular planetarium show with a live orator! Catch some incredible views outside too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zippy1717
50,Totally worth the journey!,This beautiful building is a must see in LA. You will be presented upon arrival with the beauty that is Griffith Observatory. From the amazing gardens/lawns to the beautiful architecture and views you will not be disappointed. Make sure you go to the immersive experience and the Leonard Nimoy theatre. Do not leave this off your visit to LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robber76
50,Once in a lifetime experience,"We were lucky to visit this place with terrific views, tremendous learning experiences and panoramic wonder. I would recommend at least a few hours to see some of the wonder. It would take a week to experience it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/needtogetaway7
30,Worth a visit,"This is a great location to watch the sunset and get a quick look at the Hollywood sign. We didn't go in as there was a queue, but did watch the sunset. The parking is manic and you'll need to pay to park at the roadside and walk up. There's not much space, so expect a bit of a nightmare as you near sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonHunter
40,Amazing views over L.A,"The views from the observatory are amazing. Looking over the Hollywood Hills Hollywood sign and L.A you can see for miles. Observatory is well maintained, very educational and interactive displays. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottybrowndog
50,Closest view to the Hollywood Sign and scenic spot for pictures,LA City Tours make this easier to get to such scenic locations. The Observatory was closed however extremely vantage points to capture a good view of the Hoolywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheraln2018
50,Don't Miss This,"The setting overlooking LA couldn't be better. The observatory itself is well done, with interactive displays and is educational for all ages. Plan to spend an hour outside checking out the gorgeous views of LA the Hollywood sign, and the mountains, and then 2 hours inside. Parking is limited so arrive early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billa562
40,Well worth a visit,"We went here as part of a private tour of LA with a guide. Not being locals we wouldn't have known how busy it would be and the challenge of parking etc. The guide did a great job of getting us there at the right time and knowing how to get close. The Observatory itself is very interesting, lots to see and do and we really enjoyed the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonefishingx
50,"Amazing place, beautiful view","The observatory is amazing. It has an amazing view of all of Los Angeles. Being especially close to the Hollywood sign giving you some amazing picture opportunities near the sign. You can see Downtown LA very clearly. We spent a few hours here, totally worth it. Such an interesting place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyleEvans815
40,Good place to visit for a day,"We went on a Sunday and it was very crowded. We aren't from LA so we do not know if that is normal. It was the day after the fall equinox, but I do not think that had anything to do with it. So, be prepared for crowds.We rode the bus to get there and even the bus trip up the road to get there was slow, as there were lots of cars. There were many people parked and walking up and down the road. I think if I ever go back, I will plan to go on a weekday and not a weekend.Last year we visited the planetarium in Chicago and I will have to say I liked it better, but Griffith is a nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/210SATX
50,Beautiful view,"I and my husband visited Griffith Observatory on September 27. Entrance is free and if you want to visit the planetarium is 6 dollars for a person. Parking costs 6 dollars per hour, but 1 hour visit its enough. Inside you can see a lot of astronomy thing like the moon phases and more. Beautiful view from the balcony of the Hollywood sign. I highly recommend to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285yulig
50,Tour bus stop,"What a wonderful place and really close to the Hollywood sign. So much to see, needed a longer stop here. The observatory is a work of art and is so interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/376patriciag
40,Beautiful view,"From the Griffith Observatory you have an amazing view over the City and the Hills. You can see the Hollywood sign, it is quite far away though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Svdvelde
50,"After 50 years, still a great value and visit",Hike up the hill from the free lower parking lot (a bit strenuous). Get a ticket to a planetarium show. Walk all the exhibits. Climb up to the telescope. Enjoy the view. A worthwhile 2-3 hour visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureTraveler113
50,Great views,"You will love the great views from so many locations here. There's lots of informative displays inside and it's free! There are things that cost such as shows. There is free parking that is a distance away, but if you want to be closer it costs $6/hour. If your plan is to hike (tons of options for this as well), there's bathrooms near the main trailhead with sinks and water fountains. If you plan to hike, bring sunscreen, good solid walking shoes (closed toe), and plenty of water. We were fortunate enough to get a map from a worker there and you can download them on your phone. Free wi-fi in the park as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorig689
40,Worth the visit,"My husband and I visited today. You get a good view of the Hollywood sign and LA as a whole. The observatory is free. We managed to get into free parking and then took the bus up to the observatory (50c an adult, requires exact change, less than 5 minute ride to top, runs every 20 minutes). If you go past the free parking it gets busy and costs $6 an hour to park. Cafe is expensive, gift shop middle to expensive. Lots to see. Very busy today with it being a Sunday. Worth a visit definitely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alices699
10,Hollywood sign,You can get better views of the Hollywood sign from the boulevard saves paying 6 dollars an hour parking - that’s if you can find a space,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmcdi
50,nice place to see with children,It's definitely a best place to spend around 2 hours to take a visit. Good city view from the hill either during the day or when getting dark. It's also a good place to take your children to experience the galaxy and outspaces. They will enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackier_rui
50,Science Written in the Stars,"The Griffith Observatory is a very cool place to check out. The best time to go there is during sunset because you get to see spectacular views of the mountains and the city. Parking does become hectic and there is a short walk uphill, but it is all worth the experience.Going inside the observatory is free! If you want to see the planetarium, the cost should be under $10. I regret that I didn't try it out. I love taking the photos here. I went here for a few hours during sunset and the clouds were coming with its lightning. Very cool when lightning occurs!This is definitely a great place for photographers. It is no wonder why ""La La Land"" chose this location for one of their film shots. I recommend that you bring your shoes for walking depending on how far you park from the observatory. I'm definitely coming back when there are meteor showers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anhimation
50,hike and learn,great 1 mile hike up to observatory - cool planetarium with great movies and planetary education and science learning,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/174roberte
50,Arrive at dusk for a sunset spectacle,"We loved this amazing vantage point of Los Angeles, it felt a little bit magical watching the sunset from so high up with the whole of Los Angeles lighting up below us. And then as darkness came the moon, it was a full blood moon but wow - this was something else, you could almost reach out and touch it. Inside the observatory are incredible stories, history and learning opportunities for all. The crowds make it busy at some times of year but we were lucky with a parking place and a short walk up to the top. Highly recommend this as a stop on your LA list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boxonsea
50,LOVED IT!,"SO much fun! The views were spectacular - Saw the HOLLYWOOD sign and the steps where ""the rebel without a cause"" trod... The exhibits inside were interactive and a ton of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theatrix9
50,I got hit by a meteor in the planetarium.,"While watching the stars and planets in that wierd domed movie room, a meteor came down and smacked me in the head. It hurt real bad.I went outside, the ghost of James Dean tolf me not to go into the movie room because of the meteor problem. I told him I already got hit by one. He laughed, so I told him his movies blow chunks. Was he laughing now? He was pissed.I was looking thru the telescopes on the observation deck, and saw two people doing it through a window of a neighboring motel. Amazing.Then I saw the Tesla coil, that electrical lightening kinda thing, and got shocked the living hell because I snuck in and grabbed the poles. Bad idea, don’t do it yourself.I took the tram bus, we blew a tire. AAA took two hours, and we were all mad as hell.This place was awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtrla
40,Very nice!,"This is an awesome place to bring the family or even a date! Parking can be tough, given free admission- but luckily the shuttles are very convenient. The night view is amazing and the planetarium show is worth watching :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abbey0130
50,BEAUTIFUL!,"This is one of the best spots in LA. What a view.Situated atop Griffith Park, this is probably the best place for a view of the entire city clear out to the Pacific Ocean. The best part is just about every day is sunny, so take your pick of days while visiting. The Observatory itself is beautiful, and historic. Take the time to go inside and talk with the staff, and take in one of the many shows available. You should also take the time to visit the rest of Griffith Park, the many trails to spend the day hiking, oh yeah, and there's that big Hollywood Sign located close by.Tip: Bring plenty of drinking water, sun-screen, and wear comfortable sneakers or hiking shoes. Some trails are pretty steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/594stevev
50,Sunday outing,This is a great Sunday afternoon trip.Always great to go to the observatory every few years and hiker around Griffith Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgeb4u
40,Lovely views and photo ops for Hollywood sign,"We drove up by car, and we were not the only ones so expect queues and some time before parking becomes available, but well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_shildl
50,An LA Institution,Always a great spot to take touring family/friends or to take a great hike for great vistas of the city...on a clear day that is:-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDPfjl0702
50,Iconic. Great views,"Have saw this place in so many movies. Great to stand there where these films have been made.Amazing views over the city and of the Hollywood sign. Inside interesting too.

50,To be big country you must invest to science,Everbody must understand that to become a big country you need to be out of limits. And you must serve your knowledge with people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ergdm
40,Great afternoon out,"I just had to visit the observatory during my visit to LA. A very interesting and worthwhile trip, lots to see inside the observatory itself but the main attraction has to be the incredible views of the city.It was a bit difficult to get to as there were roadworks during my visit, but still got there and was still able to find parking so no bother there! Would definitely go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanbucknall
40,Great views of city and hollywood sign,Free entry. Very busy but good views. Lots of information inside but hard to get to when its so busy. Worth a trip though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108
50,Education and great views,"I was very impressed with this park, the educational value and different shows can take a few hours to watch and view.I went at night and the views of La are also spectacular!Highly recommend this park as I’ve been to La 30+ times but this was my first visit here and it was excellent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcelo_pilot
50,A must see!,"We loved everything about the Observatory, especially the planetarium!We got up there just before sunset, perfect timing to get the sunset view and night view of LA and the Hollywood Hills.We saw the Viking show at the planetarium, which was only $7 per person and the experience was awesome.Word of warning, the big telescope at the top has constant huge lines, so make sure you leave yourself enough time to queue as we didn't. And some exhibits can only he experienced properly when its daylight. Although we did see a cool demonstration of the Tesla Coil!The views are stunning, breathtaking even and a visit hers is an essential for every first time trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKS85
40,Great panorama photo opportunities,"A free Night visit to the observatory that was excellent. Parking was a nightmare, but there was an amateur bring your own telescope event on. Can walk through the observatory at your own leisure.The views of the strip are amazing and some great photos can be taken. If you hit it just before dusk then you will get photos of the Hollywood sign, and conclude with the strip lights.A great free attraction that you can spend as little or as much time as you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneeg116
50,So Fun,"The view from up at Griffith Observatory can not be beat. I'm from a small town, and while I love to see all the stars in the sky, this was unlike anything I've ever seen. We watched the sunset, took some pictures with the Hollywood sign in the background and then it got dark. As beautiful as the view was in the evening, the view at night was even better. If you've been to LA, you know there are a lot of lights, but I still couldn't believe how beautiful it was. We looked through the big telescope at the moon, and outside a smaller one where we could see Saturn and it's rings. The museum part is cool too, with all the meteors and elements. The seismograph is cool too, if you jump, you can get it to move. The workers with the telescopes were very informative, answering questions if anyone had any. It's free to enter, but you have to pay to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefee818
50,A Must See,One of the best decisions of our visit to LA was going to the Griffith Observatory. The ride up the hill alone is worth the trip and the views from the Observatory are A+++,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomascR4785YC
50,"Great views at sunset! First time visitor, glad we went.","Views were amazing. Parking is not that bad if you go on a night when the greek theatre is not in use. Lot of parking in the greek theatre lot if you don't mind walking about a mile up to the observatory, it's not that steep and took us about 15 min. The views at the top are worthy it, we went on a Tuesday night and it was crowded but not that bad, experience was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzaccone
50,fun and beautiful views,"Do check out the live shows and check schedule for a star party. We went at during the day and dusk is the best, you get the day views and city light views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idrawart
40,Excellent experience but too crowded,"Excellent experiencie for a observatory, museum and a sunset hot spot with a great view of Hollywood sign.You can go by car or by bus. If you go by car, try to get 2h before sunset to park. If is possible, avoid the days with shows at Greek Theater.Try to start your visit with Leonard Nimoy movie.Buy your tickets to the planetarium, and reserve time to the moon observatory as well.You don't have to pay to visit, so you can go out at the sunset, take pictures and go in again.3-4h to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioCanedo
40,Nice views,"This was a treat for families with children aged 6 and up (younger than that may not be as interested in some of the exhibits as long.) It's hands on and has great views, especially on a clear day. Our family had a really good time. The only problem is parking. The small lot toward the Observatory fills quickly so either take the shuttle there or be prepared to walk, which was bad because of the views but not recommended for those with knee or back issues. Dirt & uneven trails at times and you'll be walking an incline to get there and a decline back. If you are in average shape you can do it with no problem, even with kids - but not a stroller.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blublaze13
50,Great place for learning,Very impressed with the teaching here. My 6 year old grandson learned a lot of new info and soaked it up like a sponge- he can eve quote it to you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimml2015
40,Another great sightseeing in LA,Classical building in the hills of LA with great views of the city and one of the best observatories in the world.The giant pendulum and all the exhibits relating to astronomy was informative and well presented,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funholiday70
50,Not to be missed!,We had originally planned to stop at Griffith Observatory for the views of the city which were incredible! The whole park is great with lots of parking and photo opportunities. There are additional hikes; make sure you take water with you as the heat was intense.The actual observatory was really interesting and had lots to see and explore. It was a pleasant break from the heat. There are additional exhibitions inside at an extra charge.We arrived just before the observatory opened and found in the afternoon it got very busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHannah172
50,Great Park,"My daughter and I recently stopped in Griffith Park/Observatory while on vacation. The park is a great area to get out and do some hiking. With miles of trails, you can hike close to the Hollywood sign, and get great views of downtown LA in the distance. The Observatory also offers some great views and photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanW_12
50,Must see while in L.A.,We went here as part of a tour of the city. Our time was limited but it was wonderful place to see high above the city and to see the Hollywood sign. The science that is involved in the observatory is wonderful as well. They have a pendulum that shows the gravitation pull of the Earth. The views alone are worth a visit to this observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberjeanr2014
40,Nice but crowded,"Nice place to go to see the Hollywood skyline. Every weekend, the Observatory is packed with people which makes for heavy traffic congestion. If you're driving up there, watch out for all the people stopping to take pictures on the side of the road or looking around at the skyline and not for oncoming cars. On a clear day, you can see for miles. Parking, when you can find it, is $4/hr which I think is reasonable. The exhibit inside, if you're not just going to take pictures, is also quite extensive. Lots of space related objects and meteorites. We were lucky that they were having a display of looking at the sun with various types of telescopes. I would recommend going inside to learn something about our universe and the importance of the Observatory other than it being a popular location for TV and movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yearbunes
50,Brilliant,"Walked to the observatory from the franklin road area. The walk up is nice and gives views near the top of the Hollywood Sign. The observatory is amazing so much information is available it’s well worth spending time here, and you have the added bonus of great views over LA as well.It’s a definite must do if visiting LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garywN3559DL
50,A Must See for Locals and Out-of Town Visitors,"Have not been to the Observatory since the $93 million restoration/addition completed a few years ago and it is mind-blowing. First go see the free 20 minute show about its history in the auditorium on the lower level and learn of its importance to world astronomy and space exploration. The lower level addition was an unbelievably crazy feat of engineering and the additional space has interactive displays of the planets in our solar system with videos of surfaces, activity and scales to show one's weight. The upper floor displays are varied and well done and there are four shows on various topics. Highly recommend Centered in the Universe. Entrance to the Observatory is free but the shows are not and tickets sold only in person and in limited time frame before shows. Go during the week if at all possible. The only downside is parking. It is available only along the road leading up and may require a several block hike. Few handicapped places (5-6) up at top but there is a drop off. Beautiful views if clear and still impressive if not. Bring own snacks as cafe is lousy and limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catbird28
50,Unbeatable views,"It is well worth the drive up to the observatory, the views from the top are second to none. The parking is $6 an hour and there is ample space.The drive in through the Hollywood Hills is also really pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atickner
50,Amazing experience,"Amazing view of city would definitely go back visit..There is free parking towards the bottom of the hill. however, it's a long hike, so only to be done if you're able to walk a mile or two up hill. closer parking u have to paid. I took the dash bus 50 cent each ride up and down good way to void traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaymarie2019
50,simply amazing,"We visited the Observatory on 3 seperate occasions to watch the Sun set , the view is amazing and just breath taking ! their is lots to see and do whilst you are there so pop along and see for yourself just how amazing this place really is x",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxydiane
50,"Park at the top for spectacular views of the Hollywood sign, city and hills",There’s parking all the way to the top so only park down the hill if you want the walk. The dusty and dry landscape is iconic. Spectacular views. We didn’t do any of the tours or other activities so this rating is just for the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alect2017
50,never tire of seeing the sky,"Since its update, the Observatory is wonderful. Full of great info on all things celestial as well as other opportunities to learn and enjoy. A nice visit for adults or families. Go early to find parking. During the week there may be school trips with a lot of rambunctious kids--not a bad thing, but something to prepare for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288lollier
50,Gazing...,This place is incredible! I totally recommend taking your kids/teens here because you learn about what goes around in space and around you. I saw it at night and it was beautiful. You can go outside and see the stars and downtown LA which is beautiful as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindseyw777
40,Great view of the Hollywood sign,"Great views of Los Angeles, including the Hollywood sign. Get there before sunset to get photos of the sign as it's not lit at night. Get in line early for the main telescope up on the roof as after 6:30pm the lines become huge (we waited about half an hour and weren't too far down the line). They open it up right on sunset. They also had two telescopes down on the lawn which had slightly shorter lines (~10 mins wait). They also have exhibitions, which were great. Admission is free. Definitely recommend.We drove and parked at the observatory, which was $6/hour. We got there a bit before 6pm and got a park right at the top of the road close to the observatory. We needed 2 hours to do the whole thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiefisher2908
40,Griffith Observatory,My husband and I visited the Griffith Observatory today.We went by Lyft and returned by DASH bus (because of weird Lyft driver driving pass us and leaving-another story).The Samuel Oschin Observatory “Centered in the Universe” was excellent and we would highly recommend it. The commentator was exceptional ! More scientists should be like her - stimulating interest and the urge to learn more.Many of the interactive exhibits were not working on the main floor but the lower lever exhibits were excellent. The sculpture of Einstein was great.I loved the gift shop which was unusual for me. Most are very cheesy but this one was different. I had to force myself to leave and not continue it to spend money.We would highly recommend this for couples or families wanting to learn more about our universe. Well worth the afternoon spent there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audreyet2017
50,Sunset Walk was great fun and a little scary,"We scheduled our trip to the Griffith Observatory so we could take the Sunset Walk up Griffith's Mountain. We started our walk at the Observatory where we learned about the sun and why the sky is blue and how when the sun sets, the earth's shadow in cast opposite it. It is not a long walk up Griffith's Mountain, but there is a section of the path that is a little steep. On our way up the mountain, we stopped by the Berlin Forest, which is planted with evergreens from Berlin, Germany. Los Angeles and Berlin are sister cities. We continued our climb and stopped to see some interesting sights in the sky including a full moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. Below us was the city of Los Angeles with all its lights. It gets pretty dark on the mountain and we saw hikers and runners coming down the mountain at night. We also learned about P-22, a mountain lion who lives the bachelor life in the mountain. He even has his own website. He wears a GPS monitor and trail cameras record his movements which you can follow on his website. The scary part was coming down the mountain in the dark. I always carry a flashlight and of course, many people have flashlights on their cell phones. Those were a big help. Inside the Observatory are displays about the solar system and a Foucault Pendulum. Scientists were on hand to talk about the displays. In addition to the telescopes at the Observatory, other avid astronomy bring their own telescopes to share with visitors. It gets pretty chilly at the Observatory and on the mountain, so be sure to bring a sweatshirt or sweater. Long pants might also be a good idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joan632015
50,View of Los Angeles,"Parking is a hassle but it is worth it. Come plenty of time to find parking. if you are lucky you get to park in the compound. If not, you'll have to park on the street on the side of the hill. Parking in the compound is not cheap but I don't remember how much. There are lots of stuff to do once you are in the observatory. It is mostly free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaidyk
50,Stunning views,It is very crowded but worth it! We arrived around 6 pm and we’re lucky to have a beautiful drawn out sunset. We stayed until dark. It was a great time to go. We had to park at the bottom after driving up and no spaces and catch the shuttle. This worked out well. The views from the observatory were stunning. A definite highlight of our trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros_Mel2014
50,Love this view! Must see!,"I've been here every time I go to LA and I can't get enough of the view. You can see downtown LA, century city, Hollywood, and the Hollywood Sign! Definitely a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikentravels
50,Daily trip,"Amazing place during the daily, but i still have to experience a night visit.Los Angeles view is impressive and the fresh air of the Hill fit the environment.Definrtly hightly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniela_aschei
50,Crowded at times but so worth it,"Go early in the day for best chance at parking on top of the hill. It fills up most toward sunrise. Also visit during the week for the best chance of smaller crowds. This is one of the city's most popular spots for a reason. Like Getty Center, there are terrific views of downtown Los Angeles and Century City from the Observatory. Inside are exhibits that can be skipped but are fascinating. I particularly love timing a visit to coincide with the Tesla coil being turned on. However, you really can't beat the simple joy of just looking out from the observatory over the city while marveling at the beautiful architecture of the city itself. If you can't find parking at the very top, there is parking at the bottom of Griffith Park and trails to hike up. This takes 30 minutes to over an hour depending on the type of hiker that you are. Bring water if you visit via a hike!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana
50,Great trip with the kids!,"This is a great place to visit with and without kids. I have children ranging in ages from 7-16. Every time we go to the observatory they always seem to enjoy it as if it were their first time being there. There is a lot to do year round. Whether we do the same activities or new ones, there never seems to be a dull moment! I would highly recommend it to anyone. Leave plenty of time to find parking! Also, be prepared to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vig2001
50,Must do in LA,"Tourist stop in LA, recommend wearing hiking shoes about 1 miles up to the top of Mt. Hollywood! Great panorama when it is clear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barlagdavid

30,Okay but crowded,I visited on a Wed afternoon and it was super busy. Parking was a challenge and involved quite a long walk. It also cost $6/hr to park so we didn't want to spend a ton of time here. Anyone that enjoys science time stuff like a science museum and space stuff would enjoy a visit here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenshanahan
50,A great day at the observatory,Had a great time exploring this awesome place.Also enjoyed some amazing views while hiking the grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shantj2017
40,Fun and Free LA Attraction,"Griffith Observatory is a place that takes you out of the Hollywood/Beverly Hills scene a minute and offers stunning views of the Greater Los Angeles area. This is a quick and relatively easy attraction to see, but the parking can be extremely tough during peak hours. I suggest getting there right at opening or waiting until the first wave of guests leaves and trying to park in the available public parking near the entrance. There isn't a whole lot to do here so bringing a picnic lunch and eating on the front lawn is also suggested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1919YZryanh

50,Fun and cheap,"I’m a local and I haven’t been to the observatory in over a decade. There’s a whole new level and restaurant that I’ve never seen. I took my 9 and 11 year old for a visit on a Wednesday. They had a pupil free day from school. We arrived 15 minutes before it opened and it was Already packed. I guess you cannot escape the LA crowds. They have a water show in the planetarium that was awesome. The kids loved it. We were there for 2 hours, but I recommend 3. They have some great exhibits and the kids leaned and had fun at the same time. Don’t miss the Tesla Coil demonstation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amanecita
50,A classic observatory/planetarium,"This place is a classic that has been around for a very long time, but has been updated to keep pace with modern technology and scientific advances. The grounds are lovely and provide a marvelous view out over the city, especially at night. The programs are suitable for all ages and are well thought out and presented",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsJ9312VU
50,Worth the trip!,This iconic building is well worth the visit. Even before you enter the building the views if the city and the Hollywood sign are fantastic.

50,A must do whether first or fifth time in LA,"Have been visiting LA regularly for 20 years and hadn’t been to Griffith for at least 6 years. Why? It was still a great space, always interesting exhibits, beautiful building and of course, that view.Sure, parking is a nightmare (but the walk up from Greek Theatre really isn’t that far or you can get a DASH bus for 50c) and it can be crowded, but you just have to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara

50,"Near the Stars ...and learn About Them, Too","Of the many ""Star"" attractions in LA, The Griffiths Observatory is truly star-studded. Sitting on the slope of Mt. Hollywood the Observatory provides the visitor of any age great views of the stars in the sky ( at night) and in the Oschin Planetarium. Telescopes, sundials, Volta electric displays, exhibits of deep space, and astronomical talks are just some of the reasons to go. Breath taking views of the city and its connection with the ocean complete the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1050lynn

50,Great Views Good Museum,On a clear day this is one of the best views of LA. Perfect as well if you want to see the Hollywood sign. The free science/ astronomy museum was very well done. Parking can be a big issue however. Need to be lucky to find a parking spot and if you see one then just walk the rest of the way up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dovman
40,Cool view,"The Griffith Observatory is definitely worth a visit. The view is amazing, you can see Down Town L.A. and the Hollywood signs from here. The building is also quite impressive. The entrance is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kevertje22
50,Great views of Los Angeles,"Interesting place to visit but get there early to get a parking space, entrance is free but you pay for parking. The high location gives you great views over the Los Angeles area. The observatory is an interesting place to visit and learn about space and the history of space exploration. There is a bust of James Dean to commemorate the filming of Rebel Without a Cause there and of course you get to see the famous Hollywood sign from this location. Worth a visit if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday97
50,Iconic building with fantastic views,"We had 12 hours until we needed to be at LAX and decided to use a driving service to take us to the Obervatory. We arrived about 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday and found the grounds teaming with people. (Note = parking is available in adjacent lots which require extra walking therefore even if you have a car, it might save you time and frustration if you use a ride share service which can drop you off near the entrance to the Observatory.)There is no cost to visit the exhibits in the Griffith Observatory. The is a fee to watch the videos shown in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium however they are well produced and worth the cost of admission.Make time to watch the history of the Griffith Observatory (available at no cost) to learn about who Griffith J. Griffith was, and see details of recent renovations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMFV
50,Out of this World!,"Everything about the Griffith Observatory makes it a great destination for tourists and locals alike. Iconic views of the Hollywood sign on the outside and celestial views of the universe on the inside mean there is something for everyone. If you have the stamina, hike up to the observatory, and you’ll recognize the scenery from countless movies, TV shows, and reality shows. If you’re more interested in a museum-like day, drive straight to the observatory and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rantidote

We would have been quite happy to pay something to help towards the costs.You could easily spend several hours here depending on the attention span of those attending.We saw loads of interesting stuff about the solar system along with several meteors.There are telescopes available too.You get a good view of the Hollywood sign and of L.A. from outside and there is a restaurant for refreshments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBPete
50,Great Star Party,We went on a night that there was a star party. Loved the fact the public bring their own telescoped for you to be able to look at the stars and planets. Observatory itself was also very informative and would definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harkz-Bal

50,Nice place,"We visited this place very late in the night, around 9pm and it closes at 10pm so we couldn't see views from any of the telescopes.But the view from the top is absolutely amazing. If you are into photography, do carry your tripod and camera for some amazing night shots of LA.Would recommend to go here may be in evening when you get to see the view in both light and dark. We had to park a long way outside and walk upto the observatory as its parking was full even at 9pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ad_wanders
40,Smoggy downtown views,"Parking is $6/hour, it can be challenging during peak times. It is on the hill, accessible either on foot (very long uphill walk) or by car.

50,A Must See,We were searching for the Hollywood sign along Sunset Blvd to see from afar. We couldn’t find it and found our way up to the Observatory. We weren’t sure if it was leading us up to the actual letters on the sign because the road we were traveling on was so high up (if your afraid of heights beware). My two teens loved the view of the Hollywood sign and the city on the other side. Definitely a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillyann-Biscuit
40,Amazing if your are in to stars and history,"Nice place to go both for the view over LA, The Hollywood sign, but also for the amazing exhibitions on stellar and sun.

30,Good views but a NIGHTMARE to park!,"As the title says.... good view but honestly the organisation around the parking is horrendous. There’s no reasoning around who they let in (maybe if you offer money?!) failing that you have to try and find a space down the hill in the road which is $6 p/h and leaves you with a very long trek uphill.Is it all worth it?....... yes, just!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leew585

40,Great Views,"Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Used UBER to get there and would recommend as the parking appears to be very limited as many people were walking a long distance to reach the observatory. It was relatively clear so we had great views of the city and area. Paid for the planetarium show and it was worth it. Not very costly, maybe $5 a ticket. It was crowded but amateur astronomers on the grounds who let you look through their telescope. Observatory also has two of their telescopes open, night and day. We looked at Venus and the Sun. Very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17JAB
40,Good walk,"We arrived late afternoon and parked down the bottom in the park and walked up the trail. Great walk! As soon as we got out of the car there were 2 deer and their fawns only metres away. We saw a red tailed hawk, a woodpecker and various other little birds. The view was disappointing as it was so smoggy but the observatory was nice. They had the telescope out for people to view the moon and a guide explaining what to look for. For me the walk was the best. Didn’t take long to walk up the hill and many people of all age groups did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trihorsegirl
40,Beautiful Views,"We visited the Griffith Observatory purely for the views of LA and the Hollywood Sign, however the Observatory itself was surprisingly beautiful and interesting. We didn’t do a full tour but I imagine it would be fascinating.The views of LA are spectacular from the terraces, and the trail to the back of the Observatory up towards to the Hollywood Sign are beautiful.The only reason I am giving 4 rather than 5* is the crowds... the volume of people at the Observatory was extreme! And the cafe was pretty poor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyw371

It's got exceptional views and is an awesome place to take some photos and that seems to be the main attraction.Parking can be a nightmare so go early as we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BennyDoran
40,The Griffith Observatory is a Los Angeles Icon...the difficulty is limited parking,"If you're going to visit the Griffith Park Observatory, plan to go early. The parking is free until noon. After that, it's $6 per hour. Entrance to the Observatory is free. The programs are at extra cost.Views from the Observatory outer decks are wonderful! The only down-side is the air quality on many days in Los Angeles. Plan to take some pictures of your group with the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign in the background.There's food service at the Observatory. The food is OK, but it's not anywhere near what I would call ""value.""The Lenard Nemoy sponsored exhibits in the low level are not to be missed! One of the down-sides of the Observatory is the ""not working"" interactive exhibits on the entry floor. We were disappointed to see that the Tesla exhibit was not working.Given the pluses and minuses at the Observatory, it's still a great place to take your family whether you live in Los Angeles or are visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsR9569RO

40,What a view!,Came here with my wife and our friend whilst road tripping around California! The views from the observatory are amazing! Especially looking over the whole of Los Angeles & downtown.

They put on a fake show for you, and then you are left to wander around alone. It is very crowded, incredibly boring, and overrated. If it isn't a clear day (which usually it isn't) you won't be able to see any of Los Angeles at all. Very hazy. Went there once and will never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd

It was extremely busy - both people and vehicles.To start, parking close to the observatory costs $6 per hour. If you want to hike up, there is free parking but your looking at a minimum of 2kms up the hill.The views are amazing. You have a view of the Hollywood sign and of the city below. You can also pay 50c to use those large outdoor binoculars.Inside is great if your really into astronomy. There are interactive displays and lots of information on offer. There are about 4 areas that we were able to visit, as some on the main level were closed.There were a lot of tours going through so lots of foot traffic inside, as well as locals visiting.On our way down from the parking lot we did see two deer grazing near the road which was pretty cool to see.If I were to go again, I would definitely go during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb
40,Really rewarding hike,"If you don't end up going into the Observatory, hiking up through the forest at Griffith Park and through the desert to the top is breathtaking and a nice change from the Californian suburbs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abarnes1
50,Magical LA Landmark,"Have been going since I was a little kid and have loved it every time. Exterior and interior used in films - The film, ""Rebel Without A Cause"", is a good physical introduction. And be sure to go to the star-show inside. Believe it takes a reservation. You'll explore the heavens in the comfort of a fine light show. For young and old kids who love to explore place and mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenshermanassociates
50,Vacation,"We decided to go to the observatory but there was no parking near the top so we parked and hiked up. Other than being a very hot day it was a good hike. Pretty much straight up! Beautiful views from up there. Also, spent 5he money to see the planetarium show. Well worth the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahrU7015YX
50,A must go in LA,"If there's one place you have to go when in LA, this is the place. With a breathtaking wiew of all of Los Angeles Angeles really close to the Hollywood sign. Seen our both at daytime and night, and I prefer to see it after sunset so you can see all the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jorgened
50,"Amazing Views, Long Hike",I was extremely excited to see LA from the Observatory. We parked at the bottom parking lot and hiked up to the top. I would definitely suggest taking the shuttle up if you are not a hiker. My teenagers were not prepared so they complained all the way to the top. I would love to,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keepitcutecass
50,Amazing views and interesting,"Watched sunset here. Was a clear night and the view was amazing. Massive queue for the large telescope, so be prepared to wait if you want to do this. Look around the observatory, as there are interesting facts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KentLady83
50,Closed on Mondays but still worth it for the views,"Even though we made the mistake of going on a Monday, when the observatory is closed it’s worth doing. Car parking is expensive at $6 an hour but in that hour you get amazing views of the Hollywood sign, LA sprawling at your feet and the observatory itself is a beautiful piece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554wendys
30,You've been warned - parking sucks,"We had to drive around 6, that is SIX! times to be able to park. The parking/traffic workers have no clue. At one end the are waiving you in and at the other they are making you turn around and waiving you out. The whole time I can see empty parking spots.We went to the observatory on our first night in LA for the views, not for a show. I later learned that there are many spots around the city with spectacular views and less traffic to contend with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanAndTiffany
50,Awesome view,"Has a very beautiful view! The parking is $6, but it’s worth the visit. It also has a planetarium, that would have been cool to see but unfortunately we didn’t had time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anapG758UV
50,Excellent Views,The views from this observatory center were amazing. The best part is that you don't have to break the bank to enjoy them. You can see the beautiful skyline view of LA including Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/410person

50,Popular spot and amazing views of LA,"We went up at 9pm to see the lights of LA. What a great spot for the views, and interesting displays indoors about the stars and other stellar stuff. Take no notice of parking full matrix signs - it said full and we got one right up close to the Obseratory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepM8179YN
50,The wonderful Griffith Observatory,"I took Griffith Park this summer. I admired the Griffith Observatory and I took many pictures.The building combines Greek and Beaux-Arts influences, and the exterior is embellished with the Greek key pattern.The building has an observatory, exhibit hall, and planetariumThe planetarium is a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy and the night sky, or for training in celestial navigation..The show is delightful..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/axiniatudorel
50,Great views,Wonderful views over the city and the Hollywood sign. The walk up to it might prove difficult for some but a shuttle bus runs after midday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huggy1964
50,Worth a stop if touring LA,"The views during the day include great photo ops for the Hollywood sign. The Hollywood sign is not lit up at night, but view of LA at night is breathtaking. The parking is $6 and NO admission inside the observatory. It warms my heart that there is one place that is a tourist atteaction that is not trying to profit...thank you for the free admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chroy
40,Great Views,"We had a 30 min stop on our tour... Really great views of L.A. and probably the closest you will get to the HOLLYWOOD sign.. I wish we would have stopped while the Observatory was open, we may have to go back just to do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhC1926TM
50,GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY,Absolutely amazing and awesome views over L.A. ITS FREE to go into the museum and observatory and has a FREE SHOW as well. A must see as its a fun day out for all. There are also plenty if hiking trails around the observatory. You can also see the HOLLYWOOD SIGN from there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darleines
50,Fun Day!,"If your looking for a place to take your children for some education, this is a great place. Spend the day and pack a picnic. Great just for singles and couples as well. Enjoy the views. Bring a camera and take lots of photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddudasik
50,Worth it for the views alone!,"We got an uber there so didn't have to worry about parking, the views were amazing from all angles! If you have spare time definitely worth a visit. You can also learn alot about space inside and there is a cafe and gift shop. There are sign posted trails also, so we walked back down, into the park with more great views and some animal sightings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmat88
50,Such an great place to visit with a great view,Unfortunately we did not have a lot of time at the Griffith Observatory. I would make sure you have at least an hour here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miz_emma11
30,Family U.S trip.,Can see the Hollywood sign in the distance but expect massive crowds and limited parking. OK if you have a spare day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonrB1253YW
40,Hiking trail,We went into the observatory and also a hike. It was nice family friendly and the hike is pleasant for both kids and rest of family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabyloks76
50,Check inside,I was inside and I took a picture with Albert Einstein :) It is very interesting place to visit while in LA. I think on the way there i saw a house of famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snezolina
50,Alex,"Nice place. They fixed some things, made easier parking space and drive way itself. Great view, but if you are looking for Hollywood sign it’s pretty far for the pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6117VFalexb
50,A visit we should make more often... fascinating place!,You can get your exercise & science in one day.. or just go for the science part. The Observatory sits in Griffith Park... so there is a lot to see here. Feel a million miles from Los Angeles without leaving the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwinter68
40,"Go for the views, stay for the stars!","I went at the height of tourist season and it was PACKED and although it is an amazing facility and neat, when you're there with 20 busloads of tourists it does lose its shine. That's why I highly recommend planning your visit to coincide with a ""walk and hike"" with the rangers and an astronomer. They have them once a month in the evenings, and it takes you a very short, easy walk away from the crowds where they tell you about the environment, the wildlife and what constellations you can see. You can ask as many questions as you want and it's a great way to experience the mountain. Afterward you can go back to the observatory and do whatever you want there. If you come for nothing more than the view and some selfies, it's worth it, but if you want a unique experience, go for the walk and talk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/751theresav
50,What a view of the LA basin,What a great place to see the iconic Hollywood sign as well as downtown LA. Go early because it fills up quick and traffic can be a bit hectic. Loved that their are places to hike if your adventurous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piginapoke241
50,Had never been here before. Now I wish I had gone long ago.,It was awesome place to visit. So much to see and absorb. Very interactive and informative for sure. Now we have to go back so we can see everything we skimmed over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rickczap
50,Simply Fantastic,"A very well laid out place to go to, but go early or during the week. Our first attempt was on a Sunday, but this was too busy. We then went on a Weds and this was just right. No queue and parking up top. The views from the top is not as goo as I expected. We had a better view of the sign from the Griffith Park area of Hollywood, looking up at the sign.The planetarium was brilliant, as were the exhibitions. All of the staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I'd would recommend 2hrs parking, unless you are planning to wander off into the surrounding walking areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nhorsefield
50,One of the best place in LA,"The Griffith Observatory is an icon of Los Angeles. The best time to visit is in the evening. It is one of southern California's most popular attractions. Very crowded place, go there by taxi or by public transport. The Observatory is located on the southern slope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park. It is 1,134 feet above sea level and many parts of the Los Angeles cab be viewed from here. Also, one can have best view of the world-famous Hollywood Sign from here. There are telescopes, several exhibits and a grand Planetarium. The Samuel Oschin Planetarium with 290 seats is one of the finest in the world having spectacular Zeiss star projector, digital projection system, state-of-the-art Aluminium dome, comfy seats, sound system, and theatrical lighting. Every show is presented by a live, engaging storyteller. There is a catch, show tickets can be purchased ONLY at the Observatory, only for that day's shows. Tickets are available at the main box office inside or at automated ticket machines in the building. No advance purchases or phone transactions are possible at any time. Tickets may be purchased with either cash or credit cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
50,Better than Expected,"Loved the Griffith. It’s located in Griffith Park in Hollywood. We took an Uber from our hotel because we had read that parking was horrible. We were there on a Tuesday about noon and there were parking places available. The building is gorgeous, high up on a hill. There are rooms to explore about astronomy but to visit the planetarium on the grounds is an extra charge. There are views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674dianeq
30,So crowded,"I know the Griffith Observatory is an LA icon, but I was a little underwhelmed. It is beautiful inside and out, but I think they'd be better served selling a limited number of tickets each day. It was so crowded during my April visit that I couldn't fully enjoy the experience. For one thing, we had to park very far away-- this can be a deal breaker for folks with mobility issues. Second, there is no one to explain what the various lines/queues are for. We waited in a line thinking it was to enter the telescope area, only to learn later that it was for a film that had already dispensed all the available tickets for the day. Third, it's very easy to loose track of small children if they are not in a stroller, and yet there's no room to push a stroller down the halls. So I didn't love the Observatory as I'd expected to, and I really wasn't able to learn much during my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassidy144
50,A quintessential LA highlight,"To put it in simple terms, if you’re going to be in LA you can’t miss this attraction spot. The architecture is Art Deco at its best and it’s become an LA icon. The views from the Griffith Observatory are the best. You get to see all of LA. Inside the observatory you’ll get to explore very nice and educational exhibits. Additionally if you don’t want to take the exhaustive hike to the Hollywood Sign, you can get the Instagram worthy photos of the sign from the observatory courtyard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1677CVjosep
50,West Coast Road Trip,Well worth the trip up to the Observatory. Amazing views over L.A. Does get busy & chances there will be no spaces in the main car park. Parking on the road which is metered but warning make sure you park the way of the traffic otherwise you can get a parking fine!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJK4
40,Short Visit - Stunning Views,"Our visit was little more than a short stop and a few pictures. (Only in LA for a day, and because it was Monday, the Observatory was closed. Nonetheless, it is a grand, picturesque place to visit with gorgeous architecture and breathtaking views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trav1500
30,Nice views away from the traffic,"Griffith Park Observatory is in Griffith park, which is huge. Tons of trails to hike if you're into hiking in the sun. Or you can just drive up to the Observatory and look over Los Angeles and all the traffic/freeways. Some people bring a picnic for the grassy area outside. What's nice is being away from the traffic and traffic noise. Cars look like ants from up here. And in a way, it elevates you from the woes of human troubles, even your own. It gives you perspective on how tiny we are. The inside is cool in temperature but the entire building is not open, only parts of it are. It's a nice day out but not a lot of shade. Bring water and sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/encouragement8
40,Very good,This place is steeped in history and is s great day out. Good views of the obligatory Hollywood sign and great parks etc. Take time to enjoy the actual observatory and take in all on offer. Well worth a visit 👍,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmQ1382NB
40,Nice view!,Nice overview of the city as well as the Hollywood sign and a lovely park. It takes about 40 minutes to get there by car and 10-15 minutes walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/567hbo
50,Awesome,We were told about this from a friend so included it on our trip up to Hollywood. We were so pleased we did! It’s fascinating as well as being interesting and gives great views over LA. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencA6283NY
50,Must visit,A visit to the observatory is a must. The views are wonderful. And we also enjoyed everything inside the building. It was very educational and fun at he same time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luciaq2013
40,Sunset and City Lights,"Went up Labor Day weekend to see the sunset and people watch. Knowing that parking is limited, we ventured by public transportation. From Downtown Los Angeles we took the Metro Redline Subway and got off at Sunset and Vermont. From that corner, took the local Dash Bus line. This Dash bus is specific to the Observatory. Total time of travel was 50 minute. We by passed all the traffic of cars trying to park. We were dropped off right in front.Walked around the exterior of the buildings multi levels taking photos. Great views of the Hollywood sign, and downtown to the ocean. Once the sun was down the city sprawl lit up. Observatory telescopes were open along with local astronomy enthusiasts who brought out their telescopes and setup to view Saturn and Venus. While waiting in line to view planets, it was nice talking with tourists.It is really fun to go inside and see all the exhibits, but that can be on another visit. With such a beautiful way to watch the sunset and city from above, it was just a casual relaxing evening!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TG_World_
50,Griffin Observatory,Most beautiful views in the area! Gorgeous park so much to do and see Breathtaking Took the Sightsee The City Tour is how we found the Griffin Observatory Free to visit afforable parking Love love love,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer696716
50,Super interesting,"The Griffith Observatory is a great place to spend at least part of a day. We only had a few hours, but that just means we can come back again soon to enjoy, and next time will be at night! We came for the morning and arrived 35 minutes before the 10am Sunday opening time. The upper lot was already full and the paid street parking was filling up quickly. Traffic is a nightmare so I'm glad we came early and left plenty of time to get in and get out! Oh, yes, about the observatory!!! It is wonderful. We especially enjoyed the Tesla Coil exhibit and demonstration. All of the displays are interesting and I would like to spend more time there. We purchased tickets to the planetarium show: ""Water is Life"". Want to watch another show next time we come. Fantastic views of Los Angeles basin and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talkslikeaduck
50,Griffith Park and Observatory,"My husband and I visited the observatory at night. Very neat to look at all the city lights! The inside of the observatory was pretty neat, too. We hiked in the park, the next day. Awesome view of the city and Hollywood sign! Such a fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillcoble
40,A Great Hike!,Just did the hike up and explored outside early one Sat. morning - pretty good view atop for a hazy day and a great way to start your morning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctccac
40,Free admission but can get very crowded,"You can see the Hollywood sign from here, though it's kind of far off. Otherwise you do still get a great view of LA, and an intro to basic astronomy. Griffith is rather small, but the public access to the telescope and several interactive exhibits make it a stop worth taking. This area is nice, too, since it was a warm day but there were pockets of cool breeze at that altitude.I'm starting to think that the sign indicating that the Observatory parking lot is full is on permanent display. We came first on a Saturday but the sheer amount of people trying to enter the park turned us away. We came back on a Tuesday and the ""lot full"" sign was still there, but there's plenty of parking on the side of the main street running through Griffith Park. Expect to be on your feet a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchat105
50,Great visit,"We went to the Observatory by train and then caught the Dash bus up to the Observatory. Great views including the famous Hollywood sign. We enjoyed our visit, we watched a movie and walked around looking at the various exhibits.one more place to tick off our list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kohkoh
50,Popular attraction but worth seeing,"This is such a popular spot for both locals and tourists that parking is always an issue. The lot is tiny and parking is mostly along the side of the road, which make traffic horrendous on the weekend. The observatory itself is great, and the view is incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HighPriestessSusan
50,A must-see for locals and travelers,"Anyone who either lives in or visits Los Angeles has to see this place at least once. Both the building and the nature around it are breathtaking, and it's an awesome spot for dates, hangouts with friends, or even bringing the kids to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grahaml142
50,Spectacular views,"Go there to catch a sunset. It's stunning. Best of all, Free!!!! Parking in the lot is very limited, so be prepared to park your car further down the road and hike up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellye94
50,Great place for all people. An iconic place of Los Angeles,"Located in Griffith Park just north of downtown, The Griffith Park Observatory is a great place. During the day it not only has great exhibits dealing with astronomy and science plus a great planetarium show. There is also a different theater to show videos and where they will give presentations. And it has some very unique items. How many places have a camera to show the sun. And the views of Los Angeles are the best in the city (even the Hollywood sign is nearby)At night this p[lace just gets better. Best night spot when it comes to views. They have a public super powerful telescope (on clear nights) that you can look through. The local astronomy club sometimes have people outside the building with really good telescopes to show off different items of interest. And, if they aren't busy, they even take requests.If you like science it is a great place to visit. If you want great views of Los Angeles - night or day - no better place.And you can even get a picture with Albert Einstein (they have a statue for pictures in the basement area.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim_Wito
40,Interesting,we visited here as part of an LA City Tour - interesting place with a great view of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyNottag
50,FANTASTIC PLACE,"I have been visiting the Griffith Observatory on a Tour of L.A. with A DAY IN LA TOURS; it was so beautiful!!! the view on Hollywood sign and the view of Downtown LA and Century city. All this I have only seen on TV and we were there!!! It was so beautiful. We had enough time to take pictures, the view. Magic moment. Thank you ""A day in LA Tours""!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaidaP
50,Very nice,"LA is a pretty boring town to wander around in. Sure, you have the Walk of Fame, Universal, Beverly hills etc but still, pretty boring. This gemstone saves the day though. Being in the northern parts of LA, on top of a hill, you have excellent view over the city and the building itself is very beautiful.Get up here and enjoy the sunset over the hills.Parking can be very crowded at the top, but there are parking lots around the entry point, and from there its just a few minutes with shuttles. The fee is 50cents per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evilhosse
50,Space - ‘The’ Final Frontier,"A ‘bucket list’ item, we visited this High-up-in-the-Hollywood hills venue to explore L.A. from up on high and to journey through this famous part of space exploration.The Observatory has been the backdrop to a number of films and TV series but more so, involved in deep space research for some 80 years all added up.Perched high in the Hollywood Hills surrounded by Cedar and Pine, the site is open, clean and although busy, never feels cramped. Parking can be an issue but the LADOT DASH bus from Vermont/Sunset Metro (Red Line) station to the Observatory is only $0.50 per person.There is a lot to see and do, surprisingly so, with a planetarium, event horizon theatre, numerous displays and talks, museum-esque displays including the Edge of Space and Gunther Depths of Space exhibits. There is a small but adequately stocked cafe, a gift shop and plenty of restrooms.In homage to a great ‘man of space’ there is plenty of reference to the (sadly deceased) Leonard Nimoy - known to most as ‘Spock’, Captain Kirk’s right Hand Vulcan/man. The Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theatre is dedicated to telling the Observatory’s history, with Nimoy himself giving the narrative.There are costs associated with the Planetarium ($7.00/adult) and children under 5 are only admitted to the first show of the day - none thereafter.The whole visit can take a good 4 hours + for the more dedicated and interested visitor but even the least interested will need 2 hours or more.But a word of warning to families with younger (up to 4 to 6 years) this is not something likely to hold their interest for long. Yes, there are many interactive displays but the level of understanding is more attuned to those of a slightly older age bracket where the displays will have some meaning. Otherwise there is likely to an element of boredom and frustration kick in which could spoil your own viewing pleasure.That said, there is a lot to see and do but ...The science on offer is exemplary and it really opens up a whole new vista on life and its creation - and about our ever expanding Universe. To see the Earth represented against some of its near ‘cousins’ and its size in relation to the Milky Way, let alone the Universe leaves the mind Dumb founded.To understand that in terms of time, a human lifespan is a mere speck in the oceans shows how far Time has come and how far Time has to go ....To coin a final phrase in conclusion, Space is our ‘Final Frontier’ ..... and whatever lies out there surely remains to be discovered - one day?This Observatory may well be part of that final discovery; it certainly deserves to be.Either way, it’s certainly worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4764XGandyt
50,best view of LA,"I travel all over the country and people often ask my advice about what to see. When they ask me about Los Angeles, I always include Griffith Observatory. It's free, it's impressive, and offers one of the best views of L.A. and also a great view of the HOLLYWOOD sign. I work with bands who perform at the Greek Theatre, so when I'm there, I always make a trek up the hill to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltech
50,Great view of the city at night!,"We visited at night and it was pretty crowded, but still worth the visit. The views were amazing. The signs said that the closer lot was full so we parked along the road part way up only to find out at the top that there was plenty of parking in the lot up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CordeliaGray
50,Interesting Exhibits,"We went to the Griffith Observatory early in the morning and were lucky to find a parking space within a 10 minute walk to the Griffith Observatory. Since there is limited parking at the Observatory and if we were not able to find a reasonably close place to park, we were going to take the DASH Observatory bus from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Red Line station. In addition to the great views from the Griffith Observatory, there are several interesting exhibits to display and/or put the the solar system in perspective. There are additional live shows and films that you can see by signing up as early as possible to ensure admittance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurer1234
50,Nice,"Definitely a place to go when in CA . It’s gets very busy so you have to get there early,but if you get there early you may not want to spend the whole day and night there . Parking is the Greek theatre only when there is no event going on there . Regular parking is 8.00 PER HOUR yes that’s right . They open the telescope up from the hours of 7pm to 9:30 pm and you have to be in line and there is no time limit for how long you can stay at the telescope.so your not guaranteed to see after spending time in the line.we first went about 6pm and the park was completely full,went again the next day at 1:00 (they don’t open til 12 pm ) and had to park quite a hike up) we spent about 3 hours there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lirellek
50,Go at night - avoid the crowd and WOW,This place is awesome if you can go late at night during the week when no one else is there. The crowd during our visit was horrible but towards the end of the night we were able to look through the telescopes they had set up. We saw craters on the moon and the rings of Saturn and it was incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmchapma
50,Worth the trip to this ICONIC location.,Definitely go here at least once. It is an amazing place to visit and to take photos. The views of LA and the Hollywood sign are great. It is obviously a very photogenic location since it is used in so many movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellBee
50,Great hike,"Highly recommend the hike from the bottomOf the hill which starts at the nature park. Doable for people of all fitness abilities and gives you an amazing view of the Hollywood sign half way up.The views from the Griffith Observatory are absolutely amazing. We went at mid day on a sunny day, and it was incredible. Will definitely be doing that hike again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellarussell
50,The periodic table of elements was a highlight!,"There is a lot to see at the observatory. Of course the views are spectacular. You get a great view of Los Angeles and the iconic Hollywood sign. The observatory contains a science museum with information on the planets, meteors (with some meteors on display) along with quite a few other interesting exhibits. One of my favorites was the periodic table of the elements with examples of most elements in little boxes, in the right spot on the table. They also show a film in the planetarium, but we didn’t have time to watch it. The observatory is free, the movie costs a nominal fee. You can either drive up to the top or hike to the top. We saw plenty of people walking. There was also plenty of parking down below with shuttle service to bring you up to the observatory. I would recommend trying to go when it is less busy, as it was very, very crowded when we were there around 5pm Labor Day weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
50,"Incredible Views, Good Food and Fab Movie theater!",Be sure to include this on your visit to LA. It will help you get your steps in from wherever you park too - bonus!Be sure to buy a ticket for any of the movies in their theater that was not at all like I expected. I've been to many Omnimax -style theatres but this one was a complete 360 degree dome and the many cameras that re-create the night sky were in the center of the room. Coolest theater ever.Ate lunch on their patio with a nice view through the haze. Food quality was excellent at better than expected prices. Exhibits were very engaging and fascinating as expected. Learned a lot! A must-do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wiertrvl
50,"Beautiful Architecture, Views and SCIENCE","We went on Labor Day Friday (parking lots get full so the Dash Shuttle for $1 each way allowed us to find parking and ride for cheaper than a paid lot there). Take your camera, Binocs and walking shoes ( there are wonderful trails in the park as well). The center itself is a wonderful introduction to the universe, in very accessible exhibits. There is a cafe with a gorgeous LA view on site, and it's a great place to be for sunset. Admission is free, save the planetarium show which I highly recommend. It's the most professional one I have ever seen...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WesSDCA
30,Didn’t know what to look at,"This was a very confusing place to visit. I really wasn’t sure what I was looking at. There are several displays with some descriptions, but often it was too busy to be able to get to the front to read what you were looking at. It would have been nice to have a guided tour instead of just figuring it out on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cash_me_outside
50,I can See it...No I can’t!,"Los Angeles has lots of?A) PeopleB) SmogC) FreewaysD) Largest municipal park in the WorldWell anyone could pass this test. And a visit to the Griffith Park’s 4,000 Acres! Would not be complete without a visit to the Observatory. Griffith Park(GP) is named after a guy named? Griffith who gave the land to the city. The Observatory was built in 1935 and then had its remodel in the 80’s along with the Hollywood Sign. If you REALLY want a good view. Go early in the am or pms for a fabulous view of Nightime LA! First issue is Ugh...Parking! It can be a nightmare. So plan accordingly, to walk. If you can avoid Sundays, do so. The kids will luv the exhibits and guess what? It is FREE to enter! There is a restaurant that runs $$$. So budget your visit. The Observatory has been featured in at least a couple dozen movies Terminator etc...I mentioned the Hollywood Sign because it is visible from the west side. The Griffith Observatory is a Must See if you go to Los Angeles. Stay in the public areas and this will be a safe memorable visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesR2784SM
50,surprising highlight of LA,"This is absolutely worth a visit. Built in the 1930's it has a beautiful aura of calm within the crazy ness that is LA. All kinds of star gazing and planet spotting instruments inside,There is a Planetarium inside with timed shows. And the viewing deck outside is the ideal spot to take your photo of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7oaksmum
50,Nice,Great view of the Hollywood Sign. Can't complain at all. Guide was informative. The bathrooms were clean as that is very important to me,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindycC2469TR
50,Worth visiting,"My wife and I visited yesterday and--in spite of the crowds--enjoyed our visit, particularly the show (Centered in the Universe) at the Samuel Oschin Planetarium. There is a $7 charge for the movie per person, but most of the attraction in free. Speaking of free, park in the free parking and take the DASH bus (50 cents/person) up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GradingMachine
50,You cant beat the view on a clear day,The observatory has always been a great place to visit to view the city as well as see the various shows and exhibitions. It's a great place to just hang out and enjoy the night vistas as well. Good for families as well as couples. I've been up there to just enjoy the view when wanted to just get away. Parking can get tight at times so just be aware.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3568OYwilliama
50,The Griffith Observatory,"Definitely a must, with view of all of Hollywood/ downtown/ Beverly Hills/ and even the ocean on a clear day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandonSD04
50,Great views,"Stopped here for half an hour while on a LA Tours, stunning views of LA and The Hollywood sign. Interesting place to visit and I would liked more time to learn more about it but we were on the clock. It was very popular and busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobW947
50,Great view,Went it was closed so didn't go in but the view from the top is awesome. Parking was a lot more then I can remember from my last visit. We parked free at Greek Theatre and walked about 20 minutes with a low-medium incline,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacob_633
50,Great Griffith!!,"What an amazing spot to see LA , my next home :) ! Amazing views of the City and in back the Hollywood Sign! This attraction is low cost of parking. I suggest you bring a bottle of cold water with you though. Can get hot fast!!! This is a must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miamor13
10,Waste of time,"The observatory is nice, over crowded, too many vehicles and an ambiance of an overloaded subway car.Best time to visit is never.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandydogsdad
40,Great free attraction with stunning views,The main issue with the observatory is parking. We arrived before 10 on a Sunday and most parking had already gone. We managed to find a space just the other side of the tunnel from where it was a 10 minute walk up the hill. Parking was $8 an hour. Views from the observatory are stunning and include the Hollywood sign. There was amazing amount of wildlife including deer and humming birds. The observatory itself itself looks had plenty to see and do although obviously gets a little crowded. There is a restaurant and a number of restrooms. All in all one of the best attractions in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
50,Everything about this was amazing,"We Arrived in the morning, on a weekday - lots of parking . Cafe at bottom was great . The home is totally doable and the views are amazing. I wish the observatory opened earlier in the day but ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akdav5
20,Nowhere at all to park!,"We tried to visit here in July 2018. I realise this is a key tourist time and a key tourist destination, but they really need to sort out the parking situation!! We drove up and it seemed ok, until you get to the winding road leading to the observatory. People were literally dumping their cars and parking roadside, even in places they shouldn’t have been. This made the remainder of the driving difficult, as people were pulling in, pulling out, walking roadside etc. We got up to the turn for the observatory and there was a worker there informing people there we’re no spaces in the car park. We turned the car around and drove away. Such a shame that a lack of parking and organisation meant we couldn’t visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3269CEsarahb
50,Beautiful View!,Loved the view from the Griffith Observatory! Would love to have been there when it was open. Very nice area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p_stephens61
40,Crowded,Went there on a Saturday morning which might have been a bad idea. It was very crowded. The drive there was also painful as traffic didn't move. We were able to find spots in the parking lot by the observatory but it took a really long time to drive that last mile.The observatory has some exhibits about the solar system and the universe. Most exhibits are well done and explain science in lay terms. The only issue was the crowds. It was very crowded and let's just say some people are not always considerate.The view is great when you get to the top. Nice opportunities for pictures of the Hollywood sign and for a view of LA if you can see it through the haze.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSB_10
50,Well worth a visit!,We did the Griffiths observatory at dusk which is the best time. There is ample parking and a modest walk to the observatory. The views around the observatory are spectacular at night and the opportunity to view the stars within the museum are excellent and worth the trip alone.Do not miss - one of the cheapest and spectacular events you’ll do in LA.I haven’t added any photos as that’ll spoil it for you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sardev2014
50,Come for the View. Stay for the Stars.,"A great place to visit with family, and not just to take a picture of the city or the Hollywood sign. Exhibit is worth going through and I only wished we had more time to stay for the Planetarium show. A must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erictabet
50,Wonderful day,"So, what’s not to love about the Griffith Observatory? Scene in so many films and TV programs. Are used to come here to see the Pink Floyd laser light show in the 80s. Brings back memories. They have the best thing ever inside: The tesla coil! It really is something to see. Also the views from up above Los Angeles at night are astounding. Worth the drive up the hill to spend a few hours. Ask questions they will be happy to help you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcalkid
50,A view above the city,"Though there was a bit of smog, this was a sight I will always remember. And such interesting exhibits as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahcg93
50,Starlight express,Great place to visit especially during hot summer nights. Stars are actually appeared lot closer up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalek2014
50,Amazing Place,"The views are spectacular, especially of the Hollywood Sign. The closest car park closes at dusk though, so if you're driving, you will need to move your car before the gates are locked when the sun goes down. You can also see the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJ-TheHonestReviewer
40,Can actually be a romantic visit,Had a great time @ the Griffith observatory! Wonderful things to see & the building itself is a greatArchitectural design. Going later in the day ... Take advantage ofEarly sunset...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,Beautiful Views and Science,"Great place to start a hike or walk around.Building is very cool, displays were great. Loved the Tesla coil.Avoid parking - small lot that was full early. We used a Lyft and the DASH bus (50 cents!). Far more civilized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanpO8064QQ
50,Go for sunset,"Super cool place to watch the sunset, as get to see the amazing views both during the day and night. Although expect large crowds.Good free exhibits and the option of a paid planetarium show (which we didn't do but others have asides good).Take some food with you as the cafe is expensive and not particularly great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samturner2016
40,Great but crowded!,"Fabulous place, beautiful views, but very crowded and expensive parking..$8 per hour!! I remember it used to be free. Planetarium show was very cool. Observatory exhibits educational and interesting. Worth it once in a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306karenr
50,A must do,We went on Monday when observatory was closed but the view is fantastic! It’s a very iconic place (watch rebel without a cause before going). You can see Hollywood sign and LA skyline. Our teens enjoyed and our 4 year old loved the merry go round that is part of the park as well as the train. You can ride horses and hike to the Hollywood sign from the park. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mchans
50,WOW!!!,This is a must see if your coming to LA or live here. Wonderful educational attraction that has free admission and reasonable show prices. Adult or Child will be amazed at what they learn and get to share with each other.Great for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoHoMike
40,Griffith observatory,Beautiful walk up and the building itself is lovely. We went in the early afternoon so it was quite busy so getting up close to the exhibits and being able to read the information was a tad difficult but in saying that the information provided was very interesting and interactive which would make it a good place to visit for children of all ages and adults alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthar632
40,Crowded on weekends,This place is beautiful however i suggest going during the week like I did on a previous trip. My last trip here was on a saturday and it was very crowded. We had to take the shuttle which costs $3 cash. Overall it still was an enjoyable trip. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwill26174
50,Great place for young teens,"Great place to go discover about the night sky. Learn about solar system, gravity and time.great laser show",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbtrucker
50,LA la land....,"ANyone who watched the movie -- and like it -- should go there... why? because this is the real place that was in this movie as itself...On the other hand, if you are not into the movie... and not into stars in the sky... check if you really want to go there ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcinDrP
50,Breath-taking views & superb building,"Although our hotel boasted spectacular views of the ""Hollywood Sign"", we were advised to travel up to the observatory to get even better views. The weren't wrong! As well as the Hollywood sign, it gave us the opportunity to view not only the city of Los Angeles but the stunning Hollywood Hills, dotted with little pockets of splendour including some wild deer roaming at the base of the car park area. The grounds of the observatory are well kept with a map of the solar system marked out in bronze before you enter the building itself. The ceilings in the foyer are literally out of this world - spectacular artwork throughout. Don't forget to walk onto the roof to get even better view of the city. well worth parking at the top car park for $8.00 - better than walking up the hill on very hot conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nigel_829
40,Iconic view of the city,"Phenomal view of the city. This place is also famous from the many movie shots taken here. Just make sure to be in time. Watching the sunset and the citylights go on is famous and popular, but also the most busy time. Traffic is heavy and parking places are limited near the end of day, we experienced ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelHalma
50,Solar System,Walked around and sat in the planetarium for their program. Beautiful and relaxing. It also gets a bit crowded on weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macksir
40,Educational stop while in LA!,"It's a pretty nice stop while in the West side of LA. Although I prefer it during the weekend since it's less crowded and we can actually park on premise vs parking along the hillside and then walk back up. If you watch La La Land, it basically gives you a fantastic view of whole LA. Inside the observatory has a huge pendulum which is affect by the earth's spin. Fascinating piece of science equipment. Closes on Mondays and a nomal fee to take the whole family for morning or afternoon stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryn496
50,A wonderful attraction to visit - and its FREE!,"Though we only had a short time here, and it was quite crowded (as the observatory can get on a perfect summer night), Griffith is absolutely worth the time to visit. Most everything is free, or at a very reasonable cost. Only the planetarium costs money, but closes earlier than the rest of the observatory, so be sure to plan ahead with that. All ages will enjoy it here, as there is plenty of space outside to enjoy the views of the city - and of course the stars! And plenty of button-pushing, educational attractions inside for the smaller ones. The observatory can get quite crowded on weekends, or nights when there is another event nearby, as people will stop here passing by. All in all - highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcstarz
50,Observatory,Was a great place to go to but very busy especially at night time very educational about planets and telescopes and a beautiful view up there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondie1973
50,Beautiful and must see,"The building, scenery and the collection everything is absolutely worth it and loved it. It’s educational as well as a scenic experience. They had many telescopes also our for public viewing which was an added bonus.You could see the Hollywood sign very clearly from this location if it’s a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msg132

40,Interesting with great exhibits,Had a guided tour here and was fascinated by all the great exhibits. Well worth a visit. Food and beverage available and great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666Gordy
40,Griffith observetory,Great place to visit.spectuler view of los angles from up. Parking facilities is good. Not too much walking when you park car up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amisha8327
40,Beautiful View,Great destination for tourists! It's a little cramped inside the actual observatory but a great experience nonetheless. Also there's an awesome hiking trial that starts from the observatory all the way to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evberduo
50,Star Party,What a lovely night! We totally enjoyed the view of the sunset but also to see the planets through the local telescopes on the lawn was just amazing! The observatory was our favorite place to visit in all of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennieW5716
50,A unique and classic building - an unforgettable location and view,"If you've seen 'Rebel Without a Cause', you've seen the iconic Griffith Observatory. It sits boldly on a promontory, overlooking Hollywood and indeed all of Los Angeles. You could just go there for the view alone, which is the best anywhere in the L.A. area, with views out to the beach.The building itself is a quasi-Art Deco 'international' mashup that somehow works beautifully. It's just so cool. And the early 2000s renovation added massive amounts of underground space, including the Leonard Nimoy Theater and a new planetarium (sooo wonderful). There's also the long-resident Foucault's Pendulum and every kid's dream: a Tesla coil!Now for the practical advice. Parking is now highly regulated and difficult to get. Visit the Observatory's web page to see what they recommend. There's also a shuttle. Since I live here, I'm used to parking down below the Observatory on Vista del Valle Drive or thereabouts and hiking upwards. It's not far, so requires only a medium to low-medium stamina and strength. Or you could Uber there (see the website for drop-off/pick-up location).Make sure you include time to eat at the Café at the End of the Universe (Wolfgang Puck's place), with its jaw-dropping image called 'The Big Picture', showing deep space galaxies.My father attended the opening week of the Observatory in 1935, and a gorgeous black and white photo of it on opening day graces my home. It's a special place - so go and have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chappsnet
50,Must See,My father use to take all 12 of us here in the 70’s. I always looked forward to our weekly visit. Now I take my eldest grandson here. You meet so many people and families. If your in Los Angeles this is a must see place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5DGjoh
40,Beautiful remodel - difficult parking,"Despite being an LA county resident, I hadn't been in the planetarium since it was remodeled. I was pleasantly surprised by the chairs. They are well padded and recline to an angle that allows easy viewing of the overhead show without craning your neck. I also hadn't fully explored the new section underground or seen a show in the Leonard Nimoy theather downstairs. The shows and exhibits were everything you could want. Some of it went over the head of my 4-year old grandson but he had a good time anyway.The biggest challenge was parking. We had to park 3/4 miles away, downhill and pay $8 per hour at a meter. We could have parked down at the Greek Theater and taken a bus but I didn't know that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiogapass
50,Stunning: wish had more time.,"After being completely underwhelmed by the world famous “Hollywood” sign, the GO more than made up for it.Out of our party of 8 I’m the only one with a science background but without exception we all loved the Observatory: once you get up there that is. The parking arrangements are a bit hit and miss but saying that it was only an added 15 minutes.Some people just come up here for the views of LA but they depend on the haze and smog. For those who want to see the park and Observatory you’re in for a treat. So manny things to see, do and hear I would highly recommend a few hours here; just superb!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speedbird350
50,Breathtaking,What a view from the outside and so much to see inside the observatory. Both educational and entertaining.. I went with adult children and grandchildren. Everyone of us thoroughly enjoyed it. I will definitively make a return visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175carolel
50,Family Fun!,The observatory is always fun for a family get away. The kids enjoy all the exhibits and being able to walk on the hiking trail is so much fun. The evening views are amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esmie3x
50,Great Evening Out,I took my child there for the night to see the stars and walk around. We had a great time. We even walked one of the walking trails. It was getting dark so we didn't go that far. The whole place was lovely. We really enjoyed ourselves. Though the parking is a nightmare. Be prepared to walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natural1sumr
50,Date night,My husband and I went after years of not going there. It was a really fun and romantic night. We got lucky that it wasn’t crowded. It was a five enjoyable night doing something outside the box.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyndacondit
50,Classic elevated view of LA,"Interesting science inside with a seismograph, planetarium, and time pendulum. Near zoo, garden, and Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johneK7087SK
50,Must see in L.A.,"Hiking around the area is beautiful, and there are many trails to choose from. Don't forget your water or sunscreen; there's not much shade. The show at the planetarium was really well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackcat1200

50,Great day for a date,My Husband and I had a great date day visiting the observatory. We went to all the movies that they had available. We had an evening event already planned but we will be back to stay for the night time events and views. I would recommend and do it during the week to avoid the heavy crowds. They are closed on Mondays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/269ValerieB
50,Great views over Los Angeles.,Great views over Los Angeles. The walk up to the observatory was hard going as it was very hot. Very busy when we went so had to park some distance away. Worth it though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nortontowers
40,?,It was a great day. What a wonderful view. Very interesting information at this place. What a wonderful way to see Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattip186
50,One of the best places to see L.A.,"We have been going to this place for the last 10 years and the number of visitors just keep on growing every year. We never had a problem finding a parking spot 10 years ago, now you have to come very early in the morning if you want to get a spot closer to the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoilor2015
50,One of the Best Sites to Visit In LA,"The Griffith Observatory gives a fantastic view of Los Angeles and the best view of the Hollywood Sign. It is worth the drive, but parking can be a challenge. If you cannot walk long distances, take a ride here and get dropped off, as you may need to otherwise walk a fair distance uphill after parking your car along the road at $8 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
50,Interesting to see- great views of LA and That sign!,Parking is $8 per hour - it’s mainly on street near the Observatory but their is a car park too - it’s very hilly and not much of a pavement/ sidewalk so take care on your walk up to the main building as it was busy ( Sunday mid-am) so we ended up parked a bit away. Hot too. Toilets and a cafe at the Observatory if you need them. Great views out over LA from top and of the Hollywood sign ( without the hassle of trying to get any closer! ) .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhJ1878CC
50,Worth the time out,Yes you do need to take time out yo visit even if only for the views of Los Angeles. However its worth going inside too. Lovely building and grounds...... and its free. Not much else is in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sidecarmark
40,Breathtaking views of LA at night,"We went to the observatory on a Sunday night (they are closed on Mondays) and I have never seen so many people in my life at such an attraction. The parking lots were all full, so we parked at the base and walked an eighth of a mile up the hill to the observatory (and this was about an hour and a half prior to closing time!). The observatory is awesome and I would have loved to get closer to the myriad of exhibits, but there were hordes of people and it was difficult to see things up close and move around. The views outside of the city below are breathtaking, so bring your camera. It’s worth your time to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenned17
50,Incredible Views of Below and Above!!!!!,"We drove up to the Griffith Observatory on a Saturday night with a full moon and completely clear skies. Not surprising, the crowds were huge. The line to look through the big primary Zeiss telescope was 90 minutes, it was tough to look at the exhibits due to the crowds and the planetarium shows were over for the day. However, the views of the city lights below and the views of the heavens above are worth the trip alone. We learned from a docent that the view from the smaller telescopes set up outside on the grounds is really not much different than the primary telescope with the big lines. We waited in line only about 10 minutes for the smaller telescopes and got see Saturn with its rings and Jupiter with its moons - Amazing! Even with big crowds there seemed to be sufficient parking up top if you are willing to pay $8 an hour - but considering there is no fee to visit the Griffith Observatory any parking fee is nominal. A definite must see in LA!!! The whole family was impressed!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FenwickPeriwinkle
40,Only for LA view,"Actually nothing special for observatory. But Los angeles view is very nice. You can hardly see hollywood writing on thr hill, as its very hard. We took selfies but no chance. You need to zoom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803melisaf
50,A place to see,"We have been to the Observatory many times. The swinging ball in the lobby is the most facinating thing. As the earth moves, so does the ball. The exhibits change frequently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billcE3222IR
50,Amazing!!!,"First time visiting with friends, and it was amazing, great panoramic views of LA and downtown, also the Hollywood sign . Great starting point if you want to take a trail to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imaddg
50,Loved this place,it was our Silver wedding anniversary and being Welsh like Griffith Griffith we decided to visit the observatory . When we explained we were from the same valley as Mr Griffith we were treated like royalty lol Even got to sign the visitors book ! We had numerous photos with the director and our Welsh flag a really memorable day Diolch yn fawr iawn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShelleyW338
50,Favourite spot in LA,"Comfortably my favourite spot in LA, offering a unique and fascinating insight into astronomy along with fantastic views of downtown LA.There are many great exhibits on all aspects of astronomy, including a well designed timeline explaining the creation of the universe, and the planetarium shows are given by live performers.The only issue is parking which can be a pain to find and you may have to walk a little bit to get to the observatory but it is well worth it.PS I'd suggest walking up the nearby paths or road to get a good view and photo of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterpX1946JR
10,highly overated,"yes you get a good view of LA and the hollywwod sign. but imho not worth going . could not get UBER after as there was no service , 15 mins is enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tops333
40,The view is a must,We were there at the sunset. Very nice outside. Take pictures and very good place for spotting Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581finnl
40,Great Sunset View,"We went there on a Monday, not realizing the observatory would be closed. We were able to walk the grounds and see the sunset from this amazing vantage point, though, so it was still worth it. We took a Lyft there, which in one way was a great idea because we didn't have to worry about parking/walking far. However, phone reception at the top is practically non-existent, so we had a difficult time arranging for a ride back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496vickia
50,Loved it,"We walked up the hill , its hard to get parking in the carpark, but it was worth it, we saw the sunset and payed to watch the excellent movie with a great live narrator, definitely worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AD1174
40,"Hot, but it's well worth enjoying the views","try to avoid Rush hours, because of traffic jumps. Sometimes difficult to parking. The slope is also hard if you go up to the observatory in a hot day of summer. Take enough water and do not forget your binoculars.The views are amazing, both to the city and the HOLLYWOOD sign. Just to enjoy or take a brief picnic. After visiting you can go to Rodeo dr and enjoy with all kind of luxury details (shops, hotel, restaurants, cars, models, paparazzis, VIPs, influencers or even freaky strollers).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josegV3393SU
50,Fantastic,"If you’re in the area, you will enjoy a visit here. We drove and as we approached, there Is parking along the street. Depending where you park it could be a long walk there. You have to pay for parking in these spots. We kept driving fruther up the hill and there is a massive car park for free. Then across the road you can get a shuttle bus for $1 per person. Much cheaper than paying for parking. We had to wait around 15 min for the bus. Well worth visiting for the views. Just be prepared the Hollywood sign is much smaller than I expected from this point. Observatory very interesting. Overall worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adelor
40,An enjoyable evening but super busy!!,"We decided to check this out with our 3 kids (12, 10, 8). It offered great views of the city and Hollywood sign and possible hikes nearby. There were lots of interesting displays inside in terms of space and the planets. We didn't spend very long here so just a quick visit but our kids did enjoy it. The downside- parking is a nightmare. It was so busy and I would recommend checking to see if events are happening nearby at the Greek theatre. A concert there made traffic even worse. We were able to park fairly close on the hill heading up. We didn't look at the telescope as the line was long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdzmom3
50,Arrive early and enjoy the nice cool weather,"Hi, I took a nephew visiting from Dubai to see the view at the Observatory and because we arrived around 9:20 a.m. we found parking on top! I was so happy not to have to climb. Anyway, we waited for it to open at 10 a.m. and he enjoyed reading about the satellites, sun, moon, etc. I have been coming to the Observatory since I was a kid and it does not disappoint. Beautiful view once the fog disappeared and good view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzeenni
50,Interesting- especially the show,"Visited the Griffith Observatory and it was very interesting- even the teen enjoyed it which is saying something! The show in the large round auditorium type building was excellent and a great experience. It’s a fun way to learn about the planet and solar system without being bored or nagged about going back to the pool.It incorporates a museum with fun which is exactly what we liked about it.The only downside was that they carried the astronomical theme to the gift shop - an astronomical museum with astronomical prices ! I guess it is rather fitting.It is free entry and you only pay extra to view a show but it is cheap.I recommend watching the Tesla Coil display (free, it comes on every so often).10/10 would recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amhs14
30,Very hot.,It was really hot and crowded and very difficult to find a parking space.Unfortunately the day I was the sky was not clean and view was not amazing as expected but from that point you have the clear feeling of the huge dimension of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hairfare
20,Not a great view for Hollywood sign,It’s way too far away to be classed as a decent spot for the Hollywood sign.Parking was ridiculous and over priced and didn’t accept cash.Can’t smoke anywhere around as it’s a fire hazard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemloucam
50,The view is Perfect,The place is located on the top of the hill. Which I found the place perfect to see the Los Angeles. It is also a good place to take the picture of Hollywood which is vivid in the background. The observatory was so crowded when we visited. We didn't explore much because of my toddler. But I loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CholetzTravelDiaries
50,So much fun,I wasnt sure what Griffith park or the observatory were all about so we just went for the sunset. It was STUNNING and I wish we had spent longer to enjoy the hiking. We bought a ticket for the “movie” totally worth it. My kids are 6&11. An LA must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samtammy1212
50,Stunning,The perfect place to see the Hollywood sign and Hollywood hills. The sunset is unbelievably beautiful. The views to LA are stunning. A lot of things to visit inside. Certainly a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanamG6890KV
50,A definite one for the “to do list”,"Amazing views and highly recommend getting tickets to the one of the shows - my teenage boys said it was the best show they had been to - we went to “water is life”. $7 adult and $5 students. We went on a Sunday - opened at 10am, got there at 9.30 as heard parking was a Nightmare . Top car park was already full but luckily someone left as we arrived. Not cheap parking - $8 per hour. There are many car parks further down but it would be a hot climb up or you can catch the dash bus. Great photo spot for Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607louiset
50,Best viewing spot in LA,"WOW! The observatory area is just beutifull! The mountains surrounding and the view of the city up to the sea! At night the observatory comes to life to see up!One advice about parking, if you want to park near and when entering you see notices saying its full, dont care and just keep going up, theres always places to park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gioscatman
40,Great views but very busy,We walked up on one of the hiking tours. It’s a great walk up and terrific views all round at the top including good views across to the Hollywood sign. The observatory has a reasonably nice cafe. The only problem was that the observatory itself was extremely busy (admittedly an August weekend) to the extent we gave up trying to look around inside.Walking up is a good option either using one of the hiking tours or just across from the Roosevelt coffee shop on N Vermont Avenue you can take a hiking trail which is 0.6 miles to the top. This is also just by the Uber drop off / pick-up point. It’s steep in places and very exposed to the sun so worth doing early in the morning. But doesn’t need any special equipment and perfectly possible for children. Would take about 30mins to go up but is less than 15 mins on the way down. We did one of the tours up which also take you off on a detour into an interesting residential area part way up and so increases the length of the climb up (including commentary stops) to about 90 mins.Although the walk down is very easy you can get a bus down to the Roosevelt coffee shop / Greek Theatre for 50c.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomGSt_Albans
50,Oh. My. God.,"The level of inspiration this place provides is incredible. From the exhibits, that you can visit and interact for free, to the stunning telescope, equally for free. If you’re lucky enough, there’ll be amateaurs on the esplanade near the entrance, stargazing, and they’ll let you look through their contraptions. Pay a couple of bucks and go to see the movie: you’ll support a beautiful institution and you’ll get a chance to see Leonard Nimoy himself guiding through the beautiful stuff they have at that place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crShelidon
50,See the stars and Hollywood sign too,Firstly the telescope is impressive - and apparently more people have viewed the sky through it than through any other telescope on earth! But there is also a really good (free) display of early astronomy including Galileo's telescope and navigation aids plus the Foucault pendulum which shows the rotation of the Earth. Come at sunset to see the Hollywood sign. You can drive but its $8/hr to park and very congested so we're glad we took an Uber up and walked back down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAF_Wales
50,Great Views,It was very busy for a weekday. The only problem that I could say about it was the parking. We took a hike on the hill while waiting for the doors to open. The Observatory had a lot of great information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyB527
50,Great view of LA,Not to miss view of the city. SUPER crowded on the weekend. Too crowded to actually look at the displays inside.Parking was $8 an hour!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/digene
50,Amazing views for Free,"In order to save costs on Uber, I visited this site with 4 friends that I made while on a G Adventures tour. It was only $9.00 USD to get there from our hotel. The Uber dropped us off and picked us up from the top of the hill.There are spectacular views including the iconic Hollywood sign from this building. One of my friends enjoyed taking pictures of the birds in this area. There are also great exhibitions in the observatory itself. I enjoyed seeing how much I would weigh on other planets. The most amazing thing is this sight was free! I would highly recommend visiting this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2torontotraveller
50,"Wonderful view, wonderful planetarium","Many people visit the Griffith Observatory primarily for the amazing views, and you should, but please do take time to explore the great building, the interesting exhibitions on space and the telescope and to attend one of the great planetarium shows. I visited several planetariums in my life, but the combination between the great presentation in the dome and the wonderful live narrating by staff member is unlike something I ever saw.We had an Uber drop us at the entrance and afterwards we walked down via the easy ""Boy Scout trail (about a mile full of wonderful city views).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne-Marijke
50,Very impressive and exciting Observatory visit,It was a fantastic wether and such a great & exciting knowledge transfer - we enjoyed the hole time all five of us. Stunning views to the Hollywood sign. Only the way back was somehow stressful! Little to no Taxi was showing up at the hill!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karsteno76
50,Great view and lots to learn!,"High atop LA is this old observatory. Great views of the whole area, Hollywood sign and the ocean on a clear day. Tons of people and little parking so taking a shuttle from the bottom is a good idea. Bathrooms and a small cafe is there and lots of small exhibits for people of all ages. Hot in the sun and little shade but a great time to spend relaxing and enjoying the views of the area. A must see when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh79b
30,Hard to get to!,"We planned a late afternoon visit to the Observatory and Planetarium, but were hampered in our efforts by the road being closed so we would have had to park far down the road and as we were planning on staying for sunset would have had t traverse back the same windy road in the dark with three kids. Ergo, it didn’t happen! We should have found some alternative but it was getting far too late for plan B. Alternatives should be listed on their website when you do your research.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39candyn
50,Great night visit!,There is something completely awesome about this place. The telescopes are fantastic. Also viditbthe room downstairs. It has tons of info on each planet. The only draw back is the number of people. So be prepared we to walk and to wait in a few lines. Overall it’s well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewoodsmall
50,A Visit to the Griffith Observatory,"A visit to the observatory is a well worth taking time for when just visiting LA or for residents of the area. One can drive up, although parking may be difficult on a weekend or take a nice hike up from Ferndel Park below...it may get hot along the trail. The Observatory is very picturesque in itself and offers many, many exhibits which are free to view and all very well done and interesting.There is an admission cost for the Planetarium presentation and it too it quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herb_Silverman
50,Breath taking view,It was closed the day we went but it was amazing. The view was awesome and of course seeing the Hollywood sign was fantastic. Great place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rozie0916
50,One of the gems of LA!,"If you plan to do just a few things in Los Angeles, this should be among them. It offers a stunning view of the city, a theater experience for all ages (my three year old lady bed it), and celebrates the cosmos that can’t often be seen from Los Angeles.I came with my elderly father and young child, and there was something for everyone!Be prepared for some challenges parking. You’ll often need to park on the road up and hike to the top.Once there, plan to spend a few hours if you want to check out the ferridan cage, the observatory show, the tour of our solar system, and the telescope.We didn’t stay for everything, but that’s only because we were on toddler time. Given that you’ll be there a while, I’d recommend bringing snacks &/or water.There are great hikes available from the observatory, if you want to explore Griffith Park. It’s also very close to the Hollywood Bowl, so consider doing both things in one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannaw115
50,An LA Must,"The Greek Observatory is a must see when visiting/living in LA. The history behind it, and the lessons you can learn from your visit are impressive. It’s a great place to learn, grab a coffee or snack, and check out the gorgeous views of LA and the Hollywood sign.There is also an excellent hiking trail right behind the observatory you should check out when it’s not too hot.Getting here can take some time, and now there is paid parking. But if you want to save money and energy getting up the hill, take the Dash bus at the corner of Vermont and Los Feliz. It drops you off directly at the observatory (via the Greek Theater should you want to catch a concert), and it’s only $1.00 round trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AniGarib
50,Vacation,Did it on a city tour. Great view of the city and of the Hollywood sign. There’s an outside concert area on the way up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenbuzelle
40,Looks even better than in all those 50's movies,#1 park at the bottom of the hill and ride the bus. You will spend thrice the admit of time trying to find a parking spot as you do waiting for the bus! And parking is 8$ an hour! That is not a typo!!!Now to the good stuff! Amazing view of the city and Hollywood sign. Cool educational stuff inside for young and old and all in between! We really enjoyed it! See one of the movies they are cool! The one about water is the best family/kid friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnakPak3
40,Free great view on the Los Angeles city,but take some time to park the car ($8 per hour). The view is free and great. Only the Observatorium visit cost money and must be reserved in advance. But not the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bweegenaar
40,An old gem in LA,"Beautiful location. My 22 year old daughter said it was smaller than she expected. Multiple shows throughout the day ($7/show). Lots to see about our universe. There are scales which show how much you would weigh on each planet. We spent about 3 hours there (including a 30-minute show). Parking is interesting. Parking starts on the side of the road about 1.5 miles away as you head up the mountain to the observatory. We decided not to press our luck when we got 0.3 miles away. when we walked up there were several parking spots available at the top, also $8/hour. When we left you go down the backside of the mountain, which appeared to be free parking! There were cars parked for about 0.5 miles down the mountain on the side of the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbys701
40,A beautiful LA landmark,This is a must see in LA. It’s location makes for a dream photo op and gives you a clear view of the Hollywood sign and the rest of the city. The building itself is gorgeous. Admission inside is free and the exhibits are great for astronomy enthusiasts and interesting for those of us that are not. My nine year old really liked it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760erins
40,Great views...planetarium must see.,Arrived late afternoon and was very lucky to get parked outside but paid the $8 per hour fee!!!Great views of Hollywood sign and LA...Planetarium must see great experience.Was very busy as summer but could still get around exhibits.Telescopes open at 730 pm so we did not get to see those but a great half day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_mike_stoker
20,"Great view, but way to crowded!","We visited Griffith Observatory in July. There was a chaos of cars and people already far down the road. We ended up With 3 of us leaving the car, still on the way up. Grear view, Nice Place. When we were ready to leave, we got to the car, just arriving.... Most of the visitors go there for the photos of the LA view. You find them other places less crowded too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrineLiseK
30,Great views once arrived!,A nightmare to get parked. 2 cars 1 was lucky to park at the top the other car was parked miles away and turned back despite being spaces.The views are good BUT due to the lack of visibility due to air pollution the photos were difficult to take of the Hollywood sign.Lots of free opportunities to use telescopes and the actual observatory that is free is interesting and the kids enjoyed it.The down side is the parking and chaos of getting there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sl2021
10,Avoid completely during summer,"Where to start! It took us almost 1.5 hours to get up the hill due to extremely bad traffic- no where to turn and go back, and no information prior to heading up the hill as to how bad the traffic actually was and how long it would take to get up. When we finally got up to the observatory and tried to turn left to park, we were made to carry on along the road- it was literally 3 miles until we were able to park! 3 miles from the observatory!! And they were expecting us to pay 8 dollars an hour for this parking position- ludicrous. We realised by the time we walked to the observatory (along a pitch black main road), it would be closed as it was already close to 9pm and the observatory was due to shut at 10pm. We tried to head back and were refused entry into the car park which clearly had spaces - they let 10 cars before us go in- when we asked why they were allowed to go in and not us he said they were disabled, (this was not the case), the worker we spoke to was extremely rude. So we had to head all the way back down in almost as bad traffic! 3 hours wasted of our limited time in LA- extremely disappointed with the service here as it was one of the top things we wanted to do. You cannot expect customers to queue for so long and then walk 3 miles to the attraction! If this is the case it should be stated before embarking on such a journey- no organisation what so ever. An absolute joke, would not risk visiting again. Not to mention we were desperate for the loo and were not able to stop to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauren--Firth
10,Gave up - no way to stop and park,I need to warn you. We thought we'd visit the observatory. First time for our family. We were caught in a long line of cars going up the hill with no parking and no option but to go back down the hill. There was staff everywhere trying to manage traffic but they were helpless. Avoid this attraction during high season.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatachaH112
50,Never actually was able to get here! Giving it a 5 for potential :),"Attempted to visit here on a Sunday afternoon. After stop and go slinking it up to the observatory, they closed the road three cars ahead of us! The ""smart people"" had already parked a bit down the road. When we were turned away drove at least two miles down the road before we found a parking spot. By then day was too hot and hike too long. Don't make our mistake--get there early in the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sazoram
50,Visit totally worth it!,"We came in July around 5PM and could catch a show ""Centered in the Universe' at Samuel Oschin Planetarium. The ticket was very reasonably priced at 8$/adult and 5$/ student. It was a great showing! Highly recommended.To visit the Griffith Observatory itself is free. You can get it and see many displays and information inside. Also outside on the premises there are free telescope viewing where you can watch the moon, venus and other things in space. You will have a stunning view of Los Angeles and the Holkywood sign. We stayed and enjoyed the sunset but unfortunately could not stay longer. The place is open until 10PM and if we haf more time we would have stayed longer and would not be bored.The parking was easy when we came but by the evening time just before sunset it got really busy.We also stopped at the Trail Cafe in the Griffith Park before we came to the Observatory. It was a very nice little cafe, great for coffee, tea cakes and snacks. Nice seating outside and reasonable prices. It closes at 5PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodie-pearl
50,Amazing Views!!!!,"Visited here with my family. Fabulous day out. We got a cab from the Walk of Fame to Griffin Park. We got dropped off at the Greek Theatre and walked up the pathway. It took us about 20 minutes. Make sure you take a bottle of water with you as it’s thirsty work and wear sunscreen too. When we arrived there, we made a beeline straight to the cafe as we forgot to get a bottle of water beforehand. The views are amazing and you get a chance to take pictures with The Hollywood sign in the backdrop. The Observatory is amazing too, lots of interesting facts and views from the top of the Observatory too. We didn’t get a chance to see any of the shows advertised in the Observatory, but I would definitely want to do it the next opportunity we get when we are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieJ0
50,Fantastic stargazing,What a great educational venue and it’s free! Well done for providing such a fantastic service for all to come and use. We came in the late evening when it was really busy but there were plenty of telescopes out and so we got to see the moon and then queued to see mars through the Zeiss telescope. This did take an hour but was worth it. Very knowledgeable staff and so friendly. The DASH bus service was also great and only 50 cents.I would highly recommend going to the observatory at sunset so you can see the Hollywood sign before it gets dark and then hang around to do some star gazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/810martine
20,Gave up due to traffic to get in,"Title sums it up, all you will do is sit in traffic and we gave up after 30-45 minutes...When speaking to a traffic guide, he said it’s always like this... so something we never got to experience as the traffic management kinda sucked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legodude1983
50,Look through the telescopes at night,We went at sunset and stayed until after dark. The best part was seeing planets through the telescope. Go early because the drive up at sunset gets really congested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieo713
50,Great view of the city,If you are going to Griffith Observatory during the weekend the best approach is the leave the car in the parking lot of the Greek Theatre and take the Dash bus (50 cents) to the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adyescu
50,Outstanding Venue!,"Really a cool place to visit and walk around. It's a beautiful, educational facility that also has a nice gift shop and some great photo ops of LA. We were able to see a presentation in the planetarium which was outstanding; the kids seemed to really enjoy it as did the adults. There are also lots of hiking trails in the vicinity as well. We went on a Saturday which was extremely busy, especially at opening time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homewardbound12
50,Great Views,"Great views of the Hollywood sign and the city of LA. The museum inside the building is great, especially the lower level with displays of each planet and scales to see how much you would weigh on each one. Fun interactive exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidqtravel
40,Great views,Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Climb to the top of the observatory for even better views.Interesting history about the building and it's dedication.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samadison1974
40,Difficult to access this amazing attraction,I came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday afternoon in August 2018. I made an attempt to visit last year but turned around when I witnessed the traffic/parking chaos that exists here.This time we spent an hour circling around trying to find parking but ended up parking by Los Feliz Blvd and taking the bus up to the observatory. I definitely recommend doing that.The observatory is absolutely magnificent and the view from there is amazing! We were there during sunset which was even more spectacular. They have very interesting exhibitions inside the observatory. The gift shop has good selection of items.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Relianess
40,"Great views, shame the obseratory wasn't open","As part of a city tour we stopped to see the Hollywood sign and LA. The view is amazing. The Observatory was closed, don't know why so unable to comment further.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pringlePlymouth
50,Road trip,Visited while in LA. The wait to get a parking spot took forever it seemed. We finally made it up and found a space along the side of the road ( don’t park obstructing any part of the road though saw cars getting tickets by the rangers for this). We had to walk up to the observatory from where we parked. The wait and walk where so worth it. We were able to see Jupiter and Saturn through complimentary telescopes they had set up that night!! We arrived just as the sun was setting. Amazing views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MC0526
50,Breathtaking,"My family and I were planning to watch the sunset from up there but there was a lot of traffic so we couldn't make it in time. If that's what you want to do make sure you go earlier than 6pm.But to be honest it didn't even matter because when we got up there and got to see all the city lights, it was absolutely worthwhile. The view is spectacular !Also, if you like astrology that's the place for you too. I'm not personally the biggest fan but their exhibitions were so cool even I have a lot of fun. And of course don't forget to stop at a telescope to see the stars and planets from up close. It's so worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_salmaeliela
50,Spectacular views and an outstanding educational exhibits,"We made it just before closing time at 10PM. Thank goodness we managed to get inside. It is more of a museum than an observatory. The value, in terms of education, for children is exceptional.Then there is the view. It is absolutely amazing up there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JET8882
50,Amazing,"So much interesting facts that you normally wouldn't look into if not for a place like this. They have so much information and you can also hike, there are so manny trails that lead here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonniee473
50,Free attraction,"The best way to get to this place is to use the Dash bus system that drops you right outside the Observatory and for 50cents or less with a Tap metro card, is cheap.The Observatory itself is free although there is a charge to enter the Planetarium. It is shut on a Monday and opens at midday during the week, 10am at the weekends.Great views from the top of LA and of course the Hollywood sign. It must be great at night too.All this was started by a Mr Griffiths, a Welshman, who left money in his will to build the Observatory and the Greek Theatre.It is worth the effort getting there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieM452
50,Great Views,Great views! A nice place to see the Hollywood Sign from and views of Los Angeles. The inside of the Observatory was nice. There’s a nice periodic table inside that was a good interactive for my 10 year old and myself. Worth an educational visit. Didn’t have time to do the actual planetarium demobstrations so I can’t rate that. My rating is based on the views mostly. Parking was about $8.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyd337
40,"Beautiful views, great science!","A FANTASTIC location for an observatory. It had some great science, although I needed my husband to help explain some of the finer details to me. The information on the observatory was concise and well explained for the most part.Admission was FREE to the observatory and we paid $7 per person to see one of the shows at the planetarium. It was great, well narrated and educational. We wished it were a little more in depth in that regard, but that was just one of the four shows they had playing.The views from the observatory were phenomenal. You could see the sprawl of Los Angeles.If you go, go early. We went in the mid-afternoon on a Tuesday and it was difficult to get up the mountain to find parking. We managed to find parking on the street, and it cost $8/hour, not what was advertised online for $4.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecV9554YM
40,Beautiful views but be prepared for PEOPLE,"I was so looking forward to seeing the observatory and the displays. After walking a mile up the road from where we had to park because all lots were full, we were overloaded by the throngs. We got there 1/2 hour before opening and the people just kept coming. We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with crowds trying to move through the exhibits. We made it 1/2 hours before bailing and giving up on the observatory. The view are great though and worth the visit if you time it right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmE1362ED
20,Not good,From the griff I could not see the Hollywood sign because my eye sight is quite bad if you hike you go behind it so what’s the point in wasting energy . I would still recommend for people who are tourists .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m00dymargret
50,Must visit,If you are going to LA you have to see the Griffith Observatory it have an amazing view over the city and one of the best views of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brynjarsnaer
50,Wonderful attraction,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Griffith Observatory. When entering the observatory building, we found crowds of people surrounding the immediate displays on the first floor. Our suggestion is to go downstairs to the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater, located on the lower level. It was in this theater we saw an introductory film to the observatory. The film outlined the observatory's interesting history and gave visitors an introduction to its displays. With that information, we could then choose where we wanted to spend our limited time. We found all of the displays to be interesting but we particularly liked the space exhibits on the lower level. While at the observatory, there is also the opportunity to take in the many views it offers from its grounds, including the famous Hollywood sign. Impressively, there is free admission to Griffith Observatory building, exhibits and grounds. (note they do charge admission to the planetarium show, if you chose to attend). This is a wonderful attraction to visit while in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller547
50,Fabulous views of LA,"Went on a sunny Sunday afternoon, along with many, many others! Observatory exhibitions good, views fabulous. Far too hot to walk anywhere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippadina2

50,"""Great Views of LA""","We got lucky and found a parking place near the building. Many people were parking and walking up the hill. The observatory is neat to see and has some interesting exhibits. The views of the area are amazing. From the city to the Hollywood sign, there are great picture spots!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86MissyJ
50,Best place to look at LA rom above!,"Probably my favourite place in LA! The view over LA is spectacular from the top and one can clearly see both Downtown and the Hollywood sign. I highly recommend visiting before sunset so you can also enjoy a night view, but also because the sun lets off a bit then. Park somewhere down in Los Feliz and hike one of the trails to the top.Also worth spending some time at the observatory which has some nice exhibits. I found the planetarium shows quite entertaining and at the same time insightful. The gentleman who performed the show I attended was really engaging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hristoz2014
40,Getting there was the main problem,"Before venturing up, make sure that nothing is going on at the Greek Theater! We sat in traffic for over 45 minutes starting at the bottom of the hill. We took an Uber, but took the Dash bus back down (.$0.50) for a couple stops before we called one to take us back as there is very poor or no cell signal at the top.Views were great, but getting there really took away a lot of the fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937paulettef
40,NIce views,Beat the crowds and go early morning. There is free parking in the Greek Theatre car park on the days there is nothing go on in the theatre. The short hike up to the observatory from the car park is relatively easy. Griffith Observatory offers great views of the Hollywood sign and downtown Los Angeles. A great place for a stroll and pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myatraveller
50,Awesome views,We went here early evening 6pm to see some good views. You can park at the very bottom for free and either get a shuttle bus or walk up if you are feeling energetic!!! We drove to the top and paid $8 for parking. There are some fantastic views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. The observatory is free to enter too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1972nessie
50,A must do in LA!,Best time to come here is sunset! Try and come early though as there is lots of traffic at that time. For me this was an unforgettable experience and make sure you get a chance to use the telescope!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanny101
50,"Great Views, but Hard to Park","Offers a number of quite decent scientific exhibits, as well as spectacular views all over LA.Parking can be very difficult. Come early, or take your chances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MannyG2000
30,Go early,Go early to avoid the long lines. It’s literally an uphill battle getting there. Once inside it’s great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950nakiaa
50,Great Views- super experience,"The Griffith Observatory is free entry- hence it is very busy, but very worthwhile! We spent about an hour walking around in the morning. Unfortunately we didn't make it there at night time- and it being friday and something on in the greek theater it took ages to get there and we couldn't get parked. But make sure you do get there in the evening before 22:00 Hrs as they let you use the Telescope for free too to take a peak into the sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926stefaniem
40,Great views,"Managed to park up on our second trip to the observatory. We arrived about 30 minutes before it opened and again the parking lot was full. There is overspill parking going round the hills and we got lucky as someone was pulling out otherwise you could end up a fair way down the hills. $8 per hour to park. Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign. Free WiFi too. The observatory is very space orientated for me and my kids so didn’t spend much time in there to be honest, it was very busy too. There’s restrooms and somewhere to eat if you take a snack. The water was extortionate so take plenty as it gets very hot so you’ll need to keep drinking. You can see where there has been fires. All in all a worthy visit for great photos of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kezza004
50,Great vantage point!,"Finally visited this spot recently, and we were not disappointed! Yes, it is crowded but the views are amazing and so is the observatory and museum. Personally, I would recommend using a ride-share service to get there, rather than dealing with finding a parking spot which can be tricky at most times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sr6266
50,One of my favorite things to do in LA,"Very interesting plus a great view of LA! I had been there many years ago, but enjoyed it just as much this time. Only issue was the crowd. It took a while to find a decent parking place where we didn’t have to walk forever to get there, so I suggest going early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobRon123
50,Beautiful views of LA,"The sights from the Observatory are gorgeous no matter what time of day you visit, and with the free wifi that the observatory offers I was able to upload some gorgeous photos straight to my instagram so my friends and family back home in Australia could see the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadartemis
50,Amazing Views!,"A must visit attraction, I would recommend going in the evening around (5pm) as then it gives you the opportunity to see LA’s amazing views like the Hollywood sign during the day during a sunset and at night (hoping its a clear night). There is a lot to do and see at the observatory, lots of information to to read so it can take a couple of hours, its all very interesting. They also have various demonstrations and shows every half or so which are quite interesting.We Uber’d it in as then we didn’t have to worry about any parking hassle. It is also free entry to look around the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohankapila
50,Sunset views are amazing but it’s crowded,"The observatory building was closed when we visited but that was fine- we really came for the view. all the free parking is pretty far away so it comes with a warning. Be prepared to shuttle up or walk if you want free. For sunsets, this place packs out. Parking close to the observatory is a real challenge so give your plenty of time to park and walk before sunset. It’s paid parking within a mile of the observatory and all uphill walking. Stake out your place along the fence and wait for the sunset - it was magical. Crowds thin out but wait for the skies to darken and lights to come on in LA. To catch this view, you need to walk around the backside of the observatory- it is crowded crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinkykitty
50,Great views,"A great place for an outstanding vista of the Los Angeles area. Parking can get difficult around sunset. Cool stuff to see inside of the observatory as well, including a Tesla coil. Nice hikes and paths in the area as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronb64
50,Great Views,"It’s a long way up there, we got a Uber and they lay on buses, probably wouldn’t walk and it is immensely hot. However the views a superb across LA and of the Hollywood sign. As for the observatory it is a great visit, a museum inside with lots to read about and learn (stars etc). It is free unless you want the planetarium experience. We hadn’t planned to visit here, but it was recommended and I would say it is worth it. It is very hot and very popular, probably go early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davel779
50,Hike there,Worth hiking up to get there. Great views.m; interesting observatory. Probably one of the five best I’ve been to. Also if you hike you don’t have parking to contend with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raoulg559
50,Everything you've been told & more,Outstanding views of LA. Beautiful for visiting at sunset and night time. Very interesting exhibits. Great for familes. Great for date night. Be prepared to walk a good bit from your parking space down the mountain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiegust
40,Beautiful sunset views,"Great sunset views, and views of the Los Angelos city skyline. It was EXTREMELY crowded, good luck finding a parking spot. We waited in line for 45 minutes to look through their telescope to see Jupiter and 3 of its visible moons (that was cool to see though). Overall great place to explore, but maybe go during the day and do one of the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paiten505
50,awesome,We went just before the sun was about to set so great views in daylight and at night. Both something you need to see with your own eyes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2042ZPalexanderg
40,"Nice view, but too crowded!","We drove up there on a Sunday night. The traffic is sooooo bad, so many people up there, although the night view is cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969weis
30,Okay for a day trip,"Watched the show on Aurora borealis, which was nice enough. Good views of the city, but not much else if you’ve been other planetariums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Syzygy2011
50,Such an amazing view!,You should see it. The best time to visit is in the evening because you can see the sunset and LA at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anni2806
50,Gorgeous views of LA,We visited Griffith Observatory in mid afternoon. It was very busy and limited parking. We had to pay to park. Pay by hour then put receipt in window. The view is spectacular ofLA but you also can see the Hollywood sign from there. Definitely visit when in the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cw0108
40,Great views over LA,Would recommend you do this if visiting LA. We caught an Uber up to the Observatory and it dropped us at the front entrance and collected us there as well. Spent a few hours wandering around the Observatory and enjoyed it more than I thought. Really enjoyed the seismic activity section.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneh203
50,L.A. Landmark,"The Griffith Observatory has been an L.A. landmark for years. While no longer a buyable location to view the stars due to the city lights, it still offers great view of the land/city below it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darth_Amador
40,Nice views but Hollywood sign too overrated,"We took the bus to reach here and it was a fun experience as it was a city bus which took us to here after around 30 stops. I still would recommend it as it helps you see Los Angeles very closely. It is tricky to identify the boarding point of the bus but there is one right at the top end of location which is the most convenient to get down at and then board back from. Nothing before the last stop is recommended.Coming to the monument now, it is a scientific masterpiece but most people who come here are most interested in the Hollywood hill view which is to me a non event. Instead the 360 degree view of the city appealed to me more and the open park was nice too. There is the planetarium and other shows inside that we did not much have time to see. It was cool to take the exterior stairs to go up and see the giant telescope and other instruments.It is worth a visit if in LA if observatories is your kind of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKaRoy
20,Parking lot attendant selective of who can park in top lot closest to observatory,"What a jerk! (Sorry, I don’t enjoy saying this but the parking lot attendant was a jerk!) The observatory is a popular tourist destination and yes, there’s other parking lot locations, but I’ll try to look for closer stalls because why not? Anyhow, it was busy, there was traffic and when we finally arrived at the top parking lot. Signs says ‘Parking Lot Full’, but as we pass the lot there’s at the least 10 open stall with a few cars leaving as we approached the entrance to the parking lot. The car in front of me open his window shook the attendant’s hand, spoke for a couple minutes (while a line of cars are waiting to either get in or pass through - yes it was just one lane, one way, so we had to wait for their conversation to finish - rolling eyes) then let him in. As I approached, he waved me through. I rolled my window down and said there’s a lot more parking stalls and he said not for you. Wow!!! I said it’s not permit only parking and I should be able to park too like the other car, but he said ‘move on lady’ and ignored me. What a jerk!Anyways, I eventually found parking but didn’t really enjoy my time there because of that attendant. The views are stunning. The observatory is educational. The workers on the other hand just looked like they weren’t enjoying their work time. I recommend going early or late in the afternoon. Expect to walk up to observatory if you parking along the hill. There’s busses that pick you up at the lower parking lots but there’s a lot of people who visit so come prepared with water, snacks and a fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judzv2016
50,Stunning Views at Sunset,Loved the views at sunset & after. Observatory was very educational & beautiful as well. Traffic & crowds were tough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawn_Olla_Louisiana
50,So worth the tricky walk in the heat!,"We walked up instead of driving and it was difficult in the heat but the view of LA are fantastic! Of course you see the Hollywood sign but the observatory itself is the star! Lots of interesting tings to see and learn about, although very crowded. The planetarium experience for $7 per adult was the best value for money I think we’ve had in LA! Fascinating and educational! Makes you feel their passion for education and not a tourist trap for money! Thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmapU6872WY
50,"A place to chill, learn and enjoy the view of Los Angeles! A must when in LA.","This place not only serves as a museum but also as an overlook to Los Angeles. People from all ages would love this place. The free museum is good for the family as young kids learn about the SUN, Time and the telescopes. A place where you can just chill and waste time and wait until the sun sets and enjoy the city lights of LA. If you are a tourist and a first timer in LA, this should be part of your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cliffy930
50,Fabulous,"Stunning Art Deco building on a breathtaking site. However, it’s very crowded. I did my homework and planned to park midday in the Greek Theatre parking lot which is free and 1 mile walk to the observatory. Too bad for me all the lots were closed for a concert later that day! That meant creeping at a slower than walking pace in the car until we found a parking spot. And prepaying at $8/hr is pricey.That said, it was totally worth it. The planetarium show “Centred in the Universe” was probably the best planetarium show I’ve seen. Also not expensive, $7/adult.Go, and be ready for some delays and crowds. It’s well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522markd
30,So so,If you are in LA you might as well go but be prepared to walk a long way. We walked 2.2 miles from where we parked to get to the top for a silly picture.There are some neat things in the observatory BUT it is so overcrowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kansascitynative
50,Mesmerizing Planets and Beautiful Views of LA!!!,"The Griffith Observatory is one of the must see places in LA even though it is always crowded. Parking can be found at the foothills of Griffith Park and you can walk up the hill or you could drive up to the observatory which clears up often.The views of LA are astounding as the city lights up in the far distance. At the entrance of the Observatory, the 240 lb. bronze pendulum modeled as a 1850s replica of Foucault Pendulum is unique. In the same floor there are many displays of telescopes, planetary models and others related to astronomy. It will take almost an hour to see all the displays. They have several shows ( approximately 30 minutes) running which need to be booked next to the entrance. Most of the shows are for kids above 5 years except for one. We saw the Northern Lights Vikings show and it was spectacular in terms of information, audio, visuals and narrative. The best part of this observatory is its planet viewing. There is usually a 20-30 minute queue and it closes at 9:30pm. We didn't get to see through the huge telescope at the top of the observatory because it was not working for some reason. However they provided 2 digital but very powerful telescopes which allowed the viewing of the planets. We were amazed to see Saturn with its beautiful rings while others saw Jupiter from the other telescope. You might want to plan to spend the entire evening out there but definitely check in advance if the sky is clear for that evening. Well worth the visit and very educational. We sure will go back again to watch the other planets!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulrupesh
50,More stars than the Walk of Fame,"The Griffith Observatory is a true gem- an excellent planetarium with interesting shows, solid astronomical science presented in such a way to make it accessible to almost anyone, and fantastic views of the Hollywood sign and the city of Los Angeles as well. There are miles of hiking trails for those so inclined, and admission is free though there is a charge for the planetarium shows ($7 each when I was there). The only warning is that parking is very expensive at $8 per hour (it adds up quickly), and nowhere near adequate for the crowds on summer weekends. I had to spend 30 minutes sucking up exhaust snaking through a long line of cars all vying for the same non-existent spots since it's a one way road and you can't turn around but have to go over and back down. I did find a free parking lot about 2/3 of the way back down and was then able to hike one mile up a moderately steep trail to get to the observatory. It is certainly doable, but bring water and wear a hat because there's almost no shade the whole way up. You may well want to hire a cab or take a tour bus to the top since they can drop you off whereas private vehicles are not allowed to do so. Overall one of the high points- literally and figuratively of any trip to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unavid
40,Stunning views of LA and Hollywood sign,"This attraction is free to get in. However you have to pay at least $8 parking per hour, if you don’t arrive early you park a good half a kilometre away and it’s up hill in the heat. Once in, you can wall around but to see exhibitions and the important stuff you need to pay a reasonable fee to go into other areas.The building itself is beautifully kept, has one of the most stunning advantage points to take in the city of LA and had been used in countless movies. It gets very busy and that is little wonder. Tourists and arty type people flock and no wonder. Can be done in an hour or longer if looking at everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnselmColom
40,Fascinating place,"For a great education about stars, planets and galaxies as well as history of astronomy, this is wonderful. Also has a spectacular view of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naneliz
40,Worth the view,"Well worth a visit. See if you can spot where James Dean was in Rebel Without a Cause, view the Hollywood sign and look out at Los Angeles below you..dusk is particulary good. Free parking before 10AM. If you have time then give Lloyd Wrights Ennis house a look while you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414jonathanh
50,Worth the stop,One of the few places that was free to get into! Also I am a space nerd. I have been to several space/science centers and this one was one of my favorites. Wish I had more time. It was very crowded though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashnneal
50,The view!!!,Crowded but worth it. Parking on side of road leading to park was the same as parking at the top......soooo....park at the top. Not worth dealing with squeezing car into spot on the side of a cliff. Wonderful views and very educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimE2273
50,"Worth the trip, but hard to get to!","The observatory offers great exhibits for kids and grown ups and spectacular views of LA. It's worth the trip. That said, it's tough to get to.

40,Great Views,"Definitely something to do whilst in LA. Great views across LA, but also interesting to visit even if you know a lot about stars, how the earth revolves around the sun, and the moon phases. Admission is free, and would recommend parking lower and walking up and down the trails.We paid for a ticket to watch one of the projections and was well worth it as it was nicely narrated and took you on a journey of how science has progressed our understanding of stars, and planet spotting. You can even use the telescopes on offer to see planets for yourself, some that are visible in day light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GavinWongUK

50,Wow,"We visited at around 2pm and had to park a fair way down the road. Although it was hot and up hill, the walk was not too bad and provided a fantastic view of the observatory.The observatory itself was very impressive and informative.

50,A Must See,"I cannot imagine going to Los Angeles and not seeing the Griffith Observatory. It is worth it for the view alone. Be sure to catch one of the shows in the Planetarium, visit the exhibits and grab a cup of coffee while you sit and look out at the beautiful views. If you go at night, you can look at the stars through the telescope. You will also get an awesome view of the Hollywood sign and you can hike in the area if you so desire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaannfletcher4

50,A Los Angeles Icon,"My favorite exhibit in the Observatory is on the lower floor, where there are scales to determine what your weight would be on each of the planets. Also, at least on some Friday evenings, there are telescopes set up on the front lawn, where typically you can view the moon, Saturn, and perhaps other heavenly bodies. Also, you can hike up to the observatory in the mornings before the Observatory is busy or even open, and on clear days get a great view over the Los Angeles basin. You can start near the Trails Cafe on the Westerly side of the Observatory, hike the .7 or so mile Observatory Trail each way, and end the hike at the Trails Cafe with a tasty cheddar cheese and chive biscuit or whatever, and a good coffee or whatever drink. Although there is parking at the Observatory itself and nearby (paid parking) it can get crowded and sometimes the cars line the road near the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeaZ8749IZ

We decided to stay until evening because there was a ""Public Telescopes and Star Party"" which occurs one Saturday per month were the LA Astronomical Society, LA Sidewalk Astronomers and some Planetary volunteers share their experiences and telescopes!!! We watched the sun, the moon, venus and Jupiter with 4 of its moons. I will never forget observing with family and friends and listening to the scientists in a easy language. Take 5 to relax at the stunning night views of the city... Looks like minutes before landing in LAX!PS Parking is complicated, but there are buses going up and down to the Observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeepTraveLLLing
30,It’s was OK,It was cool to see the famous “Hollywood “ sign and is closer. We had good views of LA there. The museum was pretty boring unless you are a fan of solar systems and things that happen in the sky. A lot of the telescopes didn’t work and I lost money in them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliverc522018
50,A Must If In LA,Its a place you never get tired of going to and feels like its always your visit . Always a great experience. great place to take your kids too as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mithilarajapakse
50,Great !!!!!!,"Take the kids, the grand kids. You and your family will have a great time. The planitarium all by it's self is worth the trip and there is so much more !!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishandjim
50,Griffith Observatory,I hiked all the way up. Has a great view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. I also watched one of the shows and walked around the observatory. The Griffith Observatory was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronyo106
50,"Hiked up to the Top, Strolled Around",Had the chance to visit after a short convention center trip earlier this year. Loved it there. Scenery is amazing. Flat lawn to picnic or just enjoy the sunset. Gem of LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinparks661
50,Views!,Very cool historical spot.View for miles of Los Angeles. Try and get there when they open. It gets busy very quick and there is not many places to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andypJ3947AQ
30,Nice grounds & views but closed building,Arrived on a Tuesday morning. Fought traffic even at 9 am. Patted ourselves on the back for getting a parking spot as I had read they are notoriously difficult to find. Happy feeling dashed as we were surprised to find the building didn't open until 12 Noon- in middle of high season?! I get that this is on me and I should have read that somewhere in my research- just hard for me to believe the late opening during the busiest season.Pretty building and grounds. Side view of Hollywood sign not the greatest. Long distance view marred by poor air quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsymamma
40,Closed when we visited but still had an enjoyable time,We visited as a family of 3 on Memorial Day - hence the observatory itself was closed.However the area was still very busy - and all of the “road” car spaces were full.We parked by the theatre and caught the shuttle bus back up. This was great and very cheap - well worth the fee for avoiding a steep climb in the heat (we did walk back down later!)Stating the obvious here I’m sure - but the view of LA from the top was great. It was a clear day (very little smog) and the Hollywood sign could also clearly be seen. Something all 3 of us wanted to see.We walked around the outside of the building which is architecturally quite a sight.Wished observatory had been open - but totally accept that staff are entitled to “holidays” too.If we visit LA from the UK again - we will return when it is open.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownspeeddog
50,Beautiful observatory,What a beautiful place on top of the hill. We watched the sunset while waiting for the planetarium show. Staying for the night view is a must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethz502
40,Lovely experience,"I visited the Griffith Observatory during the evening, and I had a wonderful time exploring the beautiful grounds. The views of the surrounding area and stars are breathtaking. One of the best parts of the Griffith Observatory is that they have public telescopes. On the night I visited, there were four telescopes one could use. There were relatively lengthly lines to use each telescope, yet the wait was worth it to me. In addition, there was at least one guide at each of the telescopes to help you with the telescope and to answer any questions you might have. The exhibits in the building itself were okay, yet they weren't particularly engaging or interesting to me.The worst part about my visit was getting there and finding parking. I visited when there was an event at the Greek Theatre. It was total gridlock, and there was little parking available. Everyone was basically waiting for people to leave the Griffith so that they could get their parking spot. The parking rate varies based on the day/time, yet there is a cost for the parking even for spots that aren't in lots. Consider visiting when there isn't an event at the Greek Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathleen100100
50,Above the bustle of LA,If you are looking for a place to hike above the bustle of LA llook no further. Around the observatory there are a number of trails that will give you a reprieve from our great metropolis. The observatory is also worth a visit. I also liked some of their star shows (the real stars :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alcinos2014
40,Night Views of City,Didn't actually enter tbe observatory do cannot comment on its interior. It's a great site to look out over Los Angeles at night for great views of the city lights. Park closes gates at certain times so check closing time to avoid being denied access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1152MIbillm
50,Great place to visit,Four of us visited the observatory around 4pm on a Thursday. We took an uber to the top. The views are amazing. We went to the planetarium which was amazing. The exhibits are interesting and the building beautiful it is a must see if you are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803mattp
40,Educational Astrology visit,"Decided to walk the Ferndell Trail to get here, but regretted it given the temperature. Extremely warm and sweaty on arriving at the top.Lovely building and enjoyed the static displays, but probably preferred it if it wasn’t so busy, so recommend an early visit and not the weekend in future.Saw the “centre of the universe” planetarium 30 min show and very good experience. Could sit through that at least a few more times. The presenter had a great range in her voice and how she delivered it was outstanding. Would have rated it a 5/5 if I’d seen all of the displays in a quieter environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnI1640QT
40,Beautiful landmark!,This is a beautiful facility located in lovely Griffith Park. It is open from 10A-10P. We went at night. We wish we could have returned during the day for better views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yfarm
50,"Amazing, fascinating & informative observatory & planetarium","From its Los Feliz, LA location, there are incredibly good panoramic views of downtown LA and in the distance, the Hollywood sign. The exhibits and interactive displays are great and very informative. They are very helpful in learning about astronomy, our planet, the Solar System, the universe, the history of spaceflight, and technology. There are lots of photo ops both outside and within the Observatory. It is best to come on a clear day, to get good views of the city, or at late evening to get views the sunset, followed by spectacular views of the city lit up. This summit location has also been used in the making of some Hollywood films. This place can be crowdy. It took us 20 minutes to find a parking spot.Admission is free to this amazing observatory, but one has to pay to see the planetarium shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
50,Amazing!,Don’t miss stopping here! The planetarium is top notch and sunset from the viewing areas is breathtaking!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kls98
30,Amazing evening experience.,"Parking was brutal. We had to park all the way down the road and then walk up the hill to get to the observatory. We didn't get a chance to look through the large telescope because they cut off the line when we were about three people from the front. However they had some smaller telescopes set up around the grounds that we were able to try out. Overall it was a nice evening though, and it gives you a beautiful view of the city. I would try going again for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyndall2015
40,Great stay and a great show,"Fun to watch a show that was a story from our region (Scandinavia). I actually learned why it's called West, East, South and North 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaLykke
50,Just OK,"Seeing the Hollywood Sign was great, but the actual observatory was closed. The bathrooms need a little TLC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annapN7702ZW
40,"Crowded on the Weekend, Get There Early","We went on Saturday, Got there very early so we could hike ""up"" to the Hollywood Sign. It was 7AM and already difficult to find a parking space. After the hike, we visited the observatory. So many cool displays. There are presentations on the exhibits scheduled and they were a lot of fun. Great for kids. The area with the solar system exhibit was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiKershaw77
50,Best views of the city!,"3 tips for this affection. Bring water, walking shoes and sunscreen. We had a wonderful time with friends and kids in tow. Our teenager kept occupied by taking the family photos. We weren’t able to park for free as it was full ( go early as we weee there by 10am). We parked for $8.00 and walked for about 10min to the top.The views were amazing. They have a telescope also for viewing. It’s a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClayFamilyTime
40,Science rocks!,"Well-done hands-on science museum covering Middle and High-School level content. Many teenagers will have ‘I know this’ experiences throughout the museum. Don’t skip the Tesla Coil demonstration.The telescope is up and working at night; during the day you’ll be able to get a glimpse.There’s a lot to see in- and outside and on busy days it’ll take a short hike up from your parking spot.The museum is free (!), parking is paid (cc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NataschaF22
40,It reminds view of the first scene in Terminator,A place where you can see the whole city which seems limitless and of course you have the Hollywood sign in the background.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrinesosinski
50,Best View,We were able to park for free by the Greek Theater. Great hike up and the best view of the Holleywood sign and all of LA. Bring water and wear actual walking shoes. I dont know how people were doing this in sandals or heels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mega19
50,Best view of city and Hollywood sign,"Awesome views of entire city and hiking trails around the Hollywood hills, worth the drive up but you do have to pay to park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562cayleyl
50,Fab Afternoon at the Observatory!,"Beautiful building with great views over LA, such an interesting place , you must visit the planetarium when you go, magical!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyb662017
50,WOW! LaLa Land!,"After seeing this in the movies, I had to see it and it did not disappoint. Make sure and take time to see the Foccault's Pendulum-truly amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindy031
50,Best view of LA.,"We had to visit on a monday which unfortunately is the one day the observatory is closed, however its worth going for the views alone. This was the best view also of the Hollywood sign!! If there's only one thing you can do in LA then do this. Outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/319helenw
50,Fantastic,Definitely worth a visit if you are in LA. Go just before sunset. The view is amazing. Watching the sun set over the Hollywood Hills is quite something. Once it’s dark the view of the city and it’s lights is breathtaking. The observatory itself is really interesting. It’s worth queuing up to look through the telescope to see satin and all its rings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhansmithis
40,Cool experience!,"We visited the observatory on a Wednesday night in July and it was packed! Despite that, it was a really cool experience. The views are incredible, and the building itself offers lots of cool information about the history of the earth, astronomy, and space travel. The architecture and history of the building was a highlight for me as well. The only downside was it was difficult to get cell reception at the top of the hill to get an Uber.(even using the free wifi) We were going to catch the bus down the hill, but at the last minute my phone worked and we got our ride. If you are travelling from out of town, just be aware of this and you will have a great experience like us. Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevieJ604
50,ICONIC & FABULOUS,"Even as a local its a WOW to get the E.T experience of Los Angeles and surrounding Park. Its so cool to be able to peer at the stars and mix with astronomy nerds. Parking is a bit of a b*#@h and you want to watch your timing because sometimes it feels as if the world has decided to descend on the Observatory on the same day as you. Nothing personal of course lol, but you might want to think about parking on Vermont and including a hike in the schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPFRhedda
50,Great view,"Nice trip to see the closed facility. Took an UBER to get there. Great view of Hollyweird. Scene of a lot of movies and shows, lated being the final scene of Goliath season 2",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703kenv
50,Great LA Attraction,We love coming here with our kids. There is always something new to learn and the views of the city are spectacular. They also have monthly star parties that are great for both kids and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StellarBen
50,Interesting location and great views,Griffith Observatory offers interesting facts about stars and planets but also cool views on LA. It is a must see on a trip to the City of Angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matono
50,My favorite place in Los Angeles,"This place has everything you look for in a place of interest. It has the educational value, a great place to see the Los Angeles city lights and best of all, a perfect view of ""hollywood"" sign. If you a trek lover this place also offer you an opportunity to trek. we have been to this place multiple times and every-time i go there i love it as i loved it first time. the Planetarium has great show and i love the way they narrate it live. this place give me a feeling of how small entity are we in this universe and the history of life on this planet. great exibits with great learning experience.If you are going on a weekend of on a holiday please be early to get a parking in parking lot. the parking is limited on the top. sometime you have to park onway on roadside. other way to reach there is park near Greek theater and catch a shuttle (great option), or trek to the observatory from parking lot next to Greek theater. Evenings are busy too so if you want watch the hollywood sign keep enough margin before sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaganV2014
50,Best View of LA!,Our grandson wanted to see the LA skyline at night. We took him here and it was a fabulous view! Highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9melindah
50,fav spot in LA,"fav spot in LA, amazing views. was so excited to take my kids after going with my own family when i was younger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherI96
50,Breathtaking View,Beautiful view from the observatory... VERY crowded.. go early to be sure and get a spot to park..nice way to spend the afternoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417juliec417
40,Good picinic day,well decent place to get photos and take snap of hollywood sign and enjoy the observatory. Its good day to pass time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKS81
50,Must Do,"This was a truly fun experience, educational and fascinating. So much fun. Beautiful views of LA. Lots to do. Free entry ($8 an hour to Park). If we lived here we would have annual passes!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815jeannar
50,Stars at your hands,"Most beautiful place in town! Great park, amazing interactive activities at the Observatory. Please don't forget to play downstairs with Albert Einstein and Leonard Nimoy. You can see planets and stars at telescope and learn with movie presentations at both theaters. Gorgeous Night Views. Watch, touch, experience by your-self!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirschsandra
50,Better view from ontop,"Besides all the pollution in the air , the views are amazing , so great for pictures , any photographer should definitely come here at least once in their life. You get so close to the hollywood letters!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinCruzNow
50,"Plan plenty of time, there is lots to do","We mainly went for the views but I wish we had planned more time as we could have seen so much more. We got the bus there but Uber home - the buses at the end of the day were completely packed, but I think they send more until everyone gets home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stuff66
50,Loved it here,Great place and views - doesn’t really need anymore words as the place and views speak for themselves. A must for anyone no matter how many times you have beenWe also struggled with jet lag so when we woke early we went here at 5.45am which was a great time as you could drive to the top and park as close as you can get to the observatory and the views and number of people there at that time is perfect! Fog on the hills so couldn’t see Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrionyParrott
50,Great Public Park with Helpful Staff,"Very informative with lots to view. The views are stunning at any time of day but if you go late in the day, it is probably more likely that you will find people leaving from the parking lot at the site so that you might get a place. Also, you could look at the sunset and wait for the lights to come up at night and get both day and night views. Impressive park made available to the city by private, forward looking benefactor. In addition to the good experience at the Observatory, a park officer, Gary Pis, helped us remove a loose auto part from our undercarriage (including the effort to go to the shop and get a special tool). As two retired women, we appreciated his gallantry to Damsels in Distress",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236kathrynb
40,"Great attraction, but overly crowded","I was frustrated by the parking. We tried to get close, but kept being redirected by attendants so we had to park a ways down the hill. As we walked up toward the observatory, the attendants began allowing people to drive closer to the building.The place was crowded and it was hard to enjoy the observatory because of this. The exhibits were nice and definitely worth the time to visit. Great shots of the Hollywood sign from the observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keishaw810
40,Go just before the sunset!,"I visited just as the sun was about to set. I ended up getting one of the shows, which was insightful and decent for the price. Unfortunately I missed the sunset due to this, but still such a beautful view. I hiked the Runyon for ag ood view of the Hollywood sign, but this is a better angle in my opinion,plus the city glows from this location at night. You're also able to look through the telescopes to see the moon and Polaris I believe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
40,LA's observatory and the Hollywood sign,"If you can get up to the observatory, it's worth a look and from it you get a good view across to the Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRCsydney
50,AMAZING views!!,"Got an Uber to the very top (only in LA for a few days so didn't have time to hike), but the traffic and heat was definitely worth it! The views of the Hollywood sign were amazing, and the views overlooking LA were absolutely breathtaking. Will definitely be coming back this year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophie_ScottJ
50,Better view of the stars then the Hollywood,"I found the observatory as a great way to see the stars and view of the city at sunset / night. The day we went was the day they had hobbyist set up their own telescopes and view the moon, Venus, and other nighttime wonders. The parking was terrible. We had to park at the bottom of the hill and hike to the top. There is no lighting on the trail after dark. Come prepared with a flashlight just in case.Sunset was very nice and the nigh time sky line was worth the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelarH6496UI
30,Nighttime visit,The view of the city is the best part. It’s not fun getting up there. Lots of cars and traffic. The star gazing stops at 9:30 pm so get there early to get in line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jollyllama
40,Awesome view of LA and Hollywood sign,I have been here once before and it never gets boring. Fantastic views of LA and the Hollywood sign. Parking close by although I will say when we visited a few weeks ago it was really hot and very busy. We had to walk in 45c heat up the hill because they were not letting cars go up the parking area maybe because it was full so my husband dropped us off and we walked 1 km while he sat in the traffic jam however at one point they started to let traffic go back up and he could park at the observatory. If it is traffic jammed when you visit come back....its great to visit but not worth parking your car 3km away and walking up in the heat. Just come early or when crowds are gone. Great museum btw!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sr349
50,Out of this World,"Okay, my headline is clearly pun intended. Still, I really do love this place. I always have, and since they literally raised it up and stuck a gigantic underground museum in it, It totally rocks. (I HIGHLY recommend the behind-the-scenes exhibit on what they did--mind blowing.) Parking is usually a nightmare, but that usually just results in a long walk up the hill. The museum is y free, but you will need to pay for the planetarium shows--but it's reasonable--less than the cost of a sandwich in the ""Cafe' at the End of the Universe"" to be sure! The exhibits are very educational and fun. I could go over and over and still learn things. And, my 7 year old loved it a few years back--and he still loves it now that he's 11! I'm sure he will when he's a teen too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454williammarkl
50,Amazing views!,"If you can spend the time it is certainly worth a visit. Location of many movies, spectacular city-wide views and vista of the Hollywood sign. Visited on a Sunday, no problems with parking but did have a walk up the hill from parking spot. Busy with visitors but not intolerable. Definitely put it on your hit list for LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAalba
50,Free Escape,"If you want to escape the city (=LA!) and feel the urge to let your mind and body wander in another universe, then, head to the Griffith Observatory. It is FREE!!! there are not too many things free these days and if you are on a budget, this is a great option.Take the Subway, well!! I mean, the Metro !!! to Vermont/Sunset Station for $1.75 only and connect to the DASH bus right outside the Metro station. It is so easy and so convenient. The bus will take you through the suburbs and all the way to the steps of the observatory for only $0.50. Yes! 50 cents!! Get your change or have your Metro card (called TAP card) ready. We went on the 4th of July and the access road was packed with cars. However, the bus managed to get through and had no parking problem.At the observatory, enjoy the exhibitions, the explanations, the Foucault Pendulum and most of all, enjoy the view of the city as well as the Hollywood sign which is nearby. Come late afternoon to see LA by day and stay throughout the evening to see LA by night. The transformation is spectacular. The observatory closes at 10 pm and we stayed practically to the end. Just be aware that a lot of people are going to take the bus back home and you need to line up early.We took advantage of the free viewing of Venus and Saturn through the lens of the free observatory Zeiss telescope.If you want, you can attend a live 30 minutes presentation for only $7 (adults) and $3 for children (up to 12). We saw ""Centered in the Universe"". The Planetarium reminded me of the one in New York and the show focused on our planet in the universe.You can stay there and have a picnic, you can go for a hike, you can stare at the city lights or the stars from our universe.Let's not forget Mr. Griffith who gave the land and had this Observatory built for the public to enjoy. A man of wealth with a vision and a generous heart. Thank you Mr. Griffith to make my day so special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SylvianeD793
50,Sunset Views,"We are so glad we added this to our list of places to visit on our West Hollywood vacation. Our teens enjoyed the beautiful sunset and views from all around. I had no idea how popular this place was. It’s worth the time to get to the top (there was a lot of car traffic along the route and walking- but added only an extra 15 minutes). A great place to take beautiful photos.The observatory was beautiful, clean, well staffed, and filled with interesting information.It’s the best free attraction in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBird411_MN
40,Great Views!,"Nice place to visit for great views of LA including the Hollywood sign. The observatory is pretty cool and had many free exhibits that my children (13 and 9) enjoyed. The shows cost a fee. We didn’t have time for them, so I can’t comment on that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinasJ1795QG
40,Great view!,There are a lot of great Foto opportunities at that place. Also a nice exposition inside. We spent around 1 hours at that place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalwf
50,Amazing,It’s free!! It’s a very cool and has a lot of information on the planets plus you can see hi much you weigh on all of the planets. Totally worth going there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O2834QOjenniferm
50,Great views of the city and the observatory has neat things to look at!,I was there for the first time in November and back again in July. I would recommend walking through the observatory and not just around it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s2ckley
50,Spectacular,"I had no idea what to expect, and I couldn't imagine how good this is.I was there on a weekend and there was a queue of cars heading up the hill and signs saying the top parking lot was full. Easy, found a car park at the bottom and walked up. Although it was a hot day, its not far and the views repay the minimal effort needed.Once you get to the observatory. It's an interactive museum explaining space and it's excellent. The displays are the best you'll see anywhere and the views of LA stretch from the city to the sea and beyond.This should be top of the list for any visit, alongside Santa Monica pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldredjag
40,Beautiful views,"Lots of people, and with good reason. Wonderful observatory, great views of surrounding area and interesting exhibits inside. If you can, take your time and go to the exhibits and shows. Allow a few hours to do it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RecreationV

50,Sunset - best Monday ever,After a day visiting the farmer's market and CBS Studios we caught an uber up in time to see the sunset out the Hollywood sign. Most amazing Monday ever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9560TDlouisec
50,Amazing views of LA,Amazing views of LA. Th observatory was pretty busy but you can find easily parking and the road it is really easy to go in and out. Recommend it if you are visiting LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen_pss0
50,Iconic Los Angeles!,"Great place to go with kids! But still interesting for adults too. You can watch the pendulum keeping accurate time, and you can go see a laser show and a planetarium show (check online for times though-they do not run all day!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/251janines
50,Family Visit,"One the the best locations in LA. Not to be missed! We visited on Saturday to see the sunset and it was amazing! Breathtaking sunset and views of the city below and the Hollywood sign. We walk the grounds and the observatory and took the best best pictures of our trip. Love it and would put it at the top of your list. Don’t miss the most beautiful, peaceful spot in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285dawnf
50,What a great place to see the view,"I love to visit this place. The best time is about 8 pm, then the lightning over Los Angeles is SO beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghougaard68
50,Sunsets and city lights,"We arrived just in time for the sun to set behind the hollywood sign. Breathtaking! I thought I was prepared for the walk due to other reviews, but I didn't realize it was more like a light hike so appropriate footwear is required. If I got to go again, I would definitely see the planetarium show and try and get in line for the telescope. Neither of those options was available to us due to our arrival time. It was still amazing, so many view points. Be prepared for ALOT of people, keep your kids close. A must see as far as I am concerned and FREE!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfletcher031973
50,Iconic treat,"Visiting the observatory has been on my bucket list for years! It’s such a well know building but that doesn’t begin to explain what’s inside too. There are 2 levels of exhibits one level covers each of planets,the ground floor has a few alcoves with special features - such as the way the moon affects tides, there’s even a piece of moon rock. We took in a film in the Planetarium - Centred in the Universe very informative. Actually the seats were so comfortable when the lights went down I had to concentrate to stay awake !! We also enjoyed a presentation of how Comets are made - excellent presenters who interacted well with the audience especially the children. It’s wonderful to walk around the outside of the building and enjoy the views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Good souvenir store and lovely cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm442
50,Loved the shows.,"Best time to go is when school is in. Summer not a good choice, parking way too busy. Better to pack a lunch and drinks. Food is expensive. Beautiful views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolanda1953
30,Great for the views...crazy crowded!,"I would highly recommend taking an uber or lift to the location as parking was a nightmare. We dropped off our party and was going to come back to pick them up only to be told by the guards down at the bottom of the hill we couldn't go back up. After some discussion, we were able to go up and found 7 parking spots had opened up. This is absurd that they were telling us to take a bus back up or tell our party to take one down all the while there were spaces available. Fast forward 20 minutes and cars were driving back up the hill - can't begin to explain why they did this. Pictures from the area were great but there was a massive amount of people making it difficult to really get around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aclary
50,Family Fun,"Griffith Park Los Angeles was donated to the city of Los Angeles around the turn of the century December 16th 1896 3,915 acres of land by Dr. Griffith J. Griffith he was friends with mr. Green who constructed the green hotel in Pasadena which still stands today is a test of time.Before he died he donated money to build a planetarium and Observatory and an exhibit hall with a beautiful Park wonderful benches lots of walking area for family teenagers and young children ample parking and great fun for everyone.The best part about Griffith Park is it's free free parking free admission.Ample parkingFive ☆☆☆☆☆ Star Rating..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogonblick
50,A terrific view to be enjoyed,Having lived in LA for over 18 years I always loved to come up and visit Griffith Observatory. The your family up there and enjoy the great view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurohandsofsteel
50,More interesting kind of stars than the ones on Hollywood Blvd,"Have visited this magical place a numebr of times, the views across LA are worth the visit and there are some amazing hikes through the park too. But the real gold is the star parties held monthly, where amateur astonomers guide you through the nigh sky with telescopes. The interior is also magical. Learning about the sky under which we live, will blow your mind, and you won't have to deal with all the narcissism associated with the other type of stars in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geminiadams
50,A must see,Great views of the Hollywood sign combined with interesting astronomy exhibits and a great planetarium show good for kids and adults alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonathan746
40,Probably better to go at daylight,It is a beautiful building inside and out. Loved it! However would recommend going during the day. I went at night and the lights of the city were pretty but couldn’t see the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taneecia
30,Easier to find alien life than a parking spot at Griffith Observatory,"This is very likely a great place to visit, but not by car. I tried to get there twice and both times we did not find a parking spot. Even not along the 1.5 miles long route down towards LA. We would have been willing to pay 4 USD / hour in the middle of nowhere, but there was simply no spot (not in the afternoon, not in the evening). So, take public transport or a taxi;",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H2AT
50,Excellent!,We were in LA on Holiday and this place was a crucial place to visit.The location is in the Hollywood Hills - you can see the Hollywood sign from it and the whole of LA below it.The facilities are excellent - and the observatory event was top quality - a definite place to visit whatever your age!Top place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlasgowCurryClub
50,Must see!,This is an awesome view to LA and very interesting place.It’s awesome and everyone must visit it!Hiking around it also a very nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295gentir
50,"Gorgeous building, great city views","Parking was a challenge but the building, grounds and city views are spectacular. The observatory was quite crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9322ALjuanp
50,The View,"Best view you will ever get of LA,worth a trek or a spin up to the Observatory day or night.The Observatory has plenty to explore inside and it’s totally free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkG649
30,Parking nightmare,"The observatory is good. But the parking is a problem. There are actually many spaceup the hill, but they have traffic control to let cars in by schedule or something. If you take a young kid, you can drop off your parties at a point , then they will walk 20mins to the observatory. For this situation, you have to drive down hill then go up again to find a spot along the road, if you are lucky, you can drive to the parking on the top of the hill. It’s better to take a bus or Uber there. FYI, the show is for child above 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LijiaoS
40,Very nice,I recommend using a tour company that can get you up the hill without problems. If you drive and park you will have a long hike or have to wait for a shuttle. The view is amazing. They say it’s the best view of the Hollywood sign but it is still pretty fair. The observatory is nice if you have the full time to enjoy it. I highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nakeah2016
50,Lovely place to visit again and again!,"The Griffith observatory has much to offer and it is all free. Even outside the view is quite amazing, but inside you will find interactive displays, a planetarium, and the Lenord Nimoy multi-media area. Well worth the visit, day or night.Tip: Parking can be difficult so take an Uber, but remember to leave the observatory before 10 pm, because no cars can go up, past the parking lot, once the observatory closes for the night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRLieberson
40,What a view,A “must do” if visit the LA area. You get the “full view” of the LA area and the museum is okay. Do expect some traffic both up and down the road that leads to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander788679
30,Always A Nice Time,"Every time I've been here It's always crowded, but there aren't many people inside the actual observatory. A lot of the time people come for the hike and the views and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellynn2017
40,Interesting but could have been better,"As you approach the observatory the setting and backdrop is stunning. You can get a good view of the Hollywood sign here as well as the rest of the city! I found the information parts relating to space and planets etc a little lack lustre compared to those I’ve seen elsewhere in UK before. That said, we saw the Centre of the Universe show in the planetarium and this was absolutely amazing! The storytelling was great and the effects of the sky, stars, constellations, theories and history were magnificent! Felt a little motion sickness afterwards but well worth it and certainly made my trip to the observatory one to remember!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nelzgirl
50,Must see!!,Awesome place to visit!! Beautiful views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign. Get there early as parking is difficult to find. There is also a Dash bus shuttle you can take up to the Observatory. Another option is a mile long hike. Don’t miss this location on a trip to LA. Absolutely beautiful and many space exhibits inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porterhub
50,"Amazing views, fascinating astronomy","Entrance into the observatory is free when it is open, and there’s so much to see inside! There are some great exhibits about various aspects of astronomy and other sciences, both on their level on which you enter and downstairs. There was a great film about the architecture and some history of the observatory, and a live presentation/show about what planets need to have life and creating a comet. The views from outside and upstairs are phenomenal of the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles area. Then you could also pay a small fee to watch one of their several planetarium shows. Seven dollars for adults, five dollars for students. We watched two, and they were both wonderful! A live narrator is present during the entire show. We didn’t have time, but the hiking trails surrounding looked wonderful as well. On the Saturday we went, it was open starting at 10 AM, but I think some days it opens at noon. I’m so glad I visited this iconic Los Angeles landmark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
50,Amazing views!,"There are two reasons to go to the Observatory at Griffith Park. One is the facts you gather inside (for free) and the other are the views over Los Angeles and Hollywood Hills. Get a bus to the top and enjoy. The cafe is clean,busy,and reasonably priced. The whole experience is well worth a half day or morning trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kevin84
50,Great view of the Hollywood sign,"We only went for the sign. There was ample parking at the top which is free until 12pm then $8 an hour after that. We got there 11am and took in the views, sadly the observatory doesn’t open until midday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyalford01
50,Jupiter!,"A very interesting museum. There is a lot to see and learn in this museum, planets, telescopes, space! There is a bit of a queue to look through the giant telescope but definitely worth it for you space lovers. Also amazing scenes when you catch the sunset.I’d recommend going just after 4pm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veekashp
40,Magnificent view of L.A.,"This place is a MUST whn you visit L.A. The view of L.A. you get here is fantastic, although you must consider the high temperatures of summer time, in that case (I did so) you must go after 6 p.m.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/constantinob436
40,All about the views,Has to be one the best view of LA from up here you can really make out the sprawling metropolis. Inside is pretty cool as well but very crowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsutherl
50,Highlight of our trip!,"I’ve been to LA many times, but had never been to the Griffith Observatory. Since I was traveling with my 13 year old son, I was looking for something new that I thought he’d enjoy. This was definitely a hit! There is so much to see inside and out that you really need a few hours at least. The highlight has to be the amazing views! One tip I would give anyone traveling by Uber would be that their very little cell service and you must walk all the way down do call for a ride. Also because there is very little cell service, put your phone in airplane mode so that it doesn’t drain your battery. This happened to us and made getting our Uber very difficult! Between have a 3% battery, looking for a signal AND trying to call an Uber made for an interesting evening.This is a place that you absolutely must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shonda95
30,Great view,It’s a place with a great view of LA. But a lot of the installation didn’t work and the roof was closed. And don’t think the Hollywood sign is close - it’s not. The place is very crowded but are you interested in astronomy it’s great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haggis170
50,Observe and absorb,"This place is great because of the view of LA and you can see Hollywood sign from here as well as sunset. It is amazing also because of the inside exposition about planets, stars, universe. We were not on the program offered, but we saw inside presentation for free about solar system. It is huge place full of information. You can connect this visit with nice trial through the park towards the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makafelix
50,Enjoyed again,"I last visited the Observatory 3 years ago. It was just a great on the second visit. The views are stunning, the washrooms are clean, the displays are interesting. It was much much busier this time (May as opposed to November), but it didn't really matter. The parking lot right at the top was packed and we were lucky to get a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,Best View of the Hollywood Sign,"This is a great placeto take a pic of the iconic Hollywood sign. More importantly, the observatory has a wealth of knowlege for kids and adults, as well as lovely views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finklemoore
40,"Iconic views, Observatory is free, Parking is painful","We went on a Sunday, along with much of the rest of southern California, and got lucky. When we initially arrived, the parking lot was closed off and there were no parking spaces on the road until we got WAY downhill. We decided to make one more pass, and they had just re-opened the lot and it had plenty of spaces. Yes we had to pay, but we were fine with that since the observatory itself is free. Has some interesting exhibits, including a demonstration of a Tesla coil, awesome pictures of the sun. But the real draw here are the best views in L.A. Bring a camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadJunkie
50,So glad that I FINALLY went to Griffith Observatory,"I am so glad that I finally went to Griffith Observatory! I have seen it on Instagram for years, but I never went until recently. It was WAY more than I had expected! I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57TomW
30,PARKING MAY BE FREE,"The observatory is closed Mondays (we knew this, we went to get a view of Hollywood sign.). PARKING MAY BE FREE, DON’t pay without checking the signs first! For example, no enforcement before noon some days.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoFryGo
40,Worth visit,Main attraction point see Hollywood sign. the observatory is good in terms of big pendulum as soon as you enter the gate. Spending 1-2 hours is sufficent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WantTravelAtBest
30,Family day out,My family and I visited the Griffith Observatory. Parking was very hard to get and if you did find a spot be ready to walk unless you are very lucky. Parking spots are $4 an hour. The views from the Observatory are spectacular. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/186AnnM186
10,Closed due to hazardous fire conditions,"Disappointed not to go here. It was closed the afternoon we went due to hazardous fire conditions! We got turned around by staff at the Greek Theatre. Oh well, next time I suppose",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cameronf410
50,The best views,I had the most amazing experience at the Griffith observatory we arrived just before sunset so seen everything in the day and then the night views also would definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nwinstanley2016
50,A must see,"Visiting LA usually involves seeing Rodeo Drive, The Hollywood Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre etc, but the one spot I had to visit was The Griffith Observatory. Certainly having watched Rebel Without a Cause at least a dozen times might have added to my desire to check out the place that James Dean and Natalie Wood interacted, but if you want to see an unequalled view of LA, then this is the place. It’s always busy, parking can be a bit of an issue but once you get there it’s all worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O9529OIlindam
50,Great Family Outing,"I went with family, and it was a great experience. The walking and waiting in line for shows can be tiring for very young ones (toddlers), but there's a lot for older kids and adults alike to learn and enjoy. You'll have an all-around better experience if you choose cooler weather. Parking can be a problem, so if you're driving plan on parking some distance from the Observatory and walking uphill a bit. Or check out other transportation options. But go! It's worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLS53Me
40,Great views and fun!,"The observatory not only has a really interesting interior dedicated to astronomy, science and space- the building sits on the cliffs above LA- giving some absolutely great views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericafett
50,Very cool place,Interesting displays that would keep an art student interested about science and space. Pretty LA city night view and theres a nice trail for a romantic stroll on the left.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weepwoop
50,Very cool,Not a better place to get a view of the city. Bring a couple quarters with you so you can look through the telescope. Also a great place to go jogging as it’s up a mountain on a beautiful path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbS9582RG
40,Interesting and short visit,"Went Sunday morning , probably best to go early and on weekday. Wasnt hard to find parking early in am and take shuttle for 50 cents. If you like stars planets and everything astronomy... this will be fun for you. Good for kids for sure. Only romantic thing is the view of Los Angeles. Very popular is the Hollywood sign which is what most people go for. Overall, good visit, specially since it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YumiH_13
50,Go in the morning !!,"The Griffith Observatory is one of the places you go in the morning, there are too many people any other time. There is a lot of places to park but it does fill up throughout the day. The observatory grounds are nice, the views of Los Angeles are breathtaking. Bring a camera, or a selfie stick, there are a lot of places to take pictures, selfies, and Instagram pics. Also, bring food and water. One of the most notable things about the Griffith Observatory is the clear view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulcH8628BB
50,A nice half a day visit to Griffith Park Observatory,It was a nice half a day spent at Griffith park observatory and I would recommend it to see in the morning to beat the traffic and crowd. They do have decent parking in too and on weekends it will get full and had to park on the trail towards top. Strongly recommend one of the shows and most importantly the Hollywood Sign View point from here is good too and a famous attraction in LA.. 🙂🙂,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunM04
50,Lovely view and break from the smog!,This was a stunning view and very interesting! Lots of facts and explanations of how the equipment worked! It was a welcome break from the dirty streets of Hollywood! Some air and trees make all the difference!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robjames84
50,Well organized educational information,We didn't realize how much educational information would be included inside the building throughout the halls. Very well done. We enjoyed our visit inside as much as we enjoyed the views from the outside. So make sure you save time for both.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarperVoyages
50,Drive from Hollywood.,"Great views of Hollywood sign and LA as you drive up through Griffith Park. We walked about 1/2 mile up hill from our parking. Very hot and fairly steep. Observatory is a clean, white and crisp building. Lots of free exhibitions and fairly busy. We paid for a show in planetarium. Great show explaining stars and some history. Nice simple cafe. We just had drinks. Needs about 2 -3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apb180868
40,Just Before the Fire,"I chose to visit Ferndale and then proceeded to the observatory. However, parking was so severely restricted we chose not to visit the observatory. I've been there before in the 1980's, but things certainly are different now. Then you could park where you wanted to and the place was a nice visit. It's a long walk on the side of the mountain as many people did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,A great place to see LA!,"The views from Griffith Park (Hollywood sign and downtown LA) are great, and the Observatory itself is well worth a visit, with good shows in the Planetarium. Guaranteed always to be busy, just leave the car in one of the lots near Greek Theatre and then walk up the hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giffnockman
50,Beautiful views of the city!,"Took a drive up late in the afternoon. Although all of the signs said ""lot full"" we kept going up to the actual parking lot (since it was late we figured people would be leaving). We were correct, and there were several available spots in the lot by the observatory even though people were parking all along the road leading up and out. This is a great place to go for fantastic views of the city and the Hollywood sign. The observatory itself is also full of great exhibits! Wish we would have had more time or come later in the day so we could watch the sun set and take advantage of looking through the telescope (which opens at 7:00 pm until close). Highly recommend you make a visit up to the Griffith Observatory if you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodilynn3
10,No parking to see it,Really wanted to go here but there was no parking to be found anywhere. They said to use the parking lot of a theater at the bottom of the hill but they had it closed off with people saying we could not park here. Would have loved to see it. One star due to no parking and inability to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kferrell1
10,Worst Experience in Los Angeles,"I’ve been going to Griffith Observatory and Park for nearly 20 years. I went with my teenage nieces two days in a row this month only to beat LA traffic & circle around for parking multiple times. We left the first time on the first try one day because it was so bad. The second day we circled around and around with rude and unfriendly traffic staff. Parking used to be free and I never had an issue parking for visits, programming or hiking with my dog. I’ve been in LA for over 10 years and this visit was horrible. We were trying to catch the programming show about the universe. We parked and paid $12 for 3 hours. It was hot and we hiked from our spot which was exhausting and we were all very fit individuals. We got to the top and the Observatory was closed due to a power outage earlier. No warning, no signs, no help from traffic and people ascending with parking, bus drop offs along with hikers. No one was aware until arriving. The website had no mention. Oh, the first parking & second parking meter did not work. We spent time trying to figure out if we were doing something wrong. Then, hiked down further to use another meter- $4 per hour. Griffith has always been Free until the last year or so.There was no shade, massive crowds were gathered around the bathrooms and in line of the monument to get shade.Staff were not equipped to handle any of this. Traffic personnel made all sorts of excuses why they could not inform us of the closer before hiking to the building. Meanwhile sitting in chairs, under shade tents and drinking water.We took a couple pictures and made our descent. We told the elderly and families with young children it was closed on the way down. Only to find a meter person giving tickets and putting out of service signs on the parking meters (they missed marking the ones we had tried to use). No one cared about us. The City was collecting their money though from a park which was given to the city with stipulation it remain free to the public, always.We spent a week driving downtown to the Broad, Angels Flight, Olvera Street, Grand Central Market, out to Malibu (Airbnb beach house), Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Abbott Kinney, the Canals, The Grove and various places in between. With our 2 attempts to Griffith Observatory, including traffic, spending only 15mins. on the Observatory ground, I calculated a total of 6 to 7 hours in total were used in trying to accomplish.I’ve decided to never go back.It’s not worth it. I’ve been many times before but with the new parking measures and one way loop implemented by City Council and Mayor Eric Garcetti, it’s a terrible and agonizing experience. So many great places in LA. If you want a view, go to Frank Lloyd Wright Hollyhock House, the Hollywood Bowl Overlook or places off Mullhulland Drive. To see the stars do much the same or go out to Malibu.The Observatory experience has been ruined. Not only, yesterday a fire damaged several cars as total losses and the Observatory is closed for the next 3 days because of fire destruction being so close. This place is probably the last place you want to be in an emergency. It’s sad that such a Landmark is being managed so improperly for tourists, visitors and Angeleno’s alike.thumbs down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jason2100
50,Spectacular views,It has the most breathtaking views of LA city especially at night and also of the famous Hollywood sign. It’s a must do for all astronomical lovers. Best to go there around 5pm and hang on till it gets dark. Only thing is it’s too crowded so weekends are probably avoidable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelegendinn
50,Great walk and perfect view,We went here for sunset and we spend here such a nice day. This place is magical and we highly recommending it for all the people especially for astronomical lovers. Perfect trip for all the family members.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883katyh

50,Griffiths Observatory,This is a really interesting place to visit which also happens to have incredible views across LA to the coast and with clear views of the Hollywood sign.The observatory is free to visit and is full of interesting information and facts about astronomy. There are also evening events which I would love to have attended but it did not work with our itinerary.One thing to keep in mind is that this is an extremely popular place to visit in nice weather and trying to get in and out with the traffic was a considerable challenge. We travelled there by Uber and tried to travel out by Uber but the Uber driver got stuck in the traffic cue trying to get in so we ended up leaving by taxi as we had to get to the airport for a flight out of LA. Had it not been for our deadline we could have stayed for a lot longer and perhaps even hiked the local area.Another bonus is that on the way in and out there are really interesting houses and stories about local resident celebrities. The Uber drivers seem to be full of local information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonimcallen
40,Good hike in the heard of LA,"North Vermont Avenue, cross Los Feliz blvd and you get access to several tracks through the hills which will take you to the observatory and even to Mont Hollywood for the braviest !A stop to the observatory ii worth for its view over downtown LA, the only coffee place available up there is just OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jep64

50,What a spectacular view!,"My first visit after living in SoCal for over twenty years. I can’t believe it took me so long. We went on a Friday afternoon in July and it was packed and few available parking spaces. From here you can see the entire LA Basin from the Hollywood Sign to the massive skyscrapers. Every direction I looked all I could say was Wow. If you can peal your eyes away from the vistas, the building is just as amazing. You could take a hundred selfies here easy! Now I want to go back to see a sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MapGuy414
50,Family Fun,"My sister and her daughter and me and mine took a trip to the Observatory. We both had not been there since we were teenagers and we were taking our kids. We lucked out and got a spot close to the entrance. Parking is an issue. You want to drive to the top, see if there is room in the top lot, if not then you can go down and park along the path. It is worth it. Real star gazers come at night and if it is clear the big telescope may be open but it was afternoon. We went through the exhibits then paid $7 per person, the kids were $5 I think for the big presentation. It was great! Learning about the stars, the universe, it was about 35 min. Well worth it! There is so much to see and learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stthomasc2016

50,A memorable view LALALAND that's unforgettable!,"If you have not been here, you have not been to LA for real. And closer to the sign with big S (Hollywood) you really do not have to come. If you're not really interested in planets and universes, it's great to just walk around the observatory's terraces, watch in the binoculars, have lunch or drink coffee. You'll probably find a souvenir to shop, and a picture in front of this magnificent classic building is a must. Here is also a bronze head of the rebel James Dean to view. In short: go here, you're taking with you a memorable view that's unforgettable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TIPPYPIPPY

40,Worth Seeing,"Parking can be a hassle, but the hike to the Observatory isn't that bad. Great views of LA and surroundings. Lots of educational stuff for kids. Was only there during the day, but I think night time views would be even better. Café is just average and over priced. Recommend bringing your own snacks/drinks. Note: if you drive up from Los Feliz from the main entrance, you do not have to go out the same way. Just continue down the road and it leads back to Los Feliz (basically a loop).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9385QZchrist
40,Nice view and Best spot for Hollywood sign,"i've brought my husband and aunty to visited this place just 15 minutes before sunset. We were busy to look for the parking spot. We didn't know that we have to book the parking lot in advance to park in front of the Griffith Observatory. We barely see the Hollywood sign because it too dark, and we also missed the trail there. We dnt live in State and hopefully we can make it up next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/719pattayas
50,Great place but too crowded,"This is a great place to visit when you are in LA. However, we went there on a Saturday and it was too crowded for us and parking is all the way down the hill. Those are the only thing I did not like about the place. Below are the list of things I like/love about the place...(1) Very educational... great for kids... and for adults too.(2) View of LA outside is spectacular.(3) You also see the Hollywood sign from outside.(4) There are shuttles going down the hill to where you parked.(5) There is also a designated area to wait for your Uber/Lyft.(6) The staff are very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HHM_JMS
40,It was hot but still classic,"After being a fan of Rebel Without a Cause and La La Land we couldn’t leave LA without a visit to this iconic place. After dinner we caught an Uber up the hill. It was a heat wave so rather hot and still incredibly busy as there was also a concert on at The Greek (something to check prior to visit). Observatory closes at 10pm but a few things close well before that so beware , need tickets for planetarium area too although rest free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinarykids

The have a solar telescope as well as a large telescope that is open to the public for viewing (usually the moon). Their planiterium is state-of-the-art. So many exhibits to see both upstairs (the original portion) and downstairs (the remodel addition). Go up on the top patios at night and look out over the breathtaking panorama of Los Angeles and you'll see why it's called The City of Angels.The observatory exhibits are free. The shows require payment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginalB9773LL

50,Stay Until the Evening,"My grown son and I went to the Observatory for the day. Even though I grew up in L.A., and visited Griffith Park on several occasions, I never visited the actual observatory. We waiting in line to view Venus from the huge powerful telescope! Worth the wait. We stayed an additional 40 minutes, because the next planet visible was Saturn! Who would want to miss Saturn with all of those beautiful rings?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeeMichelle

50,The best view of Los Angeles,"The Griffith Observatory is located on the top of one of the Griffith park's hills. It can be reached by bus, taxi or car. When you get at the top of the hill, you have a viewpoint where you can take a picture with the Hollywood sign behind or take a picture with L.A. landscape. The observatory is amazing. It has a pendulum that allows you to physically observe the movement of the earth (you have to read the explanation inside the observatory), it has several explanations about the tides, the planets, the stars, and many other things, make sure that when you go to go you have chance to enter the show they offer.Totally recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmosquera22
50,Always a beautiful place to visit.,"The observatory has always been a wonderful place to visit. No matter the age, you will always appreciate what it has to offer, from educational to a beautiful view at any time of the day, and of course to star gaze. I love the place. I visited the observatory when I first moved to LA, continued when I had my son as a school field trip and now with my son as an adult. We still love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nhanlucyh

50,Griffith Observatory,This location has been used in many movies. The Griffith Observatory has been a go-to attraction for many years and is well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wa6flr
50,Nice walk to the Observatory,Griffith Observatory will not disappoint. Such a nice walk from beautiful Los Feliz (neighborhood) to the top. Architecture is oh-so historic California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamaraW561
50,Nice outing for an evening,Not much to see here but makes for a very pleasant outing. This place is best for kids above 7- 8 years of age since they can try and understand some of the science on display. The place offers amazing views from the top. But plan your travel in advance since going back to the city could pose a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aptembe

The Observatory itself is stunning, and has plenty of fun shows if you need a long breather before starting your next hike up to the summit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
50,Get away,"Wrong date to the park, it was 110 degree today!But enjoy it with my family and friends from Hong Kong",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesR4470WL
50,Worth It,We regret not visiting this when we had more time or it was less crowded. It is such a neat experience to view the city far and wide and to learn and read up on the space facts inside. The staff were all super friendly and helpful and we got to view Jupiter from a telescope! We went up here on the 4th of July to see the many fireworks going off around the city and would have totally been worth it to just make a half day trip out of it. You really can’t beat the views and price (free!).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissy0826
50,Very cool place,If you want to get a good view of the Hollywood sign this is the spot to go. You will definitely get an amazing view of the city from here as well. We went on the weekend and it was very busy. Parking is not too great either on the weekend so try to get there early if possible to get a good parking spot. Overall I enjoyed it and will definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingCScott

50,Free and Wonderful,"It has great views of the city, it has great views of the Hollywood sign, it's educational, it's technological, it's interesting, it's sometimes out of this world, La La Land filmed there, and best of all... it's free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaveyCowpar
40,Wonderful Views of LA and Hollywood!,"Griffith Observatory is a must for any first time visitors of LA. It offers some of the best views of the city and is a beautiful observatory that offers all kinds of activities. It's a great place to take pictures and you can even see the Hollywood Sign from the observatory. The only thing to prepare yourself for is the parking. If you go on a busy day, you may have to park out and walk nearly a mile to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyreviews
40,Great Views!,"This place has amazing views! its high up the mountains & you can see LA & the Hollywood sign! Unfortunately we were there at their record 106degree temperature so the A/C went down & they had to shut down for 30-45mins until they could get back up & running. Once it was open is was nice, a little crowded. We did not see the planetarium show. It did take a go 15-20mins to get up to the observatory & a little less getting down depending on traffic. It was worth seeing the views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kchitaphong
50,Very Informative! must,"This place is really very interesting and informative for all ages. From there Hollywood sign too could too be seen.Once you go inside a huge pendulum clock is ticking along with the needful time of calculating old clock..it's interesting n fun.All movements of sun,moon and stars with which chemical gases..could be understood in one go.recommended for all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47seemag
10,Appalling service by the Dash shutttle service,"The observatory itself was awesome , but be very weary if your are leaving at the end of the service at 10pm at nightOurselves and 60 other patrons , were on the last supposed shuttle service down the observatoryWe even asked the ranger if the bus was coming and he assured us it wasWe waited an unbelievable 1 hour from10pm to 11pm only to be told there was no further servicesSorry basically we were stranded on top a small mountain top in darkness and all buses had goneA Good Samaritan put us on their pick up truck and left is off at los FelizAnd we had to walk by foot another 45 minutes to get to Vernont Sunset stationThis is absolutely appalling service , leaving mainlyForeigners in a deserted placeIn Australia heads would roll if this happenedCan't believe the horrific ordealOur familyWent through in a first world countryThis is not the end of itWe will be lodging a formal complaint with the transportation authoritiesSo the moral of the storyMake sure you finish your business at the observatory by 9pm the latest to be safe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RossP276
50,Great experience,"Located in a beautiful park with views of the city, canyon below and skies above. Interesting exhibits and programs. Location itself is an interesting break from freeways and traffic of LA. Definitely a tourist spot but plenty of locals and well with a visit > Drive through the park and cafe near park entrance added pluses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nypoppa
40,Deco Architecture & Impressive Views,"A must see attraction in LA, I love this solid piece of Art Deco architecture as much as the sweeping views from this wonderful vantage point. But I have to warn you, the crowds during peak vacation times are daunting. Parking can be an issue, so prepare yourself in advance for the traffic and congestion.Most people though are very kind, and you will find many people willing to wait while you take those all-important selfies :) and perhaps even assist you with your group photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookala
50,Amazing city view day and night,"This has to be one of the nicest place in whole LA if you want to see the whole city with a bird's eye view. I was very impressed, I recommend to arrive there before sunset, and just watch how the city ""transforms"" itself in the night lights. You can also look through the telescopes which are free but you have to wait in a big que. All in all it's a place which you HAVE to visit when you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/szabotony93
40,Beautiful views,"There wasn't much to do in terms of activities, unless you like to hike or you're interested in the planetarium, but the views are out of this world. We got up here with Lyft, but you can use the bus), or you can walk. This would be the best place to get a view of the Hollywood sign. Recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethKayN
50,Fabulous city view,"A great place to view the city and to get those Hollywood sign pics, and only need to pay to park your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hilary005
50,Fun Day Trip!,"My husband and I were in the LA area and decided to visit the Griffith Observatory on a spur-of-the-moment! We were very lucky and were able to get parking at the top of the hill, right outside of the entrance. NOTE: If we go again, we will definitely Metrolink and take the Dash Bus which drops off passengers right at the entrance. Otherwise, parking was only $4/hour which was very affordable.The Observatory is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous and the exhibits are well designed. Make sure to spend the extra money and see one of the films that are shown on the half hour. They are totally worth it and make the experience even more enjoyable.Food in the cafe is where the $$$$$$ comes in...$30 for (2) hot dogs and (2) soft drinks. The cafe was also very disorganized and people were running over each other to get food. The management needs to re-think the structure and flow of the cafe.Overall, I loved being able to see such a beautiful and historical structure in LA. NOTE: Bring an umbrella for the sun and a water bottle... and ENJOY! Cheers!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelloandBonjour
50,Interesting and fascinating,Went straight from Hollywood walk of fame to the observatory and regret the priority. Should have had more time here. Very interesting history and displays all over. Would like to go back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386gustavl
20,PARKING IS A MESS!!!!,The inside of the observatory is pretty good but the parking is a nightmare. There’s a fair chance you may not find it. Good luck!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/425riyan
40,Great location that oversees LA,"I think this is probably the best location to take photos overlooking the city and at the Hollywood sign.Parking is free if you want to visit there before the Observatory opens or don’t mind walking up the hill to the top. A very good exercising path. Loads of tourists there, so best time to go is early morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blues_3000
30,Busy place,Very busy place. Full of tourists that are dropped of by bus for short photo stop. The view over the city is nice. There are better places to view the Hollywood sign though (i.e. 3000 Canyon Lake Dr). Ok if you have spare time but no must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenGlesener
50,Better than expected,We visited on a Tuesday evening and we impressed. Really a great place for a family to spend some time together. Very informative and had some great displays too. And it’s all free.The bad is the parking is horrendous. The night we went there was a concert at the Greek which multiplied the parking problem.This is a must see if visiting LA. Such an iconic building. I would avoid going on event nights at the Greek if at all possible. We left before sunset but wished we had stayed to see the night view of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc33
50,I see stars,"A must goto place if you visit LA. do the planetarium show for sure. Just don't try to visit when there is a concert on in the greek theatre, this creates major traffic delays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoTorpedo
50,great place,Great place to spent time with family or friends. It's really beautiful in the evening. The place has an amazing view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7250UOmarinav

50,"Fun, educational and great views","We went on a super busy night. We took an Uber up and saved ourselves a parking nightmare and a ton of walking. The Uber dropped us off at the very top. For the ride down, we could not get cell service. So, we rode the DASH bus down to the bottom of the hill for 50 cents per person and got an Uber from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5591IRpatrickr
40,Good tourist stop,"This is an interesting stop on your vacation. It is close to other attractions, and tourist locations and educational for the family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M-LLosangeles
40,Not to be Missed!,"The place was very well kept. Has a very good view. The exhibit/show was also nice. But visitors of this place should be prepared for an uphill climb since parking space is a bit difficult to find. We had to look for those who are leaving to get a parking space and unfortunately for us, we needed to walk quite far. But the place & view was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cesdakis
30,No Parking,The view was just so so to us and parking was impossible. We ended up taking the bus from the bottle of the hill which was pretty easy. It was so crowded we didn’t love it but it wasn’t the worst experience ever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristyE862
50,Family Adventure,"Family of four (two 16 yr olds) w/ Mom & Dad. We had an all too short time at this stop (1 hr), which was part of a tour. Excellent exhibits but you really need time to hit the shows and read all the presentation plaques. Some fun computer based experiments for kids. Will return on next trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisKilian
50,What an incredible view,"Griffith Observatory was a great way to spend the morning. We got there early to beat the crowds, parking was cheap, the weather was not brutally hot yet, and we could take our time to see it all. The views everywhere were breathtaking. You have an excellent view of the Hollywood sign and some great hiking trails. Lots of movies and TV shows have been filmed there, which is pretty cool. The museum was nice from the inside as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jabri
40,"Great Place , Great View","Griffith Observatory is a must visit for everyone visiting LA . The view itself is stunning, you can see LA from above and of course the famous hollywood sign. The planetarium itself is unique and has a lot of thing to see. It is not to be missed while in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jantwid0601
30,"Great view of the Hollywood Hills, but less so on a gloomy day","Unfortunately, due to my schedule, I was unable to go on another day, because while driving up to the Observatory it was pretty apparent that the views would be a bit gloomier than I hoped. Shame because it is a great location and there were some lovely views despite the weather, but it was just a bad day for it. Also get there early because the parking can be a bit of a nightmare too. I would give it another try though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tim_Passe
40,Enjoyable Place to Visit,"Spending the day at the Griffith Observatory is a great choice! So much to see and learn here. The views are amazing! The exhibits are interactive and informative. The staff were well informed and were very willing to share and discuss. The planetarium was very enjoyable and I highly recommend paying for the show. From what I remember, admission to the Getty is free, parking was free but a bit confusing, you need to pay for the planetarium show ($6-$7, I think), and the tram to get from the parking lot up to the Observatory is $0.50 one way for each person, cash only, plan accordingly. This is a great place for those who are interested in science and fascinated by all things space related. I really liked that you could set your own pace for the day and from time to time there would be informative little talks by the staff about different topics (Einstein, Tesla, etc). The only drawback on these talks is that it is very hard to hear the speaker giving them due to the overall noise of people around them. Plan to spend the day, dress comfortably, and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraa124
50,Vacation to LA,"This is a venue worth taking the time to visit , you will from this point get a great view of LA and the Hollywood sign .Take your time and enjoy this site .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U408MSmichaeld
50,One of my favorite places in LA!,"Truly one of my favorites - whether you want to learn about planets, visit an old movie set, see the view, or hike a short trail, you can count on Griffith observatory. Just a wonderful experience all around. Parking is a challenge but try visiting on a weekday and it's a bit better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shaheens
50,Hollywood sign,From here you have a great view in the Hollywood Sign. Finding a parking spot can be difficult. Make sure you visit the James Dean statue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931wendyv
30,Unexpected hike,"Wonderful views of the city that you can’t get anywhere else BUT access is terrible. The road is a constant traffic jam and parking is a complete disorganised mess. There is no signage or info anywhere. We spent half an hour driving up the hill to the observatory only to then have to go past all the car parks, being waved through by attendants, and back down the hill to another small nondescript car park. From there it was a hike, not just a walk, a HIKE up a steep and slippery dirt goat track around 2km to get to the observatory. Luckily for us we are young and fit but if you’re not, then too bad, you miss out. Also there are plenty of signs in the car park warning you to take water but then there is nowhere to fill up. I’m giving it 5/5 for the observatory and 0/5 for the management. They need to build a cable car, do some shuttle buses to the top, or figure out some other system. What they have is not working.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awhykes
30,Really nice but too many people,"We ubered there and had to be dropped off 1/2 way up the mountain because there was too much traffic. We walked the rest of the way. It is amazing to see the city and the Hollywood sign. Really nice. But too crowded. The best advice I can give you is... when you are facing the observatory, there is an elevator on the right, in the yard. Take that elevator to the bottom floor and you will find restrooms that no one knows about. Also take the dash bus back down the mountain for $.50 a person. I know I said mountain and it may not be a mountain but I’mFrom Florida where everything is flat so if felt like a mountain. Cool view. With doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaneA424
50,The Wonders of Science,"A visit to the Gryffith Observatory is now made easier. From Hollywood area, you can take a Dash Observatory bus straight up to the front of the Gryffith Observatory. Plus, if you have a TAP card, it's made even easier. You can use your TAP card as payment. If you don't have one, no problem. Fare is 50cents. Plus, buses have on-board free wifi. I suggest going to the observatory later in the afternoon. The sunset view is amazing. But by sunset, I mean 9PM. The displays are amazing, but some may not really find it interesting. If you're a Science geek or fond of stuff inclined to it, you would love it here. It's also great for couple photos, especially that it's overlooking downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethe157
50,Planetarium that's out of this world!,"If it was just a planetarium, that would be enough to warrant 5 stars. But the Griffith has some of the best astronomy exhibits I've ever seen, explaining simple and complex concepts with interactive displays. Outside offers an unprecedented view of downtown LA (and the rest of town), along with a view of the famous Hollywood sign. Did I mention that admission is free? Yep, you only have to pay for planetarium shows. We didn't get a chance to go stargazing, but there was plenty of other things to do so we didn't feel like we missed out. Highly recommend a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naturetack
40,A beautiful view of the Hollywood hills,"This site is immaculately maintained and provides a unique unobstructed view of the Hollywood sign. It also offers an interesting vantage of the Los Angeles landscape. Notably that in addition to the larger cluster of tall buildings that constitute the LA skyline, there are other satellite clusters of tall buildings within the vicinity of LA, and surrounding all of this for as far as the eye can see is a carpet of residential areas.It is well known that parking is very limited, and that most parking is located more than a mile (uphill) hike away. One secret is that a $50 membership to the Observatory provides access to the on-site parking. This is a good option if you have very old or very young visitors in your group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chenedwa
50,The START to your California adventure...,"Yes, in California we have beaches, the desert, beautiful mountains and even snow. You can sometimes see it all in a single day. but the one place I take all guests visiting for the first time is the Griffith Observatory. It is the hub of so much history in Los Angeles and it has a fantastic view of the Los Angeles County, for that matter. There has hiking trails that take you to the Hollywood sign, there are photo opportunities that can't be captured anywhere else, the Griffith Observatory has enough interactive things inside to keep you busy for hours. This is the start to your California adventure, although there is a lot of traffic and you may need to park down the hill and walk up it, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7534DZjamesw

50,Very impressive!,Having headed up to the Observatory purely on the basis that it's one of the best places to view the Hollywood sign. It was such a pleasant surprise to go into the Observatory and see all the interesting and impressive parts that make up the experience. Made up of multiple floors. From old original telescopes to the various sections each with its own exhibit as well as a presentation in the Leonard Nimoy theatre. It's free and well worth checking out for the whole family. Such a nice surprise. If you are in LA go check it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grants976

Lots of people and the upper lot was full so we parked on the roadside near the top and walked up a short distance. The view of the city and the mountains and the Hollywood sign are all just as great as you would hope. Inside the observatory it is all kinds of science and fun things to explore. Visit here if at all possible and then every time you see it on TV, and you will, you can say you were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drdfsdaz

There was no parking to be had and looking at the loooonnnngggggg walk up the hill for any parking spots to be had at the bottom, was simply not worth considering. With that said, we did some quick research and parked in a paid parking building and took a city bus. Parking cost $14 and city bus cost 50 cents. Doing the match, maybe the walk up the hill would have been worth it! The center, while crowded, but worth the trip for the views of the city and surrounding areas and of course, the Hollywood sign. We watch one of the movies for a relatively inexpensive price but the wait to get tickets and then again, to enter the theater was long and lengthy but worth it. Were the crowds and parking choices worth it? Yes, I'm glad I did it. Would I do it again? Maybe at night as I'm sure the city lights are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynWA
50,Wonderful View,"Probably the best view of LA and the Hollywood sign. Lovely building. Parking can be a challenge, but I understand that a shuttle bus may be available. So glad we decided to make the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MegtheHealer
40,Star gazers point of interest,Nice stop if there is a star gazer with you. When we visited the upper parking lot was full and we decided to walk up. (A shuttle bus is also available.) At the observatory there is a great vantage point to see the Hollywood sign. We enjoyed the two shows showing different perspectives on the night sky. At 7:00 pm they even set up some powerful telescopes for public use. Definitely worth our hike up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469MarkQ
50,Beautiful Views,"Griffith is a must see for its beautiful view of LA and the famous Hollywood Sign but also you are a fan of the La La Land Movie. There are several scenes of the movie that were shot inside and outside of the Observatory, so don't miss visiting here. You won't regret it unless the weather is just terribly disagreeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shogsed
50,It is worth to visit,"The Griffith Observatory is really so nice and worth to visit. The building is modern and equipped good. You can see a lot of breathtaking views from the roof and, of course, the visitors are able to make a famous picture with the Hollywood sign!I would recommend to visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BilaziraKnitwear
50,Great view,It wasn't open when we arrived but the view of LA is excellent. It was a clear day with no smog so we could see for miles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erriad2017
50,"beautiful view, late afternoon or evening is best","Beautiful view, recommend visiting in late afternoon or early evening for the best view with minimal fog and smog. We went during a star gazing party event, it was incredibly crowded and required a steep hike to get to the observatory. I would probably avoid the party in the future or plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/684jenm
50,History and education all in one,"There is so much that Griffith observatory has to offer it is insane. Aside from being culturally significant and an iconic L.A. landmark, it is loaded to the brim with fun and informative astronomy exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chongcp
50,What am amazing place,This is so worth a visit which you can access via metro/ bus.The views are breathtaking over LA and the information Arouca the observatory is brilliant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evag385
40,"Amazing views, go before noon for best parking","Although we didn't take in the actual observatory, we went for the views of the Hollywood sign and the city.The views did not disappoint! There were even LA Firefighters putting out a blaze down below (not sure if it was a controlled burn to train hotshots or not). Lots of lines at the restrooms, though, so plan accordingly. So few things are free in LA, but this is one and worthwhile! If we had more time, I would love to have taken a hike and of course visited the actual observatory building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitney629
40,"Worth the hype, mainly for the views","This place is worth the hype, mainly because of the views. I strongly recommend coming here early before the place opens or near when it closes. The parking lot is small and if you come mid-day you will need to walk a great distance and there are lots of red zones for parking which could be confusing and lead to a parking ticket.If you arrive before the Observatory opens you can park for free and have time to hike the nearby trail and take pictures, when the place opens you can then pay an hourly rate.The views are worth the effort. You can see all of Los Angeles and it is the best place to see the Hollywood sign. The Observatory itself is nice on the outside and inside has some interesting space exhibits which look like they were setup in the early 90s. Admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Brilliant,"Amazing views all around LA, very easily accessible as well. Great views of the Hollywood sign, would definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSpence9
50,Iconic,"This place is icon California. If it’s not pouring rain, which I’m sure only happened the day I was there, then you can have the best views of LA and area plus the Hollywood sign.The observatory is also extremely cool and the shows are really well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelifeofcrow
40,"Great Views, Interesting Astronomy Show","The observatory is on top of a hill in Griffith Park and is in a beautiful art deco building that is situated in a lovely park. You can take a first-rate photo with the Hollywood sign in the background on a nearby hill. The exhibits are free and are good, but pay the extra $10 to see the planetarium show. You get a very comfortable lean-back seat and the night sky opens up to you with a very good narration about astronomy history and astrophysics. It's one of the very few parks in the middle of LA and it fills up rapidly. We were there at 10 am on a Saturday and the parking lot was full; we had to park in a lot at the bottom of the hill and pay 50 cents (exact change, but bills are OK) to ride a bus to the top. When we left a couple of hours later, the cars were still streaming up the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaTraveler7777
50,Definetly worth the trip,We took the bus ride to & from the observatory (exact change require) $0.50 per person each way. It has great views with alot of history & scientific stuff to learn about. Some thing's are free some charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/427mrs
50,Best panoramic view Los Angeles and a place to learn about the universe and sky!,"What a view from the terrace of the city, especially on clear days, from Downtown, Hollywood to the ocean! Inside the observatory are tons of information, displays of the sky and universe. Truly worth a whole day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4victorh
50,Very informative and good views,"The observatory was great. All the information and everything one could learn about the sky and the universe was very good. It was nice to see so many people take interest in it. Also the views on LA were great and one gets a good overview. Parking is a bit tough, but if you are ready spend a bit time hiking then there is a big parking lot further down. The hiking trails around the observatory are also worth following.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tauriv
50,Saturday afternoon visit,Great visit - although a little crowded:). The drive from Burbank area to the observatory was a pretty one. Main parking was full so we parked down the hill in overflow. Wasn’t sure about walking but it was a nice walk. Lines to long to stay for the telescopes but views and photo ops fabulous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniesudano
40,"What you need to know, in one place","The observatory is a 5-star attraction. However, getting all of the necessary and helpful information is somewhat bewildering, and some of the policies just don't make sense to me as a visitor. Still, once you know how things work, it's worth more than one visit because there is just so much to see and experience. Parking at or near the observatory is $4 per hour. We chose to go on a day when nothing was scheduled at the Greek Theater. When there's nothing on there, parking is free and abundant. That's where we parked, crossed the street and caught the DASH shuttle that runs about every 20-25 minutes. It cost us $0.25 each as seniors(60+), normally $0.50 per person, each way. Or you can walk up the hill. Several interesting trailheads on the way up. Admission to the observatory is free. You pay to attend the various video presentations, which are quite good. Each costs $7 per person, $5 for seniors. We saw the program on the Northern Lights, and Center of the Universe. Way too many interesting displays and exhibits all over the place, all free. There are lots of restrooms, although those can get crowded, water fountains, and very few benches. The cafe is decent, and supplied by Wolfgang Puck, but very limited choices. Almost everything was put away by 6 or 6:30 pm, and it was closed by 7 pm, despite there being lots of hungry visitors. Huh! I don't understand that. The other thing I don't understand is that they seem to allow backpacks. Not a very secure environment in my opinion, and you can't check them in. I think next time, I would bring a backpack and carry my snacks and meals with me. The big, main telescope is available, first-come-first-served, 7-9:30 pm, and is free of charge. A docent does an amazing job of chatting about what you can see, and about the telescope, while people move through. We got to look at details on the moon, even though the sky was still light. You don't have to wait until the sun sets to get some good views. About the same time, there were 3 or 4 smaller, more modern telescopes set up next to the front lawn. Access to these is also free, and there are trained and knowledgeable personnel instructing the use of these. You just line up and wait your turn. We got to see the planet Jupiter, with its rings and two of its moons. Very cool! Fun to hear all kinds of languages being spoken. The observatory closes at 10 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223
50,Great,Great view. Educational. Good exercise to walk up to Observatory. The pendulum clock is amazing. You will recognize the building from many movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5650EJsamanthah
40,The tesla Coil,Very hard to get to the top Very interesting with many things to do including the planets and stars. The parking was misleading. We drove to the top and found many parking spaces available,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineA705
50,Learn and play,Great for spending time with your kids. It explains lots of scientific theories and laws. It has the most amazing view. My kids love the element table.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciziaj
50,Family outing,To see panoramic views of the city and learn about space this is a must visit!!! Try to visit on a cleat day and enjoy the planetarium shows!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksjr2007
50,Only one day in LA? Come here!!,"I have been to LA a few times and was with my husband who had only one day. So we went to the observatory. It is the best place to go because the views are amazing - you can see the Hollywood sign, the whole of LA and on clear days, Santa Monica and the pier.As well as the amazing views, the observatory has excellent exhibits, interesting and educational. Plus it is free to get into.There is also an optional planetarium which is $7 per adult for a show - which is SO worth it! The shows are fab.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystal_canary
50,The Griffith Obseratory and Planetarium,"The Griffith Observatory is one of the more iconic attractions of Los Angeles. It's very, very interesting for both students and inquisitive adults who wish to learn more about our universe and our solar system. I think it was one of the first observatories opened in the U.S. and has operated since the early 1930's. There is a theater and many exhibits with docents around to explain the various attractions.Well worth a visit, and I think admission is still free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardJ2048
50,Amazing LA view,"Amazing view, worth it the hiking there with our young children.It’s a great place to visit while in LABring water and conformable shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariamlongo
50,A must see when in LA,"You have to go for the views, but I would love to go back for the exhibits and astronomy events. It was inspiring to see so many people there in line for a glimpse at the planets.Definitely one of the highlights of anyone's trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJr970
40,Griffith Observatory,"This is a must do while in L.A. It was extremely crowded the night that we went, but that just proves how interesting of a place that it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashliem130
50,An amazing place,"This is really a must see place in LA. First of all, the location is amazing overlookibg the entire LA and offering in the same time a perfect view to the Hollywood sign. Then, this is an amazing free of charge science place offering the children and the adults alike an extraordinary journey among the solar system and its formation as well as on a large variety of other science staff. Amazing place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bogdan2005
40,Interesting,Great place to go and it’s free to get in. I took an Uber as parking looked busy. There is also a bus (dash). Plenty to keep everyone interested and there is a cafe on site. There is lots of interesting stations to learn and experiment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242dp
50,A magical spot,"It’s a nice walk up from the Ferndale canyon park, or you can drive. Worth the trip for the view alone, but all sorts of cool stuff inside!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notlostyet12
40,Hollywood Sign,This was a nice stop on our tour of LA. It’s a great place to see the Hollywood sign and a birds eye view of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondi1517
50,Still Great After All These Years,"It was about 55 years ago the first time I came here and they have done a great job of keeping it current and up-to-date. AND it is free! I took the Red Line from Union station and got off at the Vermont/Sunset station. There is a Dash bus there that shuttles up past the Greek Theatre and on to the Griffith Observatory. (.35 with Tap). Parking up the hill is very limited and very expensive. A lot of folks park at the Greek then Dash shuttle up the hill.The observatory is free, there are several shows in the Planetarium at $7, $5 senior. They take credit cards.There is a nice cafe on site. Bringing your own is discouraged.How about a helpful?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alzeegator
50,Best View of LA and The Hollywood Sign!!,"We didn't actually go into the building, but instead we walked around the beautiful property to see many different amazing views of: LA, the Hollywood sign and the mountains. Even though the building opens at noon you can still drive up to it and park I believe from 7AM on. I wish I would have known this as this parking lot fills up quickly. Tour busses were also pulling in around 10AM when were visited. even if the sign at the bottom of the mountain says lot full, still go because people are constantly leaving. Also during the week days, you don't have to pay for parking before noon (I wish I would have known this!)I thing this a a MUST VISIT while in LA. I hope the details in my review were helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cbjhome
50,Don't miss this,We would have never thought to do this. The view was fantastic. On clear evenings they let you look through the telescope.Be prepared to walk up hill but it's worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leftbank7
20,Ok 👌,This is an observatory with informational material for all ages if you’re into to this. I personally didn’t find it that interesting except the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3980VWpeters
50,Loved it! Fabulous views of the city,"We went at 7pm to the observatory intending to join the walking tour held each month and listen to the guide but it was so very busy that we decided to just do our own thing.Parking was a little crazy as it was so busy but there is a bus that picks up from the Greek and costs 50c each, each way. It’s worth paying as it’s a long hill to get to the observatory itself and they are fairly regular. We waited a little longer coming back down the hill but you could grab one of the many cabs if you’d prefer to pay the $15!!There was loads for the science/astronomy lovers out there and plenty of fabulous scenery for host not so science minded. We watched the sunset over the Hollywood sign which was a treat and enjoyed a couple of hours walking about and using the public telescopes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zavarony
40,Missed most of it,We will definitely be back. Got here late but we were able to see the beautiful city and Hollywood sign from the top of the city(or so it seems). I would recommend anyone see this. It will definitely be crowded but worth it. We were able to walk pretty far and then enter building for about 5 minutes. They do not play about closing time so get there early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lanesa79

50,Joined LA City Tours,We visited the Griffiths Observatory on the above tour and got plenty of time to wonder around and received loads of information from George our driver/guide. The Hollywood sign was lovely to see as was the Park itself was wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraf516
50,"Educational, romantic view at night, has cafe with inside or outside tables","The Observatory has been refurbished but has not lost its character. The exhibit has been expanded to include videos of the renovation, interactive demos, and the traditional exhibits and light show in the planetarium. There are two telescopes that are permanent and there are temporary telescopes brought out at night on the grass for current sightings. The View of Los Angeles is incredible in the day or night time. You can see the Hollywood sign from the grass area. There is enough to go for the entire day or for a brief overview of the grounds. Don't miss this amazing historic point of Interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroler273

Also, you can’t find a better view of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stravel146

But gorgeous place to go with the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoryGSDS
50,Los Angeles Iconic Views,The Griffith has been in many movies and is a must see in Los Angeles. They have awesome educational tours and videos. Views of Los Angeles are those for pictures so bring your favorite camera. Access is easy and walking is minimal. You may want to pack a snack or lunch for the family. You want find any stores or restaurants on the drive. Enjoy! I have been serveral times and always enjoy the trip and look forward to taking new friends on their first visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mantis24
50,Get there early and bring walking shoes!,"The Griffin Observatory has a first rate planetarium and many quality free exhibits. The only negative is the parking. The Observatory is on the top of a winding narrow road. The lot on top fills up quickly and many visitors end up parking along the road. The Observatory is also the trailhead for the hike to the highest point in Griffith Park, Mount Hollywood. The trail is uphill but the rigor is moderate. People of all ages, including elementary school classes, use the trail. There is plenty of space on top and many excellent viewpoints for pictures. The round trip distance is about two miles and most hikers carry water. There are plenty of good picnic sites along the road and you can easily make your visit a full day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slambert502018
50,The highlight of any LA Trip!,"The highlight of any LA Trip! This place is surreal! It's sitting high top on a mountain with a great view of the city, the Hollywood sign and the building itself is majestic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarwarmazid
40,Great free activity!,"The observatory isn't big, but it packs a punch and you can easily spend an hour or two reading through the exhibits. The highlight of the stop, though, was the narrator at the planetarium show. It took an otherwise pleasant show to an 11. His dedication and commitment to taking the lines seriously, no matter how cheesy, was just fantastic. I'd go again just to see him!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tapeck
40,A must see - but bring your walking shoes and quarters!,"There is parking, but you have to park a ways down the mountain and take a shuttle up to the observatory. It's 50 cents per person, but they only take exact change, so bring your quarters! You could walk to the observatory from parking, but it's up hill, so be prepared for a strenuous walk if you're not used to it. We had a some older people in our party, so we took the shuttle up and walked back down with no problems!The observatory itself is lovely. The views are amazing, and the museum is fun and educational. I highly recommend staying for a demonstration of the Tesla coil! That was the highlight of the museum for me.My only complaint would be that the museum is not very educational if you already have an interest in science, astronomy, space, etc. The history of the observatory was new to me, but much of the rest was information I'd seen before. Still, I thought it was worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachel_Marie_Be

40,A place with a view,"Several friends recommended us to visit this observatory. The parking is really a challenge, I guess you have to be there really really early if you wanna have a good decent spot, otherwise you will have to walk A LOT. Beside of that, the place is gorgeous! Entrance to the venue is free, and you can take amazing pics of the city skyline and the Hollywood sign in the outside (sunset is wonderful!).

50,Amazing science,"I made the mistake of spending too long outside admiring the views of LA and the Hollywood sign when I should have gone inside first to book a ticket to one of the planetarium shows, then go back outside for the photo opportunities. Consequently, I missed out. Nevertheless, there is still plenty to see and be amazed by inside the Observatory museum. Foucault's Pendulum is fascinating, and the artwork in the dome adds to the impression.Catch the DASH bus to get there rather than bother with parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie

The view is amazing and probably the best place to take in the beauty of LA. We took bubbles and it was really fun to blow bubbles off of the top of the observatory. There is also hiking trails to enjoy and get your cardio in while enjoying the beautiful scenery. Definitely one of my favorite spots in the city but beware to try and avoid busy times because it does get packed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P420CLdavidp
50,Bestes,What are the best observatories I've been too what enjoyed all of the sites Nick in the Lasershow there at night is something amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2496HYrandys
50,Great Spot for an hour and half or more,Iconic LA location is a must see for the views and for some great shows they hold in their theatre about the universe.Hiking trails around Griffith Park start right at the parking lot as well.Go on a weekday. Weekends are too crowded and parking is tough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589jymb
50,Classic Must-See,"The recent restoration of this Los Angeles classic has made it even more fun and inviting. Worth battling the crowds to see the beautiful Deco landmark, learn something and see a show in the wonderful theatre. Make a day of it by having lunch down the hill in Los Feliz.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandisonk
50,A must see!,The observatory itself has wonderful exhibits and a great planetarium. But the views from there are amazing. Great views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottfO2650VO
50,"This is a ""Must See""","The Griffith Observatory is much more than just an observatory. Space, science, Tesla (!), astronomy. There is so much to see, do, and learn here. In addition to all the activities and things to see inside, it has outstanding views of the city outside. The Griffith Observatory is one of my favorite places when I visit Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madster02
50,Magical Place,This little piece of history never gets boring. It is a magical place and must see for tourists and locals. You learn a lot and you experience mother nature's beauty among busy Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795sonjam
40,Remarkable Views,"A great place to see LA from above. Go to the roof and look through the telescope at night, you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphS328
30,The views of Los Angeles,"It is very much what you expect, but there some season exhibits and films that are very amazing. And The Views, period.The park is, like some other places in LA, just a little bit expensive and you have to imagine how proceed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/si2shu
50,Griffith Park Is Awesome,I love visiting Griffith Park especially in the fall. This is the perfect fall activity and this is a magical place. I wish they did not charge for parking. This place is always worth a visit. I will continue to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morgankelly876
40,Nice hike,If you park below it's a nice hike up to the observatory and you'll find once you get there scenes from where Dirty Harry was filmed a few interesting exhibits there nothing special but still interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddDrumm
50,Stunning Views!,"We were slightly underwhelmed by where we were staying in LA so fancied a trip to the observatory to escape from it all and boy was it worth it! Stunning views across the city, surrounded by hills and a view of the Hollywood sign. We got up there via Uber as we’d read parking was an issue. Phone signal at the observatory is not great, but we managed to eventually connect and get a return driver! The cafe is not great, the food is edible but i would probably rate it a 3-4 star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0ruthg
50,A Breath of Inspiration,"You know this place is truly a gem! The climb up the stairs, the historic structure I and awe inspiring view is a trip couples of all ages can appreciate. It’s a view of our city that any tourist can appreciate. The reason why I suggest couples is because of the air that can blow away your worries for those moments you are there. It feels like a whole new world when you visit. There are many picturesque places you can easily get memories you cherish forever. Get your lunch and head to the best location in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trendycity
50,Beautiful,"The Griffith Observatory is an absolute must when visiting Los Angeles. With stunning views of Hollywood, amazing exhibits and beautiful shows, it is a great overall experience. Before you go I think there are a few things to know. Firstly there is a 'DASH' bus service that drops you right at the observatory door, however, every time I saw this bus, it was packed with people. We opted to drive because of restricted timings. We braved parking as close as we could on a Saturday afternoon and we were able to find a space quite easily. Parking on the road is $4 an hour but as entry to the observatory is free, it is well worth it.The highlight of our trip was the Samuel Oschin Planetarium show. Make sure you check the Observatory website in advance as you cannot buy tickets for these shows online. Instead, you have to buy the tickets when they are released at various intervals throughout the day. We wanted to see the 18:45 and people started queuing for tickets at 17:40. The 30-minute show was breath-taking, so make sure you start queuing early/plan your trip about when the tickets are released.Overall an amazing visit, but make sure you do plenty of research before you go and expect it to be very busy at weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isabelh2016
40,Loved Griffith Observatory,"This was one of my favorite places to visit on my trip. I went around 5pm, it was cooler and less crowded. The planetarium was awesome. Definitely pay to see a show, only cost $7.Im so glad I got to see you this beautiful place. Go outside and see the sunset, it’s amazing. I took a Lyft ride from my hotel and it was well worth it. Parking looked horrendous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8856HBdebbieh
40,Great views of the city,"We love to visit Griffith Observatory and do each time we are in the area. This time there were volunteers there who had telescopes available so that Venus and Jupiter could be seen. Wonderful views of the city, the Hollywood sign, and Griffith Park below. Parking was disappointing because the folks from down the hill directed us up the hill, but the attendants at the top were not letting cars move into the lot to fill vacant spaces. They directed cars back down the hill. Very confusing and disappointing. But a wonderful venue, even though the parking attendants did not help the situation at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449roseb
40,Great view!,"Great view and neat experience! Be aware of parking ahead of time. We had to park down the hill and walk up, quite a hike! If my kids weren't 10 and over it would have been torture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863shannonr
50,Hiking,"Drove over an hour here to see the Hollywood sign. The sign was very small. Even then nice to take a walk, look at the views of LA. Weather was good and walk lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youke_worldwide
40,Great views,The views are great. There is very poor internet reception but there is wifi if you can pick it up. The show in the planetarium is fun to watch. If you come via Uber it’s hard to call due to lack of wifi. We took the shuttle bus to the Greek theatre and then walked out of the complex.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255060Charlie10
40,Evening at the observatory,The observatory is old and situated on a hill over looking Hollywood - the same hill as the holllywood sign. On clear evenings they invite the public to looks at various planets and celestial bodies. The road is busy and parking scarce but still a fun way to spend a few hours as the drive up is on a windy road that passes the Greek theater. At the observatory there are several interesting exhibits and a couple of decks that offer amazing views of LA. There is also a viewing screen showing what that telescope is pointed at so even if you don’t go into the telescope viewing room you can get the same experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenda-blmhouston
50,Visit for the View,Breath-taking views outside the observatory and informative facts inside. Parking area is a long uphill walk to the drop off point. Queue to go inside the planetarium was long and winding when we visited hence we skipped this. Picture worthy scenes from the fromt of the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inaliel79
40,View and setting is worth the effort,"On a clear day, the Giffith Observatory in the hills on the north side of Los Angeles has a fine view over the city and toward the famed Hollywood sign. Plus, the grounds themselves have appeared in many a movie and television show. It is a little bit of a hassle to get up there, but with some planning it's not a real problem. We took the Vermont Canyon Road north from Hollywood and that put us right onto the road to the observatory. Note that a recent development seems to be that West and East Observatory Roads are one-way now, and streetside parking for visitors is only allowed on the uphill (West Obs.) route; the parking going downhill (East Obs.) appears to be reserved (for staff?). In any case, going up using West Obs. Rd is best, because then one gets to drive through the Giffith Park tunnel that appeared in the movies ""Roger Rabbit"" and ""Back to the Future"". Once at the top of the hill in front of the Observatory itself is the parking lot. There are automated payment stations there, but parking was free in the morning. There are public restroom facilities by the lot (which was much appreciated). Do note that the sidewalks when wet can be *very* slippery. We saw one lady removed by ambulance who'd apparently lost her footing on the slick concrete shortly before our arrival.Even though the observatory building itself was closed, it was well worth an hour to just wander around out front, check out the planetary orbit inlays in the pavement, and walk completely around the back of the building where some of the best views of the LA basin may be found.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kay-cee-1138
50,Must visit!,"Amazing views, free entry to the observatory, interactive exhibits, a cafe, and a gift shop! What more could you ask for in an attraction?We visited around midday and the place was busy enough, but not to the point that I felt crowded. The grounds around the observatory have nice walking tracks that are definitely worth doing if you get the time.The observatory itself is free, you can just walk in and go around the different floors and exhibits as you please. It’s informative and the views from the different walkways are amazing. It has a great view of the Hollywood sign, as well as the city.We just got an Uber up to it, but there is a bus that runs to the top as well and it’s extremely cheap. There is WiFi there which meant we could order an Uber to take us to our next destination, as tourists this saved us a lot on our phone bills",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aclark512
50,Great Mountain View of Los Angeles,"This is a great place where you can view the whole regions of Los Angeles. You have to pay for entering the Observatory and watch a movie inside a dome. It's worth watching the movie at least once. The seat is comfortable.You can clearly see the ""Hollywood"" sign from the park as well as downtown LA and the vicinity. It's on the mountain top and I loved the views that it provided. It's a must-see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treebeard2005
40,Amaizing view!!!,"Unfortunately had a very limited time. If you go there don’t eve try by car. Parking is horryble but from Vermont/Sunset there is a bus going up every 20 minutes. Or along the bus line you park somewhere and than take the bus, which is a better solution.The place offer so many things to see and so many interesting data that you could easily spend a whole day there.When you are in LA, don’t miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barna345
50,Go! Go! GO! You will thank me later!,"Griffith Observatory is an amazing place to spend the day. With incredible views of the Hollywood sign and the city, this amazing spot is very busy all day. Inside, there are exhibits on everything space you can imagine. If you go at night, the staff are on the lawn with telescopes to let you get a close view of the different stars and planets. Of course, a visit to the actual observatory part is an incredible opportunity. Catch a tour if you can because you walk up into the hillside and talk about the stars, moon, and planets. The only drawback is parking! Get there early to save yourself a long walk....but seriously! GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Start_Here_Travel
50,Must see,Beautiful views on LA. Try to go either morning or afternoon as we went around noon and it was extremely hot and as there is minimal cover where most of the viewing spaces are. We went on a Monday and it was closed but that didn’t bother us as we were mainly there for the surrounding views. Would definitely recommend. We got some gorgeous pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jadet97
50,Must visit,"This place was on my list to visit from long time ago. It is an amazing place. Beautiful views, A lot to see and learn about our universe. Be careful, On crowded days will be hard to park your vehicle. Have comfortable shoes in the case you need to walk. Free Wifi is available around the place but some phones still don't have reception. Has a small cafeteria to get coffee , snacks or small sandwiches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryamr127
50,MUST,"you will need a car, easy to park for free.Sunset advisable less people around easier to park. Go until the end with the car",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaC1924
50,Worth the time to visit,Great views of the city and easy to get to. The only cost was for the Dash shuttle bus at .50 per person. Parking was free at the Greek theatre at the bottom of the hill. There is a planetarium show for $7.00 that is well worth the cost. I would highly recommend a trip to Griffith Observatory when in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daverich
40,Gorgeous views!,"Visited the Griffith Observatory last weekend. Its a long drive up a hill to get there and the parking lot was closed when we drove up the first time, we circled back and the lot was open.Get ready for some amazing views, I loved walking around outside and taking photos. The inside, well designed and beautifully done, was insanely crowded. We probably got there at a peak time so plan to get there as soon as it opens to avoid the mad rush of visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelloDollface
40,"Beautiful views, very informative and well designed observatory","The views from the observatory are very good. You can see the LA skyline, and pretty much everything else from the top. The observatory is also awesome, and you will enjoy the shows, the various exhibits, and the telescope as well. Overall, a great experience. One big problem of course is the parking. The cops/rangers will send you all over the place, even if you can see empty parking spots. You end up walking a lot, even if you pay for the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohanc708
50,A great escape from the bustle of the city!,"Was a nice change of pace from the hustle of the city. Great observatory, educational as well as picturesque. Awesome views of the city day and night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strive72
50,Fabulous,"No trip to LA is complete without visiting the Griffith Observatory. The views alone are amazing!! Great view of the Hollywood sign as well. Everything is free unless you want to see the planetarium show (minimal charge). We hiked up the mountain to get there. It’s only 0.7 miles but there’s no shade. If you aren’t that adventurous, you can drive or take public transportation. I recommend the hike-it’s a lot easier coming back down! We started on Ferndell Trail and went up from there. Ferndell is all shaded and cool. The 0.7 miles up in the sun comes after Ferndell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhioLove2travel007
40,"Good for photo ops, nt much for young kids","Good for photo ops, nt much for young kids , telescope opens 7:30 pm , garden is ok , connected ny uber and lyft , dont ry going on foot as quite a track to cover if going with kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650vishalb
50,Good museum and in active use,"The exhibition is quite interesting and you also can visit a planetarium show. If you come in evening hours, you can also get a view through a telescope.A plus is a good view over the city and a view to the Hollywood Sing.A minus is the very limited parking capacity. Also parking is charged, it happens you cannot find any place for your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romanshorner
50,Great Place to Check Out.,A few tips. Get there early. Lots of groups. Check out the lower levels. The Planets Exhibit was really cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenhD4733WL
40,Good sunset view of LA,Gives one a fantastic view of LA. I reckon it's a good hike up as I saw some folks walking en route to the observatory.There is a pendulum in the observatory called Foucault Pendulum which was also awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsWayfarer
40,Great,"On the way up, you can see Jim Parson’s house. Go on a nice clear day and the views are wonderful. There are many tourists, be patient. You can spend some good time there learning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTravelertx
50,What a spectacular view!,We were staying in LA for a couple of days and visited the observatory. This was a fantastic way to see the Hollywood sign and to get an idea of just how big this city is! There was some nice trail walks in the hills around this observatory and if we had more time we would have explored a bit more.The actual inside of the building was factual and interesting but also really busy.It’s definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_babs_mclean
40,Get the best views of Downtown LA,Amazing LA views and can hike to the Hollywood Sign - wear comfortable shoes and take water if hot day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zenzar123
50,City at night: majestic!,"Anytime you visit the observatory in LA, you’ll enjoy it. This was my second time; first at night. Man, what a view! The city is at your feet, entering your retine and making itsel beautiful even with a little fog far away in the horizon. Also, don’t forget to appreciate the ceiling and mural inside. They deserve the attention of your eyes and art appreciation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nelsoncerqueira1
50,They had me with the views...,"My wife and I had been in LA on business/anniversary for nearly a week. It was our next to last day in town, and we'd been doing some serious sight-seeing in Beverly Hills. We closed down the Getty Center at 5:30, so we figured we'd check out the Griffith Observatory to finish out the day. GREAT CHOICE!We got there around 6:00 and the parking lot was full, so we ended up parking on the roadside about 100 miles away (ok, maybe just a mile, but it was up some serious hills). Was worth every step.The views of the City were breath-taking! Best view of the Hollywood sign we had found, and a panoramic view of downtown LA. We could have left then and been well worth the visit, but then we went inside.I'm no science geek by any stretch of the imagination, but the exhibits and displays were incredible!!! Videos, photos, live displays, planets, stars, moons, meteors, earthquakes, you name it, and it was here. We spent the next two hours intrigued by everything there. Because we were exhausted from our previous activities, we didn't stay for the view at night or the presentations after dark, but we certainly will next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickW11111
50,Stunning View!,"The view at night is absolutely breathtaking. I went around 9:00, an hour before closing time. It was very busy, so I had to park further down the hill, but the short hike up was worth it. At the top, you can see all of LA. The interior itself had numerous amazing exhibits, including the famous Foucault Pendulum. Great for families and education.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mormor127
50,Worth a visit!,The observatory itself was closed when I arrived (make sure to note the hours before going) but even walking around the exterior and it’s multiple viewing stations was worth the visit. You can see the whole city including the Hollywood sign. The trails are also a lot of fun with nice scenery. It gets busy but that also means it’s lively with lots of active people. Glad I went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernBelles98
40,Busy but small,"A busy place and a lot smaller than I had originally thought, great views over L.A and you can also see the Hollywood sign from here. Lots of interesting info about space inside the observatory, if your visiting LA then it would be better to visit this place rather than the dirty ‘walk of fame’ or better still get a helicopter ride over the observatory like I did (Although I was hanging on for dear life thinking the helicopter would drop from the sky) definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulp2974
50,Beautiful,"A quick visit with my wife. So many amazing exhibits. A must see for a family with children or without. Beautiful ,educational, and free!?! What more could you ask for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcR8333SS
40,"Good drive up, interesting!",It’s a good drive up since you cross a lot of hotspots getting here. The observatory has appeared in many movies - so it’s nice to see IRL! Spot the Hollywood sign as well :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziaahmed21
40,Great place to visit,I would recommend (for adults) to show up prior to noon and walk around everything. With kids - show up at dark or late in the day. Early is crowded - later is a lot worse so plan on walking. It is a great place to see with all the times you have seen in on television or movies - I highly recommend the quick visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421RickH
50,Spectacular!,"Its a must see, if you are visiting L.A.! Theobservatory is great, you can look through a telescope, visit the exhibition and the planetarium. The view is spectacular, mountains, nature, city and an excellent view of the Hollywood sign. You also can take great pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CibelesLS
50,Great learning experience and resource; fabulous shows,"How lucky one is to live in LA and have access to this observatory and it’s exhibits . Fabulous views of the city aside, the shows projected on the ceiling in the theater are awe inspiring and well narrated.Lots of learning exhibits and interactive opportunities. Good commentators and guides",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27shankarr
50,A must do for tourist and locals.,"At one stop you get beautiful views of LA, amazing shots of the Hollywood sign, gorgeous building architecture, fun and a historical destination for film buffs. Try to go just before sunset so you can see the location in all of its glory.There are also plenty of fun things to do inside. You'll have to check thier website for shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7065UDtoma
50,Worth it,"The views from the observatory and surrounding areas are breathtaking. It's beautiful on the inside as well. If ever in the area, I highly recommend visiting the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/85deliad
40,Crowded but fun,"Loved it. As you can probably guess by now, it was crowded. But it’s LA. Had a great view of the city and of the mountains. Very scenic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mostdope412
50,"Interesting, scenic but crowded tourist spot","The observatory has a nice museum display and gift shop. The views of the city below, including a spot to get a selfie in front of the famous ""Hollywood"" sign. It was crowded as all get out when we were there though. A traffic jam up the hill with occasional blockades just because there was no room to park at the top or along the road on the way up. Coming down, more traffic as preparations were being made for a concert in a park below. That's just LA I suppose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdK242
40,"Nice visit, great views, parking a hassle","A visit to Griffith is a nice fit into a big LA plan, the views of downtown and the Hollywood sign are great. The museum itself is interesting and a quick tour. For younger kids or those without astrology background they’ll learn quite a bit about our solar system in dynamic ways. The downside is that it’s crowded (we were there at about 11a in a Saturday (duh), and parking is dubious at best. Would have liked to come at night to see the telescope in operation but not enough time. We found that ignoring the “lot is full” sign worked best as the short visit duration turns cars over fairly quickly. All in all, an 8 out of 10 for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707dough
40,Not what I expected...but lovely,I thought we would be seeing an updated modern museum but it has retained it's historical facade and look. The view alone is worth it but there is a planetarium show and displays that are fun for the family. It was much busier than I expected and the drive up the hill was packed. I would recommend avoiding peak visiting hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostj252
50,Views for weeks!!,"This was just like in movies and in the video games Grand Theft Auto, an absolutely wonderful place to visit, i love astronomy so it helped that it was a little bucket list of mine to tick off but in terms of views this has been the best one yet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283luker
40,Splendid views over Los Angeles,Drove up here and strolled around the grounds on a very hot afternoon. Beautiful views across the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stubbyfolks
50,Wonderful!,"A must visit especially if you are travelling with kids, very informative & great views of LA & the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M15W
40,Busy but worth a visit for the views...obviously.,"This place can get very busy which may mean a bit of a walk if you can’t park in the nearest car parks. However it’s a pleasant walk, with oppotunity to get some exercise.It’s great that this attraction offers both free and payable options depending on what you want to see and do.We just used it as an opportunity to get a look at the Hollywood sign, a bit of a let down but we’d been warned about that. The more impressive views are that of the sprawling city beneath, well worth the visit for this and a great place to get some good photo’s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760iana
40,Nice visit – A must do if going to LA,"We went to Griffith Observatory after Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood, it’s only a short drive. Parking was hard to find and we had to drive around a few times before we got parked. You can walk around and inside the Observatory at no cost, the place was very well maintained and had some great views of Downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. It’s a must do if you are heading to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdillon04
40,Very interesting place,"Visited here as part of a day tour, spent about an hour here but needed longer. Very interesting place and great views of the Hollywood sign and if its a clear day good view of downtown Los Angeles. Would recommend a visit with enough time to see all of the observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fulf0rds
50,absolutely loved it,"I loved visiting the Griffith observatory. What I thought would be a couple of hours trip turned into a whole afternoon. The building is stunning and the views of the city and the Hollywood sign are amazing. The planetarium was also great, at only $5 for a student ticket it is well worth going to a see a show. Also really enjoyed the museum-y bit (free!) about space and the stars. It easily accessible with the DASH bus only costing 50c, well worth a trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanicash28
40,So very interesting,Great place for budding astronomers or anyone interested in the galaxy. So many free exhibits you can limit your expense to the costs of parking if money is tight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11suzannek
50,Perfect for Engagement Photography or Landscape Photography,"Griffith Park Observatory is one of our favorite places in LA! We go here to photograph engagement sessions, and we couldn't think of a more stellar place than this - especially during sunset!! SoCal is magical on its own, but Griffith Park Observatory is especially attractive to couples and photographers!! Bree and Stephen Photography",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127stephenk
50,A Magical Experience,This place is magical. The best time to go is during the Fall and Winter as the weather is simply delicious. There are a few shows to watch at a pretty affordable price. The lower level has a cafe with a variety of tasty treats.Overall it's a great experience and a friendly reminder of how vast our Universe is and the immense power we all have within us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donandresvega
50,Just Go!,"The whole area is amazing with the centerpiece being the observatory.Make sure you get inside the actual planetarium ala La La Land. Take any ticket to any show! Just sit back and enjoy! Hopefully, they will also have the telescopes open too to at least see.The cafeteria below is amazingly good and the views are to die for! It was a clear day and the ocean and Catalina Island were clearly visible.Parking can be a hassle. Getting there can be a hassle. Connect with the Zen of it and just go!Parking is easier in the morning to be sure. There are some great nearby hikes as well. Savor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoBen1
50,Magical during sunset!,"We wanted to go there for sunset (so around 7pm, we took an uber there, it costed us $10. Do that cause it looked like it was a nightmare to park, it’s $4 per hour, but by the time you get to the top, enjoy and walk back, it might cost you like $12, and you might miss sunset, so better to get an uber there and back!).When we arrived, the light was great, it looked so magical! Seeing all LA from there was amazing, we could also see the Hollywood sign from there. Sunset was great. I advise you to go inside the observatory, there is a museum, (free!), we absolutely loved it! It was very interesting and really well done! We had an amazing time there and sunset was magical.I highly recommend if you’re in LA. Plus, it’s a free attraction :)PS: there is also a bus called DASH observatory, leaving from Vine/sunset station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691aureliem
30,Beautiful place,"great place to enjoy a panoramic view of Los Angeles and the word HOLLYWOOD.There is a shop for souvenirs and gadgets, as well as a bar. I advise you to park in the valley and take the shuttle bus to reach the lookout point",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiAndre84
40,Amazing views of the city (and Hollywood sign),"This is one of LA’s finest jewels and it is free to the public. Not only does the observatory provide one of the best overviews of the greater LA area, it may also be the best place to get a picture of the iconic “Hollywood” sign. There is very limited parking at the actual Observatory, so it can be a challenge for people of limited mobility. Our visit was included in a city tour, so it was not an issue for us. There are several levels of viewing levels, some with binoculars to get a closer view of things around the area. There are several displays inside the building including a wonderful rotating camera obscura. On one of the viewing levels, you can find the rotating mirror that delivers the image to the dark room inside the building. Our tour only allowed 30 minutes there which left us wanting more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road_Warrior32034
50,Sunset perfect!,Went at sunset and the view was very beautiful. We could see the Hollywood sign. The views are very nice. The drive to this place is also very nice. Worth the time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnsI8339MD
50,"Hike by day, stars and skyline by night","This was one of the great surprises of our time in LosAngeles. We took a morning hike to the Observatory, which was wonderful, and this spurred us to return for an evening visit. Everyone in our group agreed that to was one of the highlights of our trip...we viewed 2 observatory shows and then oohed and ahhed at the beauty of the city below lit by the nearly full moon above. A magical evening—don’t miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkhallky
40,Planetary show is fun!,"We arrived at the last minute for a show. They told us there were no more tickets available. When we purchased a ticket for the next show. When we peeked into the room, less than half of the seats were sold out! We had to wait a full hour for the next show. Staff was rude and would not let us enter show even though the seats were half empty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenw2013
40,It's a wonderful observatory!,"Liked the show! The little ones are admitted only on the morning show. There is a museum to explore about anything celestial from moon phases to meteorites.

40,EXCELLENT VIEW OF LOS ANGELES AND HOLLYWOOD SIGN!,"I visited Griffith Observatory just before dusk. It was a perfect time to go because I was able to enjoy the views while the sun was still out and was able to also enjoy the sunset. The vantage point was AWESOME! The panoramic views of the city and Hollywood sign were AMAZING! Being up so high as the sun set was SO BEAUTIFUL! If you love learning about astronomy, then you will love visiting Griffith Observatory. This place can get REALLY crowded so if driving, you may have difficulty finding a parking space, depending on the time of day you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oceanbreeze212
50,Stunning views of the land and the sky,The observatory itself is a work of art both inside and out. It has great exhibits that all ages can enjoy. Then there are the amazing panoramic views of LA. Parking is tough; you may have to hike a ways from where you can park your car. But it's worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393elainev
50,Great hiking and view,We visited here on Monday which observatory is closed. The view up there is super nice: clear see the iconic Hollywood sign and LA city. I enjoyed the hiking trail and liked flowers here. Parking is on meter and easy to find parking spot on Monday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feil675

50,Must see when you're in LA!,"The drive up is great, almost like we were on a mountain in CO! We saw deer frolicking and had great views all the way up! Once up there, you can take a pic with the iconic Hollywood sign in the background! The Observatory is a museum basically that is free (donations welcome but no pressure. Parking is on meters, fyi. We went all the way to the top parking lot. Some people were parking all along the hillside and walking but it would be a pretty nice trek, so wear correct shoes if you decide to hoof it.) One could spend hours there learning about the skies and stars and how we can see them! There's a planetarium there if you desire, and neat exhibits. But the view of the city of LA is just amazing! Walk out on back balcony for sweeping views of this nations 2nd largest city! I'm sure at night it is a sight to behold! (Observatory stays open until like 10pm some nights). Totally recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SummerR705
50,Excellent views,we parked by the Greek theater and left by 3pm so parking was free. there was a shuttle for .50 save you the walk up the hill and walking through tunnel with cars.

50,Stunning. Well worth it.,"So, this place was not a set location to explore for us. My husband and I were eating our way through LA. We like to float about and find ourselves in places discovered by steps unplanned. With Time to play & roam, we found ourselves here. For Free. Very impressive inside and the views from this grand place are truly spectacular. Science in its splendor & Nature in its glory. Well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aviana
50,Crazy Parking but Excellent,"The Observatory is being loved to death by locals and tourists but is a must see. The Planetarium show ""Center of the Universe"" was excellent. Chairs were amazing comfortable, suitable for snoozing in the dim room before the show starts. Recommend arriving 20 mins before observatory opens to get parking along roadway up the mtn or down the mtn ($4 per hr via pay stub generating kiosks) or parking at the top parking lot if available, If arriving later in the day, take the cheap shuttle ($1 or less) and park at the large outdoor theater parking lot. Recommend seeing the basement area and the 22 min Leonard Nimoy Theater documentary on the Observatory history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolangfo
50,Great view!,"Went up over night,just before closing time. Had a lovely view over LA in a decent atmosphere.Didn’t have time for the exhibits though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamn856
50,Views worth the hike,"Didnt go into the observatory (check the times before going) as wanted to go early morning. Did the walk up from Hollywood, but its quite a long way so make sure to wear comfy shoes and take plenty of water. Views from the top are worth it, you can see the entire city and you cab walk the perimeter of the observatory even when it isnt open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahfearnleyhalifax

40,Came here to find the Hollywood sign,"We came here to take photos of the Hollywood sign. When we visited, the place was SUPER packed, and we could not find parking, so it was disappointing. It looks like a nice place to spend an afternoon but the number of people here was discouraging. It takes some time to drive up here, too. So, if you don't have the patience or are looking for a quick stop on the way to another attraction - do NOT attempt to visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiewaa
50,Phenomenal views!,Great tourist spot with views that can’t be beat. You can make a day of it and hike several of the trails in the area or just drive up and park for a quick stop. The observatory is free but it costs $4 to park. You can see the Hollywood sign but there are better views of that off Mulholland Dr.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwcheryl
50,Griffith Park,Nice observatory and also has many hiking trails. You can even hike to Hollywood sign from here. Parking is $4 an hour. Park downhill for a free parking. You can either take a DASH up or walk up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimsT8632JU
40,Wait until you see the HD projection of an accurate representation of a starry night sky.,"Bearing in mind that I also experienced some blackout with the 4G LTE on top of the mountain, so if you're renting a car I should recommend getting a separate GPS unit as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeweyLe
30,Don't Talk About God,Amazing views and the park around it is awesome to see and the only way up here without a car is the dash observatory bus that seems to run every day starting at noon on weekdays and 10am on Saturday and Sunday starts from the sunset and Vermont station in LA. And ends at 10pm everyday.This is along with the Getty give you some of the best views of the city. There are also hiking trails around here as well the Greek Theater close by where they hold a lot of concerts. The inside is nice museum and is free and guide tours were free as well. Just be careful not to mention God or the bible as I did this not in terms of trying to be religious but because I herd there was a lot historically accurate in the Bible and want to know how they could claim the earth is billions of years old when the bible says it is only the world is thousands because I thought in science they try to look at all possibilities. Well this got me approached by 5 security guards and the manger telling me if I continued asking those kind of questions I would banned from there forever. I left after that. But that is why it is three instead of 5 stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheapbadtardtraveler
40,Star Party night is a must!,We took our kids to the Observatory for the Star Party Night. It’s completely free and amazing. There are over 20 telescoped to view the moon and it’s just a magical night. Parking is tough especially if there is a concert at the Ford theater nearby. But so worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaclynV_12
50,"The same on the outside, but definitely not on the the inside","The last time I had been here I was about 14 years old and now I am 74. I thought I should take my wife and let her experience all the wonderful things I had all those years ago. Nothing is ever the same when you go back years later. All the interactive machine that showed how earthquakes move the earth and all the fun things were gone. It is so much more now and it was so exciting to see all the changes and yes there are still things that are interactive. We had a wonderful time and saw so many wonderful things. Nothing upstairs seemed the same. As we went downstairs I kept saying that I did not remember a downstairs and definitely did not remember anything down stairs. The art work, if you can call it that, along the wall as you are walking down shows how the universe was created and how it is expanding. Great Job. We went into the Leonard Nemoy theater for a documentary and discovered why I did not recognize anything. The Planetarium was closed for 4 years while they lifted the whole building and built a huge basement under the existing building. Do not miss this show. If you come to L.A. or live here, it is definitely time to come and bring the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923BobG
50,Great view of LA,Directly located on the hilltop the Griffith Observatory really offers a great view of the City. I've visited at night and it shows you how massive Los Angeles actually is. Lights as far as you can look. Incredibly beautiful and stunning. Definitely a must see in Hollywood. The inside exhibition also is interesting and you get to know a bit more about astronomy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marconewman
40,What a view,"If you want the best view of Hollywood, Downtown L.A. and the Hollywood sign this is the place to go. The observatory is pretty amazing too.It is very popular though so traffic and parking can be a problem but if you don't mind a bit of a walk or waiting it is fine. They have people there to help with the traffic so it wasn't too bad.We went both during the day and at night both times were fantastic. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262catherineh
50,Truly Stunning,"All I can say is WOW! The drive to and view from the Griffith Observatory took my breath away. The building is absolutely stunning and is filled with free exhibits for the public. There are also films and demonstrations that you can attend for a fee, which we didn't choose to do, and we still felt the experience was absolutely worth it. Plus, there is a fantastic view of the Hollywood Sign. I'm a huge La La Land fan, and it was a blast to see some of the locations where they filmed this movie. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriamjean
50,Great view of the city,"Come during the night, the whole city is under the hills, just like the movie- la la land, so beautiful to see from the top of the hills,Inside, many interesting things to see, walk around and take your time , find a quite corner, enjoy the cool night air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cattloverss
50,"Crowded, but the view was worth the trip","We went on a Friday night. It was very crowded and it was tough to find parking. Take the bus up the hill. Walking was just too much. The views of downtown LA were breathtaking. And the view of the crescent moon at night was just brilliant. Even the Hollywood sign was lit up because there must have been filming going on. So, the sigh was clear and bright that night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripsrfun07

50,Highlight of LA,Out of all of the sights in LA - I would highly recommend this one - stunning views of the city at all times of the day even with overcast.Iconic locations that allow you to see panoramic views of LA and it's free.Parking tends to become more complicated throughout the day (as it gets busier and school trips arrive) so I recommend coming first thing or last thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JihunKim25
50,Must seen!,Great views of Los Angeles.Very interesting Observatory for the whole familyWe really enjoyed our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silvina80
50,Must see when in LA,"The Griffith Observatory is a great visit just for the views alone - superb view of the rest of LA! There is plenty to see inside the Observatory too, though it does get very crowded. It is also a bit tricky to get to but we took the metro to a station nearby and decided to hike up to the Observatory as it was a beautiful day - the hikes are great with the views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camchappers
40,the ONLY WORTH seeing thing is the SHOW,"The park is very simple, the museum is quite regular.However the show is amazing. I've been seeing Water show. It was like a fairy tale. I would like to highlight the lady who is telling the story, the voice, the way she tells make this experience magic. Unfortunately there was no box for tips, I would have been more than happy to appreciate it with the tips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlinaB2103

View entire city and Hollywood sign from here. Must visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badshahazam
50,Even on an Overcast day this was a beautiful view,"The Observatory does not open until noon on the weekdays & is closed on Monday. When if opens don't go through the front door go around the back no one is there & you can take a right & go right to where you need to buy the tickets for the Planetarium. We went to the showing of the ""Water is Life."" Very fun to see. Sit towards the back on the end in the center then you can see the entire sky. It cost $14 for two adults. We got to the park about 10am & the traffic was not to bad by then. We walked/ hiked & explored very nice area. Also I would not plan eating here bring something with you.Oh also if you Uber here the map will show that the Uber driver is frozen or went away don't cancel there is spotty cell service & your Uber driver is on their way. We had Verizon & it seemed to do pretty good service wise but a lot of people were struggling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redredles
40,Beautiful views,This place is difficult to get to on a budget. We took an uber from hollywood. Bout 30 dollars round trip. But it was worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41beckyk
50,Highlight of our trip!,We walked up to the Observatory from our hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Although a long walk it was definitely worth it. The views on the way up were amazing. The observatory itself was interesting and a great space for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller23001
50,Must See at least Once,"First, park at the base at the Greek Theater in the Mercedes-sponsored lot. It’s free. Then take the DASH up to the observatory; the stop is right across the street from the lot and costs 50 cents per person each way. You need the exact for yourself/your group.The Observatory will provide views of the Hollywood sign and the city, scenes from La La Land, the telescope...you won’t spend long but it’s definitely worth going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myzygy

40,Best view of LA,"The Observatory and Planetarium is a great place to visit if you are interested in astronomy. This iconic place is surrounded by hiking trails and offers great views of the City of Los Angeles, and the ""Holywood"" sign on the hill. Parking can be troublesome as there are many tourists in attendance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babalubj
40,Gorgeous biews,"What amazing views! One day for sight seeing this time while in the area and this was well worth it. Gorgeous views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Very busy on weekends-but if you manage to find a parking spot a shuttle will take you to the observatory for a small charge. The observatory itself is very cool too if you are into space and science related displays. There was a nice cafe with food and drinks also available on site. So glad we got to visit, I would love to go back at night to see the view with all the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanT80
50,View From the Top is Amazing,"I completely loved our time at the Griffith Observatory (GO)!Firstly, it is free to visit and you can spend as much time as you want there. So many cool and interesting out of world facts, superb view of LA and Hollywood sign (we unfortunately did not have clear blue skies, but nonetheless took lots of pictures there). What we missed was being there at sunset when I hear LA starts to light up beautifully!Definitely worth the trouble and time to go. Parking is a pain especially if you go during the weekends and on holidays but we were lucky as we did our visit during a weekday. There isn't a lot of parking spots at the actually parking area but lots along the road so if you find one, just go in and pay for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaylee272
50,Amazing views,"There were fantastic views over LA, educational displays and an awesome planetarium. The show in there was really great. It’s set in nature too. Just lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvitaKnits
50,Iconic - so amazing to see.,"We ended up hiking about 5 miles around the observatory, and enjoyed the cool morning breezes. I have to say, I find California so dry and brown now that I have lived in another greener state for the past 12 years, and therefore I would not say it was pretty. Strking, perhaps. We did see many people out on the trails, and loved seeing the snake with a small lizard in its mouth (a garter snake, not a rattler).Wonderful vistas on days with no clouds or smog (how often is that?)...great location. So many films shot here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaudraS

40,Get your exercise on this visit,"We visited on a weekday, but the parking was full, so we had to park on the road leading up the hill and hike the remainder of the way. The views are great. Lots to see inside and there is a presentation that you have to pay for. We did not do that. Took a number of pix and am glad I can finally say that I have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenrQ5924PJ
50,Breath taking views!,"There is so much to see and do here . Educational on the inside plus the beauty of nature on the outside. Great place to see the Hollywood sign if you didn’t want to make the hike (you can from here). At night, the city lights shine and the whole feel of the place is just enhanced! I suggest taking Lyft up as parking is at a premium. Cell reception is iffy so be sure to get on their WiFi. I’ve been here when they do allow you to picnic on the yards. This time it wasn’t allowed tho.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129colleena
50,Scenes in La La Land- Griffith Observatory,"I always enjoy going to Griffith Observatory. Besides the headache to find parking spot and beat the crowd.

Check the event and calendar before visit, and plan to watch the 4D show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gracecO4512QC
40,Great view of LA,Wonderful destination in Los Angeles. Take the 50 cent Dash Bus from the Vermont/Sunset Metro station. Interesting astronomy exhibits inside but the real attraction is the view of Los Angeles from the roof deck. Fantastic. You will recognize the view as many car commercials are made in that location. There are also hiking trails if that is of interest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben13224
40,Wish I have arrived earlier,"Nice place to visit. Loads of information so spare some time to learn a lot about the universe.Had the opportunity to look Jupiter from the telescope lens.Unfortunately, I arrived late but I am under the impression that Griffith is a very good place to watch the sunset and take pictures of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeaSR
40,Lovely views to explore!,"For me I had squeezed this on a very packed day but glad I went here.. took an Uber from WB studio tour and the place has lovely views.. even on a slightly cloudy day.. I was not able to explore the observatory in much detail but you could spend more time there. There was a lot of crowd on a Friday evening..You need to plan your travel if you are not on your own vehicle. No network there and the WiFi is patchy. Although I was able to book a cab, was not able to connect or find the same.. started walking down and after a long long walk reached a parking space with more humans in view.. managed to book an Uber from here and was back quick, just in time..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rituspace
40,An interesting place for kids and astrology lovers,"On my visit to LA, I requested my friend to take me to a place from where the HOLLYWOOD sign is visible and I want to take some pictures with this. He took me to this observatory. Though the sign is far away and not possible to take picture of self with the sign, the observatory itself is interesting. Astrology related facts are displayed with illustration, pictures, 3D modelling and in very understandable way. City view is great from the building. Unfortunately, parking is a problem but not severe. You can park your car far from the observatory and still can take hop on shuttle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Makshum

30,Don't go if it's rainy or foggy,There isn't much to see when it's foggy or raining. We could barely see the Hollywood sign and the building and exhibits were packed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelam71
40,Great exhibits,"The planetarium three shows were amazing as was the Nimoy historical movie. My favorite exhibit was that of the planets in the lower level where one could be weighed on each planet and see photos and videos of the planets. There were many interesting facts throughout the observatory, and the surrounding views were incredible. I would have given this five stars except for the cafeteria which was one star in the opinion of my group. For so many visitors, they were almost out of food and the food was not very good or fresh. There was hardly any workers there to help, and the food is highly priced. It is the only place to eat as there is nothing nearby and parking is difficult. Other than the cafeteria, the visit was well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyb558
50,Must do!,"If you live anywhere near LA or you are in Los Angeles, this is a must do. You get the whole city for sunset, beaming back at you! Park wherever you find it and enjoy the walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4x4surftours
50,Fascinating & Fun,We thoroughly enjoyed stopping here. I really recommend you take the Dash Observatory bus - it costs $1 and drops you off right in front. We saw so many people walking long distances plus paying for parking plus going back to pay more because they stayed longer than they paid for initially. We did the planetarium show (senior discount! ) saw the Tesla coil demonstration and watched the sunset on the camera obscure. Just fascinating!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture465502
50,It’s a Must!,"This is an astronomy class in a fun way! There is the biggest telescope, and it has different theaters where you can choose and Pick which show to see, and you become part of it, I loved it!The architecture of the Observatory is beautiful, it was recently remodel and you can see how they did it, in a video.Also you get a wonderful view of the HOLLYWOOD sign from that highEnjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyG76
40,Great views and free!,"Although we were there before it opened at 12, which was a shame, we survived the 1 mile walk up the hill from the car park to the observatory at the top. Brilliant views of the whole of LA, especially the Hollywood sign. Couldn’t get inside as too early so can’t comment but I suspect the shows and decor would have been worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erical167

50,MUST SEE SHOW,"The observatory is great, the view at sunset is sensational and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Totally recommend it for that alone. But for me, the highlight was the show. Only 5/7$ and one of the best half hours of my life - you recline in the chairs and feel as if you’re traveling through space. No experience like it. Worth the money and then some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18asiat
50,Great view for the Los Angeles traveler,"I haven't seen the movie ""La La Land"" but I didn't need to in order to make this stop a part of my 24-hr L.A. visit. The views are fantastic. The parking situation is a little tricky (the lot at the top of the hill seems to fill up easily) but if you give yourself enough time to enjoy the hillside, there are trails to hike and truly enjoy the natural surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renz124

Learned lots of new things about the outer space. Also interesting for yout kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeroenb561
50,Astronomy with a great city view,"You can get there by car directly. There is limited parking capacity, an hour parking cost 4usd. Better arrive before 11am, otherwise it will get very busy there.Even without buying tour tickets, its great stuff for young and old to explore inside the observatory. This place is also great to take pictures at day or night for a nice panoramic LA view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joergstravel

The parking areas get busy as the day plods on.Hiking is superb, great views of the Hollywood sign, great views of Los Angeles and Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thedistractedtourist
40,Stunning views,"We hiked the Mt Hollywood trail before going in here. Although the views were great, they were better from the trail. We were here on a Sunday morning, and it was very crowded. We did enjoy our time here, but liked the trail more",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rageisman
50,All about the stars and planets,"The Griffith Observatory is situated on a hill, inside the Griffith Park.Inside the observatory is a museum about space events. There you can see how move the Earth in the Solar System, the phases of the moon, the tides, the seasons.From the terrace you have a terrific panorama of the city of Los Angeles.Also, you can visit the telescopes of the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8837LLgabriela
40,2016,"This observatory is the one seen multiple times is TV and movies. Primarily you get here through driving, however you can make connections through the Metro and a wekend bus connection. The exhibits are usually of a cosmological nature and offer information of space exploration. If you want you can take a picture of the Hollywood sign. It is a nice stop if you are in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933reeds
50,A great sunset,"Arrived up to the Griffith Observatory for the sunset, could not park up the top so parked in the lower car park which if you are old is too far to walk up. So get there early. Views stunning, sunset stunning, building yes you’ve got it stunning and true Americana. Worthy of a visit for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NGER14
50,Most amazing views of LA from above,"It pays to have a local as your tour guide, and a film editor helps even more to get those special photo ops!Whether you hike the park to the observatory or just drive and park, you don’t want to miss these great views on your trip to LA. And stop by in Hollywood Land for other famous pics as the last pics here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913suzys
40,Busy but for a reason,"Actually drove up here and got a park at the top easy enough. You can walk from the bottom up but thats up to you.Views from the top are great of course, with views to the Hollywood sign, Hills and downtown areas.The observatory is great too, plenty of information to pour over inside detailing the what and how.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickb664
50,What a view!,"If you want the best view of the Hollywood sign then this is it. Parking can be a problem but we went during the week about 1130am and it was busy but we were able to get a park fairly easily. A lot of people were leaving so I’d imagine it’s busy first up in morning when it’s not as hot. It gets really REALLY hot, especially around midday so be sure to bring water, and wear sneakers there’s a lot of walking! It’s a good family day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicRay2016
50,"Nice spot to visit in LA, CA","While in Los Angeles, tourists should come and see this place. It's very informative and educational,specially for school age people. Parking is not so bad but check their schedule because sometimes there are large groups of students or tourists from another nearby cities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesjB7764PZ
50,Breathtaking views of the city at night!,"Breathtaking views of the city at night! The entire city lights up, wonderful date spot. The best part is.. it's all FREE. I get a kick out of the giant periodic table filled with real life examples of the elements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnitake
50,Go for the sunset,Incredible views from the Griffith Observatory at sunset. We drive up ourselves and paid for parking right outside the observatory. You don’t really get a great view of the Hollywood sign from here but the views of the city are great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L4418SZac
50,Lovely Place for lovers of science,This is a place for information and fun.Requires full day to completely enjoy this place.Very useful for young kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shariqueniazi
50,Great Sunday Fun!,We parked and took DASH for 50 cents up to the Observatory and saw The planetarium show. It was incredible!We saw the camera obscura in motion and the big telescopes and exhibits.We enjoyed a snack too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770nickis
30,Parking Difficult,Made it there but the parking was a nightmare so settled on a look - see if the outside across the canyon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazer695514
50,Great views.,This is an excellent place to see great views of the city and the planetarium is a lot of fun. There’s also a lot of history with the building of the observatory in the movies that were filmed there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbN4283YO
50,Fascinationg,Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to see everything - worth another visit. There was so much information inside the observatory and the surrounding views are spectacular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmac2003

50,Why did it take 6 trips to LA to see this?,"This place is truly beautiful and I wonder why it took multiple trips to LA to see this spot! The view is amazing and the main exhibit halls are free. The planetarium tickets are low cost and worth it. I could go into countless details, but suffice to say, if you are in the LA area and have a chance to see this jewel- do it. Caution- parking is at a premium. We parked on the lower portion of Griffith park and walked/hiked up to the observatory- probably a 15 minute walk, maybe a little more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexKutschke
40,Sightseeing trip,"It was 10.30am when we arrived. The day was very warm and, after finding a parking space, we had a 20 minute, up hill walk to reach the Observatory. Fantastic views across LA and beyond. I would recommend choosing a week day to visit or get there early to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slatts1234
50,Must See,I went at night and it was magnificent. The views of LA were amazing. They also had two telescopes set up for people to look into. They were looking at Jupiter and a star called Sirius. What a great experience. The next day I spoke to people that went during the day and after I told them about my experience they said they wished they went at night...I highly recommend going to the Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichiePort
50,Must-see when in LA,"Been here numerous times and if you love LA and the views from the top of the mountain, you'll appreciate this place. Inside is nice too, plenty to see. I usually go in the afternoon, after being inside the observatory, you can chill outside and watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustlivinglife
50,Glad we took this suggestion,Visiting the area for my great-nieces college graduation. She suggested the observatory as a must do. Glad we did. Awesome views of LA and surrounds from the park. Even got to take a peek at the telescope. Parking can be challenging. We luckily pulled right into spot as a family was leaving. It is a long hike for a senior from the over flow parking areas-you will want closer parking for them. Our multi age group of seniors and young adults all truly enjoyed ourselves. I recommend making time in your schedule to visit this gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/490elsiem
50,Beautiful,"This place is so calm, beautiful and interesting. You can mix science with well-being its so calm over there. I love the view of LA outside, just like the movie La La Land. I wish i can return there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarakells
50,Great place to learn abour space and science,"Beautiful view of L.A. Love the displays, very interactive and neatly done. Will definitely visit again. Tip: Take the observatory shuttle to get there if not driving. It comes about every 30mins from sunset blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Latoyaa1
40,Always Worth a Visit,"This is a gem of a place that is always worth a visit. Generally you should be prepared to see a crowd, which often means you will have to park away from the Observatory and then walk (uphill) to the entry. Even if you are not planning to visit any of the exhibits it is worth a visit. Take the time to walk all around the Observatory and the grounds and enjoy the great views afforded from this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAWH77
40,"Great Views, Crowded, Impossible Parking","We've been visiting the Griffith Observatory almost on a yearly basis (whenever we travel to the LA region). Every year, the parking seems to have become worse, with the only spaces available a mile down the road. All the exhibits and the halls and open lawn areas are packed with visitors. The exhibits and the pendulum remain fascinating as always and the view is awe inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barzinji
50,Free & great views,"Great views all over the city, and free to go in (you have to pay to go in the planetarium) but worth visiting. If you are relying on public transport you can get a bus outside Vermont/Sunset Metro Red Line station which only costs a dollar for a return ticket. Definitely worth a visit to get pictures of the Hollywood sign and look out over the City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jholiday1996
50,Fascinating,"A surprise, not just for the history (both scientific and filmic - has been the backdrop in many famous movies) but also for the huge variety of activities and displays. Be prepared for a long walk, had to park a long way down the hill (all meter parking at $4 an hour - make sure you allow walking time in the amount you pay). One would hope that they put the parking money towards some decent footpaths, it’s a long way up the hill and currently very uneven dirt trails (or walk on the road but it’s quite busy) if you have someone in a wheelchair or a disability it will be hard going. The actual observatory is amazing with some of the best views of LA and the Hollywood Sign you’ll find - get your tickets just inside the main entrance for the planetarium - a must do. Everything but the shows is free, you could spend hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lookinoutallover
50,free! & lots to see,"One of our favorite parts of LA. Free to visit, like the rest of the park. Can easily spend a few hours exploring the exhibits and soaking up all the info on planets, meteorites, our sun and more. Great views of the city from outside as well. Plan to do some walking though. Go at night to get a view through the telescope!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandafZ1511GQ
50,One of my Favorite spots in LA,"Griffith Observatory and Park are beautiful we hiked the park then walked into the Observatory. I highly recommend visiting during the sunset, the views are awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728melissaq
50,Well worth a visit - Good views of the Hollywood Sign,"Free parking at the theater - a slow, relaxed walk up the hill to the observatory. Spectacular views of the Holllywood sign and the rest of LA. Inside the Observatory itself lots of interesting artifacts and information relating to astronomy. Well worth a visit for spectacular views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveGoldswain
50,Must-see in LA!,Great views of the Hollywood Sign and at least 180 degree views of the city. Perfect for tourists - especially if you like to walk/hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateTynan
50,Looking into the Stars,Thank you everybody who provide this place to the public. It has a great location in Los Angeles. The visitors have amazing and unforgettable time at this observatory. If you have extra 2 hours it is enough to arrive and see. Strongly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esrakaratay
50,Educational Offerings and Awesome Views,"The Griffith Observatory was very educational; much more than I expected. Most of the offerings are free and there is an awesome view of LA and the Hollywood sign. As you walk around the Observatory, there are staff here and there explaining displays or giving demonstrations. We took the Dash (bus) to the Observatory, which made our visit so much easier than parking (which others have said costs and has a time limit). The Dash drops you off right at the Observatory and, when you are ready to leave, you just jump on another one. I for get the exact cost, but it was less than a dollar. The Griffith Observatory is a must see while you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaS419
50,A must see!,Awesome views and very educational.Don't miss this on your trip to L.A.Definitely worth the drive.LA LA Land was filmed there.Weekdays are less busy than weekends.At the top of a hill.Park as close to the top as you can get unless you like to walk and climb.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smowery7
40,Not as good as Griffith Park itself,"I'm surprised the observatory in Griffith Park is ranked higher than the park itself as I found the park to be incredible and the observatory to just be okay. The views from the observatory, whilst excellent, are nowhere near as good as the views you will get if you take some of the trails through Griffith Park. Even if you only walk for around an hour you will get unbelievable views of LA, the observatory itself and the Hollywood sign from Griffith Park. The observatory doesn't offer quite as good views.That being said, the observatory does offer great views at sunset (see photo), so I would recommend spending some time walking around Griffith Park before sunset, then walking back down to the observatory itself for the sunset.The observatory itself is interesting and considering it's free you can't complain. I didn't spend too long walking around as I've been to numerous observatories in my time and most have been better than this one.If it wasn't for the trails of Griffith Park nearby I wouldn't go back to the observatory again, so in my opinion Griffith Park has to be 5* while the observatory only 4*.As a tip, I advise anybody to take the Observatory Dash bus to the observatory. It costs just $0.35 each way and takes you right to the observatory. The amount of people I saw trying (and failing) to find a parking space, only then having to park waaaaay down the hill and walking all the way back up, was insane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewK508
50,Amazing night view,Totally amazing night view that I got from the Observatory. walked around for at least an hour seeing the view. Would of liked to have gone in day but ran out of time on my trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyS4659
50,Mr A,"One of the spots of LA, good view over city, free parking before 12pm, nice walks around. Great location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrelF6596MB
40,Closed on Mondays,"We visited the Observatory while in LA but learned it was closed on Monday's. You can still drive up and park and get views from outside, but cannot go inside the Observatory. On a clear day the views are well worth it, but was pretty smoggy on the day we were there. I would still recommend a visit - it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam1010
40,A chance visit to the Griffith,"We decided to drive up the hills to see the Hollywood sign and when we got to the top, there was the Griffith Observatory. We stayed only 30 minutes on a warm, sunny afternoon, to look out at the city from the roof and see the telescope used for star-gazing....parking was only $4!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pastorbob_12
50,Don't make my mistake,"My husband and his brother had a late visit to the Griffith observatory right after we saw a sunset and the Hollywood sign. We got there around 20:50 and the only thing i dreamt of was to see a movie about the universe at the planetarium...and we missed it for 5 minutes(((So for you to know the last movie on Saturdays starts at 20:45. And you'd better come in advance.Anyway we walked around, saw some nice educative exhibits about our universe and stars, watched the spectacular view of a night LA from the roof and saw the Tesla coil in action (they start it every 30 minutes. It was pretty awesome. The last one is at 21:30.The whole place closes at 22:00.The observatory has a parking lot.It cost 4 dollars for 1 hour and it is 2 minutes walking from the car to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733svetas
50,Excellent View,"The view of the Hollywood sign is excellent. The view of the city is also excellent. There is a fee to park, but it is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctombs1
50,Great views all over LA.,"This is well worth a visit if you are visiting LA. There are fantastic views all over LA. There were really interesting exhibits inside, but we ran out of time on our ticket (you pay when you park, and we didn't kinow how long it would take to visit - my tip would be to pay for longer than you think you will need!). Great giftshop too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elsiemleedsUK
50,The best views in LA,This is the best place if you want to get a clear view from the PCH all the way to downtown LA. Pack walking appropriate shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLocalSquire
50,Griffith Observatory,"This is a must see place in LA that is intersting, filled with great science and space information and we were able to see Venus through the giant telescope. The views over LA from up here are excellent and you get to see the Hollywood sign too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gjavirge
50,Fun for everyone,"Stargazers, movie fans, kids, adults, everyone....come here! It's a beautiful location and the Observatory itself is fascinating and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
50,Beautiful day trip,"Amazing view of Hollywood and Los Angeles , great hiking and an area for children to run and be free. The observatory is a good place to talk to your children about science stars and space! Really nice day trip that makes beautiful memories and pics",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliaa423
50,Very interesting place to visit,"This place is worth the drive up the hill. This place provides a lot of information about astronomy and the cosmos. They have a lot of exhibits with videos to give a real experience in understanding our thangs have evolved over the years in space. There is parking up there but could fill up fast so you may have to walk up the hill, or take a tour and ride the bus up just as good. The view is crazy of the town and the hollywood sign almost eye level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VinceJ2010
40,Excellent views of LA,Excellent views of the city and the Hollywood sign from the observatory. Parking on weekends is a challenge. We took a taxi and were allowed right into the observatory and the taxi driver waited for us without charging extra!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eve212015
50,A must to visit if you are in LA,"The Griffith Observatory delivers one of the most pragmatic views of the City of Angeles, not just from the observatory to downtown but from other parts of the park where the observatory is your subject.You also have the option to go onto a hike from the observatory itself towards the Hollywood Sign which takes about 1.5 hours each way. If you decide to do it, you will snap here one of the most beautiful pictures from your trip to LA, the observatory with downtown on the background.Visiting the observatory and the Park in general is free of charge.I recommend visiting it either early enough so you could capture great sunrise pictures(park opens at 5 am, not the observatory though) or during the golden hour for amazing twilight captures. Park and observatory are open until 10pm.Hope you enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1899IMfrankg
50,Amazing views and awesome air,"If you visited Los Angeles in a high smog day you probably want to go up to the observatory to clean your lungs. If it is low smog you will enjoy amazing views. Awesome opportunity for trail walking, star gazing or just plain old walking and enjoying. Word of caution ... it can get a little cold and windy .. but it is an awesome .. must visit place.. parking is paid but reasonable... $4/hour... highly recommended .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mihais55
50,SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE,"We went to the Observatory with a wide age range. Everyone had a wonderful time. A lot of thought went into making it a fun experience for children, teens (yes even teens) and adults. First of all if you are new to the area the view is worth the trip alone. Inside is a marvel of the universe but made for the everyday person. Plan on a few hours here because there is a lot to do. And have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sportsmaven
50,Always great to be outside,"This park on top of the hill is breath taking. I parked downhill and walked uphill, great exercise. This is a perfect venue for everyone especially family. Very educational venue with the Hollywood sign in the background",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrishS_Traveler
50,Nice spot to take picture!,"I went to Griffth Observatory in Mar. This place was really good with who are interested in space, stars, etc.From this place, you will see the Hollywood sign and LA city. It is a good spot to take pictures!I'm recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rungthamp
50,Great Views,We were very lucky to get great views. We got there earlier and it really paid off. Parking was easy and it was not busy. We felt like we had the place to ourselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4rinepetrovna
40,Great view,Great view of LA and the Hollywood sign. Still quite a distance from the sign but still great for photos. The observatory itself is still worth a look and very impressive from the outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snakedoctor321983
50,Fantastic!,We had a great time here. Our only regret was that we didn't have more time! We spent most of our time at the observatory which was incredible. So much to see and great staff to explain. We had a late start and ran out of time to see the Autry Museum and Zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goneinaheartbeat
40,Hollywood sign viewing,My sister and I drove up to the Griffith observatory to view the Hollywood sign and see downtown LA. Very pretty up there and lots of parking and trail signs for hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327annetter
40,"When timed well, this is a great place to visit","We drove up at around 3pm in order to beat the sunset crowd and get parking. We were successful! What would be useful is if they had some sort of sign on the way up, letting you know if there was still parking available at the top. If you make the turn to go up there and there is no parking, you're going to be forced to drive past and back down again. Anyway, enough about the parking...this is definitely a place for science geeks, astronomy fans, or people who just want that perfect shot of the Hollywood sign. The views of the sign are great, as are the views of LA. The sunset, in my mind, wasn't as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be, but it does provide excellent lighting for shots of the observatory itself. Inside, there is a lot of science...I got a bit bored of reading. I wish there was an easier way to learn, as I found a lot of the educational aspects a bit over my head. Maybe a guided tour would be helpful. I found it a bit difficult to know what to do when I arrived, and there really wasn't anyone greeting people and letting them know how to make the most of their visit. That said, you can pick and choose what you want to see and learn about, and it's all free except the shows, so just dive in and enjoy I guess. I regret not staying later (until after dark) to get a chance to view the telescope, but as I said, I got bored of the science and couldn't kill any more time to wait for dark. The place was packed with people, and gets really crazy at sunset so the second the sun was down, we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cate13
50,Beautiful hike and great museum,"We hiked up to the Griffith Observatory with our 6 year old. We went on a Friday afternoon and it was quite busy. We parked for free in Ferndell Park (at the bottom of the hill leading up to the Observatory). The trail was lovely and well maintained but steep on the way up. The views were extraordinary, particularly the view of the Hollywood sign. The Observatory itself was much better than I had anticipated with interesting exhibits and a theater as well as a shop and cafe. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend this experience. If you are hiking, make sure to wear appropriate shoes and bring water. The trail is not paved and there isn’t much shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98haleyj
50,Great views of area and science to boot!,Earth day visit with teenage daughter. Wonderful views of LA and surrounds. Museum exhibits were interesting and even engaged the teenager! Nice gift shop. Made this science nerd happy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tami13077

We spent almost 4 hours there, enjoyed the view and manage to get a picture with the Hollywood sign. Public parking is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeylow23
50,Crowded but fantastic views,"Recently they have fixed the parking problem by making a one way loop, this is fantastic but now you need to pay 4 bucks an hour.Even so, I think this is one of the best places to see the city and get a feel of the immense scale of this city. Be sure to be there way before sunset to get a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fdg1337
40,Hiking & thinking,"Great views! you can either drive to the top or hike it! if you’re on vaycay, enjoy the walk! you’ll save money & have a great view of Los Angeles. There is a “ Café “ but I recommend bringing your own snacks, it’s over priced for the products that are there. The staff is super nice though! The gift shop is really cute! The employees are helpful if you have questions. Obviously recommend this for science fans or architecture fans - and if you wanna enjoy the view. You can also see the Hollywood sign from there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferlynnc2016
50,Stellar views!,"Absolutely stunning experience. Among all city attractions this one has earned its place as one of the premier tourist attractions in L.A. The place is perfect, seriously. It has such unique vibe, both during the day and at night. It is hard to describe. Simply the quintessence of Los Angeles. Legendary architecture and stunning views. I felt like a movie star when my Uber dropped me off at the Griffith Observatory. What a romantic place! The view of downtown L.A. is breathtaking as well as the view of the Hollywood sign. There is so much to learn from this place. Basement level is occupied by interesting exhibition regarding planets, solar system, meteors, etc. The surrounding area is also highly recommended. On a beautiful day, this is a great place to run, walk, or have a picnic. You should definitely visit this place before and after sunset. Admission is free! I didn't see any paid show and still my experience was five star. It's well worth the trip to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acidov
50,City of Stars,Simply brilliant. It only cost a dollar to get to and from the observatory from Sunset and Vermont on a regular bus service. It can get quite busy so be prepared to allow extra time.The views from the top were breathtaking of Los Angeles below and the Hollywood sign on the hills above. The inside of the observatory was really interesting too. I highly recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846deang
50,Cheap and free!,"I hiked to the place, so it was free to enter. The scenery is beauitful, the museum is well maintained for the amount of traffic they get, and the cafe is...just okay. I've gone 3 times now kay for some good pictures of the sunset, and a teaching picnic on the front lawn!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstorc
50,The Show was Amazing,"I was surprised that the observatory is a cheap Uber ride away. It seemed for the hour… The visit and the view it’s self was fine. Of course seeing the Hollywood sign up close it’s pretty cool. And the valley is beautiful. I did not have enough time to do that hike but I saw the trail and it is fantastic. I would return for this trail....Now what I really really really enjoyed was the show. I did not know what to expect, and it was very engaging very special and just log/short enough. Show is 7$ and entrance is free. What more can you wish for.Quite happy that I made the time to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239nadinel
20,Frustrating,"After driving well out of our way to get there, we were unable to even reach the observatory due to their being a 5 hour wait to be able to park and get inside. Not nearly enough parking or workers for the amount of visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaronTip
50,Wonderful view,Visited observatory 2 times - during day and night. Both times the view is wonderful! Panoramic view of LA and off course Hollywood sign. Worth visiting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZygimantasG

50,View and Cool!,"Landing in LA we decided we didn’t want to do Hollywood or anything remotely similar, so we chose the observatory. BEST CHOICE! It was super busy, but that didn’t really matter. It was super interesting and the views were also incredible. Wayyyy better than the cheesy hollywood stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyness67
50,Great place!,"Great place to visit!My mom and I went here during our California trip. The weather was great!Amazing views of Hollywood sign. Cool sights to see at observatory. We took an uber from our hotel in Hollywood then we walked down the spiraling road and caught an uber back at the Griffith Park entrance.Cafe has a good food selection - sandwiches, salad bar, hot food bar, salads that are pre-made.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CourtneyandScott
50,Amazing views,"We knew the Observatory opens at mid-day. We didn't plan to go in anyway, so we got there early. I'm glad we did so, because the parking is difficult. But parking fee is cheap.Griffith Observatory is truly one of the best spot to see the Hollywood Sign! It's still a little far to capture on camera. Still amazing.We walked around the Observatory in stunning weather. LA downtown was in sight. I bet it would be amazing during the evening too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason526
40,Great view,"We took the DASH bus up the mountain. Parking is awful then you have to hike up. Saw many people in distress trying to walk up after parking down below.Wonderful view. Worth the effort to get there. You can also go in the observatory and learn about the planets and solar system if you want. That is free. They also have shows you can pay for but we did not go.From taking the bus up, seeing the view and coming down it was a little over an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ned14
30,Beautiful view of the city,I would recommend this place if you want to see a panoramic view of the city rather than the Hollywood sign. The Hollywood sign still looks pretty tiny and people won't really notice the sign if you take a photo with the sign in the background. Go during sunset to enjoy the beautiful colors in the sky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fehminaa2015
50,"Beautiful place, good view of city and interesting science centre.","Beautiful building on top of a massive hill. Can see LA for miles and good view of the Hollywood sign.

Worth the drive up and on a clear day the view of the surrounding area is fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eastcoaster101
50,Amazing place to watch the sun go down,"My favourite place from my trip to LA. It gets busy at sundown as it's such a perfect spot with breath taking views over this sprawling city and the HOLLYWOOD sign. You can drive right up and park on the road, there are parking meters. A must for any LA visit, love to go back and spend more time exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774yvonnef
50,Interesting place and nice views!,If you are visiting Los Angeles you should visit Griffith Observatory. This Place is super interesting if you are into science. You get here by dash or by car. Ofcourse you can also walk. 😉 Views from the observatory are gorgeous if the day is clear.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mervilaitinen047
40,Day visit...... Great!!!!,"Even though we went during the day, it was absolutely great!!! To start with it was FREE!!!! In this day and age of tourism its rare to get anything for free so this was a nice surprise.Do not park up the top, park near the Greek theatre and walk up, its not that tough and its a great walk with great views.When you get there, pay the $7 to see the Planetarium Show, its brilliant. These people clearly care about there science and do it justice. You will leave wanting to change careers and become an astronomer or a professor of HPS!!!The views of the Hollywood sign are second to none and the building itself just make you want to sit there and look into the distance and lose yourself.Highly recommend to all visitors to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sifterboy
50,Great free view of the Hollywood sign,"As someone who just wanted to have seem the Hollywood sign, and not really needed to get super up close, this was perfect.

50,Day trippin must see,"Go see the Tesla experiment that’s scheduled every few hours, it’s quite the site to see. Electricity everywhere !such a cool place! It’s totally free (except for parking if you don’t enjoy walking too much) (also if you want to see planetarium show it’s like $7)Has beauty, education, sites, history, and nature all in one place.Great to hike around the parks and mountains , walk around the observatory itself, learn about the sky and space, and meet other fellow minded travelers/locals!This is a staple in where I bring my visiting LA guests day OR night.Greet angle to get shots of the Hollywood sign.Guarantee happy experience no matter what or who you are and what you’re looking for! Fun for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaynaC_13

50,"Amazing place, amazing view !",The place looks like it is taken from a fairy tale. You can spot an amazing view over the City of Angels. It is very close to the Hollywood sign. The projected shows are amazing. There is also a little restaurant there but more like a canteen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7424UGmariap
50,Hiking Observatory and Hollywood sign,"Observatory itself is a very nice place to visit and kids like it too. There is great view over the city as well as towards the Hollywood sign, but to really see that big enough you should go there. Taking at least water with you it will be a nice half day trip to walk up the hill to observatory and then trough Griffith park to the Hollywood sign. Underneath the sing you get a very nice pictures that you were in Hollywood if didn't already at the walk of fame. Coming down towards the city from the sing also gets you a view of local housing. That is different to what you saw going uphill from underneath the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomiJ
30,Long bus ride and it's average at best,"We went to Observatory and, frankly, it's a long and cold bus ride for not that much at the end of it. It was mildly interesting but I wouldn't rush to do this again. The bus stop/parking area was absolutely packed and the busses seemed to run to a schedule that was all of their own. Maybe it was just too much at the end of a long day sightseeing, but I didn't overly enjoy this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodidella
40,City of lights!,We visited at dusk to see the sun set and the night lights over LA and it didn’t disappoint with great views and a nice museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949tg

40,Lots of learning and great views!,"Can’t believe it took us multiple visits to LA to check this place out. Great opportunities to learn about astronomy and to enjoy some of the greatest views of the city. We Ubered there. The signal wasn’t great up there, so it was a bit of a challenge getting back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickledorigins
40,The views are incredible!,This is just the best place to look out over the LA area. The breeze is fantastic up here. There are tons of education exhibits to look at. And it’s FREE! Awesome place to go when visiting LA or just take your kids for a day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesarahbella
50,The best free thing to do in LA without doubt!,"Go late afternoon, check there’s nothing playing at the Greek Theatre (or you can’t park!), park in the Theatre car park and walk up the hill - the view of the Observatory and ‘Hollywood ‘ sign are fantastic.Once you’ve taken your photos, go inside and explore the fascinating exhibits manned by knowledgable volunteers. All free!Book for the early evening show ($7 per person) and after the show you step out onto the terrace....WOW (see photo which doesn’t do it justice!).The most amazing place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iantI2320NW
50,Exceptional park to get away from the hustle an bustle of LA.,Stunning park and observatory and if you want views of LA then this is a must see. Great planetarium which was a great experience in itself. Completely free to just walk around take a picnic or even go for a little hike in the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377daleb

50,Great views,Great views of LA including the hollywood sign. Also some cool exhibits. My favorite was the model of the solar system. We had to park a ways a way and take a shuttle but the observatory itself is free in a city where it seems everything is expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynn_from_WI

50,Amazing views and a deeply historic LA attraction,The Griffith Observatory is a Los Angeles landmark attraction. The grounds and facilities are amazing. The views from the park and from the balconies are spectacular. The line to look through the telescope is long but well worth the wait. Plus you can meet a few cool people while you wait. There are exhibits all throughout the main facility which are cool and fascinating. This is one of the must see places in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WizardToby

30,Ok,The views of the city are sick. However it's really no different from other planatariums I've been too. The Hollywood sign isn't super close and you'd have to hike to get to it. Also very spotty phone servixe so keep that in mind if you need uber.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittneyLikeSpears
50,A must see,We visited this initially to get a great view of the Hollywood sign. We were overwhelmed when we saw the observatory. It was quite a hike to the top but well worth it. The observatory is a beautiful building with amazing views of Hollywood and L.A. The space exhibit was incredible and very informative. The restaurant was lovely too with great food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVlincs
50,Fabulous views and scenery,"We visited the griffith observatory on our final day and after a long walk having parked the car at the next available space, we ventured up a long hill. The journey was definitely worth the trip the views are fantastic and we also went to one of the planetarium shows, which cost 7$, the lady who hosted the show was excellent, very knowledgeable and the loveliest voice your ever hear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1242DLnicolas
50,Stunning views,If your looking for some stunning views of LA and the Hollywood sign visit here. As a bonus the observatory is full of interesting and interactive displays were you can explore the solar system and perhaps learn a thing or two. The whole park below is also amazing and if you are feeling energetic you can hike through it including up to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834shaned
10,Poor show not advising opening hours,After paying for 2 hours parking the place was not opened at 10.30am. Had to Google to find out it wasn't opened until 12.00. No signs to advise...not happy. Poor show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulad866
40,Fabulous views great art decor building,We came here last week on our recent visit to la. The attraction is free as we had picked a funny afternoon at weekend to go so did everyone else do parking was a pSin we has to park in the road and walk for around 25 mins to get to the observatory but it was worth it.The views are fab and there are several viewing areas good views if holly wood la and beyond.Very interesting points for star buffs and Astronomers alike and all free to see. Take a picnic you can walk around the surrounding hills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosewarr1106
50,Amazing Views,We stopped by to walk around the outside of the Observatory. Amazing views from all sides. Well worth the stop when you are in the area.. Can see the whole LA city line and the Hollywood Sign plus all the other views..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationAdam
40,Worth a special trip,"Enjoyed the great summit views.Parking in midweek was easier than anticipated, though pricey.Went to the Planetarium show. This was quite interesting though somewhat exaggerated in its own awesomeness",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG897
50,"Awesome views, Tesla coil, camera obscura, planetarium","This is a must visit if you're in LA. To explore properly you need at least half a day. Reach there between 3:30pm to 4:00pm and explore everything there in the next 3hrs to 4hrs including catching a show at the observatory and the Tesla coil demonstration in action. In case you're not interested in science, no worries at all, you may enjoy the stunning views of the city during daylight and see it completely change the mood when the sun goes down and the city lits up. Make sure to visit on a sunny day with clear sky for the views. For the big screen fans, the Hollywood sign too can be seen from here during daytime. If you want to explore the park too, you might need to spend an entire day. Do carry 50cents change for each side per person if you take the electric bus to get in and out of the park to catch the metro, I did not see any other public transportation apart from this bus to reach here and they don't accept Tap cards. There's always a line for tickets to the planetarium and it gets filled fast, tickets are available only at the venue, no online bookings, try to get a seat towards the back once you're inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767abhishekd
50,My favorite spot in LA. Period.,"I'm biased, as an amateur astronomer, photographer and science-lover, Griffith Observatory just brings it all together for me. Since the renovation some years back the exhibit space is large enough to make the visits less painless and the new theater allows for more special events. The grounds are fantastic and there is no other easily-accessible location in Los Angeles with similar views.Entry is free, but planetarium shows have a charge. On evenings when the sky is clear, docents set up telescopes on the lawn for you to use. The view from these (modern) scopes is often better than can be had from the ""main"" refractor installed in the observatory dome.In addition, the observatory is just a beautiful building, especially at night. It's one of my favorite buildings to photograph at any time and in any weather.Parking is challenging, especially weekend evenings, evenings during tourist season, evenings when the weather is good, and generally on evenings. Better to take a DASH bus (50 cents) from either the parking lot near the Greek Theater or the Hollywood/Highland complex. If you do drive, expect to take some time finding a space to park and you may park on one of the roads a good distance from the observatory. For this, you will pay $4 per vehicle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgO2056FX
30,Ok,It’s really good however the cafe was half empty and was really busy so unable to view the telescope,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthew122777
50,A wonderful spot in LA,"Griffith is always a busy spot in LA, you better go there early if you want to park near by the Observatory. Before you go inside, walk around and enjoy the view, you can see Hollywood sign from here. Here is totally free and doesn't need to make a reservation. Only if you want to watch the show you have to pay it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katy840306
50,Plan ahead,We were unable to get to the observatory because of the crowds. So recommend you go there way before the openingCars were parked everywhere. Many walked a great distance uphill to get there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobKava
50,Must see,"Must see attraction in Los angles. Free entrance but the parking cost 4 $ per hour.Park anywhere on the road side and pay to the machine.Great well presented place, included awesome thing and many useful information.Great view of Hollywood and Hollywood sing.Highly recommended, don’t miss this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imohddashti
50,great views,We had a great time here. Parking can be a little tricky but we quickly wished that we had more than an hour. There are fantastic views all around the observatory where you can see the city. The observatory itself was also quite interesting. Lots of great information and a fun gift shop. A very good place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryr50
40,A fantastic place for everyone !,"While in the area we decided to try this location on a weekend day, just after lunch time. BAD MOVE! no place to park for miles. Next day we try again and this time come in from the Los FEZ entrance to Griffith Park. We begin our driving assent at 1130a. ( this date the observatory opened at 12 noon). This road is more direct than the other route that winds for a while up into the holly wood hills. We approach the Greek theater that offers parking and a shuttle ride to the top for 50 cents. We roll past the traffic safety people in an attempt to park at the top next to the observatory. We starting climbing to the top and observe many people parking at the on street, metered parking. ($4/HR, I RECOMMEND A CREDIT OR DEBT CARD )Folks, this parking is for walking the trails of the park ( which is fun safe and very pretty), and walking to the top, strait up hill to the observatory. We arrive at the top and grab one of two spots left. This is paid parking only at $4 /Hr. SO before I go any further, please note that arriving 45- 60 minutes early is helpful, especially in you want or need top of the mountain parking AND want to get tickets to the planetarium when the Observatory opens. Please note there are only 112 parking spots at the top, 6-8 handicap spots for California handicap placards that still valid ( be prepared to show the handicap id card and you may be inspected for the use of the card to ensure the handicapped person is in your car). Motorcycles have a parking area also with room for approx 8- 10 motors.The grounds are impeccably kept and throngs of school children have great fun on the main lawn area. Once you enter, the tickets for the planetarium are located at customer service to the left of the main doors. Within minutes of opening, the line for the tickets may have 50 -60 people waiting. The exhibits offer something for everyone. There are three levels inside and the outside of the building offers a few different viewing levels including the roof top level. A gift shop leads out to a nice cafe with a indoor outdoor feel. The Tesla coil is worth hanging out for. We spent a few hours on the grounds and really enjoyed the displays and the over all property. NOTE* if you cannot see the observatory or the ""Hollywood "" sign you may want to wait until you get a clear weather day. Arrive early, wear comfortable footwear and clothing and do not forget to take plenty of pics. Lastly, when leaving the building you will see a unique tower with many historic people featured. If the sun is out you can make use of the very accurate sun dial located between the observatory and the statute. This is a great tool for kids to see how accurate time can be read without looking at a cell phone or digital watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerseybob175
50,"Crowded, but worth it","Visiting Griffith Observatory at sunset is truly a unique experience. As long as you can tolerate the crowds, both in the roads/parking lot and around the observatory itself, it’s something you should make time to see. The historic building itself is beautiful, but the views of the city are breathtaking. Parking can be a challenge (metered along the side of the road and in the parking lots), and there are often traffic jams leading to the observatory around sunset, so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gooseboy54481
50,"Take a hike, Buddy!","There’s a trail at the bottom of Griffith Park and if you take the path that starts off by the creek, you’ll be in for a treat. It leads to the top of the observatory and then to the Hollywood sign. Get out there and experience this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5648HBjamesd
50,Fun afternoon with the kids.,Great view of LA! But more important it's the starting point for a 6 mile hike that gets you up close and personal to the Hollywood sign. Pretty busy on the day we were there and parking looked like a mess. Highly suggest Uber to get there and avoid that craziness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/07travelchick

50,Amazing and Amazingly crowded,"We went on a Sunday evening for sunset- Took the bus from the lower parking areas- .50 each way- a total bargain. They really should have a separate lane for the buses- you do end up sitting in traffic on the short ride up the hill. Wish it hadn't been so crowded, I mean shoulder to shoulder in the Observatory, lines for everything- but we found the highlights and I am glad we saw it. Especially enjoyed the Tesla Coil demonstration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pauliepalmz

40,Great cheap day out,"Went here on my first day in LA we parked down the hill for free it was a bit of a climb but really worth it for the views. Lovely spot for the kids and adults. There is a cafeteria which was a little expensive but a good choose of food brought on weight on your plate. I believe that the observatory is not open everyday, I went on a Sunday which was Busy with the locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spice2uk
50,Great place to see vistas of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign,"Griffith Observatory is located at the top of a hill within Griffith park. It is free, so you cant beat the price. They have a few science exhibits regarding the planets and space exploration. The exhibits themselves are not super fancy, but they were interesting.I went on a Saturday afternoon when it was quite busy. Signs warned us that parking areas at the observatory were full, so we parked at the base of Griffith park where there was plenty of space, and took the ""Dash"" bus, which is a public transport bus that runs every 10-15 min or so, for 50 cents a person, it will take you up to the top, and later back down to the base. You could walk from the base instead, but it may take 10 -15 min, and its mostly uphill on the way there.Once you get there, you get good views of the skyline of downtown LA, and the Hollywood sign. Additionally, there are numerous hiking trails you can take that start at the observatory... we did a short one and it was a lot of fun, you can see some of the interesting architecture in the nearby homes. Furthermore there are restrooms and a small cafe where you can get snacks and drinks... In a town where lots of stuff is expensive, this is one place you can go and spend a few hours without spending too much $$$. Definitely recommend if you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2768TRmikek
50,Great Quick View of LA for low cost,"It's a great view of the Hollywood Sign. I recommend parking down by the Greek Theatre and getting on the bus (costs 50 cents each way) up to the top. It's extremely easy. If you drive up to the paid parking ($4), you'll have an uphill walk. Much better to take the cheap bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethesdaMomof5
40,Very nice introduction to astronomy,"Very good place to bring your kids (or Masters of Arts) to learn basics of astronomy, exhibition is very good and all phenomenas are well explained. Busy on weekends, but it should not discourage from visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Nobody_1979
50,Spectacular view of LA,Most romantic park in all of Los Angeles. Fantastic views. Observatory is super cool. Perfect for dates. Steep in cinematic history. One can't help but think of Lalaland or Rebel Without A Cause when visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dod2015
40,Easter Sun was jam packed,"Everybody had the same great idea we did! Parking was full by 10am; we drove up the hill just to drive back down the other side in search of street parking. The walk back up was nice but it was hot and my third grader was jetlagged and unprepared. Once up the hill, the observatory was amazing and the other humans were . . . enthusiastically rude and selfish, I'm sorry to say. Nobody seemed to remember how to queue for a bathroom or anything else. My husband was asked to take somebody's picture. He is good natured and agreed, only to discover it wasn't a family wanting all members in the pic. It was a woman in workout gear who asked him to take probably 10-15 pictures, complete with instructions on how to position her, now one without my shoes, now one with just my shoes, etc. She adjusted hair and make-up in between and everything. Welcome to LA! The planetarium itself was great, highly recommend. Views of the Hollywood sign and LA were great but go on a clear day for maximum impact. The 1935 architecture and embelishments are gorgeous. We had to skip the telescope itself, needing to save energy for the little guy's walk back down. But I have no doubt it's also great. Maybe go first thing in the morning in the middle of the school week? I'd go back without hesitation, even so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljaack
50,City view .,"Great location to observe the city , sky view amazing, and the mountains. Very peaceful.Close by the walk of fame for visitors ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamyshv
50,Great views,"Fun place to hike the trails, interesting this to see in the observatory and fantastic views of the city and Hollywood sign! Super busy the day we were there but it was during spring break!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ericksmom
50,Classic place,"This is a beautiful place and as a native Angeleno I always recommend this to out of towners. The views, exhibits, building and surrounding areas of Griffith Park are so beautiful. The exhibits areas and theaters are a lot of fun and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q1608MCsarahv
50,One of my favorites! Do not skip! It is a must do!,"I've been twice on trips to LA and it is my go-to spot for that special ""I am here"" feeling. It was on my bucket list growing up so imagine how I felt going for the first time! The view is amazing and the area is open and spacious. There is a great view of the Hollywood sign. I must confess I've never been inside. However I am taking my two teens this summer so it is on our must do list and I will update this review but I'm sure I will LOVE it. This is a must visit to LA. Do not skip it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baleeve
50,Best public obseratory in the US!,"The Griffith Observatory is fantastic. A beautiful, recently remodeled architectural gem situated on a peak in Griffith park provides excellent views of Hollywood & LA.Most observatories I have visited are focused on university reserach, but not Griffith. This is a free public obseratory providing excellent exhibits on physics & astronomy. Telescope viewing is also available. The planetarium show was also engaging.Congratulations to Griffith Observatory on providing an excellent educational experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej
50,Pretty views,"The Griffith Observatory has stunning views, we visited at night and was still busy. A must see when in LA 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emsbob
50,Very interesting!,Definitely must make a trip there - the views are amazing and the Observatory was very interesting. Would go again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthaksy
50,Beautiful views,"Parking can be a bit difficult, so we parked down the hill a bit and hiked up. It was a beautiful walk and a good work out. Views from the top were wonderful although the smog did block a bit of downtown. The gallery inside was educational and interesting. Would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinecK8063OK
50,Nice for the family,The observatory is worth the 47 steps to the top deck. You may look through one of the telescopes and/or watch a short movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenjerliz
50,Awesome view of LA and holloywood sign,We spend an hour or so.You can see the LA skyline and Hollywood sign.Observatory also have good Astro things.Good place to visitClosed on MondayParking is available but busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641vineets
50,Amazing views!,This place provides amazing views over the entire city as well as views of the Hollywood sign. We went on a really sunny day and had a brilliant time. It wasn't overly busy and the walk up wasn't too difficult. There is also parking available if you would prefer to drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiehQ724RP
50,Amazing views!!,Loved the Griffith Observatory. It was our last stop while in L.A. It is a must see. The views are amazing and it is great learning adventure for the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lsalcarr
50,Finally got to go here!,"It's the place I've seen in the movies for decades, the place I always want to visit when we head to SoCal, but we're always too busy or the weather isn't ideal or it's a holiday weekend. No more excuses. Our cousins booked a planetarium show for after dinner, and once the show (live narration by a great speaker!) was over, we had plenty of time to peruse many of the exhibits (weights on Mars instead of Earth? Sure!) and admire the gorgeous artwork inside. It's sciency and touristy and historic and wonderful, and I'd love to go back again. Only the parking and shows cost money; the actual exhibits and views from the hills are free and worth your while. WARNING: do not rely on the café, because they understandably ran out of food late in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcdenman
50,Interesting,Loved walking around here.Lots to see and learn!Certainly fills up your cultural knapsack!Great for every age group,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRD1981
50,Amazing Place! Even When Crowded.,"We visited over Spring Break, which involves lots of crowds. Don't let this deter you! There is so much to see, and the views are amazing. I would suggest saving this visit for a day when the weather is good and the sky is clear.We had to park in front of the Greek Theater, and buses shuttled us up to the observatory. The buses do pick up/drop off RIGHT IN FRONT of the Greek main entrance, on the appropriate side of the street for the direction you are going. The fare is 50 cents/person each way, but the bus driver doesn't really check how much you pay. The sign reads that you must have exact change, but you can throw in $1 and be on your way.There are lots of exhibits inside that are great for kids and adults. There is no admission charge at the observatory. We sat in on the ""How to Make a Comet"" demonstration, which was very interesting for our 1st grader (also good for adults!) Our toddler had a difficult time sitting through this, though.Bring some quarters to put in the binoculars out on the balcony (50 cents).The gift shop is full of interesting and cool gifts. There are really neat small items up near the registers that would probably make easy souvenirs.This a such a cool experience, and it's practically free. Definitely worth a visit, even if it's crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCCG2015
50,Amazing views and very interesting exhibits,"Amazing place to view to the hills, the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles. The exhibits are very well designed, they explain hard thing in an easy to understand visual style. The pendulum was very interesting. Parking can be tricky, and the only thing you have to pay for. The cafe and gift shop are both have great things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viganiko
50,Beautiful experience,"Probably the best thing about the Observatory is its location: it commands a breathtaking view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Parking can be a problem if you try and park at the top, so consider leaving your car 20 minutes from the observatory, where you can find free parking and have a nice walk to the top. Inside the observatory is a range of activities you can do and shows you can see. We went to the Planetarium and watched a light show about Aurora Borealis. Very nice indeed. You can also use a telescope but the queue was too long so we did not go. Definitely a must-see if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Penguin1982
50,Must visit !,I really liked this place. Best place in town to get views of the Hollywood sign and overlooking the city. The Tesla coil inside was awesome !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaz869
40,Must visit at least once,"Easy to hike or drive up. Can get congested and parking may be an issue. It was crowded when we went so photos were spoiled with all the other people. There are better times to visit though. It is a good walk up, good views including the Hollywood sign. Nice building and the exhibits inside are very well done. Good scientific explanations and would be very interesting to someone who understands all that stuff (and excellent for school kids). Loved the section where you could see how much you would weigh on each planet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieM795
50,Nice Place!!!!,"I've been trying to visit this place for awhile and every time I visit LA CA. I always forget, but not this time. I was so thrilled to be here. To see the Hollywood Sign and be educated at the same time about the work, earth, etc... Lots of information. This is a beautiful place for everyone. They have shuttles to drive you up if you don't want to pay to park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/072107
50,Real Piece of Movie History,"Outside of this place, they have a bust of James Dean and a plaque commemorating him and the movie Rebel Without a Cause for using the Griffith Observatory as a setting for the classic American movie. It explains how this was the first movie that included an observatory in a movie, and how well it promoted this observatory. It was also in La La Land and Sandy Wexler. The Griffith Observatory is an American icon with many cool things to experience, including the planetarium. It also has an amazing view of the city of Los Angeles. This is something you have to do if you are ever in this city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fellowtravelerFL
50,Great views,Lovely views of the city on all sides and also the hollywood sign . Also u can go in to the observatory for free and look around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6872WOjamesm
40,Crowded!,In the movie LA LA Land they had this place to themselves. Well imagine the exact opposite of that and you might get a sense of what your visit will be like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnySong
50,Nice view!,"We hiked to the observatory from Hollywood/Western Metro station. Amazing views! I recommend to take the West Trail, it's a little bit longer mut totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aniir111
40,Cool place to see,"Cool place to see, you can see the Hollywood sign (though from quite afar) and on the other side of the observatory, you can see the whole city. The observatory itself is fun if you are into astronomy and science. The parking was a huge hassle so be aware of that. All in all, interesting place, wouldn't necessarily go there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222dar_az
50,Planetarium Show is Awesome!,"We saw the planetarium show ""Water is Life' and it was excellent. The narration was live and the narrator did a fabulous job! Would have like to have time to see another one! Great views of the city and Hollywood sign. Great science exhibits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marypoppinswannabe
50,Phenomenal view of the city,Took a evening trip here while on vacation in LA. The view was absolutely amazing. Getting there can be a bit challenging. During the evening we went the parking lot there was full so they had parking available at the Greek Theater and there were buses that rode you and from the observatory for 50 cent. It was extremely crowded. I am not sure what their peak times are. This was during a lot of people's spring break. I would do this again. Also it is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ymm1974
50,A must see in LA!,"The place itself is extremely interesting even if you are not into astronomy yourself. They have a great exhibit of all things related to planets and stars, and a movie theater where you can see a nice introduction to astronomy. This is a kind of place which will be good to see both by the parents, and the kids. Apart from that the Observatory is places on a nice hill overlooking the entire city of Los Angeles. Views are spectacular! And go there just before sunset to see the most beautiful colors of the LA night sky. Additionally, if you are into hiking, this is a great place to go for quite a tiring walk. Also if you come here by car, make sure you find a spot not very far away from the top of the hill - walking back to your car in darkness can be not that pleasant, and there is only around 70 or so spots to park on top (other parking spots are available along the road leading up to the hill top). Also Griffith is one of the best places to take a photo of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac
40,"Must visit, amazing views!","It was super crowded and parking was a huge hassle.. we ended up driving all the way up and waiting for a while to find an spot to open up. That said, amazing views and a nice observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divya92
50,Fantastic,"Went up on a Saturday afternoon. We parked down at the Greek theatre and walked 10mins to the observatory. The roads and carpark at the top were full, so this was a good option. We first went a did a hike and came back about 30mins from sunset. We got a quick bite to eat at the 'End of the World' cafe and settled in for the sunset. It was amazing! The clouds held off just long enough for a lovely sunset. We purchased tickets for one of the planetarium shows, Light of the Valkyries, about the northern lights. This was about 20-25mins long and just amazing! We then wondered around the multiple exhibits, the best one being finding out i would only way 30 pounds on the moon (how do I book my ticket?)!You really could spend hours and hours here, highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Faith_and_Me
40,"Amazing views, great leaning experience","We visited in late afternoon and the weather was nice and sunny, maybe 63 degrees, and it was pretty crowded. We watched a show in the planetarium, which was amazing. We explored some of the other areas, and watched a documentary of the observatory and all of the fairly recent renovations, which was very interesting. After dark, we tried to get a look through the telescope, but the line was just too long. That was a bit disappointing, but we still enjoyed our visit. Parking was free at the Greek Theater and the shuttle was only .50 each way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56feliciah
50,Spectacular!,"Sits on top of hill with great views of LA and Hollywood sign. Telescopes and science exhibits are impressive. Arrived too late for planetarium. Parking is minimal and costs $4 via meter, or on the side of the road with a bit of a walk up/down the hill. Very crowded and popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliek554
50,A must see!,"Visiting this place never gets old. The long line for parking and heavy traffic are well worth it. I prefer to go when it's dusk/dark The view is pretty spectacular. Make sure to wear good walking shoes in case you have to walk form the bottom. Lots of parking and there is also a bus. The lines for the bus are quite long at closing, for us it was quicker to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachJunkieHinsdale
40,Closed on Mondays,"Not knowing the observatory is closed on Mondays, we drove to the top for the views. The HOLLYWOOD sign was awesome to see, and take some photos. We got to walk around the observatory grounds, but couldn't go in because it was a Monday afternoon. Still had a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellC5948MN
50,Go go go,Even on a slightly misty morning we enjoyed our hike up to the summit - don’t drive all the way to the top as the walk gives a sense of achievement. Read up on the history too before you visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D566GNdavidl
50,Great place,Lovely place where you can see right around the city also the Hollywood sign is in good view from here great place to visit if you like walking many trails to take . The information inside is awesome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avisburnham
50,I loved it!,"If you love space & the science behind it, it’s all there! And if you aren’t a huge fan of science it’s still a really pretty building to visit! And some pretty cool stuff to see in there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briannab33
50,Amazing views,We went on a Monday are were upset to find the Observatory closed. It was a clear day though and the views were stunning of the city. Would love to go again at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pabloelmacho
30,"Clean, tidy but a little underwhelming.","Clean area, cheap bus from the Greek theatre up to the observatory. Few nice bits up there and can see the Hollywood sign but it’s better to take a walk or bike ride to get a better look. Quite crowded and so better to leave it later in the day to go up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemsyLou89
50,Amazing!,What an exciting visit! The observatory is amazing! We watched one of the planetarium shows. Exhibits are very informational. Tesla coil demonstration was the best part for the kids!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBMom3
50,Still takes my breath away!,"This iconic landmark of LA has been here longer than I have (I'm 64) and even though I came here often as a child, it still takes my breath away.Dozens of movies have been filmed on these grounds, and they have wonderful views of the city.Inside, the planetarium is first rate!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashebroe
50,Fun,"Amazing view, and the planetarium is totally spectacular. We saw the show on the Northern Lights and completely loved it. Griffith is worth your time and money if you find yourself in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackM291
50,Local views with a twist,Living in Southern California all my life and I had never been to visit the observatory. It was beautiful.We only planned for a few hours but wish we had set aside more time to explore the observatory. So much to see but we only quickly walked through as I only had paid for two hours of parking at $4 an hour. It didn’t help that it was Easter weekend either so it was packed.Additionally The views of the city and the Hollywood sign were amazing from the observatory. So much that we are going back to explore some more. Their appears to be many hiking paths which we plan on exploring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porsche911t69
50,Incredible Views!,You will be amazed by this fascinating Museum - Arrive before Sunset - Take a hike up to Mt Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvguytravels
50,Great daytime visit!,We went on a Saturday during the day - get there early to park as there can be a lot of people there on the weekend. The exhibits are really interesting and well done. There are asteroids and a chunk of the moon too. We spent a lot of time reading the different signs and you can learn a lot! The views were amazing as well. It was a wonderful place to visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnSB
40,Beautiful,Was a great day to go and enjoy the views. The actual observatory was not open at the time there. You could zoom the Hollywood sign in your photo. Has bathrooms available that are not port a potty type. We could have spent a lot longer time if we paid more for parking or wanted to go hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PATTIS64
50,Best views in the city and amazing technology!,"Family trip during March. Very crowded late in the afternoon/early in the evening, but worth fighting through the crowds. Great view of the Hollywood sign and incredible free, public telescopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sakman73
50,Great Planeterium,"Besides the planetarium itself there are lots of thing to do including history and viewing of various space exhibits. There are nice hiking trails, a gift shop, and a small restaurant. Amazing views of Los Angeles and surrounding area. Also a nice view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshuaK195
40,Great Views,Getting to the Griffith Observatory is a great hike. There is a lot of traffic if you decide to drive up. There are a lot of view stopping points to see if you walk up. Definitely a must if you are in Los Angeles. Be prepared for large crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamikaNOTG
50,Pick a clear day and the view alone is worth it,There are dozens of great places along the hills to stretch your legs and enjoy spectacular views of the city. I’d say that Griffith is probably one of the best views. The Observatory is also an architectural highlight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markandcathycalgary
50,Must see,"Not only is the observatory a must see in it’s own right, it also offers a fantastic view of LA and the Hollywood sign.Take some food and picnic on the lawns, then head for a stroll around the observatory. Or take a small hike over to get a better view of the sign.Only one negative - parking can be a nightmare!! Especially on holidays!!So be prepared to walk to get there.For those with kids, there’s a playground at the bottom... so once you’ve finished here - reward the kids with a play in the park (if they’ve still got energy to burn)!Also check out the carousel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/May_J83
50,Who says science is dead,"One of LAs icons, Griffith observatory is well worth the parking hassle. Day or night the views are spectacular. If you have time to go inside the observatory, it’s well worth the time. They have on display one of the original Tesla coils. It’s fun for kids and adults. However, just spending time outside or even going for a short walk or hike is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weeuns
50,Clear day - Great views,A must stop on the LA tourist circuit. Great spot for 5 minutes or for hiking around the area. The views are phenomenal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rggtraveler
50,Walk up Mt. Hollywood!,"The observatory itself is fun to see, and a neat building. We attended a planetarium show (Lights of the Valkyrie) which I'm glad we did though my teens were underwhelmed. The highlight of our visit by far was getting away from the crowds and hiking up to Mt. Hollywood for sunset. It's not a long walk and there are easy winding dirt roads to take as well as shortcuts that are a steeper scramble. On a perfect evening there were only a couple of dozen other people on top of the huge open area at the top. Round trip is under an hour and it puts you well above the observatory. It was a very memorable afternoon/evening in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MN_on_the_road
50,Had a great time,Super cool exhibits and shows. The whole family enjoyed it all. We hiked in and out guide was super knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisfP4688UY
40,Pretty Neat!,"Have to agree with a few other reviews that say it should have some little cafe or something to get a coffee or a snack. We stay in the Hollywood Hills when we are out in LA so we are used to cool views but always heard a lot of hype about this place so had some down time and thought we would check it out - the views are awesome, traffic sometimes up to it can be a bit of a hassle and it can get crowded but it is worth checking out for sure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KC_Ultraveler
50,Hiking and Sightseeing,"What a beautiful location which overlooks LA. We experienced nice staff, great information and hiking to beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xbf224488
50,Very interesting place,"You can take a look on the city panorama and you can see the famous Hollywood sign from there, kind a crowded place, but it's worth it to visit it on the map of LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogaliiinio
40,Great views,Best place to get a look of the Hollywood sign and a panorama of los Angeles. Pity there is no cafe or a place to buy a cold drink so bring extra water.Nice walking paths.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950peterr
50,Venus,"Visited to see the Hollywood sign, but the observatory is a good enough attraction on its own. Aside from the shows is free to park and visit, including the giant telescope on top of the observatory looking at Venus. We were lucky to visit on one of the monthly dates when societies are on the lawn, and you can view Venus and the moon from their telescopes. Unexpectedly good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stonerose5
50,Gorgeous views!,Enjoyed our visit very much. Great view of the Hollywood sign. Near other tourist attractions. Highly recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jvreming
50,Best view of Hollywood sign,This is by far a better view to see the Hollywood sign than Mulholland overlook. The $4 parking is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hsquared01
40,"Good view, would go back to have an easy hike","We went earlier in the day, around 11, and it wasn’t crowded. Parking was not a problem at the bottom on the east side by the Greek Theater and it was about 15 minutes to walk up on the sidewalk along the road side. The view of the Hollywood sign was a good and we could see into the valley below. The observatory didn’t open until 12, so we didn’t go in. There is a representation of the orbits of the planets in the area out front of the observatory. We drove down the west side to leave and there were lots of people trying to park along the side of the road and the parking was metered. There was a free lot further down and you could just walk up from there. Lots of wide hiking trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachcolorado
50,Thursday afternoon trip,Definitely worth the trip. Had to park at the Greek theater (was free) and hike up (there was a shuttle but we never saw it). About a 15 minute hike up. Observatory offers great views. You can see the Hollywood sign clearly but it’s pretty far away. Teens really enjoyed it too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151kristied
50,Best view of the LA area,"You can get a stunning view of LA downtown and its surroundings. And of course, it‘s the best an dmost convenient place to get the perfect view to the Hollywood sign. If you want to be a little sporty, you definetely have to walk up the hill.The observatory itself was very interesting and IT‘S FREE!!The exhibition is very interesting and you can learn a lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel3xpert
40,Excellent views,We spent a pleasant afternoon at the Griffith Observatory overlooking LA and looking at the telescope displays. Also a vantage spot to view the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dave22362
50,Must see in LA!,"This place is beautiful beyond words. We went around sunset and it was very crowded, and it took a while to get up to the top. Plan to arrive much earlier than sunset if you want to get there on time! We parked at the Greek lot and then took the DASH up to the top. The DASH cost 50 cents to ride. The view is spectacular. If you are in LA, don't skip visiting the Griffith! It is definitely a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erisimjeffy
40,Great views. Excellent hiking...I assume,We were bummed the observatory was not open on our visit. But the views of the Hollywood sign and the city took our minds off our disappointment. Parking is scarce. So are bathrooms. But lots of grass to spread out on. We did not hike but there are TONS of trails. Most looked challenging. We took a Hollywood tour up. It was nice to be dropped off and picked up. Consider it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspV6928EA
40,Must visit when in LA! YES YOU'LL REGRET IF YOU MISS THIS.,Must visit by sunset so that you can see the city in daylight as well as the city lights at night. Breezy up there but the view itself is so soothing to make you feel calm and on top of the world.The planetarium has shows but depends on the crowd.Parking: The place has very few parking spots up there compared to the visitors and quite a touristy spot in LA so crowded most of the times. So they let you park in a bigger parking lot down there on N Vermont canyon road near greek theatre and go via shuttle to the observatory. While if you have a disabled person with you and the placard showing disabled then you are allowed to drive till the observatory.Also the parking is free till 12pm in the morning and also less crowded.Enjoy your time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132dhruvins
40,Closed on Mondays,"We were so excited, had set Monday for our Beverly Hills, Griffith Observatory, & Hollywood day. We get to the Observatory, and they told us it’s closed on Mondays. There was also a sign. That said there was a special event.I’m giving it 4 stars because it was my bad trip planning that led us to go on a bad day.... the 4 stars is because even though we couldn’t get in, the views were simply breathtaking!! We were able to get some decent shots of the city, & the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaye528
50,A must-see,"Great planetarium. Free for those who wish to just visit the observatory itself (beautiful view), but do spend the few bucks to see a 15 minute or so show in the planetarium. Very entertaining and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toadsoup
50,Breathtaking!,"We went to the Observatory to watch the sunset. It was a busy time for obvious reasons but we still were able to park in the lot for $4.Both the inside and outside of the Observatory are a must see for anyone traveling to L.A! Seeing the telescopes in person is amazing and there are tour guides and a planetarium show if you want to see.We were mesmerized at the views of L.A, Hollywood and the Hollywood Sign. Watching the sun set was amazing. I would definitely come back here on our next trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanBakes1
50,Amazing views,This was definitely an experience! We enjoyed the view up by the Griffith Observatory and the planetarium show was beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reacah
30,Great View of City,Great view of the city. We didn’t go at night but I can only imagine the beauty at night! Overall the proximity and view of the “Hollywood” sign is underwhelming. Very neat spot though and fun place to browse.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreww238
50,Griffith Observatory in a Constellation of Its Own,A must visit. Edwin C. Krupp the Director is the bright star guiding one to the wonders of the universe. A most enthusiastic and personable ambassador.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenabydesign
50,Beautiful Day Beautiful View,"Really enjoyed our visit here and we caught it on a day where visibility was unlimited, you could easily see the Hollywood sign and the ocean.Planetarium show is definitely worth seeing and the Observatory itself is pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadwarrior172
40,Great panorama,"LA is such a big city that deserves some landscape pictures from this point. Buses from Sunset take you here in less than 30min and you can avoid the overwhelming traffic jams. The biggest failure is illumination, very dark at night (I guess they do not want to interfere with telescopes)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arce69zamora
50,Worth the Trip,"Very educational. Long walk so I highly suggest parking at the Greek Theatre and taking Dash up to the observatory. Very crowded, but views were gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raylynn2014
50,Worth the drive,Well worth the drive even for the views.Bit bored with the solar system etc. Kids seemed to enjoy it.good pics of the Hollywood sign. Only wish had more time to walk the trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ne233l
40,Get here early and you'll have a good time!,"If you are visiting LA, this place is a staple. When anyone stays with me, I make it a point to bring them here. You get full views of LA, including downtown and the Hollywood sign.Recently they added in pre-spaced parking spaces close to the top and at the top that require payment. It used to be really haphazard and now is a lot more organized. If you don't want to pay for parking, I would recommend parking right at the beginning of the park and hike about 1+ miles up for a good workout and great views.Definitely get here early. I would say between 9 and 10 am and you'll get good parking and mostly unobstructed access to the instagram-worthy spots and the displays inside the building.My final recommendation would be to get in early, take a walk around the edges, and up on roof. Then move inside and look through the displays, then get tickets to a show in the planetarium. We saw the first showing of ""Water is Life"". It wasn't the most outer space-oriented show but was still fantastic, I even learned a little bit. The first show each day are the most kid-friendly shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisong339
50,A real highlight of LA,"We loved visiting the Observatory, and particularly enjoyed the architecture and views. Great cafe and gift shop as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJM784
50,Nice city view of LA,Parking signs indicated that it was full at the observatory lot($4 per hour) but you may get want to drive up and make sure. We decided to just park down by the Greek theater which turns out be about a mile walk uphill. Gets a little windy so be sure to bring a jacket and some water. We got some coconut water that was $4...There are restrooms outside and inside the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tten05
50,Stunning views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"We went to Griffith Park Observatory on a whim after visiting Warner Bros. Studios and I'm so glad we did. The museum and planetarium are fascinating, and so are the view of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller0893
50,"Architecture, art and science intermingles there","Architecture, art and science intermingles there. You can visit the building as an art piece or architectural marvel. Observe the mysterious sky or trace the remnants from the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pelyn
40,Great great view- but not much else,"Went because rated as top thing to go to in LA. Well worth the drive- amazing view of LA, and if you like hiking g— great paths. However that’s it- view and hikes. Hint- even if parking lot signs say full- drive up. Lots of turnover and we got a spot no problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nedelakttraveler
50,Amazing Views of LA!,It wasn't open during the time I was up there but the views are unmatchable! You can see everything from up there and it's a great spot for a nice hike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGonthego
50,Well worth the drive,Griffith Observatory has great views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign. It is also free to enter the Observatory but the Planetarium show does cost ($7 for adults). We enjoyed walking around the outside and enjoying the views. We also enjoyed the Observatory and the Planetarium show. Parking costs $4 per hour and is metered. There is not a lot of parking at the Observatory but you can park along the road on the way up and down with the same metered parking. We visited on a beautiful Saturday and there were lots of people just outside enjoying the view and the weather. Well worth the drive to the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdunn1211
50,Wonderful view,"Best view in the whole of Los Angeles! Make sure you go way before susnet though, parking is very restricted on one side of the road leading up. It's quite a walk up, bear that in mind for those with walking disabilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveladdict0018
40,Weekend Visit.,Place was packed. Took shuttle bus from lower lot. The film was very good. I would recommend a weekday if possible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geo111
40,Nice place to visit!,Don't miss to visit this place! This is hilltop place from where you can see the HOLLYWOOD sign from very near and also you can enjoy the city from top!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maruf_Haque_Khan
50,Beautiful location for sky viewing.,"We visited on a weeknight and it was incredibly busy. Having been there, now we know why... highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juniord2006
50,For love of Observation,"This is a brilliant, historic, captured world to be enjoyed by those who love looking for what others don't see. From the views of Los Angeles to the stars observed there is a lot on this hill to see. The Observatory exhibitions are interesting, educational and true classics to enjoy. The down side is parking and week days are best. All in all this is not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cantertales
50,Great views of the LA region.,"This is a free experience so some may consider it worthwhile to pay for parking. We like to walk, so it was actually a treat to park at the Greek Theater for free and walk the 1.2 miles up to he observatory. There are some great views of the greater LA Region along the walk. On a weekend, arrive well before the 10:00 a.m. opening, especially if you want to park at the top. It gets crowded pretty quick.Inside houses a lot of exhibits about astronomy, telescopes, moon/earth relationships, time, etc. Enjoyed the movie experience. At $7 per ticket, it was worth the unique setting of the movie projected  on the ceiling. Note to parents: Children under 5 were only allowed in the first show at  10:45. May want to check this out for the day you plan to visit.Outside gives the option to hike some trails, wander the rooftop viewing area, and check out the huge telescope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbwyer
50,Space explained,"A very rainy day when I went so visibility was poorly see LA view. All is found inside. Interesting facts about space and planets on two floors. A planetarium to view different themed night stars. I saw show about water. A worker at Griffiths, is the narrator of the story. We were there about 2hours. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeMahwah
40,Great place to visit,Highly recommend to all newcomers! And for families with children 6yrs and up! Great learning experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessPAdvisor
50,Stars and Stars,We sat through to different shows. I was not real excited about spending that much time there.The shows were magnificent and the presenter was extremely talented and made the presentation more interesting. He was the perfect combination of dramatic and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bill7Nott
50,Great views of the city,Fantastic views of Los Angeles and the surrounding area. There are also good walks around the surrounding park. Car park was mobbed and had to circle round the one way system several times but other than that it was a great afternoon and a bucket item ticked off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callumt231
50,Great Views,Wonderful views of Los Angeles and the surrounding area including the Hollywood sign from the Observatory. Crowded and parking lot full when visited but additional parking at the Greek Theatre and ride on DASH for 50 cents was worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelvet
40,Great views,Great views by day or by night. Free entry but $4 parking charge. Interesting exhibitions plus a planetarium. Good date spot in the evenings too. Good view of Hollywood sign by day (not so much at night as not lit up).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPWEsq
40,Crowded,Took my grandkis here. Shows were great. Parking was ridiculous and the number of people on the grounds on a Tuesday afternoon was amazing. It looked like the crowds were unthinking out when we left at 7y so maybe a later visit is the way to go. You can also see the great city view lights from up here when it is dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3523EBbobf
50,Fun & Free,I suggest taking an Uber here as parking can be hard if busy. And drivers can take you all the way to the top to drop you off. It has nice views and also fun scientific info. We ended up taking the walking trail back to our hotel. It was fun but at times can be difficult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626leighf
50,A day well spent,"Observatories can be hit or miss. The planetarium show at Griffith was excellent; and unique, in that it was narrated by a live facilitator. The kids learned a lot and were fascinated throughout.Other exhibits were equally insightful; with a cloud chamber exposing cosmic radiation, a giant pendulum-clock, space rocks from Mars (yes, Mars...you need to go to find out how it ended up here..) and the moon—that you can touch.As a bonus, you get spectacular views of greater L.A. and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAL99999
50,Great for space lovers!,"This was my childhood place and often come here during celestial events, because this place can get a detailed view, they also have a mini museum underneath and it’s very cool!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navas2002
40,Awesome views from Griffith Observatory,"Free admission from midday to this fascinating place, they do have some shows for a small cost. Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign from here, also able to walk up via the walking trails through the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janesU7597SM
40,"Fun for groups, outdated observatory",The Griffith Observatory is a fun place to go with friends or family and offers great views of LA. The information inside is fun to view but the observatory itself just seems really old and outdated. Still would recommend going!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hhalvz95
50,Incredible visit!,"I almost skipped this on our list of things to do in LA b/c but it was SO worth our time! Absolutely gorgeous at sunset! You get an amazing view of the sunset + LA at night and all lit up. Highly recommend but bring a jacket, it’s cold up there! Also, they have a cute cafe with food and drinks if you get hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexwalkuski
50,Excellent place to visit,We parked down the hill for free and paid $1 per person on the “Dish” bus to get up to the observatory. Beautiful site! We also booked the 12:45 show called “centered in the universe” in the planetarium which cost $7 each for 13 years and up. It was about our solar system history. Pretty enjoyable!There is a nice cafe with amazing views of the Hollywood sign.Definitely worth the trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elnchan2
50,WOW,"So, I went on a Sunday afternoon and early evening... AND IT WAS PACKED. I can't believe how many people was there. Even though it was crowded, I enjoyed the views and sunset from the Griffith Observatory. It is definitely a must-see place, and take your phone/camera with you. The views around the observatory are beyond fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennymZ2865RA
30,Interesting,I went with friends at night. It was very crowded so I didn’t enjoy the visit enough. The view is beautiful though. You can go there spend an hour but it’s not extraordinary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julitat2017
40,Beautiful views,We went after dark and the night time views of Los Angeles were beautiful. I got some great pictures. The cashier in the cafe was extremely rude. I bought a $4.00 20 ounce bottled soft drink paid with a $20.00 bill and asked that one dollar of my change be in quarters. He rudely told me he wouldn't give it to me in quarters and told me if I didn't want the drink he really didn't care. The very nice young woman in the gift shop broke the dollar for me when I asked her if there was somewhere I could get change to take the bus back to my car. We gladly spent $60.00 in the gift shop but I will never spend another dime in the cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/904-424-3593
40,Pretty cool!,"Some interesting exhibits, such as finding out how much you weigh on various planets. Amazing views of the city from the surrounding areas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairesS5879DE
40,Family trip to the Observatory,"fun place to walk around and check out the beautiful panoramic view of LA, and also the Hollywood sign.very busy on the weekends so expect to park and shuttle to the top",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScotMoga
50,Beautiful building & location,"Loved our visit here, definitely would recommend if visiting L.A. great views of the Hollywood sign, lovely walks around the building & the observatory itself stunning, lots of information, worth paying to visit the planetarium & see the other shows there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazycats_10
50,We love the Griffith Observatory and been many times.,"We love to park below and walk up to the Observatory as it is a great walk and the views are pretty. The views from the Observatory are unbelievable and I would highly recommend to arrive in the late afternoon and stay until it is dark. That way you get the regular view of LA as well as the night view with all the lights. The Observatory it self is fantastic too. They have a cute little museum store and a great exhibit. The kids loved it. They also bring out telescopes at night. We love coming here. Only negative, the food at the cafeteria is not so good and overpriced. Bring your own picnic / snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwissBoundNL
40,Great experience!!!,"I enjoyed my first experience at Griffith Observatory, and enjoyed the tours thy were provided. I was also able to take several pictures with the Hollywood sign, but they weren’t very close.Overall, I had a nice time here, and the coffee within the cafe was amazing. It was just right for one of those cold California days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyg972
30,Great panoramics,"Great view of the city and of the mountains around LA. It has to be very special at the afternoon, when the sundown is happening. But is a very nice and well kept area. For walking or trecking is very nice area. The tour inside is ok, nothing special, but to have a look to the sky or to the city is very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanv449
40,Busy but what a view,Very busy on a sunny day but a fabulous view. You can see the Hollywood sign. Some great hiking in the area as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BryanSToronto
50,Great landmark and brilliant views,"A great hour spent wandering around, looked after really well. We got dropped off at the top, it was very busy, busses everywhere. Took a walk back down one of the tracks and was easy and pleasant. We went on a cloudy day but still saw a long way out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francescabT8434FT
50,Beautiful building and grounds.,"Arrived just prior to opening and there was so much to take in. The building is so beautiful and there were lots of spots to take amazing shots of the ""Hollywood"" sign. Inside the building were lots of great exhibits and a wonderful cafe where we had a great lunch. Highly recommend the trek up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steph1070
50,Free and iconic!,"Griffith Observatory is an LA icon that was made more popular with LALA land. Better yet - it’s free to visit the property and exhibits. It can even be free to park if you’re willing to take the shuttle from the bottom of the hill (otherwise it’s $4/hr). The planetarium shows are one highlight and that costs money ($7/adult, $5/senior with student discounts).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveDCA
50,A Must Visit,"This is a breathtaking place where you see Los Angeles and Hollywood skyline and of course, the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JedRevolutia
50,Amazing views of LA,Its a really nice place to visit with awesosme views of the city and excellent programs are really icing on the cake.It was really a last minute decision to visit ghis place and I am so glad that we did. The exhibits are very informative and nice. The programs though are really brilliant with excellent narration. I hope they sustain the excellence.The views from the top are awesome.I would definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunakc1984
50,This is THE place,I only have 1 word for this place: wow. The view you get is just unbelievable. I didn't pay to go inside as I was only there for the view. The way up there is horrible (because of traffic) but it's so worth it. The place to be in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larsv165
50,Love it,"I didn’t like too much LA at the beginning but I started to like it from this view, it s cliche but really nice to see surge cuty form upstairs and the famous Hollywood letters",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmelinebm
50,JAMES DEAN!!!,One of the best views in Los Angeles. I love to come up here and just spend the day hiking around or going through the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnFallonstudio
50,Griffith Observatory weekend before 4th of July,"Wow. Let's start with that.The view from this place at evening, sunset and even dark is magnificent and breathtaking. I didn't even consider it was the 4th of July weekend (4th of July was on a Tuesday so people celebrated it the weekend before the Tuesday) until I saw the fireworks over the city in red, white and blue (not to be rude, just as a Swedish citizen it didn't occur to me since it's nothing special in europe).The art inside, the information, the view outside of the city... It all just makes for a mesmerizing experience. This was among the top 3 experiences on my trip across the USA summer of 2017.Behind it is also a hiking path from where you can see the whole city even better and the Hollywood sign (or if you have the energy for it, even a path to the Hollywood sign.Be vary when you get back down though, as you otherwise might get a prairie wolf/coyote following you for a few hundred feet (yes, this actually happened while I was on my way back to the city from the observatory).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aidlac
50,A precious gem overlooking the City of Angels!,"You start with a drive up a hill through beautiful neighborhoods. We visited on Sunday, and parking was at a premium. We ended up parking downhill from the Observatory, and parking is $4/hour. It is a bit of a climb to get up to the Observatory, but it is worth it.When you arrive at the Observatory, you will be amazed at the views of LA. The park surrounding the Observatory is about 3500 acres, and is beautiful. Many walking trails throughout the park, and playgrounds and picnic areas.The Observatory is an architectural wonder. Built in 1933-35, it is a magnificent building and in great shape. Admission to the building and its' displays is free. Planetarium show is $7/adult, and is worth every penny. Many interesting displays (note, some of these displays only work on sunny days, as they involve equipment in the domes above the Observatory). The lobby contains a pendulum that keeps time by knocking down pegs, this is really cool. Be sure to look at all the murals in the building, they are beautiful. We are so thankful that Mr. Griffith and others donated this land and built this observatory!Travel tips: wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Pack some waters and snacks in car. Arrive early and purchase your Planetarium tickets for the show time you can attend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCbikerman
50,Solid excursion for 1 hour,Kinda a pain to get up to but worth it. I'd rec going at sunset or afterwards in order to see all the lights. We spent about 1 hr there total. Well worth it. Note that parking can be tricky,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhouston8
50,Amazing views over LA,"Amazing views, and a really interesting place to visit.We only went here to fill a bit of time, but we were so glad we did. The views out over LA are spectacular. We only went inside for a quick look round, but found ourselves absorbed by all the amazing space facts and info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stivesfoodfan
50,Amazing Museum,"This is a great museum to visit with a teenager. It is not that interactive but the exhibits, although a little dated are worth the visit. The views from the terraces are spectacular. I wish we had had more time to walk around and use the trails to access the park it sit on, Entrance is free and the place was really busy on a Saturday morning 30 minutes after opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chagallvoyage
30,"Views were great, parking was bad","So, we actually went here because we play a lot of GTA at home. Parking was a little rough, had to park down the hill a bit.The observatory itself actually ended up being pretty cool although the roof was closed that day. It has great view of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsgman777
50,Must visit place in LA!,"I know observatories and museums can be quite boring, but not Griffiths. It's located at a ""vantage point"" where you can see the entire LA cityscape. I could just sit there watching out to the city for hours long. It's amazing. But even otherwise, they've got shows and small activities going on that makes this place interesting. Give it a day, don't rush through. Find some time to sit in the lawn and relax. Sunsets are amazing to see from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manikarthik
50,Excellent place to visit!,"The exhibits and programs were excellent. Only problem was that the parking was at the bottom of the hill, and it was a very steep climb. No tram or any other way to get up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irene357
50,Love with stars,It is a great place if you like stars. Very romantic. Also you can have a glimpse of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarunS848
50,Beautiful Sceneries,"Other than being an astonishing L.A. landmark, the observatory has hundreds of beautiful views and places to explore. Even when hiking and trail running, the trails, people, and views can be new experiences for your life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henrysP528SW
50,That view...,"I’d recommend to visit before sunset, so you’re able to take a good photo of the Hollywood sign, and then enjoy the sunset while all the city turns the lights on. The observatory has free access, if the sky is clear you can take a look into the stars with a huge telescope, the view is simply amazing and you can take a look at the museum too. Very much recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammieab
50,"Incredible Views of the City, Come at Night","We visited Griffith just before sundown so we were able to get some amazing views before, during and after sunset. I would highly recommend coming here at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
50,For Stargazers and all the rest....,"Super place, unfortunately too many crowds at times, but worth the battle up there. Fantastic views over LA when dark, superb actually. Cayotes wander around outside, lots of tourists too...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pddkerumo
40,Nice Views,"Drive up to find the lot was full so we parked at the Greek theatre and took the DART up to the top. The fee is .50 cents per person per ride. No change so you must have exact amount and no cards accepted. The overall appearance was good, needs maintenance but I suppose it will do. Exceptionally nice views if the city and surrounding neighborhoods. It's been checked off our list so we likely won't be back. The inside planetarium is really nice and the staff know what they are talking about. If nothing else visit for this part if the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myjaljo

50,Tourists go here rather than the walk of fame.,"Best view of the hollywood sign, amazing panoramic views of the city. don't bother with the walk of fame since it's smelly and horrid, drive past it, don't bother getting out of the car and instead drive to this amazing spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naysonk
50,"If it's good enough for James Dean, it's good enough for me!","Beautiful observatory. It's free but parking isn't and it's crowded. We went about an hour before sunset to be able to look out at the spectacular view of LA. As we went in, one of the staff gave a brief talk about the Foucault pendulum in the atrium. There were staff everywhere ready and willing to answer questions. We decided to take in a planetarium show (remember Rebel Without a Cause?) The show was professionally narrated by a live actor (LA, right?) and was full of historical information about the universe. This show was inexpensive and about half an hour. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mujissa

50,Must see on any visit to LA,Would recommend a visit to Griffith Observatory for anyone heading to Los Angeles and wanting to experience the Hollywood Hills and view of greater LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicholas_AU
50,Great Date Place,"Lived here 15 years and had been wanting to go here for so long. Took advantage of a free telescope viewing night. We did drive up as far as we could and parked near the pick up place for the bus that takes you to the observatory. It is a bit of a walk if you don't take the bus up. The night time view is obviously amazing from there towards downtown LA. All the street lights down below, pretty cool to see.We sat in the new Leonard Nimoy theatre. They recently remodeled and rehabbed the property. The cool part was that Mr. Spock himself was the film narrator for the new space. I got a little teary eyed.We wondered all over the place. Got to see Tesla's Coil, learned the history of Griffith Observatory, saw through some amazing telescopes of stars and nebulas, walked down into the newer display rooms. One of the many things that was really cool was in the main area of the lobby is the pendulum that sways knocking over the little brass pieces to show people how the planet earth actually moves. The pendulum does not move around to hit those piece, the earth moves and the pendulum moves in the same direction. Geez there is no real way for me to explain this, you have to see it to understand better.We didn't see half the rooms and displays. We are definitely going back to see more for another cool date night. Highly recommend if you like the stars and telescopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiZ_12

40,Drive to the top,"Driving up the hill to the observatory we saw people parking in the spaces along the road for $4.00 an hour. But that would have been a tough uphill walk and a long way. So we kept driving to the top. There is a large parking lot on top. Pulled right in and the price was the same $4.00 per hour. Short walk from there. The observatory itself was fun but very crowded on a Saturday. Get in line for tickets to a show when you first get there, then explore. Great views outside of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249EricY

40,Beautiful view of LA,"We went on a Sunday and it was crowded. The view was beautiful. We were expecting more, it looks nice, but nothing different from other observatories in other cities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithc951
50,Beautiful Views!,Take the time to go to the Griffith Observatory to see the spectacular views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign! The trails provide great hiking as well as marvelous scenery. You also get to see some of the magnificent multimillion dollar homes built into some of the most scenic views of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Budes65
40,Interesting and great views,"We were there at sunset on a Saturday (mistake-- so long to wait to get up on the shuttle-- no parking-- and so crowded) and then again on a Monday night-- much more sane. Both times it was a great view, but avoid the weekend crowds- it's just not worth the fuss.Will note: the cafe is closed. So, don't plan on eating while you're there or pack your own!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyl97
50,Love this place,"What an amazing place, great attraction to take friends from out of town, especially if they have kids. They will love it here. The views of the city are also phenomenal, can't beat them anywhere else in the city. Go to the planetarium, catch a show, I love them. I think they change weekly, not sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sethmichaels2017
50,Amazing!,"We hiked up to the Griffith Observatory at around 3pm, this gave us time to look around the observatory before it got busy and before we watched the sunset and all of L.A. lit up with the street lights, the views are out of this world. It will definitely be a trip to remember, even more so when my other half got down on one knee and proposed while watching the sunset!I’d give this a 10/10, the views are incredible and worth a visit just for that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EveP419
50,Wonderful Time at Griffith's,We spent a few hours there walking through the exhibits and all the halls. Wonderful place to learn about planets and stars etc.. Very interactive and folks from all age groups were enjoying... Nice view of LA and Hollywood sign from up there..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LathaRajagoapalan
50,"Great trip, amazing view",Best possible view for the Hollywood sign. You can take UBER or Hike there. Great attractions for the people love science. Night view is also amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babumannan
50,Great views,"Great views you have LA at your feet, Hollywood sign and the Observatory is stunning.There is a shuttle that takes you up and down only 0,50 cents",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/William73_12
50,Star Gazing Capital,"Absolutely gorgeous! The observatory is structured beautifully and offers a breathtaking view. If you’re attending at night, you can find telescopes scattered throughout the grounds that allow you to see the moon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smphillips53
50,great view from the top,"This is accessible by hiking up the hill or by taking a vehicle by roadway- it seemed to be a split as to how people made it to the top- if you are a bit more adventures the hike is not too strenuous but if it was too hot it could take its toll on you. Once to the top you have an AMAZING view of the area and the oh so famous Hollywood sign- which is another hike you could connect to. We ,in fact ,chose the Mt Hollywood trek after this one. The observatory offers a snack bar, clean washrooms and many inside exhibits. The planetarium has different shows (with a cost) but I am sure well worth any entrance fee. There is a souvenir shop and many places to take pictures from- including the roof of the building.I would suggest not to do this near dusk as it does connect to many trails and one could easily get lost up there. Noting as well there are rattlesnakes and other wild animals that one would probably encounter at night.Debbie and Mike",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878debbief
50,Spectacular views of LA and the mountains and the Holloywood sign,This is the only place to see different view of LA and the mountains.It is also a great place if you are a photo buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maijr1119
40,Great Views,The Griffith Observatory is a great place in L.A where you can get the best views from Santa Monica to Los Feliz. It is quite an interesting place to visit with plenty of history and information as you walk through the building but can be a little crowded as you would expect.Overall it is definitely a must do whilst visiting Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh13101993
50,For the Astronomy Lovers,The Griffith Observatory is a neat and interesting attraction. I love how you can see the different views of Los Angeles. The views are breathing taking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352MD
50,Go for the sunset views,"My wife and I visited Griffith Observatory Friday March 2nd and were not disappointed despite persistent rain. This is an LA icon. Views of the city / mountains / Hollywood sign are superb. Exhibits inside are educational, and don't miss the Tesla coil experience. The building is a great example of art deco architecture and looks really cool lit up at night. After the sun goes down, the view of the city lights is amazing. It can get busy/cramped a bit inside (mostly was due to the weather). After watching La La Land we were surprised to find it seemed smaller than in the movie. Highly recommend for families/couples/friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timrO7530XG
50,"Beautiful view, FREE!","There was no charge to explore this area. This place had a great view. If you enter the building, you are able to explore and learn a lot. There is also a cafe and a gift shop right at site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetzec
50,Great place!!,"We had one day in Los Angeles and this was one of the few things we did.Loved the views from the observatory. It was quite crowded (Saturday afternoon) and no accessible parking but the security guard let us go past the barriers and park in the staff parking area.We didn't take part in any of the activities inside, we didn't really have the time and it was crowded inside. We did see the huge pendulum.If we are ever back here again we'd come on a not so busy day and experience more.It is wheelchair accessible with free entry to the places we went (probably a charge for the shows).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencX5901KK
50,Evening Beauty,"This is one of the most beautiful locations to enjoy views of the city lights of LA in spring or summer, especially after a rain or on a cool day when the air is clear!Prepare to park far down the hill & wear comfortable walking shoes...the observatory is well worth your time and provides great photo ops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290maryannh
30,Beautiful view outside; challenges inside,"So our visit to this historic observatory was not BAD, but there were some elements that left us a little disappointed.We visited on a Sunday afternoon so we could see the evening stars, etc. The traffic was AWFUL trying to get up to the dropoff. Our Uber driver was concerned we would not be able to go to the top. But we persevered and made it. We took the bus back down and caught an Uber at the Vermont/Sunset station. MUCH easier and highly recommended. The buses get a little more flexibility on passage (but they can't drive through other cars, so it still took a while to get down.)And yes, you can see the Hollywood sign from Griffith.The observatory itself was OK ... not as much actual viewing through telescopes as we experienced at other observatories such as the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. While it's certainly a value as a free venue to see some of the exhibits, don't expect a huge telescopic experience.The cafe downstairs was a HUGE disappointment ... even though we made it down an hour before they closed, they were out of food except for ice cream. Prices are pretty steep. A gyroscope my son purchased in the gift shop was broken within two hours.So the view is great, and the exhibits are informational. But the trip was an effort and don't go for a lot of telescope viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/commguy101
50,Time to get Spaced Out!,"To Me, the Planetarium is the main draw. But the Telescopes views are also an enjoyable experience.I recommend a Observatory visit, for every Family. The learning experience is without reproach.The best part of a Observatory venture, is the fact that, the total cost of the visit is free. Meals and fuel cost, not withstandiing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1VBKemo
30,Great views but too busy,We opted to visit late evening. We actually left it really late thinking it would be quite. It was packed. We did not get near the obersvatory but still enjoyed some great views on route up and down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bains19
50,Hike your way up if you can...then marvel at the free greatness,I would NOT drive up and park here...but rather hike up one of the many paths that you can google and find. It's amazing that this place is free. It's gorgeous and novel and interesting. It is crowded on beautiful weekend days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmc
40,Great Views,"Parking is fair to difficult depending on the time or date of your visit. When crowded, you might have to park along a curb on the hill approaching the observatory and walk the rest of the way up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tigerpaw54
50,Iconic,"A must for anyone visiting Los Angeles. As much an iconic landmark as the Hollywood sign. Parking is an issue during certain times of the year, so don't be surprised if you have to hike up the road. Great views of the mountains and the city of Angels below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChispitaSpark
40,Nice outside visit,The day we went it was closed. It is a very nice facility and much info outdoors. You can see the Hollywood sign from there. All the solistices and equalinoxes are marked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454leem
40,Walk to the Observatory,I think the best way to enjoy the observatory is walk up there. It’s all uphill and will take you around 1/2 an hr and will probably be very hot. You get nice views on the way and once at the top you will be rewarded a look round the Observatory and a water fountain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alunaf2016
40,Great spot,"Loved that after paying for everything else in LA this is free. We paid to see the movie in the Planetarium and it was well worth it. Interesting place to look around but I think the best thing is the view, looking down over LA and even out to the ocean (we were lucky to get a really clear day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susypip
40,An iconic feature of Los Angeles-visit on Saturday Night,"Los Angeles (as opposed to London, Paris) has a limited history. And it is through the motion pictures that a few iconic features of Los Angeles are so well known.The 1950s picture ""Rebel Without A Cause,"" and of course ""LA LA LAND,"" bothfeature the Griffith Observatory. It was built in the 1930s, and the craftsmanship (the marble and word work are remarkable).So I have lived my life in Los Angeles, I have visited the observatory 30-40 times, over the decades.There are two reasons to go: (a) the observatory itself, and (b) the views of Los Angeles. The observatory is in fact a series of science displays (to some extent interactive). And the science displays will be a great place forchildren.Most of all, most visitors go for the views. It is open until 10:00 P.M. and the night time views are spectacular, (as are the daytime views) from the Ocean to downtown Los Angeles. Go on a weekday (It is closed on Monday), (less crowds). It is Los Angeles of yesteryear, from an calmer and more peaceful time.AHLos Angeles, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawoffah

50,"Tourist or native angeleno, this is a must!",The observatory is a great place to visit. The planetarium show is excellent. You can hike around the observatory.

50,Griffith Observatory,"The Griffith Observatory is one of the few municipal observatories in the country, and I have been going there for over 60 years. There is often something new to learn there, and, like music, there is always some new pleasure or insight to gain from revising the old exhibits. The planetarium has stat-of-the art equipment and programming, with staff who truly are passionate about connecting to the greater Universe. It is a cultural treasure of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennist408

50,Day in LA,"We had limited time in LA but wanted to make our way to the Griffith Observatory and I'm so glad we did! The views of LA are beautiful, you get a closer look at the Hollywood sign, and there is so much to learn about our galaxy. We appreciated that you could tour the venue for free. They also have a very nice souvenir shop. When in LA definitely stop here, but plan for parking. We visited late afternoon on a Friday and because we took a taxi, we didn't experience parking issues, but had we been in a car, this would have been a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhpeters

We had a tour bus and were dropped off at the entrance. There are many showings throughout the day.The show we saw was Titans of the Galaxy. Would have preferred a more scientific, celestial show but it was enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiseppeGord
50,"High quality, interactive displays and fantastic films about the sky - and a great view!",This old observatory is a fantastic destination for interactive displays about all things space. Wonderfully interesting and educational. We saw a film about the northern lights in the dome theater (360 degrees of screen) that was absolutely fantastic. Three weeks later I am still thinking about Polaris! The view of LA is terrific and the Hollywood sign is super close. This is a great family outing. Get there early otherwise parking is difficult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaV_123
50,Enjoyable Education,There is so much to learn here but the BEST BEST part is the planetarium!! The Observatory is free but the planetarium has a $7 admission fee for adults. Definitely worth it to fly through the sky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan1010
50,My favorite view of LA. The observatory is cool too.,"Traffic going up the hill is always bad near sunset, but it is worth it. Some people take the bus now, but in my experience (December 2017), there was a very long line for the bus as well. On the way down (about 1 hour after sunset), There must have been close to 200 people waiting for a bus (over 30 minute wait in the cold!) Parking was available (I waited less than 10 minutes), and reasonably priced. If you are going by yourself and don't enjoy hunting for small parking spots, then take the bus. Otherwise, drive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevie128

50,Beautiful location above all the hubub of Los Angeles.,"I got here quite early in the morning as Jet Lag was doing it's thing and was thankful that I did. It was very calm and tranquil place so look down on LA. The observatory was not yet open so a did the 1.5 mile hike to the look out point, although it was February it was around 70 degrees and was a tough walk in totally the wrong shoes but I am so glad I made the effort, the view from the top was stunning and I enjoyed looking across to the Hollywood sign too. If I came back again I would try some of the other trails no doubt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilfromGrayshott
40,Good views,Used the Dash bus to get to the observatory. The bus stop is outside the Vermont/sunset red line station. Very easy.Great views of the city and of course the Hollywood sign in the distance!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indianqueen39
50,So much to see...for free!,"We attended on a Friday night in February. As we made our way up the hill towards the Observatory, we saw people parking quite a long way away and I started getting quite nervous, as I had heard that parking was a shemozzle up there. Thankfully when we made it to the Observatory’s parking space, we found plenty of spots (I think it was just that people didn’t want to pay the US$4 an hour parking fee!). It was starting to get close to sunset, and quite busy, so we quickly made our way up to the viewing deck for sunset – and what a sunset it was! We had enough time to have a bit of a look through the Observatory, which is free, but we wish we had another hour or so to see everything and stay to see the telescopes working, but unfortunately we had to make our way to the airport. We'll definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeonVenables
50,"This is an LA ""Must See""","You need to go at night to enjoy the view of the city lights but the parking situation is difficult. They charge now.

We looked at all the exhibits and went up to the rooftop see the skyline and Hollywood sign. Looking forward to coming back to see one of the shows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHONNA1221
50,Beautiful Architecture and Great Exhibits,"Most recently featured in the film “La La Land” the Griffin Observatory is a Hollywood landmark rivalling the nearby hillside sign. In addition to spectacular views and classic architecture, the attraction hosts a series of excellent astronomical exhibits; has a theatre; and has a working Tesla ball, which sends out electric charges into the air (reminiscent of the device used in “Frankenstein” and “Young Frankenstein”). We were disappointed to find the restaurant closed for renovations and the parking near the observatory is a challenge, but overall we were very impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwD7057IG
40,Important source of education and timeless archetichture.,"Really educational all around. There is so much to learn from this historical observatory. It is important to understand all the great exhibits that this observatory has to offer. Some are self guided and others are paid. Lots of movies, videos, and commercials are filmed in this location. Great part of history and timeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444salvadorr
50,Great Views overlooking LA,"I went there last March great views but went during the day so cannot comment on checking out the scope, I took an Uber up there too check it out but bare in mind that there is not much phone coverage up there managed to get enough coverage on the right hand side as you face the building to grab another ride back down to Hollywood, has some great history check it out.Cheers Brett from Hastings Point Australia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettSOk68
50,Spectacular way to spend a day!!,"This is a spectacular attraction! You can send most of a day here and easily over three hours. The museum exhibits cover every aspect of space, the universe, and our solar system. Many of the exhibits show the affects that the sun, moon, and stars have on life on earth. These include tides, moon cycles and seasonal changes animated in an incredible display. Hours can be spent viewing and reading this information. I was fortunate enough to be there for three shows in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium; 'Water is Life', 'Light of the Valkyries' and 'Centered in the Universe', all three amazing!! The live narrative given by Doug was brilliant! His knowledge and delivery was a work of art. The shows lasted about 30-40 minutes and are an absolute must while visiting the planetarium. The cost is $7. but there are student and senior discounts available. As an added bonus the views of Los Angeles, Santa Monica and the Pacific are breathtaking. Watching the sun set over the city was mesmerizing and seeing the lit up skyline was nothing less then magical. Go! Plan on spending a lot of time. Parking available for $4. an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CATTSAR
50,Great Place to Visit,"This is a little out of the way but worth it. We got an Uber there from the zoo and a taxi back to our hotel as there was a line of taxis waiting outside.There are a number of things to do here. There are some very interesting science displays about the stars, tides, moon, planets, etc. on the first floor and in the basement. There is a planetarium showing various shows throughout the day. The Nimoy theatre shows a very interesting 20 show about the observatory itself.There is a nice cafe and gift shop as well.But the best thing about the Observatory is the views. It’s got the best view of the Hollywood sign. The sunset is spectacular. And the view of downtown LA all lit up at night is fantastic.But the best view is through the telescope. Yes, you get to look through their huge telescope. Queue up about a half an hour before sunset. There is a long line so get to the roof early.It is very busy most days here. To do everything, I’d plan at least 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
50,Amazing view of the city!,"After a long day, we decided to make our way to the Griffith Observatory to relax and take in some views. Whoa! This place was amazing. Although there were a lot of people around, it was still a calm and relaxing atmosphere. The skies were crystal clear and the views of LA were incredible. The best part of this place, is that it'a free to roam around! If anyone is in the area, I'll totally be recommending this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
50,Fascinating Place.,"As well as being a great place to visit, it is also a good spot to see the Hollywood sign and get a superb view of the city. If you know nothing about the cosmos and believe that the planet was created 5000 years ago, then this place will give you a dose of reality. I particularly found the 'Big picture' awe inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanWhickersMate
50,Fun for the whole family,"I couldn't believe how many people were there! The observatory itself is amazing, but so are the views around LA. Amateur astronomers set up their telescopes on the lawn and you could look at the moon or planets, for free! There's a nice cafe downstairs along with interesting exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelticWandering
50,Amazing views,"I ended up at the observatory after hiking up the trail. It was a very steep hike and to be honest I almost stopped a couple of times but I kept looking up at the observatory and knew that I wanted to make it to the top. And if I’m honest there were people that were older than me passing me up this hill and I knew that I just couldn’t give up. The views are absolutely amazing great view of the Hollywood sign and of downtown LA. I took advantage of going into the planetarium, mostly to rest before I walked back down, and saw a great half an hour show. I would totally recommend it just be prepared if you’re hiking up the mountain wear comfortable shoes and know that you are going to get dirty because it’s a very sandy/dirt trail. But I do believe you can drive up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciasF1199XU

50,Aussies on the go,The trip to the Observatory was uneventful- took Lyft as couldn't work out the correct bus - DASH. Entry is free with large amount of information provided. Need to book in fir the Observatory presentations for a small cost. In the lower level - you can see the planets and compare your weight to your weight on a particular planet.Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CardiacChik
50,Visit to Griffith observatory,its on a hill to overviewing LA city. its a beautiful and well made place and must go for all ages.

50,Most Beautiful View,"I have dreamed about making it up here. You see it in all the tv shows and movies. This is where you realize that LA is a beautiful city. On one side you can look at the Hollywood sign and mountains, the ocean on the other on a clear day, and the sweeping city all the way around. It is incredible. There are miles of great hiking trails as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntraveler19
50,Must go to the Planetarium!,We really enjoyed going to see The Griffith Observatory. The drive up there is pretty nice and then there’s the beautiful views of Downtown LA and the Hollywood sign.My favourite part was the Planetarium which is well worth paying for as it is a unique experience. Especially if you love science! And it’s not expensive either.You will be required to pay for parking and it was pretty busy when we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ducky1988
40,Crowds but Must Visit,We went here on a Friday morning thinking it may be quiet - it wasn’t lots of kids and tourists. Parking is available as you drive up the hill. The observatory is interesting and the views over the city are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavinC

30,Interesting but inaccessible.,"There is practically no parking at the observatory. One has to park at the foot of the hill at a place called the Greek Theater and ride a bus up to the observatory. At the end of the visit, you take the bus back to the parking lot. Round trip, $1.00. At the observatory, you can see the 12"" refractor telescope, a sun watching telescope and star show inside. I endured a lot of aggravation to get to this place only to see an old observatory that is past it's prime. Even the view of downtown was obscured by thick haze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahaskell

We found many of the exhibits to be informative and nicely done, especially the ones on star types, the sun and the Foucault pendulum. The docents were very helpful with explaining the exhibits. There are some beautiful murals on the ceilings. A real treat both inside and out!Did this review earn a “helpful” vote?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnAnnColumbia_MD
50,History of the Universe,"If you ever wondered about our atmosphere or even wanted to see the sky and stars in abundance, this is the place for you. The guides are very knowledgeable and can answer any questions you may have. In addition, there is a show that you lay back in your seat and watch as the sky passes above...very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cszostak
50,Amazing!,"We loved our time at the observatory. This is the best way to view the Hollywood sign and L.A. The observatory is wonderful as well, we learned a lot. They have wifi everywhere, helpful staff, and the DASH bus is also super helpful. You can take the bus to and from the observatory (the first and last stop is close to Sunset Boulevard) and the one-way bus ride costs 50 cents. Just make sure to have coins, the driver cannot give you your change back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZanetaB27
50,Planetarium show,"We watched ""water is life"" and it was beautifully done. Our preschooler was with us and enjoyed the experience as well. The observatory has a ton of exhibits for all ages. The views of LA and the surrounding landscape are lovely. Also good for hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rumblingstrips
40,Stunning views of Los Angeles,"Griffith Park Observatory is somewhat of an icon. Even if you are not into astronomy it is worth heading up there just to take in the spectacular views. On a clear day you can see all the way from the ocean across Santa Monica, mid-wilshire, a tremendous view of downtown, and even further east to the mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwangers
50,A Must See at Night,"This was on my son's must do list and so we trekked up to the Observatory. I am really glad that we went.

Incredible learning opportunity for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMACsMom
50,Best views of Los Angeles,"Don´t miss this place if you´re going to LA. The road up there is beautiful, and the full panoramic views of LA are really amazing as you get to see the whole city from above. The parking can get crowded, but the two times we´ve been there we still had no problem finding a spot. If you´re there on a busy day you can also park down the road. Take a walk around the observatory to see the views from all angles and also to find a place less crowded. We brought food and had lunch in the sun overlooking LA. Beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livrv
40,Beautiful location.,Easy to get to by bus although most people seemed to drive. Great views and an interesting observatory. We didn't have time to explore the miles of trails in the surrounding park unfortunately but did have a coffee overlooking LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichNewt

40,opens at 12 noon,we took an Uber to the observatory in the morning only to find it opens at noon. Never he less it was worth the trip for the view of the Hollywood sign and across Los Angeles.

We wanted to make the most of our time, so we stopped at the Griffith Observatory. Got there really late, but after the trek up the hill it was amazing to be there for around an hour. Interesting inside, beautiful on the outside. Look up inside to enjoy the architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanGold
40,View from Griffith Observatory,"Must visit place in Los Angeles. View is fantastic from Hollywood Hill to Newport Beach.

Prepare to be patient to get a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khanhphotolab
40,Amazing views,The observatory wasn't open. We weren't sure why but the views were unmissable. Easy to get to using a dash bus whoch was very cheap and a must do if u visit LA and can't or don't want to hike to the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsWorldExplorer

50,Fab Views,When we went it was Martin Luther King Day so the observatory was closed but the views from the grounds were amazing. Definitely recommend going here if you have the chance. I plan on returning to do the observatory. Walking from there to the Hollywood sign boasted some fab views. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blue_Diamond21
50,Beautiful,"Great view, parking is affordable ($4 an hour). You have to get there early if you want close parking. Otherwise you're walking quite a ways up to the observatory. It gets a really busy around sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodiS145
50,Amazing !,Amazing view of the city. Night view is breathtaking. Shows are just awesome. One of their kinds. I saw all 3 of them. Favorite was Centered in the Universe. Kids will love this place too. So many interesting models at display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankurs386

50,Best views of LA,"Directions: Take the Metro red line to Vermont Sunset Station, exit from Vermont Ave and take the Dash Observatory bus ($0.50, cash only no change will be given, pay on board). The bus will alight you just in front of the Observatory in about 15-20 mins depending on traffic.There is a walking trail here so those who love the nature and hiking should plan for a full day trip here. This place also gives a clear, unblocked, slight side view of the Hollywood sign.Be sure to catch the programmes in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium, especially Centered in the Universe. Tickets are sold at the counter (on the left when you enter the Observatory), $7 per adult and $3 for children below 12yrs of age. And seating begins 15 mins prior, no late entry is entertained.Here’s a tip: don’t go for front row seats, you’ll get a better view from the back rows as it's a dome shaped projection screen on the ceiling inside the Planetarium.Touring round the rest of the Observatory is free and they’ve got quite some interesting displays. Lots of detailed explanations from the time of the Big Bang to the galaxy, the universe, the planets and stars and even history of time telling. The exhibits are also interactive, with videos, microscopes and even weighing scales where one can see how much you'll weigh on the different planets.It’s a great place to view the stars, in a huge unblocked wide sky. Suggest you come in the early afternoon around 2, which will give you sufficient time to go through the exhibits, catch the programmes in the Planetarium and stay through till night so you can capture the beautiful skyline from day, to Sunset, to Dusk and then night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyhx
50,Go here for the view - it's awesome!,"After years of traveling to LA I finally went to the Griffith Observatory - and what a treat it was! The view at night was spectacular! Be sure to put this on your ""to do"" list when visiting the city. The museum portion is ""okay"" - by no means Smithsonian quality , however the view is what you want to see. Parking is limited, so be prepared to walk or catch a shuttle at the bottom of the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USMEagleFan
50,Amazing setting and worth the drive,Part of the fun in visiting the Griffith Observatory is driving up the mountain through residential areas to get there. The visit doesn't take long and parking is very easy and convenient. Fun family outing. The lightening exhibit was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjacksond
50,Observing the Observatory,"My visit with my husband to the Griffith Observatory was great! We parked in the free areas below and hiked the rest of the way. The Observatory park trails were a little intense if you are not an active person so please keep that in mind. The views are fantastic. You can see the Observatory, the LA skyline and the Hollywood sign from up there. Coming down we walked through the Observatory which is free. Very nice and educational for kids. I would definitely do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aishany1
50,Stunning,This is a must! Beautiful scenery and wonderful views!!! Just beautiful!!! Parking is free is you go before 12. There is also trails that lead you up to the observatory as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4818AFkarenc
10,No Parking. Too Crowded.,Don't know if this place is nice or not because I drove around for 45 minutes and never did find a place to park and finally just gave up and left. So thick with people you can't move.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricknie
50,Great Visit & amazing views!,"This was my 2nd time to the Observatory. We arrived late on a Thursday night (8pm), but were able to find metered parking. The best time to visit is sunset for a spectacular view of the Hollywood Sign, but we could not make it that early. I love the observatory, so we went anyway and really enjoyed the night time view over all of Hollywood and Downtown LA. The Observatory itself is very interesting if you like Planetariums. I am a self-proclaimed science nerd, so I find it quite interesting, especially the lower level exhibits. You do not need a lot of time here, but expect to spend at least 1.5 hours. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting the LA area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMRetzke
50,Free of charge,"This place offers a nice view of the city of Los Angeles: if you are able to, just go and visit the place !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jentet2016
40,Crowded,"Out to one side the parking ticket and the crowds, the trek getting there is absolutely worth it. The views across to the Hollywood sign are about as good as you can get. Additionally the Observatory and the museum are worth a visit, understanding the history of the building and Griffiths himself is enlightening",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardmT1850IB
50,Los Angeles and Griffith Observatory goes almost 'hand in hand',"If you are visiting LA, don't miss this place. If you loved La La Land, don't miss this place. If you trust my review, don't miss this place :)))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JUNI-BANERJEE
50,"Interesting, educational and spectacular view","My kids took me here on my recent visit to Los Angeles. I have been to LA many times and heard of Griffith Observatory, but have never been. It was a wonderful experience in so many ways. Parking was reasonable but there was free parking if you are willing to walk up the hill. The museum has free admission but there is a fee to get into some shows. There is plenty to see and do free of charge. Very educational. The views of the city were incredible. It was a great activity for all three generations of our family. A must-do if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349ChristineN

50,Great place to visit,We bussed up on the observatory bus which starts directly out from the stairs from Vermont/Sunset metro station. The metro tap card system was unreliable so we had to pay cash for one of us. It was a clear Saturday and busy but we got tickets to two shows to the planetarium which we really enjoyed however the two shows did overlap content. The cafe was good with outdoor seating with great views of the city and Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanB124
50,Very informative!,This place exceeded my expectations as we were only at the park to hike to the Hollywood sign. Very fancy and cool museum type place with so much information. I would return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canadiana25
50,a Must Do in LA!!,"On a clear evening when the sun has set view a beautiful sky through the telescope!The building is a piece of history and movie trivia!! The architecture is very unique to any I have seen and I found it charming.There are lots of interactive things to experience. The Tesla coil is there!If you LOVE photography it is a very special place to get creative.The restaurant is not very good, so I would eat before or after a trip to the Observatory.The planetarium is quiet nice and perfect for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snipart
50,"Beautiful view, nice hike, and interesting attraction","It took us about 45 minutes through a maze of trails to get to the top of Griffith on foot.The hike began at Griffith Park, situated in the northeast area of hollywood.The hike was nice, many people were there as well on a beautiful day about 25 degrees celcius (im canadian). The way up is a bit physically demanding, but not difficult. This is well worth the visit and should be done by foot for the full experience!As for the attraction itself, once we reached the top we found out how beautiful this place actually was. The building is detailed, and provides much info/visuals for visitors to enjoy and learn about some astronomy.The view from the very top is outstanding and worth the visit. Well probably go again if we return to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExoticIslandsTravelr
50,Well worth the visit,"Only drawback is parking, there never seems to be enough. Very informative, their star history show is so amazing, and everything is well kept. Great places to take pictures of the surrounding area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915gracielat
50,Tour visit,Had a great time at Griffith Park and Observatory. Went there with a tour group and explored the place. Just wish we could have gone at night to look at the stars through the telescope. Great place for pics and the price is right. It is the largest city park in the U.S. Came home and watched the movie La La Land which shot quite a few scenes there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KurtR67
50,Worth the Hike!,"Hiked up the mountain to get to the observatory. Free museum and beaufitul grounds - was totally worth the hike up and down. Be prepared to go to bed early though, as the hike is exhausting if you are not used to it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1984GXstephaniej
50,Best to go there in the evening,Awesome place. Do not hesitate to make a little hike above the observatory. The observatory is for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adam115Adam
50,HollyWOOO,"We went just this past Monday and they were filming a tv sitcom at that time so we had to walk from the lower lot which still was not too bad. very scenic place. Not sure if the museum is closed every Monday or because they were filming. I would recommend going to see sun set with THe observatory lit up. Pack a lunch and have a picinic. Restrooms are conviently located too. There are some other walking path's as well, wish we had time to check them out but we were on our way to The Sequoia National Forest. I would certainly spend more time here on my next trip. That way I can really soak in all the beauty from this vantage point. spend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpenberth076
30,"Do not go there during Christmas week, it is crazy busy!","Do not go there during Christmas week, it is crazy busy! Especially in the evenings when people go to see the view. We spent an hour in traffic to get to one of the parking lots (there are like 10 of them) and then walking in the dust to the top. It was unrealistic to get inside of the observatory, stay away and don't go inside, it is so crowded it can be dangerous. The view of the city is still nice :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisa670
30,Griffith Park Observatory,This place was crazy!! All the way from driving around and around and around for a parking spot that costs minimum of 15.00 to the crowds. It was cool to see but not really interesting for little ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdnorth
50,Wednesday evening post sunset,"Beautiful views, friendly helpful staff... A lot of very interesting exhibits. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. There were of course a lot of tourists, so if you can just ignore the craziness of that part - you are sure to enjoy your visit. We were able to park in the main lot of the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktflisa
50,Great Museum and Views,This was an interesting experience with great views of the Hollywood sign. The Tesla Coil exhibit although quick was very cool. There is quick a bit to see in this Observatory. It was very very crowded (but we went on a Saturday afternoon). Parking was a bit crazy. It’s free at the bottom of the hill and you can take a shuttle for $0.50 each way. Otherwise it’s $4 per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lezmi89
50,A good attraction for the last day in LA,"We went to the Griffith observatory on our last day in the city. It was very thrilling to get The Who,e city and valley view after we drove through it in the past days. There is no entrance fee. Just 4$ for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victormG5383EO
50,Observatory,"My fiancé and I did the short hike up to the observatory and the views of LA during the hike were amazing. The hike was mostly on gravel or sand and the angles were a bit steep at times, so proper footwear is recommended. We arrived at the observatory about an hour and a half before sunset, which gave us enough time to look around the facility and take a lot of photos. We then had a bite to eat at the cafeteria while we sat looking out at the Hollywood sign. The most spectacular photo were taken during sunset and the period just after. It was worth the drive and the walk and excluding the food, it was all at no cost. A great way to spend the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Av8ter98
50,A fantastic view!,"We had the privileged to get to the observatory on a clear day with magnificent 360 degrees views from the top. The walk up the hill was all worth the hard work and the Hollywood sign was seen better as ever before. The stroll through the park where one can have a picnic was something to experience. If you want a view of Los Angeles, nothing can beat the Observatory on a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielM158

40,View only on this trip,"We did not have time to actually go into the observatory but we did drive up to it in order to see the Hollywood sign, James Dean memorial and a panoramic view on Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockcole
50,A true highlight of LA,Amazing foresight by Mr Griffith to gift the land and build the observatory so we can look over all of LA. Certainly worth all the accolades in all the reviews. Parking is a challenge as everyone’s noted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graham_international

You can see the Hollywood sign from a different angle, you see the CBD of LA and views all over the city. You can see the Hollywood Hills and the Boulevard.And the Observatory itself is interesting on its inside, especially with its underground exhibits.A must visit in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b_long176
50,Best Free Date in LA,"My Fiancé and I stopped by here one of our nights in LA since we are pretty young so we were on a budget- it was spectacular! We ended up parking way way way down the hill (like probably half a mile or more) down the hill because we went on a Saturday night, coif you can use there I suggest it. Regardless, the walk was scenic and once we got there we never wanted to leave. We ended up paying to watching something in the IMAX- I can't remember what it was called, but it was one of the best experiences of my life. They let you recline back in the IMAX room and suddenly the whole room is covered in the stars and galaxies. I hope everybody gets to experience the magic that is the Griffith Observatory at least once in their life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2172EKrebeccac

50,The Quintessential LA Experience for Tourists and Locals,"Not many landmarks can beat this place. Why? Because it is a museum, scenic view, nature hike, and planetarium all rolled into one.I have taken my kids here numerous times over the past 12 years. One time they had their birthday party here. As soon as we arrived I purchased the planetarium tickets. We took a hike on the mountain and returned for some museum exploration, saw the planetarium show, and then had a picnic on the big lawn. I brought large glow sticks as party favors that they used like light sabors when the night fell. It was a full experience and the kids loved it.Go to the website and check out the dates for the star parties. Those are certain evenings each month when they invite people to bring their personal telescopes for viewing to share with the public. They have knowledgeable guides telling you what you are seeing in the sky.The general admission and parking is free, as well as the Leonard Nimoy film about the restoration of the observatory. The planetarium costs money and is well worth it. There is a cafe and a nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mushigaga
50,LA must see and it's free!,"I've been here previously and I know that the iconic Hollywood sign is visible from this location. This is undoubtedly an LA icon with great views both day & night.We went on the monthly star party where volunteers had telescopes set up on the lawn and you can come up to look. The volunteers are all glad to help and answer questions. The observatory was also open so we went in to look at the exhibits and were in time to see the Tesla Coil demonstration.I underestimated the attendance and we ended up parking down the hill & had to walk up. Shuttle buses were running but they were all full in both directions.I would highly recommend visiting even on an ordinary day/night. If the observatory doesn't interest you, you can't go wrong with the panoramic views of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHIAMTH
50,Million Dollar Views,An L.A. must see. Gorgeous views of L. A. and the Hollywood sign. The building is old and a must see in itself. Wear comfortable shoes because you might have quite a hike from where you’ll probably park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimtravelnut
50,Historical Icon “Must See” in Los Angeles!!!,"The Griffith Observatory provides an awesome opportunity for education about Space for the whole family. The excellent interactive learning, guided stories, and movies opens up your entire perspective. The experience was enhanced by the private telescope owners allowing you to look into space. The architecture of the building and dome housing the permanently mounted telescope are a must to see. Public transportation is the best method to get there. Use the red line then the bus that takes you directly there. Get there early and expect long lines and crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1WorldTraveler9
50,Great for adults and kids,This is a marvelous experience for children and adults. The planetarium shows are very well done. The hands-on exhibits are fun and educational. Go early if you want a parking space on top. Our grandson loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanP731
50,Took a chance,I had been to LA once before. My coworker wanted to see the observatory. It was kind of cloudy and the Uber driver said it wasn’t a great day to go but we went anyway.There is no cell signal up there. They do provide free WiFi. Some Uber drivers are not from the area so they had problems picking us up for the return drive. The driver who took us was from LA and knew to change it over to WiFi.The views from up there are stunning!! A clear view of the Hollywood sign and watched the sunset turned as everything turned a pinkish color. We didn’t stay late enough to view through the telescope but took a ton of pictures of LA from above.Well worth the trip up there!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6661FSryanm

40,Great LA views,"Great LA views . Parking and drive up can be slow process during peak times. Walk or hike a bit and take a small tour, don’t Forget the camera",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babycakesshops
50,My favorite place,"Since my first time in LA I fell in love with this place. Go there even just for a walk, or visit the museum, or go into the planetarium, which is magical.Don’t forget to wait for the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacopor646
50,Great views. Educational and cheap parking.,"This is a great trip for the whole family , with friends , or even by yourself. Some people hike all the way up to the oberservatory, but it is quite a steep walk. Parking at the very top is $4.00 for 1 hour. This is more than enough time if you are just going to take in the views. The observatory is free, and you are able to pretty much wander around the whole place- there are plenty of activities some at additional cost, and it's very good for kids because there is plenty of opportunity to touch/ see . You get to see all of Los Angeles and you get a glimpse of the famous Hollywood sign. My favorite was the sundial, so amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9_Travelbug26
50,Amazing view,The best way to see Los Angeles from above and to understand its size.interesting exhibits.A car is needed for the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anassot

50,A Must-See Attraction,"We visited Griffith Observatory in Jan 2018 & really enjoyed this attraction. There’s a lot to see and take in for all ages. Expect to spend 4+ hours to take in the full experience.Be sure to arrive while the sun is still up so you can view it inside the observatory. We missed it. Bummer.You have a great view of L.A. & the Hollywood sign from the front lawn.It is all pay parking up top, but worth the free admission to the Observatory IMO. If you’re planning on parking below for free and walking up, be sure to read all signs so you don’t get a parking ticket after sunset like we did. HaHaWatch a short movie of the upgrade process of the Observatory hosted by none other than Leonard Nimoy in the theatre named after him.Watch one of the Planetarium movies or look through a telescope at the moon after 7:00pm.Summary: This is a must-see experience you will want to share with your loved ones.PS: If you don’t want to wait forever in a long line on the roof, there’s usually a couple telescopes on the front lawn available to look at the moon that are nearly as powerful optically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamK487
50,Beautiful View of Los Angeles,"If you are ever in LA, you must make your way to Griffith Observatory. It is definitely worth the drive. Traveling up to Griffith was a struggle as we were stuck in traffic, but once we got up there, we were able to find parking quickly. We went at night, and there happened to be a stargazing event that night, so all the lights were shut off and the Hollywood lights was off; but it was definitely worth it as you were able to see the beautiful night time sky and all the city lights.I definitely would go back and this time during the day to get the daytime view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gthao01
40,Classic LA | Incredible Views,"The Observatory feels like classic LA. The charming architecture, the winding road to the top, the views of the Hollywood sign and the sprawling urban grid below.The Good:- The position of the observatory affords you incredible views of both city and nature. The hills reach out below the overlooks and the Hollywood sign stands just above.- Entry onto the grounds and into the exhibit is free.- The architecture and views provide great photo opportunities.- There is also an opportunity to hike the hills, providing you a solid afternoon of activity and sightseeing.Items to Consider:- Parking can be limited, and traffic can move slowly up the hill. If you are capable, consider parking at the bottom of the hill or lower down the hill and walking/hiking up the to the observatory. You will want to take your outfit choice and the heat the day into account.- There is a bus that provides pick-up and drop off at the observatory.- There are shows that run throughout the day. There is a fee for these and the box office line can sometimes stretch a bit.- The observatory can get crowded, especially on a weekend. Be prepared for the crowds and consider a weekday afternoon.- Sunset is a beautiful time to visit. You get the approach of golden hour and can get beautiful shoots.- The lawn or outdoor seating is a great place for a picnic. Be sure to bring water if you are hiking or visiting during a hot day. There is a cafe available if you did not pack your own food or beverage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adponce
50,A must for La La Land fans,"Stunning view of downtown and the Hollywood sign and Basin. Lots of staff on hand to assist. A peaceful haven away from the bustle of the city,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydneyshopgirl
40,Great views and interesting exhibits,"The views of the city and Hollywood sign are incredible, but parking is very limited. Inside the observatory there a some really interesting exhibits and the planetarium is great. There are a number of walking trails to do from here also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianwG657YG
40,Great views,"What a wonderful place to visit, and I highly recommend a stop if in LA. The Griffith Observatory sits atop the hills near the Hollywood Sign. The view could be spectacular on a clear day but even on a hazy, smoggy day it is still nice. This would be a great place to pack a lunch and take a hike around. We did not have a lunch or plan to hike but we had fun. It was busy on the weekend but we found a parking spot without a lot of pain and for free. After parking we walked around the outside of the observatory enjoying the 360 views. We then went inside to check out the exhibits. There is a planetarium inside (for a small cost) that has shows often. We did not see the show but instead walked around all the exhibits on space, stars and how the observatory works. Our kids had fun pressing buttons and looking at the models of planets and the moon. Neat stuff! The also offer a chance a night to look at the stars through the telescope. Our only complaint was that some of the exhibits leave much to be desired, with most of the information so basic that is feels like reading an elementary school textbook. A minor detail in what was otherwise a very enjoyable and memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_Williams191

50,Great views but crowded,"There are amazing views but beware, it gets very crowded, very quickly (both indoor and out). Inside is a pendulum, a museum, a planetarium, and some other cool interactive exhibits worth checking out. The telescope has a schedule, views are great, and parking has a fee (or park down the hill and walk for free). Definitely worth visting and bringing guests new to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberxapocalypse
50,Awesome view,"wonderful view of the city and the Hollywood Sign. It is free to visit, you can view the stars or moon with the high power telescope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisacG4605RS
50,amazing view for eye not camera,"if you are going there to take a picture with the Hollywood sign, then believe me you will be disappointed, because it is far far away from the sign, however, it is a very good place to see the sign with your eyes.one problem there that it is too crowded and with very little parking spots, so what you have to do is to park at the Greek theater which is like a mile away then you take the shuttle which will cost you 50 cent ( you must have cash with you and in the exact amount), the bus will take 10-15 mins although it is super close, or you simply walk.the observatory is great from inside with so many information about the solar system. one more advantage of this place is that you will be able to see the whole LA Area from a high place which is beatiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasjabeiti
50,Unbelievable,Some of the greatest views ever. Really wanted to go there during the night but my Uber driver didn't know what he was doing. So next day I decided to go and I wasn't even mad about what happened a night should since how amazing this place is. Will visit again when I'm back in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isiahb2018
50,Beautiful views of LA,"Awesome views, don’t go too late or you’ll have to park 5 miles away! If you like to walk/hike go prepared, stay hydrated. Don’t forget LA is always hot! You’ll have to pay the parking in advance ($4.00 per hour) and enjoy the views, the building and the exposition inside. If you want to pay, there are more info inside the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741fernandah

50,"City views, fun facts",I didn't see the show as the last one is at 8.45 and 9pm so make it before then even though it closes at 10pm. View of the city is amazing and exhibits are informative and fun. I liked the seismograph as it showed me making an earthquake. You actually can see the sun if you go in the day and I didn't see any stars even though I was there at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R569UQchristinek
50,Amazing!,"I read the history of Griffith and I’m so impressed with him as a man! He is an extraordinary genius who happens to have a generous heart and a love for life and education.The fact that there is no charge to come here, because that’s how Mr Griffith made this so, is wonderful. He wants everyone to come and enjoy, learn and get excited about learning.It’s a beautiful building, with great exhibits and wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign! Extra bonus there! Our 9 and 11 year old grandsons enjoyed it very much!There are telescopes to view the planets after dark. And again, no fee! That’s how Mr Griffith wanted it.I wish I could have met this kind man.Come see! Come learn! Come fall in love with the moon and the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pof69er
50,fantastic,Fabulous views of Los Angeles from her. But best of all there is a whole new world inside the observatory and all for free. The exhibits in the observatory are very interesting and some with hands-on fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerleg12
50,beautiful views,"We visited here on a trip to LA. We had heard great reviews so had to have a look for ourselves. We parked in the car park outside, the sign on the way up had said full but there was constantly people coming and going so plenty of spaces available. You had to pay for the car park which was a couple of dollars. We went and had some photos taken with the hollywood sign in the background as you had great views from here. Then we went to the top of the observatory it was a very hazy day which made it difficult to see the view of LA. We went and had a look at the telescopes and then went downstairs to where there was a section on the planets.We visited the gift shop which was priced as you would expect of souvenirs. Then we went into the restaurant, this was very expensive so we decided to go elsewhere for food on the way back to the hotel. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921jenniferc
50,Beautiful Sunset Spot,"Great place to watch the sunset. The lighting was great for photos with the Hollywood sign (albeit small) in the backdrop. However, coming just at sunset means that you will not be able to see some of what the Observatory has to offer as you need sunlight for that.Once inside, a film showed the Observatory's history and its reconstruction, which was very cool to watch.Tip: If you are on T-Mobile, may sure you check what you need before heading up to the Observatory as I lost signal the whole time I was there. Not sure if others had the same problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summersbea
50,Great views,"Stopped here in the early morning before opening time. So didn't actually get to go inside, but instead enjoyed the great views out to the Hollywood sign and L.A.. However, the whole of L.A. is covered in a thick layer of smog, so views are somewhat limited.The building itself is stunning, with wonderful architecture and arches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9838QXsarahb
50,Great views of the city - and the sun!,"This is where you need to go for an easy selfie with the skyline and the Hollywood sign. There's plenty of free wonders in the observatory - my favourite being the telescope that lets you view the sun without burning your eyes out... I saw some nice solar flares. My tip would be to catch the shuttle at the bottom where there is free parking, you just need some change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobys88
50,Wonderful,Beautiful views of LA from the observatory. The drive up is also very lovely. On a clear day you can see all of the great architecture of the city and of course the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodTimeGal78
50,"Great experience, not just a view of LA ...","I went there with my family mostly interested on the view of LA and Hollywood sign from there, found something else. The building itself is beautiful, great architecture and the interior is fantastic. From a science perspective it offers great options including a lot of information about the Cosmos and solar system planets, my kids loved it. Did I mention that the entrance is free ? We went there in the morning as parking spaces are limited close to the building, but there are a lot of tour options as well. And the panoramic view from LA is excellent from there. A very good experience, you should not miss this place in your trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505walterv

40,Quick drop by during the day,Nice quick drop-by during daytime. Interesting and small enough to appreciate as a “last hurrah”. Beautiful view of LA but must be better at night with all the city lights on. Make sure you book your ride back before you arrive as the network signal disappears as you reach the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertgan

50,Great learning facility and fantastic views,What more can you ask from a facility that is free. I would say that science and space lovers will get the most out of this experience but the view of LA at night would probably be worth it for anyone. Space exhibits are well thought out. Facility is clean and well maintained. The place is huge. Give it two hours if you want to do everything including planetarium and telescope.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoSieber

My 10 year old grandson loved it and said things like Oh that's what our teacher taught us this year. Fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janieray
50,Perfection in one building!,"This has always been on my bucket list to visit, and lets just say that it did not disappoint. You begin with a long and winding road which takes you up the mountain. Upon arrival, the building is straight ahead of you which displays all of its glory. I would highly recommend making your way to the viewing areas at the back of the observatory, as this would allow you to make sure that you take the best photos in the day. We were lucky as we arrive prior to the sunset, so we were able to take day photos and then made our way inside. It is like another world inside, as there is so much to see and do which could take you hours. We then made our way outside to the roof balcony, where we were able to see the sun setting over the Hollywood sign which truly took my breath away (I know this sounds cheesy, but honestly it is amazing). After taking a ridiculous amount of photos and videos, you are able to see how the city transforms by night and how it lights up.We asked locals about the best way to get back down to the city, and recommend the bus as it had several stops on the way down. I would recommend keeping an eye on the time, as you may miss the last bus back down to the city. The bus only took about 10 minutes to arrive back into the city, and caught an UBER back to our apartment in Hollywood. Overall, this is a must see if you are visiting Los Angeles and is on my list of things to do when I return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlevans15

Parking was $4 an hour, we only stayed for one hour but it was well worth it.On the drive up to the observatory's main car park there were a lot of people parking roadside and we weren't sure why as there were plenty of vacant parking spaces in the car park above!I would recommend a visit here even if it is just for the photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onlysophie
50,Even if you live in LA...,"The Griffith Observatory is beautiful as an outside destination, with stunning grounds and spectacular views of the city and ocean (sunset is gorgeous). It is also beautiful as an inside destination. Make sure to catch at least one planetarium show while you're there. The cafe is vegetarian friendly (much appreciated) and the exhibits are educational and engaging for people of all ages. We've gone as a family, as a school field trip, and my daughter also had her 13th birthday party with friends there. Even if you live in LA, it's not just for tourists. You'll be so glad you went! The lot fills quickly, so just give yourself time to park on the road a little ways down and walk up. Also bring a warm jacket (even in the Summer) it gets cold up there once the sun goes down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellemariew
50,Beautiful views from everywhere,"Beautiful sunsets, amazing view of LA downtown and Hollywood sign (please note that there are no lights in night for the Hollywood sign). If you have time, do check out their shows - they are worth your money. The museum is also nice. Would recommend going there at dusk - so that you can enjoy both the light and the sunset. The observatory looks beautiful in the night. The other thing to note is that the phone network is very poor in Griffith, so you might not be able to book an Uber. Catch the shuttle from Griffith that drops you back to downtown and has a good frequency.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/85kirank

40,Fantastic Los Angeles but be aware of parking and the GREEK,"I am a native Angelino, and I feel that this is a must see place in Los Angeles. The parking is tough, it's sometimes horrendous. If you have a motorcycle, I suggest you ride one up because there's front line Motorcycle parking. Great place to see LA. If you can be fortunate to come up here on a clear day, eweather gods must be on your side. They're cracking down on filming things, I'm not sure why. Pictures you can take whatever pictures you want to. Great views, great for your instagram. There has been a recent trend of people sitting in the front lawn and just hanging out, which is COOL but they're bad about sharing space. It's free. Share the space share the road.Few ways to get up, and also, watch out for events at the Greek that might slow down your commute up to the observatory. Great landmark, great must see for LA visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taesian

We came early - at 10:30 am, and Observatory opens at 12pm so we had time to look around and it was interesting to see the orbits of the planets on the ground and other. Then we came in and bought the tickets to the show The center of the Universe - it was interesting experience. Observatory is total free except the shows so before the show we had time to learn about the Sun, Tesla coil, stars etc. there are a lot of interactive expositions, so we tried to press and move everything we can:) And taking into account that we 30+yo and it was really interesting to us, could only imagine how the kids are interesting in it:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olgaklimenko

Being able to surprise him by taking him out of school and driving to California to go to the Observatory for our first time was an experience we will never forget.It is an extremely large and beautiful building. Walking in we felt that everything wasn’t cluttered and easy to navigate through. We saw one of the Star shows they had which was really exciting informative and fun. The Tesla Coil was one of my favorite parts as well. Then lucky us, after getting a snack down at their snack station we were able to go outside and watch the beautiful sunset across the valley. How amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LasVegasBarbie

There is an excellent view of the Hollywood sign from the grounds also. The museum at the observatory is excellent including a large display of the solar system. I love the planetarium shows. At night the whole place becomes magical with one of the most impressive views of LA and it's sprawl you can see anywhere. Also at night is of course the giabt telescopes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennTheTravelGuy
40,Great day spent at observatory during winter break,"Overall we enjoyed our trip to the observatory. It was informative, interesting and entertaining for my 2nd grader and her friend and also for me. We loved to learn about planets, to weigh ourselves, to learn our weight on the moon, to see giant telescopes, and overall to witness Tesla coil in action. The best part that it’s fee! The views of Los Angeles are impressive and the architecture of the observatory is very enjoyable.We didn’t like the trafic going up and down the hill! It took about 40 mins to go up and about an hour to get down. It was Infernal! We ended up parking at the Greek theatre and had to walk up the hill to get to the observatory itself. The cafeteria At the observatory is also very crowded. This trip reminded me of my experiences of international travel from and to LAX airport in terms of traffic, parking and food quality but I guess we are in LA! So this is the price to pay for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NN999

There are some public nights where the observatory is free to visit, do not come then because it gets incredibly crowded and parking is not available and often times you will be sent away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lasa88
40,An iconic stop for the views.,"The Griffith Observatory is an icon and has some of the best views of LA and Hollywood. The grounds are well kept and nice, but the museum and observatory itself are a bit dated. Some of the exhibits were malfunctioning or broken when we were there. We still enjoyed ourselves and would like to return for one of the night viewings.Parking is a hot mess and I am not sure there is a good solution. I recommend coming at least 30 mins or more before opening hours to get a decent parking spot. We arrived as the museum opened and ended up parking almost a mile away. For this reason i would also recommend good walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomD46
50,Amazing views of Los Angeles,I always take all my friends and family to the observatory. It's a beautiful view of Los Angeles. There is no admission into the observatory. You could hike for free. Kids can learn a lot from the observatory. It's a place for all ages. We always have fun there.It's one of the best places to see in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785linneag

50,"Great, if smoggy, views of downtown LA",A 'must do' place to visit when you come to LA/Hollywood. A lot of parking on the roads to/from the observatory. Easy walk up to observatory and many areas to have great views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA Definitely recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richh954
40,Best view in all of Los Angeles,"You can’t beat the view from the Observatory. It feels like you can reach out to touch the Hollywood sign on one side, from the south side, you can see all of the city.Many, many trails to hike as well.The only problem? Parking. Lots fill up quickly as well as parking on the roads. It is a somewhat a stressful experience to find a spot and lots of morons that are jockeying for spots. My advice is to go really early or off hours. Don’t go on a holiday. If you’re up for a hike, park in the lower lots and hike up to the top.Still, it’s worthwhile to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mako159

50,Fabulous - and free!!!!,"Catch the Dash bus from outside Sunset/Vermont metro and for the sum of 50 cents they will take you to Griffiths Observatory where entry is free. This is probably the best place to get a decent photo of the Hollywood sign and the views over the city are great. Inside you can spend hours reading, watching demonstrations and learning about the universe. For the sum of $7.00 you can attend a live ""show"" which I highly recommend, and when you are done head to the cafe for a tasty snack before heading back on the bus (they run every 20 minutes)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933beea

50,Always a Delight,No visit to this gem in LA's Crown ever disappoints. This visit was no exception. A wonderful sunset view. A visit to the Planetarium. A glance through the main telescope into the furthest reaches of space and the illuminated cityscape creating a dazzling carpet into the distance. Just a few of this visits highlights. My only complaint is the recently introduced parking fees on the approach roads. My discovery was the free parking at the Greek Theatre from where you can hop on a shuttle bus for a few cents. Just make sure you have change. I think it was 50 cent each way. Will always visit here when in LA day or night a must do destination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orlandosheraton
50,Wonderful planetarium and museum,"I visited the observatory one day in winter, and it wasn’t as crowded as I expected. The museum/exhibits were all free, and very interesting to look at. The view, both of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign was amazing - I managed to go on a day with no smog. You could see clear to the sea. However the highlight of the visit was the planetarium show, we saw “Centered in the universe” and both my friend and I enjoyed it. It was entertaining and drew you in - I didn’t want it to end! Next time I go, I will be seeing another show there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfran88

40,Lovely night views,"My husband and I went around 5:30pm in January to see the night views from Griffith. Parking was difficult as the top lot was full. We parked lower down by the Greek Theater and then had to walk up (we would NOT recommend this if you have trouble with inclines or have a fear of heights). The views at the top were great though and definitely worth the ""hike""! We were disappointed that we couldn't see the Hollywood sign since it wasn't lit up, so we'd recommend going during the day if that's what you're hoping to see.The museum itself was small and VERY crowded so all we did was walk through it. It is free, we would not have paid to go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniC4590
40,Amazing views - and the science is pretty good too!,"We last visited Griffith Observatory early on a rainy Friday and managed to beat a lot of the crowds that the weather hadn't scared away. The views over LA are spectacular and though it's the path well-traveled, it's still one of my favorite vistas in the city. On better weather days, I highly recommend taking some serious shoes and enjoying the hiking trails in the grounds.Inside, the exhibits are thoughtfully presented and there is a pleasant oldschool feel to the layout that matches the grandeur of the venue. The Tesla coil is a showstopper, of course, but we loved the planetarium and the space exploration exhibits on the lower levels - some great artifacts and very thoughtfully presented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510bradleyy

50,Another must-see for everyone!,"This is definitely another must-see of LA and you should either plan going two days or staying the whole day, here is why: Its great to go during the daytime and enjoy the views of Los Angeles but at night-time its pretty breath-taking to see all the lights of the city go on and check out the stars! There tends to be a line so be ready with comfy shoes! And if there is a concert, be ready to be stuck in traffic on your way there.

40,"Star light, star bright, the first star.....","Alright, what other type of catch phrase can you use to capture the attention.So our day comprised of up early, and hike to the peak point above the observatory (~ 1 hour) from the parking lot at the Greek theatre. From there in the morning on a beautiful blue sky morning, you can see the city from a multitude of directions, as well as some great views of the Hollywood sign. Then a 40 minute hike down to the observatory (which is free to tour around). Although the Planetarium charges for their feature. The observatory has some great information, and observation tools. It comfortably will take 2-4 hours to make your way through this observatory. Then a 20 minute walk back to the base parking lot, and you are away.One way to experience the observatory!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_tornado67
20,Over rated,"I was told this was the place to see all of LA. No one mentioned how super crowded it was. Huge crowds and limited parking. Thankfully shuttles to top of you can find parking. When you get to top, it’s super crowded. Biggest disappointment was the smog obscured almost all of LA making for poor pictures. I would recommend viewing city from Hollywood sign instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewhC5452QY
40,Crowded but worth it,"Great place for lunch overlooking LA and the hollywood sign. I got a salad and it was delicious. My son enjoyed the exhibits more than the rest of us. Great that it's free, but DO NOT go on a day when there is free parking. It was SO crowded. Go right when it opens to hopefully avoid the crowds. TOO MANY people. We had to park and take a shuttle for a small fee. There was lots of waiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlyssaH118
50,Great view and perfect starting point to go to Hollywood sign,Great view and perfect starting point to go to Hollywood sign.

50,WOW WOW WOW SO BUSY,OH MY GOSH!!!! Holidayed with my wife in your country for 2 months for the 2nd time. First time in 2013 & now 2017. Our first port of call was L.A. We made the mistake of visiting on a Sunday the day before the solar eclipse happened in August. Oh it was packed I would have hated to try & get there on the day of the solar eclipse. We took a taxi & he couldn't find a park so he parked in a no standing zone & we unfortunately only had 5 minutes to look at the views & take a couple of photos. Would have loved to stayed longer & actually go into the observatory but it was like every man & his dog was there. Views are spectacular. Definitely worth going to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickt2311
40,Go at sunset,Free entranceParking can be a drag. It’s 4 dollar an hour.Also the way to get there can be weird depending on your navigation (through residential areas with small winding uphill roads).I found the driving skills of people living there are poor. Very rude and impatient. I understand tourism; coming from Amsterdam; but if you’re rude you get the same treatment back.The observatory offers an amazing view on the city. They have some shows(not free) but we didnt go to any. Every so now and then an operator starts explaining something about the pendulum or the tesla coil; it felt irregular. A lot of picture and video’s of the sun or sunflares but all archive. Perhaps its different during the day.From 19:00 you can queue up on the roof to look through the telescope. Queue started around 18:30. On our day it was looking at.. i forgot.. perhaps orion’s belt.. or was it some sort of cloud on the edge of the galaxy where new stars are formed. Magellanic cloud perhaps. Anyways we were about 20th in the queue from 18:40 and it opened up at 19:10. The thought of looking at something so far away is amazing but the actual view to me was a bit disappointing. I’d rather look at the moon but it wasnt available that day. All i saw was about 3 dots with a bit of a cloud so you have to theorize about the distance and whatnot to make it a bit special. Visually it was not very appealing to me.Would come here again for the view on the city and perhaps see a show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryO81
50,A must see,"Best views of LA, great hiking trails and the observatory itself is very interesting. Parking was hard to find, the time we went the main parking lot was full, but we just drove around and eventually was lucky enough to get one. its not free parking either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyalilovic
50,You must go for the views and the history!,"We had no idea the Observatory was going to be so mobbed...we had to park pretty far down the hill and walk up, which was fine. Later, they added a shuttle from the Greek Theater. Just be prepared to park and walk. Some of the traffic folks were just horrendous in how they treated the guests...people didn't know what they were doing or where to go, and rather than help, some of those traffic guys would just yell and scream at the guests. One traffic guy at the top yelled to another, regarding a car that was trying to figure out where to go, ""Tear him up! Just tear him up!"" It was awful. It wasn't the fault of the guests that parking was so awful. With many coming from out of town, they simply didn't know where to go and directions/signage were non-existent. There was only yelling and gesturing. But...once you get away from that traffic mess and to the Observatory, it's beautiful. Be prepared, also, with water or snacks, as the cafe was closed in the middle of the day due to a ""technical problem"". We had planned to eat lunch there and were pretty hungry, so we had to cut our visit short. I guess these inconveniences and inefficiencies are to be expected with a totally free, government owned site.Anyway, you can buy tickets to the planetarium, look at the exhibits, admire the building, and enjoy the view. The staff/volunteers inside were very helpful. One gentleman kindly explained the ceiling mural for us. It was pretty crowded, so we didn't stay for any of the shows. But, it's still a don't-miss site. After your visit, enjoy the beautiful walking trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveling-family36

50,Prepare to walk,"Parking for the observatory fill up before dawn. Plan for a long walk to see this jem. You'll likely need to park near the Greek theatre, because if you overshoot, there is little parking on the far side and you'll just have to make the trip all the way around. A wonderful place to visit, walk up the hill and bring a picnic lunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266richh
50,Enchanted ....,"Regardless of your level of knowledge about heavenly bodies, this place will definitely offer something which will have your attention.

50,More than one visit,so this is my 2nd time at this attraction. It is better to be there at night to enjoy the night sky esp on a clear evening.

50,Beautiful but Crowded,Not sure if it was of the Christmas holiday but there were a TON of people. We didn't park at the bottom to hike up. We just drove up and parked in a metered space. The place is beautiful that provides a lot of good information to both young kids and adults (especially for those interested in astronomy & physics). We didn't stay for the viewing at the theater. The walk around the observatory is beautiful as you overlook the city and see the Hollywood sign. There was a yoga class held out front and people just hanging out. It's a leisure activity you can take your time with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrossaboss

40,Amazing views of Hollywood,"This was a place I have always wanted to visit and I finally got my chance last November, all I can say is it did not disappoint the views were amazing and the observatory is a great place to explore.

Park your car at free parking and get on the public bus for 50cents/person to go up to the observatory. Dont forget to bring hiking shoes in case you are in mood for a hike with views in between.Not only for views..this place has planeterium and many other interesting scientic things to learn. Felt like it was a tribute to the great scientists in our history.Can also watch the hollywood sign from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nityaraghu
40,See the stars,"Fantastic observatory to see the stars and learn about constellations, the moon and more! Great gift shop, really good cafeteria, or, pack a picnic and sit on the green lawn outside with other picnic-ers. I would have given it excellent (5 stars), but parking is a nightmare. The parking lot is really small, and mostly for disabled parking.

Make sure you dont miss Centered in the Universe show its the most popular one. The line for telescopes can be long.To reach there use the DASH Observatory shuttle bus and the Red Line Metro in LA. Have quarters/cash ready for the shuttle bus they do not accept cards.( I think its 50 cents one way or a dollar),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stn_datraveler

But we spend like 40 minuets while our driver can find us. Because there is not cellphone service at the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vladusv
40,The observatory itself is fascinating......,"we spent almost two hours wandering through the place and thoroughly enjoying the exhibits. If you have any interest at all in science or space then you will definitely enjoy this place. The downsides are the crowds--swarms seem to be everywhere--and parking. Our first trek we parked at the base and took the shuttle ($.50/person one way) which was a wise move as we discovered later when we returned for pictures only to find the cretins in charge of traffic have absolutely no clue what they are doing (too long a story to mention here). Their stupidity is only surpassed by the drivers--one of whom actually followed a pedestrian couple most of the way down the mountain at their pace in order to ""poach"" their parking spot. The driver did not seem to care about the fact that w/ no way to pass he was holding up almost a half mile of cars--not to mention there were plenty of spaces further down.Go for a visit but do so when there are no crowds (if possible). and take the shuttle. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tencatdaddy
40,Top of the City,We were visiting LA and looking for something mellow to do in the evening. We decided to drive up to the Griffith Observatory to check out the view. It was a semi-hazy night but well worth it. We really enjoyed watching the city lights and the warm breeze on a January evening that rocked. It cost $4 an hour to park your car in the lot or free on the hill on your way up. The admission is free but they do charge $7 to look through the large telescopes. Because of the hazy night we opt to just gaze at the view on our own. It was very romantic and lots of fun if you enjoy star gazing and finding a hidden jewel to share with the one you love.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MychelleF_12
50,Loved it family of four,"Everything was awesome probably could do it in a whole day parking wasn’t that cool but it’s a nice little walk up to the thing and then you can take the trails really close get a good view of the Hollywood sign and then at night the view from the observatory is awesome groups ages 9,12,44,43",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgX7387TQ

There's a bus/shuttle going to and from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyalMom8

40,Get there early,"Views are great and the whole experience is a learning experience. Lots to see and great place for pictures. Be prepared to walk up the hill if you do not get there early enough to park in the parking lot. A long walk that is not for the faint of heart. They do allow drop offs for those who are disabled, but you have to talk to the staff to let you up to the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peepye
30,Bad Experience in a great place,"We had very high hopes for this Hollywood staple tourist stop, but had a bad experience this time, in spite of its popularity and better times in the past.First recommendation is to check the weather, web-cams, and their website for any weather or important issues.The traffic on Friday night was horrible as expected. Western Canyon Road was closed to through traffic to force people to use Vemont Ave. It took about 1 hour on Los Feliz to get from Western Canyon to Vemont. Both directions were backed up bumper to bumper.Once we got through the traffic it was impossible to find a parking spot. The top lot was filled, and the parallel parking spaces from the top all the way down Western Canyon road were filled. We ended up parking at the very end of the spaces on West Canyon and hike all the way back up to the observatory (about 0.5 miles).When we got to the Observatory and weather cooled down into the 50's, and a thick fog rolled in very quickly, obscuring the entire view of the city.I must say that the observatory itself is marvelous and a great place to visit. The exhibits are very well done, and very popular for good reason.So we hike back down the hill after about 20 minutes to get to the car, and found that it had been ticketed for $58 for parking outside of the box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okimmigrant
50,Amazing views of LA!,"Wish we had gotten there earlier! We didn't realize that the observatory closed at 5 so we didn't even get to go inside. However, the beautiful views of LA and the Hollywood sign were still worth the trip. We arrived just before sunset and the pictures we got were amazing. We were allowed to stay on the balconies of the observatory after it had closed so we were able to enjoy the sunset and watching the lights come on in LA. I will make it a point to go back and see the observatory itself and take some of the hiking trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmalltownGA
50,Must visit,"An enriching visit with many options to attend events or view exhibits. The observatory website tells has all the details and calendar of course. The view of LA from the observatory is stunning. Time your visit to see the sky at night. ""Free public telescopes are available each evening the Observatory is open and skies are clear.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianB6495
50,Must visit,"If you are visiting Los Angeles and you are given enough time in this city, this place is worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lekler
40,great view,We got to the observatory for the vie and did not actually visit the inside. overall the view is fantastic and worth while the drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galassoe
40,"Stunning views, but very crowded","This being my 11th trip to LA it was my first vist to the Griffit This being my 11th trip to LA it was my first visit to the Griffith Observatory.The place is a must to see, with the view on LA. I suggest going there in the evening to see the lights of the vast city. The Griffith has many visitors and only at the second try we managed to find a parking anywhere reasonably near, but still with a two mile walk. Even the traffic to the area was heavy.The ques to the telescope ware endless so we skipped that part and the tickets for the show one could only get by lining up one hour before the show.Definitely wort to see, but be prepared to park far away and walk or take a bus to the observatory itself. This is a very popular destination, for tourist and for locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mietzner
40,Beautiful 360 degree views,I hadn’t been here in many years. It’s like going home for someone raised in Los Angeles. The building still looks great other than the names carved into the parapet wall caps.It’s a great place to take out of towers for the views.The only negative is the parking. The parking employees were nice enough to let us pull up to drop off our cousin with bad knees to avoid the trek up the hill.We will definitely go back again. We didn’t get to see any of the shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vetski
50,Great Spot to take in view of entire LA City,"Great Spot to take in view of entire LA City. Daytime great to see views to the ocean and Catalina Island. Nighttime view of City Lights. I would visit in the afternoon, park on Los Feliz Blvd and hike up Fern Dell Path. Traffic at night between 5-10 pm very bad and long delays to exit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryA29
50,Most excellent!,"Obviously This is a massive tourist attraction but it's obvious why, it's absolutely fantastic and there is just so much to do for all ages. The brows over LA are pretty special plus there's a great view of the well known HOLLYWOOD sign. We drive up twice in a week just for the beautiful sunset.. it does get busy and parking can be hard but if you preserve its worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joeyanna1234
40,"Go for the view, stay for the museum","The view is without a doubt spectacular. I was also pleasantly surprised with the museum. It was very interesting and definitely worth a look. I took a bus and did not have to worry about parking, but I could see that parking could be an issue. I would not recommend driving or taking a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmabJ4719EC
40,Amazing views,"The view from the observatory is breathtaking. Seeing the city and the famous Hollywood sign is the coolest. The drive up is steep and parking at the top is limited, cost is 4.00 and people don't pay attention when they are walking and driving. Walk around and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joddyd2016
50,Best View in LA!,"They have great shows and so many interesting space exhibits, but the best thing is to go at night and use the telescopes. It is so much fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
50,Griffith,Went to the Griffith observatory on a tour and it is a must. The view of L.A. from the observatory was great and the observatory tour was also great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726nigelp
50,Fun hike and location at no cost,"We started our vacation here and loved it. You can see the Hollywood sign from here and it’s free! The restaurant offer free water, which always appreciated. This is a good place for a family picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yettem2014

40,A sightseers must,One of those places that you need to do just tick off your list. Great views that make excellent photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt-W1973
40,Amazing views,"The views from here where spectacular. Amazing. Highly recommend. However, the parking was beyond horrible. We had to park down by the Greek Theater and take a bus up. That worked well. Definitely bring the camera. Fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A69UNmichaelh
50,A Must in LA,"Griffith Observatory is one of the few ""destination destinations"" for angelenos and visitors alike. It's a deco masterpiece with 180 degree views of the city. To see LA sprawling below you from downtown to the left and the beach to the right; well, that alone is worth the trip. Tip: Don't try to drive there and park, instead park on Vermont and take the free shuttle bus to the Observatory. It will save you time and frustration. For those of you so inclined, you can hike from the bottom to the top, or vice versa.If you're in the area, try to catch some live music at the Greek Theatre. It's an awesome place to see music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39ronk
50,I will be returning more frequently,"I had visited the Observatory years ago when I first moved to L.A., but because of perceived issues with traffic and parking, I had not been back for about 20 years. Recently, I had the opportunity to return to Griffith Observatory for a private function centered around the [then] impending demise of the Cassini Spacecraft by sending it into Saturn's atmostphere.There is ample parking for several hundred cars at the Observatory, but it is easy to get lost on the twisting roads, especially if authorities block roads for any reason as they were doing that night. Plus every road in the park was lined with parked cars on both sides (if possible), so one wrong turn means it takes a while to find a spot to turn around! In future, there is convenient and easy parking near the Greek Theatre (as long as there are no events there) and free shuttle buses to the Observatory OR a short (but steep) trail up to the Observatory, which would be preferable, not to mention healthier.The views from the Observatory are perhaps the best in L.A. Sunset up there is magical. Photos of Griffith, with the city lights behind it, are breathtaking. Do check out views from all the terraces, and the Promenade is not to be missed!The Wolfgang Puck ""cafe"" is more like an upscale, expensive 7-11 for choices (except 7-11 has more); expect ""Stadium Prices"" on everything, but do grab a table outdoors on the balcony--there isn't one without a view. The gift shop across from the cafe was great but unfortunately closed early, so as nice as the shopkeepers were about politely getting us to leave, I could have spent a good 30 minutes checking out the stuff for sale (and probably a lot of cash!).With the special talks and features planned that night for the function, I also didn't have enough time to see all the exhibits, but the ones I did were phenomenal! Don't miss the Tesla Coil, or the ""wormhole stairway"" (there must be a sign explaining it; my friend just lead me to it and explained--but there's a circular, enclosed landing between two sets of wide, shallow stairs where you should experiment solo and with a friend...speaking, whispering and listening!). I could have spent a solid hour just looking at the Cosmic Connection display on the ramp, displaying the history of the Universe using 2200 pieces of vintage to modern jewelry. Staggering.The greatest thing I got a chance to do was go to the roof and look through the Observatory's original 12-inch Zeiss refracting telescope at Saturn--my first real view! I spent 17 years working with a spacecraft orbiting that planet, yet I only saw Saturn ""directly"" just before Cassini's end. The telescope was very cool, but I couldn't stop seeing scenes from ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and ""Bowfinger"" at every turn!Tip: spend some time chatting up the Observatory employees. I learned such interesting facts about the building, construction, earthquake fortifications, the history of the place--even the marble on the floor of the Rotunda--from the guards. They're all so knowledgeable, and they love to share that knowledge. You'll gain fascinating tidbits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/native210
50,Amazing sunset views!!!,"This place is just wonderful, the main observatory entrance is free and there is a very cheap bus that will take you up or down the hill. Seeing a show at the planetarium is also a must-do! I highly recommend to try to get there at the sunset. The views are just lovely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martynak571
50,Fun and educational for children and adults,"The iconic observatory, remodeled recently, retains its Art Decco charm while using advanced interactive museum techniques to impart wonder at the information it shows. It is good to get a ticket for the wonderful planetarium show in advance. Parking is rather limited so may require a hike up the hill to the observatory. The display about the planets, what one would weigh on each planet, is fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anacarolina
40,Great Attraction !,You can spend several hours at this attraction- so much to see and do. Outside you can see the Hollywood Sign on the hillside ! Must stop if in the area !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352bobs

50,Great places for locals and tourist.,My husband and I moved to LA 3 years ago and this past September we finally went to the Griffith Observatory. WOW we should have went 3 years ago. This place is amazing. The views are amazing but the Observatory itself is fantastic. I love all of the interactive stations they have. We have gone back one a month since Sept. 2017. Take the time to go and see this even if its busy it's still worth it. Also check out some of the event that are going on at the Observatory also worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannono139
50,tops,Light show is amazing. The Zeiss telescope is good fir gazing. Adult fee is still 7 dollars. Better value than Disney or Universal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanawan
50,Must Visit,The views from the observatory are spectacular. This is a must visit place when in town. We arrived right around sunset and are glad we did. The traffic getting here was a bit tough therefore we had to walk quite a bit but it was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnc7200
50,Great Views!,It gets really crowded during the evening. One of the best spots in LA to see sunset and city views. We watched two of the shows and it was a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saumyasingla
40,Good view point of the Hollywood sign,"Great observatory, good history, great little space and science related displays. Most people go there for the viewpoint of the Hollywood sign. The views of LA are pretty decent too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9192GBandrewl

40,A lot to see here,"You can spend half a day here: the view of the city, the grounds, the architecture, the astronomy exhibit in the lower floor (which is fantastic), the film detailing the history of the observatory. Because it's such a famous destination, parking is difficult and the place is fairly crowded (we visited on a weekend). You may have to park below on the hill and hike up, but it's worth it. Couldn't believe that entrance is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/litedee
40,Beautiful Sunset,We were here over the xmas period so it was extremely busy. Took us a while to get parking but once we did it was worth it. Great sunset over LA and lot of walking tracks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalymelissa
40,great day out,a long meandering road to the top of the hill gets you to the observatory.a few stairs to climb whilst in the place but worth the climb for the views .inside lies a huge pendulum as its centre piece hanging from the ceiling. what i liked most was the information and interaction especially for kids about our universe and surrounding planets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selky
50,Beautiful sunset,You need to drive up or take a shuttle from the museum. The climb is a bit taxing for the unfit. However worth the effort. View is spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKC9318
10,"Nice place, but beware of car break in","Nice place but not nice to see your car broke in and stuff stolen.. few cars were broken. Do not leave anything in the car, not even invaluables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amolhan
20,Couldn't get near the place,"Unfortunately we only had a Saturday to visit. Traffic was nuts. There was a cross country Mountain Bike event happening near the Greek theatre. No parking anywhere on the hill. It took us 90 mins just to get up/down without ""stopping."" (We were stopped, or barely moving, most of the time) We opted against the hike back up from Suburb level. Such a shame, but instead of sucking dollars out of everyone to park, I think they should ban vehicles on peak days and only run shuttles/hike up from a lower Carpark base. We obviously can't review the actual observatory experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sickaworkin
50,Great view but be prepared for heavy crowds,"my party of three started out at the bus stop at the streets los feliz and vermont waiting for the dash bus going up but since it would come in 30 or more minutes we decided to take a lyft up to the actual observatory instead. the vermont road leading up was extremely congested heading up and the speed of traffic was the same if not slower as walking up. However some point up around the greek theatre the traffic was redirected and it cleared up really nicely! Can't imagine the parking tho since all the lots appeared to be full. the view up there is stunning and the hollywood sign is also visible. the view was especially gorgeous at sunset and after dark when the city was lit. the inside of the observatory was also nice and informative (plus clean bathrooms) with exhibits explaining different astronomical things. the lines for shows were long although we did not attend any. there is NO CELL SERVICe (i believe there was wifi provided) there was a huge line for the bus going down for 50 cents a person. they did a good job accommodating the crowd with many buses coming up allowing all of the huge line to get on, however it was not posted or announced ahead of time that the bus did not take you all the way down to the streets but instead ended and dropped everyone off at the greek theatre with a long way back to the main streets. this was not normal and seems to be something changed for the holiday weekend. due to the lack of service we walked down the vermont street leading up for about ten minutes until we got signal again and could book a ride. not too big of a deal luckily since we were able to just walk all the way down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486ananditap
20,They charge 4$ for parking on side of rd,Parking is a nightmare and they charge 4$ fir parking on the side of the road and you still have to hike up to the observatory. Overrated attraction that is more of a hassle to get to than the actual experience of observatory .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422jh
40,First Time!,"We came here to get great views of LA and beyond. However, we came at night. I recommend to come during the day if you want to get a good view of the Hollywood Sign. We didn't venture inside the observatory, as it was pretty crowded, but it did have nice views. It's an iconic place, and a must see if visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevina520
30,Good observation point of the city,"We went up with everyone else to see the sunset. Very crowded, but great views of the city. When we were leaving around 7pm, Park was clearing out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyW84
50,Must visit spot in LA,"Blend the finest natural environs with impressive science exhibits and you get Griffith. If you like science with fun outing for you and your family, this is a must visit place. To top it off, there are several easy to moderate trails that start from Griffith. This observatory is as beautiful to look at from distance as it is to enter and learn about our planet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NitinSS
50,Great view of the city and the observatory is very interesting,Came up for sunset and Uber brought us here from Dolby Theatre. Definitely plan for a little longer then Uber says due to number of people doing the same.Excellent facility and it is free but highly recommend the planetarium show. They had the telescopes setup around the grounds to check out and that was informative. Check if SpaceX is launching as we missed the launch before Xmas as we went inside at the wrong time.Also the Hollywood sign is not lit so make sure you get up with lots of light if you want pics of thatOverall highly recommended but plan for lots of people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998kenb
50,Amazing spot ruined by La La Land...,"This has always been one of my favorite spots for night views of LA, but ever since La La Land came out, tourists have flocked here by the bus load making it impossible to enjoy. It's generating a lot of revenue for the observatory so hopefully that will allow them to upgrade the place and when the crowds die down in a couple of years, the place will be better off than it was. But until then... I've relegated this one to ""tourist trap"" status.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmznoh
30,"Too many people, too much smog","Get tickets for the shows. View would have been amazing but the smog was awful.It was super crowded when we were there. If you can handle it, park at the bottom and walk up. It was a great hike. Just wish the views had been clear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julnilsmith
50,Nice to see LA from this perspective,"I had never visited Griffith before but it offered a great view of the city. Fascinating exhibits, all for the right price. Iconic building that I’ve seen in many movies. Great view of the Hollywood sign. Beautiful sunset. Worth a visit simply to see the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kato-Canada
40,Crowded but amazing view,Bring change as there is a 50 cent charge each way / person for the shuttle. In the night it was very crowded and was filled beyond imagination. I would recommend going in the day as it will be easier to see and spot buildings and less crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidarthg2017
50,A must-visit! A must-see,Whoever goes to LA should really make an effort to come to this place. The view here is spectacular. Parking can be challenging. Wonderful way to just spend the whole day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShufenC27
50,Fantastic!,We loved everything about this place! It was the high light of our trip. We would definitely return and recommend this place to anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredie657
50,Terrific Views - Difficult Parking on Busy Days,"We went on a Saturday during the Xmas/NYE holidays and the place was packed. Parking was impossible. The staff were redirecting cars away from the top as they said it was full closer to the observatory. I ended up parking a long 20 minute hike away and still had to pay for parking. Ugh.Some tips:- get as close as you can an drop off your group if you can't go right to the top- from what I understand is that you can park at the bottom of the mountain at one of the plentiful parking lots and take a public transit bus that drops you off right in front of the observatory and it's 50 cents. learned that too late.- even though the observatory opens at 10am, we arrived just before that time and the lot was full. clearly the parking lot is open before 10am so suggest going early on busy days.There appears to be a lot of nice areas where people can go hike also.Despite the long hike from my car to the observatory, was still worth it. Beautiful views of the city. Hollywood sign is visible but not that close. Overall, recommend it - especially if not on a busy day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/416Toronto647
40,Worth the view but the journey may take forever,"There’s no denying that this is a great view, but the journey we took via bus included long lines and long waits. The traffic up to the Observatory is slow as well. Great free place to go, we paid a small fee to watch one of the scheduled films which was amazing and really explanatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portiaking
50,Beautiful view of Los Angeles,Me and my husband decided to see the Hollywood sign we had that Uber driver take us but ended up he dropped us off at the end of Griffin park and we had to hike up to the observatory which is a very far hike really great views but a lot of exercise where are your tennis shoes. When we got up to the observatory it was a gorgeous view of Los Angeles and we decided to take a hike hire to see the Hollywood sign it was a great day and had a lovely hiking trip up the Hollywood hills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maygambrell
40,Amazing views - difficult access,The views are amazing. We tried to get there by car but some roads were closed so we had to climb the last kilometer. The road was super dark (we went during the night) and I thought it was not safe to walk so close to a cliff with no lights on. The view is worth it by night. I suggest to come early to be able to get inside as it gets super busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadial561
50,Amazing,What can I say such an amazing place if your in la you've got to go and visit the observatory is brilliant and the views are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul67utb
50,This place is for the astronomer in you,I'm always amazed when ever I come to the Griffith observatory so much to see if your a space buff like me then this is there place to see from shows to eclipse days and showings I been coming here since I was about 4 and everytime was different especially now with the remodel it's 100 times better. You got a beautiful view of our city and the outskirts as well. Planetarium offers lots of things from how tectonic plates and how earthquakes happen to their on seismograph. Various scales and models rocks and meteors hey u can even take a picture with Galileo. If you in the Los Angeles area it's a must see don't leave LA without seeing it for yourself. Thanks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theplumber82
50,Great views!,"Provides great views of the infamous Hollywood sign & LA if it’s not hazy. It was hazy when we were there so we couldn’t really see too much of the LA skyline but the Hollywood sign was clear as a bell.The car lines to get there were crazy long so it took a bit. There’s parking along the road for $4/hour I think but then you still have to hike it to the observatory. There is a parking lot closer to the observatory where we parked & that is also $4/hour.It’s free to get in but it was crowded. Just be prepared. The views are amazing & it’s pretty neat to see the telescope. I didn’t do a lot of research so we didn’t know ahead of time but if the weather cooperates, you can go there at night and actually look through their telescope for free. I think it’s from 5-9 pm.Definitely worth a stop if you’re out doing touristy things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VioletMN
40,Great attraction especially for kids who are keen with scientific stuff,"The exhibits were educational and were presented in an attractive and experimental manner. The kids loved this place. Get to know a lot more about the planet system, how did the Northern Lights come about, star gazing when the sky got dark. And apparently a good spot for photographs, especially of the 'faraway' Hollywood sign. If you are taking ride-sharing transport like uber or Lyft, beware that the internet connection is weak!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familytrips148
50,Observatory show worth the hassle,"The crowds are overwhelming but the observatory show and other displays, not to mention the views of LA make it all worth it! This is a must see stop, at least once, in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhK5320FI
50,Iconic location and it's free to visit,"What an amazing place to visit! Loads to look at both outside and inside the building. Great views of the Hollywood sign from here.Be sure to get the bus (which was ridiculously cheap, $.50 each I think), rather than trying to park as it gets very busy. Visit at sunset and get some amazing photos of downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V283CFalanb
40,"To visit Griffith Observatory, you can have excelent view to see LA & Hollywood sign","To visit Griffith Observatory, you will see the excelent view to see LA & Hollywood sign but to visit there, you better drive by yourself because it's on the top of the mountain.

50,Best Planetarium Show,"We were visiting with my sister and our two children, who are ages 5 and 12. The children were both entranced by the museum and mesmerized by the planterium show...as were we. What an amazing experience! Now the Fern Dell trail hike up to the observatory...that was much steeper and harder than I thought it would be . What a workout!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flwcc
50,"Beautiful View, Great Science, Lots of LA History","Amazing view of Los Angeles and the historic Hollywood sign. Walking the grounds gives a good perspective of the entire area on the south side of the mountain range of Los Angeles.The Observatory is a great science lessons for kids and adults. There are both interactive and short lecture lessons to be experienced. Lazer show is really cool and fun for all. If crowded, may have to walk a bit from parking area. Nearby Griffith Park is a beautiful hike as well as pony and train rides for younger children. A historic Merri-Go-Round is also in Griffith Park which is a classic good time and a location spot seen in many movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9434GJjilll

50,Heaven gazing close to the avenue of the Stars,"Classic architecture and views that alone are worth the trip, this Los Feliz landmark is a must-see for any Los Angeles visitor. Parking used to be impossible, but with new fees and time limits, spots are more available, albeit no longer free.The telescope itself is a far cry from the 100-inch scope at Wilson Observatory, but this is free and open to the public (Wilson is research facility and strictly invite-only)A real plus is one of the best views of the Hollywood hills and sign you will find in all of LA. Open sunrise to sunset, and the absolute best place for a sunrise hike - bonus parking is free and ample early am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetlagjeff1
30,Just OK,"I have heard people talk about the Griffith for years, and after living in LA my whole life I finally decided it was time to go. Walking around was just swarms of people just standing in the middle of the hallways (supppperrrr annoying). I went and saw a laser show also which is the only thing that made Griffith super enjoyable besides the view. When we were leaving so many people were coming when it was starting to get dark and I was curious why since the museum was about to close, guess I'll never know though since there was no advertising for anything happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmclain11
40,Great but parking is ridiculous,The place itself is nice but parking was ridiculous. It took 15 min just to drive up bumper to bumper. Then awhile to find a spot. Still had to hike quite a ways to get to the site. Glad I did it but wouldn't bother again. Also wouldn't do if short on time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdandoy

10,Couldn’t find parking,I drove threw a few lots while going extremely slow. There was no parking except for the bottom of the hill. We ended up just driving thru and leaving,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0darrenb
50,Just AMAZING,"For one, the view from here over LA is unbeatable. Nice area to take photos with the Hollywood sign. The content at the Observatory is also amazing and considering it's free entry, even better. I wish we had more time to explore and read the information available. Definitely worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreamQ7499ZR
50,Breath Taking Views,This is a must see when you go to LA. You get the best view of the HOLLYWOOD sign from here. I suggest taking the A Day In LA Tour which includes this. Or another tour that includes this. Otherwise you might have to park really far away and walk up a giant hill to get there. The tour buses drop you off right at the top and pick you up there too. Not a lot of time needs to be spent here but definitely take it all in. Just beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTAP364
50,First visit with kids,Absolutely enjoyed this trip. We did the “water is life “ in the planetarium and loved it. Would have loved to know that children under 5 are only permitted for the first show so we had to split and leave one behind. Kids ranged from 18 months to 13 yrs old and everyone enjoyed it. Very educational and so much to see but not enough walking space when busy. Everyone walks in different directions. Little frustrating with 6 kids but the buddy system worked wonders. Stroller friendly and easy elevator access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianegN2649PB
50,Enjoyed tremendously,"I went here with my family. I haven't been here since I was a kid. I thoroughly enjoyed the top floor. I walked and read all the signs. I walked down to the leanord nimoy center and was wowed. We sat in in the 4th grade experiment. We also paid and watched the water in the universe show. I like all the updates. We went during the day, when it opened at noon. We spent 3 to 4 hours there. My teenage kids were bored after they took selfies of the Hollywood sign and the city.Hint: buy your show tickets at the self service kiosk when you first arrive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101brada
50,A sky full of stars viewed from the city of stars,"A great day out. Lovely building, great views and set in great park land for hill walking.Fascinating exhibits inside and v helpful staff. Check out the evenings when staff put telescopes on the lawn to allow the public to take a peek at the planets. AN LA treasure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenaS4675BZ
50,Great for family fun,"One of the best place in Los Angeles for all ages specially kids and teens to learn and explore Astrnomy, don't miss the shows tickets are cheap. And have extra time for hiking around the park. Parking An be tricky here, either take public shuttle or UBER from Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GS512016
50,View of LA and a great hike,This is a super activity for a free and active afternoon out. The hike is an easy walk and there are several routes up to suit different fitness levels.Once up take a walk around the whole balcony to see a 360 deg view of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieadventuring
40,We went to see the observatory at night,It was during the holidays so it was a bit crowded but a good time was had by all. We made sure to make time for one of the shows which was quite interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinan559
40,History is Free,"I don’t know if many places around Los Angeles where you can visit a rich piece or history for FREE. The Griffith Observatory has been nestled in the Hollywood Hills skyline as long as I can remember. It’s a beautiful Art Deco structure filled with history, stories and fantastic exhibits. There’s a Tesla coil, telescopes throughout and lots of fun facts about the area.The view is also worth the drive up the hill. Perfect for a romantic outing, a family adventure or as a starting/stopping point for an awesome hike. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crism498
40,Great view of LA,We enjoyed a couple of hours at the observatory. We saw the show and the planetarium and watched the sunset over LA.Watch out on the parking. It is very limited along the approach to the observatory.They have a shuttle from the Greek theater but it only comes by every 45 minutes. It is a mile and a half steep uphill walk from there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846LisaR
50,Great visit!!,"Not to be missed!! We had fun looking through the telescopes, and enjoyed the phenomenal views of Los Angeles. Amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaydee1969
40,Great trip in the evening,Great place to see the Los Angeles skyline. Handicap parking. Free. Some venues laser show do have an admission fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryC1841
50,Seeing Stars,Great Free place in Los Angeles. Family can have a field day. There's lots of things to do and see in there for free. Except for the movie. You can have a magnificent view of the whole city and look at stars at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soraya0916
40,Ms.,"I loved the history and architecture. My main problem is the tough parking (we ubered, thank goodness!) And it was way too crowded for my taste. I did not get to see any shows, lines too big. Next time I’ll go on a weekday, and arrive before they open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarabV7441KC
50,The best of LA in one spot,"Griffith Observatory is great for both casual visits and for those who really want togeek out and stay all day. The view is wonderful and the building itself is worth seeing for the architecture alone! There's something for all age and interest levels, You won't be bored!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonp296
50,Great views,great view of los angeles and inside is very cool as well. parking here is an absolute nightmare but that just makes this a very LA experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonl994
50,We enjoyed the visit,"The drive up alone on a hybrid is fun, then it was even more when we explored it. The Hollywood sign is not good to take selfies. Better bring a camera stand and your camera should have a good zoom range too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911nestorm
50,Art Deco LA,"This is the place you must visit! While large tour groups come here from out of town, it’s also a beloved centerpiece of the city for romantic dates, kid outings and field trips, and guided tours. My favorite aspect is the architecture and details, which house ingeniously scientific relics that still captivate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamliebi
50,Visit the REAL Hollywood Stars,"The Griffith Park Observatory is a must see for any visitor to Los Angeles.Located in fantastic urban park, great for a stroll or family picnic, the Observatory is majestic in its architecture, and grand in its vistas.During the day the views breathtaking on a clear sun-filled day. At night, the citylights make a memorable impression. Both are beautiful in their own light.The Observatory has tours, but it's historic wonders can be explored independently.There is a gift shop and simple cafe located in the building.I would highly recommend taking a ride share service such as UBER or Lyft to the location, because nearby parking can be very scarce.All in all, tourists and LA residents fall in love with the Observatory, it's Griffith Park location and it's panoramic views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardG984
50,It's a must,"Great view of Downtown LA, Valley, Westside and Hollywood. It's free unless you want to park your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dukebdev
40,Must do on an LA visit,"This was a really beautiful place with wonderful views. We got a lot of great photos including some of the Hollywood sign. I highly recommend going inside and experiencing the planetarium show. The stars were mesmerizing and romantic, so a great date idea! Traffic can get pretty bad with the roads only being one lane in each direction so avoid coming during high traffic times if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldtravelSM
50,Day visit to enjoy the views of Los Angeles,"A must see while in Los Angeles. The views are amazing. The architecture is stunning as well. The exhibits are educational, too. A lot of science can be learned in a very short time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suegJ1197TV
50,Soft spot for Science,Absolutely mesmerizing! From Tesla’s inventions to getting close and personal with the real stars through telescopes - a must see in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SvetK734
50,Fun,Stopped by with my wife before we left Los Angeles for a wedding. Definitely a different quiet scene outside the city and some pretty interesting things inside as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shatara
50,Great view of LA,Best time to come would be during the day and not on a holiday otherwise you will find yourself in a long and slow car line to make it to the top. You used to be able to park along the hill and walk up but now you can really only park really far below for free or right at top for paid parking ($4 an hour I think it was). The walk would be pretty far if you plan to hike it up. I would not recommend to walk up if you have strollers or young children or elderly people who have difficulties getting around. For these people I would recommend to just pay the Parking at the top as you will have a very easy and short walk to the observatory. There are restrooms at the site but these can get a long line as well. You can also access the observatory through several of the hiking trails from Griffith Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682cindy
50,Trip,"We went as a couple, got a uber up.Lovley views, the observatory is interesting, great day out and I learnt alot. It's free, which I can't belive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katieeee1234x

40,Iconic place to visit,Worth the visit to this free attraction but be patient with parking and be prepared to walk a bit. The views of the city are amazing if visibility is good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickiwms
50,Must see !,"We had a free day in LA so we went to Griffith observatory, glad we did as it was one of our favourite spots to visit whilst in LA , really nice views and educational as well 😀",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/493troyl
40,Good free attraction - parking tricky,"Worth a visit in the evening but check the show schedule at the Greek Theatre nearby. Normally can park there for the observatory visit, but can't when the show is on. Have to take chances on parking along the road towards observatory - no guarantees there.We spent about 1.5 hours there including a 20-min show at the planetarium which was quite good. Good for family with school-aged kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ER2013family
50,Favourite place in LA,"The views, the exhibitions, the location - what's not to love? I'd keep going back if I lived in LA. We spent a good 4hours and had a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ny2814

40,Stunning photo opportunities,"The observatory itself is a beautiful building against a bright blue sky. It offers plenty of areas to explore for free and 360 views of the hills, city and the Hollywood sign. There are some general areas within the building that offered free exhibits and others needed tickets.We didn’t have time for hiking but there are lots of trails. We lucked out with a parking spot at the main lot but many others parked along the roadway.Our visit was one hour but we would have liked to stay longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellewug
50,Vacation visit,"As a movie fan, I really wanted to visit here & wasn’t disappointed.We parked next to the Greek Theatre and got the DASH bus for 50c each. (You do need exact change and we were waiting for some time)It was well worth the wait, gorgeous views across Los Angeles and a beautiful building.We paid to go into the planetarium too and that was well worth the money. Really emotive show, very effective.Afterwards, we walked back down to the car which was also nice to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmahK174EM
50,Lovely!,Such a wonderful place and it has free admission!! This is where part of the movie Lala Land was filmed. So much fascinating information that we just couldn’t get in in the one hour we spent there. Parking was crowded but that’s to be expected on a Friday night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesleyGulledge
40,Such a great spot and the best view of HOLLYWOOD sign,"Went our first day in LA, this past Friday. Had always wanted to go so I couldn’t wait and it didn’t disappoint. We saw great views of the Hollywood Sign and of the Hollywood Hills. You can park and just pay for an hour unless you want to see the planetarium show. We didn’t, but got to see the rest of the exhibits for free. Definitely a must when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessa954
50,Great views,A must do when in LA. Go at night time for the the view of the city all lit up! Make sure you check of the Tesla coil when it is on show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52tessah
50,What a treasure in the heart of Hollywood,It's free! The views are amazing. You learn. Incredible art deco architecture. And did I mention it was free?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexiacc85
50,"Educational Fun. Yes, I said that!","Not only will you be visiting a historical landmark of Los Angeles, you will learn much about this world if you allow yourself to learn. They do a great job and it's not a big building so that it takes all day. They outside views are just as amazing. I suggest go towards the end of the day so that you get a day and night time experience. They both have their advantages. Enjoy history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michiganbartman
50,Must visit,"The observatory is a must-do for a visit to LA. Just walking around the grounds provides beautiful views of LA, the Hollywood Sign, and the gorgeous art deco building itself. Once you get inside, there is so much to see- the Tesla coil being my favorite. The have demonstrations of it through out the day, and a schedule is in fact posted in the lobby. I wish I had spent more time here. Definitely allow for 2-3 hours for inside and outside exploring, and if you can, get there before it opens. Parking is definitely an issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brinotfromearth
50,Wowzers!,First time visiting this place even though I’m a native Californian! Very impressive observatory set on a beautiful hilltop overlooking the Hollywood hills. Extensive planetarium exhibits including a demo of the Tesla Coil. Had lunch on the patio at the Edge of the Universe Cafe’ enjoying the views. Everyone gathers on the rooftop to take pictures of the sunset. Then at dusk we rushed to get in line to have a look through the telescope and I luckily snagged a spot first in line! It was so exciting to see the moon through the telescope—simply phenomenal! Then as we exited the telescope room we were treated to the beautiful night time views of the City of Angels. I could go back to this place again and again. Very enjoyable!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingCAgal
50,Loved it!,"My husband has been in the United States good many, many times more than me and knows most places I should see. We stayed very close to Griffith Park and it was obviously for us to visit the place. Even though he has seen it several times before. We had great weather (34c) and perfect weather conditions to spend time on the spot. From here you can see the Hollywood sign on the mountain and you also have a panoramic view of Los Angeles. Fantastic beautiful observatory. Visit the site!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fl0rensc
40,Stunning views,"Lovely drive up to the observatory and stunning views once you get there. Good spot to take ""Hollywood"" sign photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElenaTV9

40,"Fun, great views...park in the lot!",Fantastic exhibits and amazing views. Take time to stop for a snack or popsicle and sit on the side deck outside the cafe and enjoy the views.Wait for a parking spot in the lot and don't risk injury walking up the steep road without a sidewalk!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rainiers_075
40,Great view of the city and the stars,I went there at sunset and it was beautiful. I loved the architecture and was pleasantly surprised at the exhibits inside about the stars. Only downside was that it was really crowded and parking was a mess.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellyd2017
50,Awesome,"Fantastic day out ,highly recommended and it’s all free.The views of LA are amazing and there’s so much to look at inside .Amazing place .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happychappy59
40,Very nice view from the top of LA,"This place offers a great view of Los Angeles, it has plenty of hiking trails so you could go there walking, by car, by bicycle or any other way you like.You can also see the Hollywood sign from that spot.Book a show to watch the stars and stay late for the sunset, you will be amazed by the view you will get!Sunset is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trips2spice
50,Great Views of Los Angeles!,"This should be a ""must see"" if your visiting Los Angeles plus it's FREE! It offers beautiful views of Los Angeles and you can see the iconic ""Hollywood"" sign too. It offers some great trails if you want to take a hike and the observatory itself is very interesting with neat exhibits and demonstrations. The drive up to the Observatory is worthwhile and you can go through Griffith Park and you can make a whole day out of this visit if you have the time and interest.I would suggest to see it at sunset but it can be very busy or crowded at this time depending on the weather and time of year. I think the only day it's not open is Monday's. The observatory closes at 10pm each day it's open but their is a charge for parking if you get lucky finding a parking space.It offers a cafe and a nice size store if you want to purchase a souvenir or would like to get a bite to eat while up there. If you visit this place you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,Must visit spot when you come to LA!,"Griffith Observatory is gorgeous. Whether your a science buff or just want a beautiful place to spend the day, this place will not disappoint!You can come in either the day or the evening, both offer a similar yet different experience. A day visit will allow for you to take in the scenery and lay on the grass. An evening visit will leave you with a breath taking view. The inside is open regardless of when you visit. PRO TIP: It get CHILLY!!! Especially in the Fall and Winter to bring a jacket!Have fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sswayy
50,"Everytime you go, you see something new","Go here at hight just to see the view of Los Angeles.Go in the day, look at the sun, wander the rooms, read all you can. Walk the timeline of our planet. There are so many fascinating presentations of our earth and our solar system. Kids would enjoy it as well. Difficult to park, but worth it, or choose to have Uber or Lyft drop you off for some hours of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB606
50,beautiful place,if you want to see the city of LA this is the best place to go!beautiful view of the city and make sure you stayed at night so you can see the the city of LA with their lights on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/det70
50,LONG Ride to get there,"Lovely views, but we decided to go up on a bad day.. traffic was horrendous! Scary long.. but totally worth the visit.. BRING a sweater..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fredgd2004NYC
50,The stars brought to the public,"Drove through historic Griffith Park into the hills above LA. Parking is a bit of trouble. We had to park on the road which still costs 4 dollars an hour. The observatory is very impressive. It is a combination of art deco and Egyptian architecture. There is no admission cost. There are some interactive exhibits and a lot of information. Really little kids wouldn't find it that interesting. There is a camera obscura. The planetarium shows are very cool with reclining seats from which you can look up at the simulated night sky and presentation. Kids under 5 can only come to the first show of the day, you must buy tickets for this. The Hollywood sign can be seen from the grounds and building areas. We visited when there was a lot of haze so the wonderful views of the city weren't clear that morning at 10 am. We covered everything in about three hours. There is a large parking lot but it filled quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilywizard
50,Truly amazing,"Hadn’t been here for over 25 years. The remodel has created a whole new experience. And the remodel itself is a great story. Grandkids 5 and 7 had a great time. I’d strongly recommend. Only issue is Parking, which barely exists. I had to park at the Greek Theater and take bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDHTarzana_CA
50,More than a View,Always have loved this place. Make sure you check the website to see what free activities they are offering since it totally enhances the visit. Making the Comet one is my favorite. All Space Considered is also fun and just intellectual enough to give a Friday night a little pizzaz. Go early and grab a burrito from Yucca's down the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdunn308
40,Great views of LA with plenty of hiking trails,The Griffith Observatory offers great views of LA with plenty of hiking trails. You can also brush up on your astronomy and check out the cafe. I haven't checked for the latest but you can visit the website for the schedule of light shows with music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YazMaTaz
50,If Interested in the Stars and Space - You must go,The show was great. The star displays were beautiful The scenery around the observatory is also worth looking at. Had a great time. This is good for kids and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stan2nM
40,Lots of Interesting Facts and Photos,"Lots of Interesting Galaxy Facts and Photos to see and study. You need to allow enough time to do this else its just too much to take in on a walk through. Especially liked the Pendulum exhibit. Don't think small children would enjoy this. Probably preteens and teens, especially if they have an interest in science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Columbia_Ted

40,Great views of LA,Had some time to kill so got a taxi up to the observatory. On a clear day it's worth it as the views are incredible. Lots to see and do inside and worth a visit for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrDalvin
50,"Worth the view alone, the science is fun and interesting","Hit this on a clear night - the view of most of LA was amazing. Road and parking was busy with cars but everyone was polite. The Observatory inside exhibits are good, though a bit dated. Waiting for and looking through their telescope is worth the time and wait!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WonderingMomma
50,Very fun trip to Griffith Observatory,Visited the Observatory near dusk and as able to view planets from the outdoor scopes set up on lawn. Inside the observatory is also fun. Great view of the Hollywood hills sign too. recommend taking the DASH bus up and down as traffic is congested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3959VUrebeccac

50,The best way to see the Hollywood sign,"The easiest way to get great views of the Hollywood sign. Once at the observatory parking, look at the numbered spot you park your car in (the number is painted on the spot on the ground). You will see parking pay stations through out the small lot. At the pay station you need to enter you parking spot number, pay then place your ticket in ur car on the dash. This is a quick place to vist, the parking lot is right there where you take pictures of the sign. We were able to park, take pictures, view the valley and leave all in about 30 mintues. A quick easy way to get your sign pictures!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debie3682
50,Among Stars,Extraordinary place. Two big telescopes. Would recommend to go when there are less clouds. The parking might be a problem if you do not plan accordingly but there are lot of places on the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenDunk
40,"Educational programs and displays of the universe, plus view of L.A.",We arrived a little before sunset and enjoyed a beautiful view of the sunset with the lights of the L.A. area coming on. The displays inside the observatory were educational and interesting. Wish we had planned ahead to spend more time so we could have taken in some of the programs being offered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LtColD
50,Nice view of LA,"We had great time up there, the cool breeze. The restaurant was a bit expensive and the food was ok. You can get there by hicking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Layaning
40,Early morning is good for views too!,"We went early on a weekday morning (9am) before the facilities opened (at noon) so we weren't able to go inside but we knew that before going. You can wander just about anywhere on the grounds and there wasn't much of a crowd. Parking close to the observatory is limited, though, even at that hour, but it is free until noon ($4/hr after that). It was a stunning day and the views were fantastic. The building and grounds are very beautiful in their own right. From a few vantage points you can get an excellent view of the Hollywood sign, perfect for selfies! We spent about 45 minutes, but could have easily stretched the out if we didn't have a busy itinerary to keep. An iconic location that's worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskul
40,"Worth a visit, allow plenty of time","Visited here one afternoon/evening in late Nov 2017. Took the car b/c b/f has old injury and can't walk far esp on steep inclines. Had been warned that traffic could be heavy, esp during Thanksgiving weekend. Took an hour to get up there from bottom of park! There is free parking about half way up but still a v long walk after that. Parking in marked roadside spaces and at top was $4 an hour I think. Meant that sun had set by the time we arrived, was nice to see evening views of LA but would like to have seen area in daylight as well. Observatory interesting, pity that main telescope was closed off the day we were there. Free entry to everything apart from planetarium. Toilets, limited parking at very top. Certain parts of drive up are one way. Rangers on hand to provide help and info. Marshalls at top to help direct traffic. You can get the bus up, don't know which route nr or where it stops. Would like to come back again during day time if returning to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polymoog
50,6 hours and I could have stayed longer.,"I went up there (by public transport) at about 3:30 PM and didn't leave until 9:30 PM. There's plenty to see, demonstrations and static displays. Time it for the afternoon and watch the sun set into the ocean and watch the lights of Los Angeles illuminate (and be glad you aren't down in the traffic jams). Wonderfully peaceful. Walking tracks should you wish to have a bit of a wander.I can't rate this highly enough - a real shock that it was FREE entry - you only pay for the planetarium shows ($7 US each) which are live narrated and a visual feast. There are 3 different shows to choose from.It would be good for children.Food is many and varied with healthy options.Staff helpful and willing to chat about the displays should you ask.Stay and have a look through the telescope and see where they are pointing tonight.Open until 10 PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quentinh687
50,good place to see the sign (hollywood) and planets,"It was very crowd as it happened to be one of the days that many people brought their own scopes to observe planets. However, it was worth it as we could see moon, sun and other planets with kids. In addition, during sunset we were able to see the sign in a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/613tomo
50,One of my favorite things to do in LA,Such a beautiful place in LA and so great to go to when you want to get away from it all. I love going at night and looking down at the city lights and I love watching the planetarium shows the only complaint I have is why can't you buy tickets to the show online. They sell out so quickly so you have to get there hours early to ensure you have tickets. Other than that I love this place and I still go even if I have to wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alfazakcn
40,Iconic Landmark-Not open every day,"If you’re afraid of heights, take a cab or bus . The information and view is amazing. Can’t understand why such a landmark isn’t open to the public every day due to budget restraints. Check dates and times before taking the trip up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olands2016
40,"Great place for a view, as many reviewers agree","There may be other places to get views like these, but you'll need friends high up in the Hollywood Hills!Yes, parking is a drag. Yes, bathroom lines are a drag (secret: use the one at the restaurant). But even if you don't go for any particular attraction at the observatory (I lived here 18 years and never went inside), staying for sunset is worth the hassle (see attached photos).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErPr
50,Put it on your bucket list for LA,"Its a fun and free thing to do in LA, but be aware, it definitely gets PACKED with tourists and parking can be frustrating. The trails to walk around are beautiful! Make a day out of it - go for a hike, and then head down to the observatory to cool off and learn about science and technology and space! Kid-friendly, date-friendly. They even have a cafe to get some food and relax outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felicityfeline
50,"Views, views, views",The Griffith Observatory is amazing. The hike up is very nice offering great views downtown and also the hollywood sign in the distance. I would definitely recommend taking the walk up instead of driving it doesn't really take that long and it fairly easy even in the heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesuitcaserdiaries
50,I saw the moon!!,"This place is so worth a visit but be warned, if you go for sunset you might be parking miles away. It empties out once sunset is over but the best part was looking at the moon through the giant telescopes.Put it on the ""must-do"" list",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbunny
50,sunset over LA,"love this place , high up the hill over looking La , get there late afternoon and watch the sunset over La, you wont forget it. Then wander round a very beautiful observatory. .look through the telescopes its one of the places in La.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilA1372
50,Overview of the city,"I an amazing time here. I You can see the Hollywood sign very good as well as a full overview of the city. A good exercise, relax your mind out here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973brycee
50,Great views inside and out,"The observatory is in a remote spot in a very scenic part of LA. Many people and many visitors come here to take their photo with the Hollywood sign, but I more impressed with the display of rocks and meteorites that is on the bottom floor of the observatory. Especially great for younger kids. The whole thing is free and there are some guides there that can answer questions for you. There is some buffet style restaurant on the bottom floor looks good but we didn't eat there since it was super-busy. I believe if you don't go at the high-season you can have easy parking space and eat a quiet lunch there with the view of down-town LA (too bad for the constant smog). A word of warning about cell-phone reception, that can be a problem on the mountain and there is no Wi-Fi, so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ngap_82
50,Free Admittance and Multi-million dollar view here. Star parties are the thing!,"This observatory must have been on every local school field trip list. As a child at 7 years old I recall a delightful planet story presented visually, musically and caused us to look up in the theater to see the stars dance.That warm and fuzzy memory engendered a return as an adult. Armed with words exceeding one syllable now ascending steps to this Observatory in the sky with some of the best views in Los Angeles---what I found within was a secret.Colonel Griffith J. Griffith said “If all mankind could look through that telescope, it would change the world!” opened in 1935 and ranks high on my list. Telescopes like Solar, Zeiss, and smaller portable telescopes (situated on the green grass). Visit and look up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/170indiac
40,Art nouveou building,"So If you like this kind of architecture , this building its great . You do have a big problem tho. And that is the parking . Been there on a Sunday night with a friend . We never had a chance ... did the tour to the hills and back twice and we really couldn't find a parking spot . We thought will get revenge next morning which was Monday . 10 Am we got there . It true we got a spot , but can you imagine the parking lot , at that time, being 70% full ...so better get a bike .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tudorc923
50,A trip for all,"This really is one of the rare gems in Los Angeles, that can be great for a date or impress someone or for a family outing or for a visit to LA. First it is free! They have movies which are still reasonably priced. This is located next to the LA Zoo, plus in a really trendy part of LA so lots of good restaurants. It is also next to a good hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleeng2567
50,My favorite in LA,"When I first learned about the observatory, I thought it was just a popular building to come and watch the sunset. Turned out to be a huge astronomy museum with tons of cool things and so much information. I watched a show in the Planetarium and I was completely blown away. They also have a huge telescope to see the moon and other planets. You also get a view of LA at night, which is also very nice. This place is a must when you're in LA, whether you're interested in astronomy or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sechpham
50,A must-see in Los Angeles,"We just wanted to say how thankful we were that someone suggested we spend an afternoon here. Beautiful space, beautiful views and beautiful exhibits, a true la-la land experience. Very romantic and pleasant outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atherton_Boston

50,Very cool (and free) public star party,"We were in town for a wedding and were looking for something to do afterwards. We noticed that the observatory was having a public star party where local (amateur) astronomers would set up telescopes to let people take a look at various stars/planets. This was really cool and I think its a great way to introduce people to astronomy. We took our 7 year old son and 13 year old daughter and they enjoyed it.We briefly looked in the observatory itself and would definitely consider going back. It was very interesting and entry is free.The best part, for us, was the great view of the city. We only were there at night, but it was beautiful and I imagine the daytime view is just as spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasoncG6425VD
50,First time at Griffith Observatory,"It commands a view of the Los Angeles Basin, including Downtown Los Angeles to the southeast, Hollywood to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. The observatory is a popular tourist attraction with an excellent view of the Hollywood Sign and an extensive array of space and science-related displays. Admission has been free since the observatory's opening in 1935, in accordance with the will of Griffith J. Griffith, the benefactor after whom the observatory is named.We watched a movie narrated by the actor Leonard Nemoy that described the observatory’s history and facilities. We watched one of the shows (charged for it) in the planetarium which was excellent.Different exhibits on mans interest in the universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerJaneCourtney

40,Evening Viewing,"6 people for evening visit to the Observatory, including outdoor telescope viewing.Parking was an issue, be prepared for parking to take some time.Some exhibits are showing signs of age, but were generally informative. One of the kids ""got"" some concepts previously studied when seeing the concept presented in the exhibit.Telescope viewing was good, wait times were reasonable for viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhxSpeak

50,Great View of the Hollywood Sign and City,"Make sure you spend the $14 to take in a show in their state of the art planetarium, it’s narrated live and they do a great job of storytelling. A walk around the observatory and a look at all their displays is very educational. Parking is next to impossible here so if you aren’t in a mood to hike to the observatory then I recommend taking an Uber or taxi. The views are amazing so make sure you bring a camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c-shell71
50,Great place even if closed,You can make your way up the mountain by car to get great views of the city and the Hollywood sign (even if the observatory is closed). Parking is available at the observatory for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueSki3s
30,Something fun to do for a few hours,"My family visiting from out-of-town decided to check out the observatory the day before Thanksgiving. Make sure you know about parking before you go, parking near the observatory is $4/hr on the street or you can park for free and take the $0.50 shuttle however it runs every 30 mins so if you just missed it (like we did), you'll be waiting.The observatory is awesome with lots to see, especially the 30 min planetarium show for $7/person... but for me it was the LA city views that I loved. Especially around sunset, the Hollywood sign to the north, Santa Monica and the ocean to the west, and the city all lit up to the south, great views.Definitely we'll be back but will time it so we can also see the observatory that opens after 7pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrstats69
50,Out of this World,Exciting for astronomy fans - can view heavens through high power telesope. Magnificent view of LA. Not to be missed both for location and infromation available.Staff is very knowledgable abd inter4esting to discuss astronomy with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14judiths
50,Incredible day!,"I had such a fantastic experience when visiting. I would highly recommend visiting the shows while there. I would also recommend going up just before dark so you can experience the view going from day-night! Such a beautiful view, really topped our visit off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellemb1611
40,Beautiful views but get ready to ‘hike’,"We visited day before Thanksgiving after a trip to Warner Brothers Studio Tour. Heard excellent things about it. Went early evening; 6ish. Parking was tight at top so we parked towards bottom of hill (and it was free...shocking!) and made the 20-30 minutes pilgrimage to the summit.Somewhat winding. But narrow. Little bit dark in spots - but hey; I’m a city dweller and not necessarily used to these things...lot of volume going up and down the path, and of course some don’t understand ‘single file’ and basic human courtesy but what else is new...Views on the way up and at the top were brilliant. Sweeping panoramic of LA skyline. Outstanding. Breathtaking. Must see.Went into the actually observatory. Beautiful building. Very crowded. Bit confusing.Made our way up the top and again, views were stunning. Line for main viewing area/telescope was too long. We passed.Worth the visit for sure but make sure you have comfortable shoes.Solid B+/A-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markpicc
50,Like being on top of the world!,My husband and I loved visiting the Observatory. The planetarium program was fabulous! The narrator was soooo good! the displays and outside views alone were worth the trip! Glad we did it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieJacobson
40,great spot for sunset-over-LA,We drove here and paid the meter to park. We came to really just watch the sunset over the city. The Hollywood sign is no longer in lights so a bit of a disappointment .The drive to the GO is interesting -almost ran over a group of coyotes! Had we had more time we would loved to had hiked instead of driving up. The Observatory itself is ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubuli32
50,Best views of Los Angeles at sunset and at night,"If you want to see amazing views of Los Angeles, head to the Griffith Observatory. I strongly recommend you head there very late in the afternoon if you want to see the city as the sun sets. Seeing the bright lights of Los Angeles at night is just incredible. If you have around 3 hours to spare, the experience is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
50,Enjoyable evening,I was blown away by the interactive and enjoyable scientific aspects of this museum. The view over LA is also incredible.I really enjoyed the thermal camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598jessicao
40,Worth going,It is very worth going there once in Los Angeles. It offers the best views from the whole city. Highly recommended!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoletaJamesSaar
50,Beautiful views and educational,"Take the time to visit!! This was so worthwhile, I don't know why it took us so long to finally come here. I was really amazed by all the info and how much I learned. Let yourself nerd out on the solar system and periodic table of elements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunDancerSmith
40,Good place to spend couple of hours,"If you like Science, this is a good place to know facts about lights, telescopes, etc for free 😥. The planetarium show for $7 for adults and $3 for kids is pretty good. Worth the money. Never seen an interactive show with a live presenter. Good one. You get great views of the city from the top. You can also trek for a couple of miles right outside the observatory. Parking is a problem but there is free parking 1 mile before you reach the observatory. Parking at observatory costs $4 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547kaustubhm
50,Really neat place right by Hollywood sign!,This is a great place! It is a beautiful place to play with science and see the Hollywood sign! Spend a couple of hours here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413brandit
50,Great Place to Visit.,"We managed to park in the area just in front of the Griffith Observatory, which was convenient as we had my mother in law with us and she was unable to walk too far.The views around the Observatory are fantastic and it is worth parking for at least 2 hours so you can look around at your leisure.The displays were very interesting and informative. However A MUST DO, is the planetarium. It is $7 per person, but well worth it.Had a great time here. Also, as we were briving up toward the observatory, my eldest daughter said that the tunnel you go though looked like the one from the movie, Back to the Future. And it is, it looks a little run down by comparison to the movie tunnel, but it is the one used for the movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nkfox
40,Nightmare to get there; worth it,"To get to Griffith, you have to climb a literal mountain in your car. Once you've gone through the hour long traffic line, you have to find a place to park. That may take 10 minutes, it may take an hour. What I did was I had a friend coast around for a spot and I snapped the pictures I wanted to take. It's worth the walk around the whole thing. You can see the Hollywood sign and the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hansdergerman
50,Into the stars,Have to say that everyone should visit. Overlooking LA you can see all the way to the ocean.So many interactive stations to explore and learn about the universeExcellent planetarium shows for minimal cost and since it’s free to come here you can’t go wrongAttentive staff all full of knowledge will assist you and answer all your questions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/148keiths
30,Very pretty sight but prepare to hike!,"This place advertising free parking, which is rare in LA. There is free parking, however you will end up hiking another 2-3 miles to the observatory. Bring water and wear appropriate clothes!!! You’ll be walking in dirt, over branches and rocks, through a tunnel, and up very steep inclines.The observatory is warm inside because there are a lot of people going in and out. The best views are right at the top near the front lawn. Look out and enjoy unobstructed views of the city. Worth it - just prepare for the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcd0513
50,awesome view of Los Angeles at night,"The Griffith Observatory is a unique spot in Los Angeles. In addition to interesting displays regarding astronomy and space, the planetarium under the domed ceiling puts on very informative shows. Unsure if they ever resumed doing the Lazerium show there, but back in the day it was very fun to see the lazer light show synced to Pink Floyd or classical - Very Trippy indeed.The Observatory and the Planetarium was a location featured in many films and TV shows like Flesh Gordon, Terminator Superman TV Series, Rebel without a Cause, to name a few.At night the view of the city lights stretching in all directions from the back of the observatory is unparalleled. Back in the day, if you really wanted to woo your date this was where you would bring her to try to have your first kiss - this practice never failed me.Also there is a great view of the Hollywood sign from the property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2131POstevens
50,"Come for the View, Stay for the Observatory!",It's a great way to spend a Saturday or a Sunday: hike up the hill leading to the Observatory (or just drive up if you're short on time); stand on the roof and the sides of the Observatory to take in the view at various vantage points; go inside and learn about some basic astronomy; then depart. The mix of people you'll see is also pretty incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr844
50,The place you have to go,"One of my favorites places in LA, you can take pictures of the Hollywood sign and you can improve your knowledge about astronomy. All ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/237milenat
50,Beautiful sunset,"Walked there from the car park near the Greek Theatre yo watch sunset (took about 15min walk, it's fine). Beautiful sunset, beautiful views over LA, great view of the Hollywood sign. Very crowded though, you have to fight to get a nice spot with a view. We didn't go in the Observatory or Planetarium. Would definitely recommend doing to get the beautiful views and feel like you're in La La Land!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babsd33
50,LA trip,Beautiful views all angles on any side of the observatory. From downtown to the mountains bring some extra memory for your pics. You are definitely going to need it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miller9115
30,"Worth it for the photos, but a headache to get to!","My husband and I went to the Griffith Observatory in the evening to see the Hollywood sign and look around.Travel tip: you cannot see the Hollywood sign at night, it isn’t lit up like it is in the movies, which sadly I didn’t know until we got there.We parked in the free parking at Griffith Park and walked up the steep and winding path along what appeared in the daylight to be a cliff/mountainside. It did not seem like a safe walk, and in future I would likely not do it again in the dark without a big flashlight. There is no real walk-way and you either have to walk on a narrow bumpy dirt and rock shoulder or on the road itself. Neither of which are a safe option, as you could trip and fall (down the side of the mountain) or get hit by a car speeding around the bend. Luckily, we made it to the top and back down without injury.Once at Griffith Observatory, there is paid parking (which I wish I knew about!), restrooms, and the Observatory itself. We went inside, however it was so busy we weren’t able to get tickets until the later show and we didn’t want to wait around. We took some lovely city-view photos from one of the observation areas and then hiked back down to our car.The following day we went back in the afternoon and drove to the top to park. It was an absolute zoo. The traffic there was terrible and it took us longer to drive to the top than it did to walk. Parking was $4 but just as my husband went to the machine to pay the machines went down, so it was free that afternoon. It was a particularly smoggy day, so photos of the Hollywood sign weren’t the greatest, but it was nice to see it up close. Again, the Observatory was far too busy for our liking, so after taking some photos and looking around we got back into our car to drive down.Travel tip: there was a medical emergency the day were were there, which had significant impact on the traffic. Since they have traffic going one way only, we were waiting in our car at a complete stop for over 20 minutes while they cleared the way for emergency vehicles. Obviously, the medical emergency takes precedence, but just something to note if you do drive up instead of walk - prepare for a slow arrival and exit.We likely wouldn’t go back, however did enjoy seeing the sign from their observation points.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheAverageTourist
40,Worth your time and FREE!,This is a famous place in Hollywood film history. Parts of Rebel Without a Cause starring James Dean were filmed here. This is worth it even if you don't go into the Observatory. You can see Downtown LA one way and the Hollywood sign another.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20anad15
50,Great View,"Loved this view of everything, come early as the parking gets hard and can be a hike to get here. Up close to the Hollywood Sign...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dnnklly

50,A long way up!,"I was not prepared for the long drive up the mountain! I was certainly rewarded. It is a beautiful place inside and outside. Parking can be a bit crazy. I was lucky to get a spot near the Observatory. My friend was not and she was not informed of the shuttle that would have made it easier to get back up to the Observatory, she had quite the walk. Make sure you feed your parking meter for at least three hours. With beautiful weather I just wanted to sit outside and embrace the beautiful views. Inside is very informative, the people that work there are very helpful with answering questions. Amazing information and displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJG_957

50,Must-see attraction with awesome view of LA at night!,"You really need to visit Griffith Observatory during your next trip to Los Angeles if you have not been there before. (If you saw La La Land, you'll recognize the Observatory. Of course, you'll never see it that empty in person at night!) The museum exhibits are interesting, the building is beautiful, and the views of Los Angeles at night are astounding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoodleawood
40,Nice drive up for iconic views,Great view of the Hollywood sign. Nice drive up through some pretty neighbourhoods. Hopefully you see the city through the LA smog,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Damo35
50,Spectacular at night,We went for an evening ride. Prepare to pay for parking. It is $4. Then walk up to the observatory and climb the stairs to the top. Amazing view for nothing more than the price of parking. Take pictures of the whole city. The Hollywood sign is at eye level across the way but not lit up at night so only could see the outline. Really incredible. We stayed about 45 minutes just to see the view and not inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amber1127
50,Nice displays for space friends,When in LA make time to visit and awe at the heavens. Handsome structure both inside and out. Admission is free but parking is $4/hr.Observatory opens at noon. Allow about 2 hours just to look at the displays. There is a free 25 minute movie narrated by Leonard Nimoy plus a feature movie that has a fee. Learn how insignificant our rock is compared to what is out there. Nice cafe on site if you get hungry. Views of the LA basin and the Hollywood sign are neat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
40,Great view,"This was an excellent place to overlook Los Angeles. Parking is absolutely atrocious and rather frustrating! They have some need exhibits in there and overall I think it's worth the experience at least once. I have been fortunate enough to look at the Dome , previously, and that was an amazing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinbN2312WF
50,Expected to spend an hour - we spent 2 hours and just did the basics!,"So much to do: a beautiful building, the planetarium show is a must, exhibit after exhibit and next time: we will leave time to hike around the park and see the Greek theatre.Tip: if you are using Uber, when leaving Griffiths take the public bus down to the base of the park somewhere. Ubers don't seem want to come up the hill. The bus is only 50 cents per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaM368
30,A great view obscured by legendary LA smog,"My interest in going up was for the view and not the obsveratory itself. Can’t speak to the latter. First off parking, it’s extremely limited up top next to the observatory itself. You might get lucky and park there, but more likely you’ll end up parking further down the hill and have to either walk up or from the very bottom take a shuttle. It’s a bit of a trek so be prepared. As for the view, we went twice, once during the day and once at night. During the day it was disappointing to say the least. The vantage point should give a spectacular view but it’s really diminished by the heavy layer of smog over the LA metro basin. You get a partial view at best. At night the view is somewhat better because the smog isn’t as obvious and you can enjoy the lights of LA. The crowds at night were heavier so this must be a common perception that nighttime is better for viewing. It’s a close call, but I’d recommend it this only if you have spare time during your visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeteranWorldTravellr
50,"Marvellous views, great place to learn about out universe","Visiting the observatory gives you a great overwiev on our universe and the elements. From the platform you have marvellous views on the City, Santa Barbara and the Hollywood sign. Parking is at $4 per hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WolframKarbid
50,great views and building,"A planetarium is a planetarium, so what is in it is as expected, though the actor giving the narrative for the show was superb! But what makes the visit exceptional is the building itself and the views from the building- just stupendous on a clear day. The park around it is wonderful too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elebau
40,Solid museum,Love the museum and the information provided. Exhibits are not very interactive but the sense of awe is there when one learns about the universe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamalMamat
20,Just Okay,"The views from the observatory are great. The displays are well done. The show that we chose at the planetarium was entertaining and informative. But, dealing with the traffic and fighting to see displays, I'm not really sure it was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DEkholm
40,Gorgeous city views,Really nice place to go for views of the entire city. We went at night time and waa a but daunting driving up the twisty roads that lead up to it up the dark. Free entry and paid parking outside. Can be a hard enough walk from thd car depending where you park so comfy shoes are essential!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleWhiteBear_6
50,Holiday,We went here really for the views over the city amazing. But when we went inside it was really good and you learn things about the night and day etc. Kids could interact with things. And they did a show but we left so not to sure what that was about sorry. Would recommend if you want great views and pass a bit of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanL146

It's best to go around sunset because you have a clear view of the sign as well as they have gentlemen out there with telescopes that allow you to see the different starts and the planet Uranus. It's a beautiful place to go on a date or have a 1st kiss. I love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedes909
40,Beautiful,"When in Los Angeles visiting the Griffith Observatory is a must see! Entry is free and because of our time constraints we did not see a show. We arrived later in the day and it was very crowded, but we kept driving up the hill and found parking quite close to the observatory! Next time, I will arrive in the morning or later in the evening for sunset. We looked around and the grounds and building are just beautiful, but the day we visited was very overcast and the views were not the best! We were able to see the Hollywood sign though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaaearl
40,Great view at sunset,Timed our visit to coincide with the sun going down and was well worth the walk! Is very busy and parking can be a way from the top which means walking up!

50,Beautiful view o so la la land,"We thought we would be done in an hour or so but we stayed longer then expected. Great info, lots to do and see for kids. Restaurants there. People picnic on the grass. Great ambiance. And of course totally la la land feeling. You have to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigwideworld4

50,An absolute must!,Breathtaking views await. The views are unparalleled. The building itself and its contents are wonderful and fascinating. We did not pay for show but explored the entire building and area and it was wonderful. We went at night. Excellent views of Hollywood sign but not able to get a good picture in the dark. Want to go back during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonj2015

10,16 of us on a bus.,Absolutely jammed with people. Saturday visit about noon. Smog was thick. Definitely not worth going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gene377
50,Well worth a visit. Free entry.,"We went in the evening. Firstly spectacular views over LA, the city and the hills. Worth it for this alone.Then there is also the observatory which has several areas on different elements of space and science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KallanK
50,First visit!,Well worth a trip out to here - it's free! Lots to see inside and out!Make a day of it and really enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesmas
50,Nice Views,Fun family vacation to California. We stopped here on our way back to our hotel from Universal Studios. Parking was difficult. Then a traffic officer told us about parking at the church. We parked at a church (forgot the name) and they had a shuttle that took us to the observatory. Very easy and didn't have to wait for the shuttle very long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmc921
50,Spectacular views of LA!,The Griffith Observatory is one of LA’s prime attractions. It is set on top of the hills overlooking LA and from this place you can experience the best and most classic view of the city. Come here for sunset views. Parking can be difficult. While you are up here check out the planetarium. This 1930’s era building is beautiful. For the most part the exhibits here are somewhat dated. If you are a fan of vintage technology then this is an awesome museum. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryspokeman
40,It's ok,"I have read so many good reviews about this place. Well guys, it's ok. Definitely no must..The movies that this place screens are very interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atnellys
50,spectacular place !,"We drive to Griffith Observatory and enjoyed the trip very much, although parking is a little problem and we have to walk a little while. We learned a lot about cosmos etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hohsien
50,Awesome !!!,"Love the spectacular views, it’s like being on a stage!I’ve not being at the shows, but just the exhibits are very interesting, the planetary movements, the sun activity, the eclipse, so much to mention related to the space.It’s one of the most fun places to visit, and it’s free even the parking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattyreyes16
50,Hiking,"We come here every Sunday or every other Sunday .It is our family hiking Sunday our dogs love the hike and relaxing for a few mins around the observatory .Enjoying the view at 5 am is amazing.When we come here is always clean at 5 am .Holiday season is so bad with traffic jams, limit amount of parking. Best thing is to come super early or parking at the bottom by the parks/carousel area. Restroom area can be messy around holiday time.Prices for snacks and all pricy. Better to pack your own .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion714399
50,Iconic and worth it at the same time,What an amazing place if not just for being able to say that you've been as part of an iconic history of LA but the actual building is a treat and mostly free. Lots of hiking and things to do in the area too make it a full day enjoyment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamles
50,Where stars shine,"Everyone comes to Hollywood wanting to catch a glimpse of some stars. Well, here is one place that can guarantee that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bearcatmanphoto
50,A place to feel LA with closer to the Hollywood sign,Always to think about visiting the place whenever I am in LA. It’s good to enhance your scientific understanding in what is presented in the museum; but it’s always good to be there to feel you are in LA by looking at the Hollywood sign and the great view of downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2800PDA
50,Best View of Los Angeles,"Griffith Park and Griffith Observatory are must sees on your visit to Los Angeles! Jasmine Jia shared her knowledge of P22, the park's only puma. The views she showed us were unparalleled! Our visit to the Observatory was information and interesting. I highly recommend Jasmine as a guide with interesting stories and lots of facts to share.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeltaOne
50,Not just a pretty view!,"Griffith Observatory has probably been in more motion-pictures than you can Imagine.... so going there for the view alone (it is worth it!) is best supplemented with: 1. enjoying the looping drive up to it. 2. Looking for the shooting locations from LALA Land and every other movie you can think of; 3. Long hikes with more great views after you park.; 4. The observatory itself.; and then 5. The lunch you brought along for a picnic!... make a day of it. It is worth the time!..Now we forgot the Museum part and theLeonard Nimoy exhibit of photographs, and the Telescopes. And and and... and thats after you enjoy the views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beckerp360
50,More than just an observatory,It’s more of a museum about space and earth. There are also shows you can see. The night we went there was some type of society that had their telescopes our so you can see different planets and they do this every month like on a Friday. You can also go on a hike to the Hollywood sign from there and you have a beautiful view of LA and Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6296CBaliciag
50,Love the Observatory,"I love this place, and so does my daughter! It's a great place for her to learn about the planets, our planet, and space! She wants to be an astronaut!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamienMS
50,History of The Galaxy/ Picnic Spots / Hiking Trails / Limited Parking /Free Tours,"Hello Again Guys!Keep in mind that Griffith Observatory has extremely limited parking and a large number of tour buses, tourists, and LA natives.The best option I took was to park at the bottom and walk up the hill. I'd say it's a very short walk and not a real trail (so you'll be walking on the side of the road for near 3/4 of a mile up a hill)Now if you can remain positive about this, there are tours and discussions that happen daily at Griffith Observatory. You can probably check the times online (Some are impromptu)The field in front of Griffith is awesome to have picnics although there is no shade so bring an umbrella you can lean! and a blanket for the grass.Besides the limited parking, large amount of tourists, it has beautiful views and is worth a visit... if you're in the hollywood area onlyGriffith Observatory also has a cafe in the observatory - Great for dates or coffee -Gift shop also available",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/345nabeelk
40,Great Experience,"The shows are great, but the exhibits are even greater.Especially liked the exhibit where they compare weight on various planets and the relative sizes of each.Only downside is the parking is inadequate and made require a long walk up a hill, especially on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E8318KSstevek
50,Stars Shine,"Built and donated by Griffith J. Griffith the observatory is not only a landmark, but a fun place for learning, enjoyment and entertainment. If you happen to visit ona clear day be amazed by the views of the pacific! Get to know your solar system by going to one of the very informative and intresting star shows, and be entertained by a laser show. A great place to visit around sunset, but great anytime. On you way home stop for a picnic on the grass at the nearby Greek Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunsetbeachbuddy
50,Two Main Reasons for Rating it Excellent,"It is a worldwide recognized Los Angeles icon as famous as the Hollywood Sign only far more experiential. The second reason is it has arguably the best hilltop view of Los Angeles. It is an absolute must-see for tourists and I go there yearly as a local. It is prominently featured the classic film, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (James Dean, Natalie Wood). It also is tucked up just below the Hollywood Sign with two hiking paths up into the heels which begin there. You will love the Leonard Nimoy Even Horizon with free film screenings of NASA's latest discoveries as well as a 22 minute film narrated by Leonard Nimoy show the history of the planetarium including the recent 2006 renovation. Back to the view. On clear days you can see our growing downtown skyline and panning right the ocean and Catalina island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
40,Very interesting. Great views of Los Angeles.,"We didn't realise just how much there was to do here and didn't allow enough time for our visit. They had a film showing the renovations to the observatory and a brief history of it. They had a couple of different talks in the planetarium, both of which we didn't see. We queued for a while to look through the telescope on the roof, but ran out of time. There were plenty of interesting exhibits inside the observatory and just walking a round the building at sunset was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5Pam5
50,An Important Part of the LA Experience,"Visiting the Griffith Park Observatory ranks up there with going to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, driving along Mulholland Drive and visiting the Boardwalk at Venice Beach. Spectacular views of the Los Angeles basin and the Hollywood sign make this a must visit. The Observatory itself is a wealth of information about our solar system and the planets. Sign up for one of their special presentations to learn even more about the heavens. A drive up to the Observatory at night will give you a view of the lighted city at night and the piece and quiet of the Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6229ZYboba
40,Good to take your kids to see,I stopped by couple times and this place is good for you and your kids to learn about science and astrology. They have many sections of the building to stroll and take a look at the observatory. They even got a big screen theater to watch films on space and astrology. They used to have free parking but not any more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510khanhn
50,A Classic Gem,"Whenever we visit the Griffith Observatory we are reminded of its spectacular architecture as we walk up the sidewalk from the parking area. Inside is even better! The views of metropolitan Los Angels are also great ""on a clear day.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kentennen
50,I love biking to the observatory,"Enjoy the view or check out events, activities, and nights where you can use the telescope. Beautiful building and view. Parking is good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artemite
50,Great for science & movie buffs,"From ""Rebel Without a Cause"" to ""Transformers"", this LA landmark has been an internationally recognized destination for decades. But is just not a prop for movies, but an honest to goodness outstanding science museum and planetarium.On a clear day, the view is priceless, and the cafeteria is pretty good as well.One bit of advise, finding parking up there is nearly impossible. Do yourself a favor and take the Dash. It's cheap and hassle free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176youngk
50,Informative and pleasant,Excellent fun for the family. Colossal panoramic views of LA county. Really enjoyed the many different stations and all of the information given.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliel783
50,Wow!!!,This is a must experience!!! So sorry that we did not get to explore everything they have to offer---most of which is FREE! Top of the world view of LA is amazing during any time of day but night time is magical! We were astounded by all the information that is available inside the museum and very well thought out and presented. At night they have student astronomers come out with telescopes to show you amazing wonders of the night sky as they answer your questions. However---be aware that parking is horrific! There is a small lot at the observatory that gets full quickly and otherwise you have to park and pay along the side of a winding steep road leading to the top. We went on a beautiful Saturday night so that could have been the problem. We were in a very long and slow line of cars to the top where we dropped off son and with his wife and baby and we proceeded back down and then up again to find parking. Very long walk to and from observatory in the dark with no side walk. Amazingly it wasn't too bad going up due to the switch backs. Worth every step--just be warned. Want to go back to really see everything without the crowds and get into the planetarium show---which you pay for and reserve.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweetbb
50,The real stargazing in Los Angeles!,"The observatory is phenomenal, with great shows in the planetarium and mind-blowing, interactive exhibits throughout the facility. This is well worth your time even if you go just for the views of the LA skyline and Hollywood sign from this iconic LA landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterJayR
50,One of my favourite places on earth....,"This was probably one of the most enjoyable moments of the holiday. Having been L.A a year before but not had the time to go Griffith this time we made sure it was a must and it did not disappoint. I feel it was very busy when we went yet there was still always plenty of room and so many places to get good photos. We got there around 5/6pm and so saw it in daylight and ended up staying about 3/4 hours and so saw the sunset, it all light up and then how cool it looks at night with LA in the background. We saw a show in the planetarium which was brilliant, great visual display and very informative too. That costs about $10 per person i think, but well worth it as everything else in there is free. While we were there we managed to see Jupiter through someone's telescope on the front lawn which is free to use. There's also a whole exhibit on all the other planets and how heavy you would be on them. So much to do there and if you visit LA this is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
50,Love this place!,"This place is gorgeous and one of my favorite places to visit over and over again in LA. Perfect to take out-of-town guests, especially if it's their first time in LA. The view is amazing and lots of free activities. The parking can be a bit crazy and traffic getting there can be pretty heavy most days so give yourself plenty of time to get there, park and enjoy. Bring a blanket and food for a picnic. Bring cameras for great photo-ops with the Hollywood sign and the city skyline. There are some great hiking trails for all skill levels. If it's your first time, I suggest parking down below at The Greek theater (yes, the famous LA concert venue and also a great parking alternative when there aren't events going on there) and taking the trail up to the Observatory. It's a quick hike with a good incline so you still feel like you did something. If you're feeling more adventurous and have more time, there are a ton more trails here though, many with cool sites and spectacular views. There's the famous Hollywood Sign trail of course, the original Batcave, the Wisodom Tree... and more than 53 miles of trails in 4310 acres of surprisingly rugged terrain. This is one of the largest urban parks in North America and it’s right in the middle of L.A. Tons of movies and TV episodes have filmed scenes here too, most recently and notable were several scenes from La La Land. Do some research and plan an adventure. This place really is magical and amazing with endless possibilities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/719amberg
40,Fun and interesting,I haven’t been here for years and decided to take a friend who was visiting from out of town. It was most enjoyable and the program they show was very interesting. It’s educational and intriguing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
50,Sun set,"At the entrance to the Observatory the traffic control tries to make take the rout to the tunnel. You done have to go through the tunnel. I made the right to go up the hill. There was plenty of parking along side the road. A bit of a hike to the top, but not bad. There is plenty of free things to do. You can walk all the way around and inside the Observatory for free. The views of Hollywood and LA are the best. If you stay long enough you have a very good view of the sun setting. The inside of the observatory is awesome for an astronomy buff. I loved everything about it. The gift shop has a lot of good space thing not found anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlR4907MN
50,Science that is accessible,We enjoyed hiking up to the Griffith Observatory and their excellent exhibits and shows. The venue needs enlarging to accommodate the crowds. It is an art deco dream architecturally and beautifully maintained. The whole family can enjoy this treasure on the hill top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurad130
50,A must-do in Los Angeles,"I try to visit the Griffith Observatory every time I'm in LA. IT has some of the best views in town, and it's paradise for an astronomy lover. Even if you're just mildly interested in the universe it's worth the trip ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderlusterful
50,Beautiful Observatory with Awesome View of LA and Hollywood Sign,"I have driven up to the Observatory and also hiked. The hike is long with no views. I don't recommend this hike if you are wanting beauty. But, when at the top, Amazing! Great science museum also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z6491AOlindat
50,The Griffith Observatory - was amazing!,"We went there in the morning, and liked it so much we went again in the evening. They even have free public viewings through the telescope! Absolutely loved the trip to the Griffith Observatory, highly recommend it to anyone who likes science and gorgeous views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syeda409
50,A must do to understand the LA area,An unique panoramic view of the Los Angeles basin. The building itself is a work of art and a tour is definitely worth the time. A must see if in the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/287ChrisW287
50,Some of the best views of the Los Angeles metropolitan area at night.,"Great place to visit at night or during the day. There are plenty of trails in the heart of the city of angels. At night, the views are spectacular when clear. Parking has been a problem over the last couple of years so it’s best to Uber or take a taxi. If you are from out of town, don’t leave belongings that are visible from the outside as there have been car-breakins. The building has a lot of information and displays even if you are not into astronomy. Great for families or a fun date night. The Greek Theater is down the road, so you can add a show at the end of the day. Famous Terminator scene was filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillysWorld
40,Griffith Observatory offers some great views inside and out!,"We first checked out the Griffith Observatory when we first were deciding to move to the LA area. In addition to be really interesting inside with a star show and interesting facts and pictures, It offers a great spot to start a hike and get a great view of the observatory from above. Parlking is limited, so we walked from the bottom which is manageable but you must be agile, and in relatively good shape. On hot days, make sure you have a hat, water and sunscreen regardless of where you park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryL1334
50,The Sky is the Limit,"Everyone should see the stars and the astronomy show at the observatory. It's iconic Los Angeles, fascinating, exciting and you actually "" learn "" things about space, planets and the stars.A thumbs up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaKnowsTravel
40,Great viewd get there before sunset!,"Parking is terrible the hour before sunset everyone lines up for the view. Employees are absolutely terrible for parking. They are nasty, unhelpful and downright rude. By the time we parked we were so stressed hard to enjoy the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciamR5356UC
40,Loved it!,"Planetarium was closed for maintenance, but we still had an amazing time in and around the Observatory.The view is unbeatable, parking is cheap enough, and all exhibits are free.Our toddler loved looking and touching all the hands on exhibits.Will be bringing him back again in future years when he understands a little more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyler-family-aussie
50,Great place to watch the sunset,Get there early to get a parking spot. Otherwise you may have to climb! Gorgeous bird of LA and the Hollywood Sign. Love the James Dean tribute.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sflorge
50,Verry interesting but closed on Mondays,"Enjoyed a hot day here, parking was a problem, we had to drive around for about 20 mins before we found a space. It was well worth the visìt. Plenty to see and a good spacious eating area inside and out. Monument of james dean where Rebel Without A Cause was filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerbyPhilip
50,Stars,"Came here last Saturday night after debating whether to do so, as the Uber ride from Santa Monica was pretty expensive. So glad we did. The views of the city are amazing and even though it was pretty crowded, there is enough space for everyone to enjoy the views. You can walk around the outside of the observatory to see the views from different angles, as well as go up to the roof of the place. There were a couple of telescopes set up for free public viewing, each with a guide to explain what you would be seeing - we saw Saturn and this pair of stars, the names of which I forgot. Inside the observatory, there are plenty of interesting exhibits, like the Foucault Pendulum and Tesla Coil. The only thing you need to pay for is the Planetarium show, which is well worth the $7. We saw the last show of the day, Centered in the Universe, a half-hour show with a brilliant ""live"" narrator - it was hard to believe it wasn't a recording! At the roof, there is also a free giant telescope, but it cuts off at 945pm (I believe) so you have to queue up early if you want to get in. I believe you can check the timings on the observatory website. Budget at least an hour, preferably two, to spend here. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TengKiat
50,Beautiful Place to Be on a Clear Day!,"As long as the LA smog is not lingering over the city, this is a beautiful place to be during the daytime. At night I have not yet been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775heatherb
40,Great views at night.,The views of LA at night are really good from up on the mountain. If you are into thus I guess it would be good. The show was passable. My teenager enjoyed it and it was her idea to go here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RM0100
50,Nice hike and observatory,The observatory itself is nice and you can see 1-2 planets with the telescope. The hike and nice views of LA adds to the attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gk2160
50,Unparalleled Views,"Grab a blanket and some food, ideal for a picnic lunch with views of Hollywood Hills, downtown LA, out to Santa Monica and all the way to the Redondo Beach Pier (on a clear day). Very relaxing and a great spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5625MKsamanthas

40,For space lovers,We really enjoyed the Observatory. We did it as part of a guided tour with Anaheim Tours co. Great views of the Hollywood sign and the city. The show is a must see. Our ticket was included in the tour. A great place for people who love anything to do with space!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rach_Kelly
50,Do not miss this fab attraction!,"We loved the observatory. The views are amazing, also when there is smog or overcast. You can enter the museum and building for free, but if you want to see the appr 30 mins movie about the universe you pay USD 7. We highly recommend the movie, it was a super experience !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinebI3510SB
50,Monument of Hollywood and LA,"This another incredible place to visit in LA. You have probably seen the observatory in many movies including the recent La La Land.You can choose to hike up or take a shuttle. We did hike. It isn't too difficult, but remember to bring you water and a decent pair of shoes.Great place to learn about space or just have a picnic on the lawn.

50,One for the bucket list that did not disappoint,This is a must visit if you are in LA because of the following 3 main reasons:-1. Its one of the bast places to get shots of the Hollywood sign2. The panoramic views of down-town LA and Century City3. The iconic backdrop to some of the best Hollywood moviesThe observatory is free to enter and you can take a quick tour around the various levels. If you have some hiking shoes on why not take the path below the observatory to take a trek around the Hollywood hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263markj

40,Good to see in the day. Even better at night!,"You can see the Hollywood sign from here on a clear day.I wish I knew they had a trekking trail and I wish I dressed for it. You must plan to come here and explore the 2 hour trek path. It's beautiful I hear.In the night, it's a magical sight with LA lit up as tiny colorful dots - the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/76vartikav
40,Educational with amazing views,Depending on where you have to park (it can be quite busy) it may be a hike to get there but some of the views on the trek up are great. I was told there’s a path that will take you to the perfect view of the Hollywood sign.The observatory itself has some fantastic views from the outside as well as a variety of informational exhibits on the inside. My favorite was the solar system exhibit room and the statue of Albert Einstein that you can take a photo with!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deonna2
50,Interesting Exhibits,"Too hot to truly enjoy the exhibits, but terrific views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Tough place to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobR623
30,Great to visit at night - be careful if there are events ongoing!,"My fiancee wanted to visit this iconic site to get pictures of the city. We went there our first night in Los Angeles and it was a horrendous mistake.Unbeknownst to us, there was an event ongoing that night (Greek eats). It was absolutely packed. We utilized the app Waze to navigate which took us close to the observatory, BUT the road was closed. So we had to backtrack and go an alternate route, following the street signs. Also, there were NO detour signs until you got within a few yards of the road closure sign.It took us about an hour to go 2 miles to the observatory. There was so much traffic and congestion, it was one of the most insane and bizarre experiences we've had. We knew LA traffic was bad, but for a Sunday night when we figured it'd be somewhat decent, we were dead wrong.While it took us an hour to get up to the observatory, there was absolutely no parking available and we took pictures from the car. Going back down and out was a much, much faster route which probably took us 15 minutes.The views were spectacular but I strongly advise to research so you aren't caught offguard if an event is being held.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zusas
50,Fantastic Views,"If you like the skyline, sky and views. You will love the observatory. You get a great view of LA, the Hollywood sign and everything in between. Its a great place to catch the sunset and catch up on what's happening in the sky above our planet. There are displays, demonstrations and shows. Take your time and take it all in. The parking in the area is steep like the hill you have to travel in order to reach the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swok13

50,"Great view on LA, Hollywood and Santa Monica","We had a trip to the Observatory, with special interest as our son is an Astrophysicist. Great view on LA, Hollywood and Santa Monica areas.

50,Griffith Observatory a must visit attraction,This location was added to our grand tour of LA and is a must see attraction. The views of LA are tremendous and really help to get an overview of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brett_Clowes
50,Spectacular,"Red line from downtown and get off at Vermont /Sunset Station, take the electric bus nearby, have coins or small banknotes to pay 50 cents to bus. Enjoy watching environment... pay attention and time around at observatory...Don't run or rush.. Think about our huge planet is nothing inside the universe.. Slow down.. relax..Enjoy your life...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/264mguler
40,Great views,"Had awesome views of LA and Hollywood sign...make sure u have some shades.. suns pretty bright, we didn't go inside just viewed outside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860dnr
50,Amazing view,A must see when you in LA.Amazing view in nighttime LA.It's free to get in also you can get Dash bus there and from there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angiet413
50,Fascinating place,This is a superb place to visit in LA. The views over LA and to the Hollywood sign are fantastic. The sunsets are also beautiful. I only wish we'd given ourselves more time to make the most of it all. Inside there are many displays and opportunities to watch/listen to staff demonstrations (such as the Tesla Coil). Outside on one of the terraces we were also able to view Saturn through a telescope. For us the highlight was definitely the two shows we attended in the planetarium (Light of the Valkyries and Centred in the Universe). Both were thoroughly enjoyable and the narrator was excellent. We look forward to returning someday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFizzogs
40,Good place for sunset,"We came here by uber, it's almost 4 pm, what worried us was the way back to hollywood, but actually there are reguler bus come and go to hollywood everycouple minutes. This building is hostorical and famous, just come and enjoy this place, even when good weather we can have good sunset.a must place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJNugraha
50,Fantastic views of LA,One of the best angles of the Hollywood sign and great sweeping views of LA. Nice walks to be had up to the observatory and around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarrenWAS
40,Fantastic and fun place but $$$$$ Parking,Amazing place to go to. Loved going here with my wife. Beautiful view day and especially night!!! Had a lot of fun. The only downside is they made parking pricey. Used to be free and now it's very expensive. They even charge if you park on the side of the mountain a MILE AWAY. Shocker! Had to do a lot of walking 25min up and that's 50min wasted and paid for. Other than that it was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HyeStyle
30,Great museum and views shame about the food,"A really great place to get some great views and great interactive experiences with science in particular space. Only downside its the poor quality and majorly overpriced food in cafeteria. I wouldn't mind paying those prices if the food was decent, but when the sandwich is dry and unpleasant, I dont know how they can be ok with charging what they do for terrible food!Take your own lunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mac_attackk
50,"First time,",I have seen this observatory in many of the movies. So our family was very much interested. It has many seintific affects and knowledgeable place.We should have spent some more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lassenmj
30,Big crowds cause issues with parking,Plan on taking a bus or Uber to get there. Lots of both locals and tourists. It took about 20 minutes to drive to the top on a Sunday afternoon. It's a must see one time. I dont need to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aes31
40,Make sure to go on a clear day,Beautiful location but make sure to go on a clear day so you get all of the views. Was able to catch uber to and from there but heard the pick up can be difficult,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aggies1999
50,A must see,We went to Griffith Observatory twice on our visit.. between 7pm and 9pm you can look thru the big microscope and see the moon which is pretty awesome. I recommend visiting here but at nighttime it's way better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2lovestraveling
50,Excellent panoramic view of LA,One of the best locations to see LA both during the day and at night. During the day you can also see the Hollywood sign considerably close and go for a hike nearby. At night it is very panoramic. One can also see and tour the telescope area and films are shown for a fee. Parking is limited so it's a good idea to take a shuttle bus from a designated area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5544LOpeterh
50,"Beautiful, a must visit","Got the bus up the hill from the metro ,but walked down the Boy scout trail ,steep but great viewsThe observatory is really informative ,clean,uncluttered ,interactive,funViews are spectacular you can see the whole city including the Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaA761
50,This place is a MUST SEE!,"This place is really good to if you wanna see the Hollywood sign and the landmark of the whole LA. Great photo opportunity and the planetarium is cool too. Beware that the parking is not safe at all, so keep all the things so nobody can see them and take all the valuables with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Alex_Jo
40,Fantastic,We didn't spend so much time in Griffith Observatory as we were given only 30minutes to take photos and went into the building to briefly browse what's inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melds67
50,Nice,Nice view and a free museum with many different asteroids. Good also for kids see our solar system and planets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThiagoB
40,"Sunsets over the city are fabulous, if it’s a clear night","Keen to visit here to see the sun set over the city. Unfortunately as it’s october, the sun dropped faster than my teenage daughters search for her lipgloss!!and we missed the low sun before it dropped behind the hills.However, you still get an incredible view as the sky turns wonderful shades of red and yellow. The observatory is set in a superb location and it is free to enter.The information stations are helpful for all ages and my teenager enjoyed reading these.We travelled by uber but plenty of people arrived in their own cars and parked further away.It does get pretty dark up there and I personally wouldn’t want to be walking back downhill to my car late on in the dark, so arrive in plenty of time before sunset as it’s very popular.I think early morning would be ideal and you can explore more.You can also book an educational film but we were too late.Also check opening hours etc as I believe they close one day a week. Good way to spend an hour or two, definitely longer if you arrive daytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edinburghcitymom
50,Visited Griffith on a tour bus.,"We only spent 30 minutes here from a tour bus but saw that you really need more time to absorb everything here. Place is pretty interesting, with a great view of the Hollywood sign, but traffic and parking were a mess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpC6952AS
40,Place for quick visit,I have this amazing background view of the Hollywood sign.. will certainly provide a few instagram opportunities.. the planetarium as such is k. Half an hour can be killed...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anoop_p999
50,Informative observatory,"You get a great view of the city and can see the Hollywood sign. Inside you get a lot of information about the planets, the Sun and the universe in general. All of this is free! They have shows in the planetarium for 7$ as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773nicholasn
50,Glorious Views !,"What a wonderful place this is looking down, you can view over the whole of Los Angeles. A viewing place of serenity of a city which is a myriad of chaos. Very good views of the Hollywood sign can also be seen from here. So peaceful, stunning and a must do attraction. A bit of journey to get up there and quite busy but certainly worth it.Glorious indeed !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jadfran1
50,Bucket list Check off!!,"Great place for views, day and night. Tons of history and interesting astronomy displays. We didn't get to hike but could tell the area was loaded with trails. Parking is tough especially if the Greek Theatre is having an event (which happened the day we visited!). We drove and found a parking space on a residential street at the bottom of the hill close to Griffith Park and then used Uber for the rest of the way to the observatory. It was inexpensive and convenient. I think one could spend 3 or 4 hours looking around inside and outside. We were there for about 2 hours and didn't get to see everything we wanted to. Got to experience some of the displays fully but just got to look briefly at others. Worthwhile taking time to visit while in LA. Glad I finally made it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112tammyt
50,Part of our tour,"Unsurpassed views across the city, very cool! We only had a short time as we were part of a tour of LA, but could have happily spent much longer there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahgway
50,Amazing views of LA,What a great place this iss. Great views of LA. The landscape is also very beatifull. One of the best places to view the Hollywood sign. A must go place in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlosj692
50,The Views At Night Are Unreal,Loved this place! We went at night and the view of LA from here can't be beat. Got some great pictures! Parking gets a bit crazy so I would suggest carpooling or getting there as soon as the sun sets. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404gretell
40,Great Place,This is an intresting place. I would suggest to try not to visit it on a weekend as you will struggle with getting parking and the crownds make if difficult to see anything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB958
40,Always Interesting,"The city views from the Observatory, day or night, are beautiful. Oh, and let’s mention there’s a good view of the famous “HOLLYWOOD” sign. The building and patio spaces are a wonderful example of early LA Art Deco, but filled with exhibits explaining the latest in Astronomy. Note: Entry was free, but the prices in the downstairs cafe have literally become ‘astronomical’!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5heartfamily
50,I visit almost every time I'm in LA,"I guess you have to be an observatory geek to love a place like this, but its top notch. They have fantastic programs, especially at night, so check out their website/schedule before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMCBlood
40,Amazing Views,Visited while staying in LA for 3 days & worth making this one of the places to visit. Amazing views of LA & the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasJ29
50,Love the view,It’s so very easy to get up and down to the observations building. I’ve traveled and been to this place many times and enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276alina
10,Couldn’t get parked,Tried to visit this attraction but the closest parking space was about a mile down a very steep hill and you still had to pay to park so needless to say we didn’t stop very disappointing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lill252
50,One of the best views in Los Angeles!,Wonderful views! If you come early enough parking is free (up to 10 am on a Saturday). Very beautiful and also the starting point for a number of great hikes (e.g. To the Hollywood sign).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350kayl
40,Go at sunset,Fab place to watch the sunset. Dash bus up is 50 cent each way so really affordable too. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FiHackling84
50,My rebel without a cause experience,Decided to take a trip to the famous Griffith Observatory to visit some of the famous filming locations from James Dean's 1955 Rebel without a cause..... If you want to park close... you need to get there way early......close parking fills up rapidly.... unfortunately we just missed that luxury... so a drive further down the hills was our only option... followed by a 20min walk back up to the observatory.... to be honest it was a nice walk great views.Once we reached the observatory a quick visit to the James dean bust which is cool then we went inside ... I'm not really into the stars and space thing...but strangely found it very interesting.. booked the show at the planetarium which was excellent... plenty to see and enjoy ... found my filming location so was very happy .... the observatory is a great place to visit and would highly recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/390tonys
50,Beautiful,If in LA you must not miss this. Beautiful and interesting. Observatory itself is a lovely building with lots of free exhibits though we paid $14 to see a show in the main theatre - well worth it.But situation & views over Hollywood & LA just fabulous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtaylormj51
40,Stunning views,"Gorgeous views! Just unbelievably Gorgeous! We didn't go inside, we just walked around the observatory taking in the amazing views and checking out the wildlife. We saw coyotes and hummingbirds. There was also free WiFi and some Pokemon spots if you're in to that as well :p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SasPopps
40,Nice place at sunset 🌅,My girlfriend and went to this hill to enjoy the sunset and Hollywood top view.Honestly it was such romantic kisses with breezy weather,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmwu
50,LaLaLovely,The website was extremely helpful keeping updates on construction and events. The observatory itself was a beautiful peace of architecture! The history was beautiful! Plan to watch one of the shows! The observatory is free but there is a fee for the show. Handicapped accessible! Friendly staff!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroldY8759MF
40,Great place but slightly problematic,"It has been a great place in terms of exhibits and displays, however what we found lacking is sitting benches in corridors and no mobile connections. It is hard to locate a uber cab as driver cannot call you.The drive to and feom griffith is very scenic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anubhavmpm
50,Views,This was a very fun and informative place to see. the views from here are wonderful to see the city and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacieP301
50,Beautiful,"A must do in LA! After many visits, I finally made it there and it worth the beautiful, mythical view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990oliviak
50,If visiting L. A. this is a must visit,Nice views from Los Angeles and Hollywood sign from the hill where this observatory is located. Watch out for parking as it gets filled up earlyInside of course you will be treated to science and astronomy and tons of information,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSC1973
50,Out of This World,"Amazing. Must see if you even visit the L.A. area. The drive through Griffith Park has magnificent views, but once you arrive at the observatory there are sights to behold! You can see the Hollywood Hills, the Hollywood Sign, most of L.A. county, and a few airplanes as far as your eyes can see. Inside the observatory is amazing too. The Griffith Observatory was one of the stops on my tour and I'm glad it was included as I loved La La Land. Inside or outside the observatory presents amazing views of L.A. and the really the universe. Great trip and deserves a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leaving_Samsara
50,LA must do !,This spot should be in anyone's top 3 things to do when visiting.I would definitely suggest a sunset from this location and to catch the shows .we had never seen Jupiter with this clarity before .I would also recommend a ride share as parking gets pretty dense on the weekends .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherc804
50,One of my favorite things to do in LA,"It is really a paradise for Space and Science lovers. Kids and adults would enjoy this expo of amazing tools and displays which you can interact and experiment with, and it is all for free. The show inside the Dome is spectacular, there are 4 shows a day, cheap tickets and an amazing experience for all ages. Saw 2 and they were both extremely interesting! The quality of the images make you travel through space. Loved it. The environment around the observatory is alone spectacular, located on top of a hill with a great 360 view of Los Angeles. Also a hiking trail is right near by! Super Location and super interesting information inside and around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaghoul
50,Top of the world (LA),"Great experience with the best view of the city. Totally free unless you want to go into the auditorium for the talks, which are very reasonably priced. Very comfortable seats, it was hard not to fall asleep. Parking can be a bit difficult, but worth it. ❤️❤️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vicky050268
20,Too many selfie sticks,"We went here after work on a weekday because we thought it might be less busy. We got that wrong. The drive up the hill was slow because we were behind a line of cars. There were a lot of people hiking up the hill too, weaving in between the cars on their way up. At the top you pay for parking. The Observatory itself doesn’t have much to show inside, as it’s all about observing the sky. At every corner of the Observatory grounds you will see people taking pictures of themselves, with the city view behind them. The Hollywood sign is off in the distance and can be captured in a photo. This is perhaps one of the reasons why it’s such a busy spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionao315
20,Rude staff,"We unknowingly wandered in behind a school group, not realising the observatory was closed to the general public.Had we seen a sign indicating this we definitely wouldn't have made our way in.My friend approached the desk to ask a question and was rudely told to leave the building. As we then made our way back upstairs we were then told again rudely by security to immediately leave the premises.Calm down guys! Would love to know how you would react to an actual security incident. Just hope one day you know what it feels like to be a clueless tourist needing help. 'It's nice to be important but it's important to be nice', perhaps staff training in empathy and custom relations wouldn't go astray. It might also be an idea to have staff monitoring the entrance at the top so people don't come in confused as we did.I'm sure the observatory itself is great but after that initial experience we decided to give the observatory a miss. I do hope management takes this feedback on board..And to the two very rude gentlemen we encountered, if you ever happen to visit my country we'll be sure to take care of you properly :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaddyR_11
50,Nice place bit crowded,If not timed properly it can get quiet crowded up here to see the Hollywood sign. Beautiful breath taking scenery everywhere..on a clear day you get to see good view of los Angeles and also take snaps with Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441ipsitad
50,Must see!,I think most people go up so they can view the Hollywood sign but this is a great observatory. Two of the telescopes were viewing the sun and the moon. Cool exhibits. The building is beautiful. Love the statue of the astronomers out front. Very crowded and parking is a bit of a pain. But definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klbrownee
50,Great views of LA,"If you want to get a great view of LA and also have hiking trails, this is a great location to do that. You get the mix of the natural elements of LA and you can see all of the hustle and bustle city life of LA. Parking is $4/hour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waltlewjr
40,interesting and educational exhibition,"It's a short drive up the hill, but it takes some time to get the car parked, if you mind a short walk. My personal recommendation for the lazy ones: Either come early or take the shuttle.The Observatory is an impressive building and provides from the parking lot a great view on the Hollywood Sign. Inside is an amazing exhibition which definitely takes some time, but is worth the investment.Our tour guide tried hard to be funny, but failed from the very first moment, so we decided to leave the group and explore the exhibition ""un-guided"".Absolutely cool to spend half a day in the Observatory and hiking in the hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dude_loves_to_travel
50,Amazing,"We went on an August Saturday afternoon / evening and had a great time.Parking - the queue for parking in the lot was about 2 miles long (we entered via Fern Dell Dr) and in the end we did a U turn and parked in the large, free car park at the bottom. There is a 1 mile trail (a clear but dusty, safe and wide trail, up hill) to the top of the observatory. If you are going to be at the observatory until late in the evening, you will feel safe walking back down; there will be other people walking too but it will be dark make sure you take a torch or have enough charge on mobile phone to use as a torch!Zeiss Telescope - the observatory opened at 7pm and we queued for c40mins. It was worth it, we had a great view of the moon through the telescope. However, there was little / no queue management or information available and several people left early in sheer disgust.The remainder of the observatory was interesting, museum like, with plenty of interactive exhibits to look at / tinker with.Views - fantastic views of the LA skyline and the Hollywood sign. The sunset was also fantastic and worth waiting for.Worth a visit but, it was very busy when we were there and seemingly it is always busy irrespective of what time you go.Enjoy.... Take a torch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardN28
40,Nice!,"One can get a nice view of the city and Hollywood sign from here. Inside the observatory, there were many informative things especially for kids and science lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711surbhig
30,Just Average,"Would I go again, no. It's pretty, your up high, and yes you can see the Hollywood sign. That's about it. There are too many lights to see the night sky, there are a ton of people and traffic, and parking is not easy. It's free though. You can look through the telescope if you don't mind waiting 45 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637jaimew
40,Great place to view the city from,You need a car really to get there but its worth the visit. the view is amazing. Better on a clear day and not too hot if possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londonlouise43
50,Excellent,Great place to go. No admission and have access to anything. The only problem was parking. What a buggar as someone actually had to drop us off because it was about 3 miles before we could even park. Other than that - excellent place to visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsAgiedc
50,Visited after seeing La La Land the movie,We visited Griffith Observatory catching an Uber there from our Hotel. There is no entry fee and you can stay as long as you like until 10pm. You can pay $7 to see a show in the theatre but entirely up to you. The view of LA was amazing and the Observatory well worth a visit. Would have known it even existed except for the movie La La Land.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962janined
30,Love love love!,Love love love the telescopes! Saw three constellations tonight and well worth the wait. Uber driver did have a hard time finding the place and picking us up due to the concert at Greek theatre. Need time need to research events nearby better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthao520
50,Interesting and informative,We arrived in day one with an hour to explore as part of a tour. Quickly realising we needed more time as it was the last day of our tour we decided to come back the next day.The next day we uber up to the observatory and spent a few hours there. Great exhibits and a large underground area and theatre. People there to give talks on the exhibit such as what is that pendulum as you enter?? Just wait a few minutes and someone will explain it.Decided to walk back to our accomodation at Dunes Inn on Sunset taking about an hour along dirt trails which was enjoyable day recommend. Don't recommend the walk up to the observatory unless you a super fit!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraK511
50,Amazing views..,Great place to visit and take in the breath taking beauty of Los Angeles! Don't forget to hike it up its even better.. If you can handle it.. 😉,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolar769
50,Awesome views,"My mom and I made the mistake to come on the 4th of July for our first time in LA. MISTAKE! It was SO crowded and there was no where to park. But, come on a regular day and you'll find easy parking, great views, awesome hikes and more! Go inside for some fun education about the stars and go up to the top of the observatory for breath taking views! You can even see the Hollywood sign! Go on a hike! ENJOY YOURSELVES! It's fun here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnase9609
40,Check the operating schedule,"If you want to go to Griffith Observatory, do it on a weekday. But beware, the observatory is closed on certain days. We tried to go there on a Sunday and it was a mad house. There was literally no parking and the park police were having people drive right on through the park and exit out the other side. It was a loooong line of cars all the way up the mountain, only to be met with disappointment. There were no good options.So we went back on Monday. There was parking and the views were great but the observatory was closed. We did not know that would be a thing. We did not even check if it had days it wouldn’t be open.So for the logistical nightmare on Sunday, I would give this a 0, but on a normal day when you can park and walk around and see the views, it warrants a 4 simply for awesomeness and uniqueness.I cannot comment on the observatory since it was closed. But you can still walk all the way around it and see all the views. The parking was easy. It is pay parking up at the observatory. I bet if the observatory had been opened I would have given this attraction 5 stars. Next time I’m in LA, I will check the schedule and go when the observatory is opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshochet
40,Griffith Observatory - overlooking L.A.,Arrived early morning but unfortunately it was closed. But enjoyed the views around from the hill top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434maryo
50,Very nice Observatory,This place is very stunning. From there you can see all the city of LA and the Hollywood sign. You can walking around without paying a ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGirlOfTerezKorut
40,Fantastic views of Los Angeles,"As many times as I've been to Los Angeles, I finally made it to the Griffith Observatory and wondered why it took me so long! The views at the top are fantastic as you can see across the city. The observatory itself has some interesting exhibits, but the real winner for me were the views. We enjoyed a few hours here walking around with the kids. Be prepared to walk from where you park as it is very limited at the top. We got lucky and found some when a car was leaving, however many people park along the hill and then walk uphill to get to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrogersz34
50,One off my bucket list !,Always wanted to visit the Griffith Observatory it was great and very informative loved the views they were fantastic ! Definitely worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98DavidW
40,Good views and interesting exhibits,"Definitely worth a look, found the views brilliant and the camera obscura was very clear.The exhibits were informative although we didn't pay for the extras.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoasterNerdett
50,Outstanding!,"Parking is an issue, but on a Tuesday we got there about 11:30 and there was just enough turnover in the $4/hr lot that we got a space right away. Pre pay via machine. The museum was excellent, though not really suitable for small kids. If you have an interest in the heavens and universe, you can easily spend several hours there...and the planetarium show - Center - was beyond excellent. Cafe is ok - salads were good, hot dog was not! The view, as everyone says, is wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
50,So Glad We Stop!,"On our California Dreamin' Road trip we had extra time in LA before making our flight and we decided to spend the time here. Only disappointment that we didn't have more time.There's. So much to do & see -- much of it free. Parking is at a premium, is timed & strictly monitored/ticketed.Panoramic views of the city not to be missed. Close view of the 'HOLLYWOOD' sign.Try not to miss this stop when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HCrowder
50,"nice walk, superb views","nice walk up to the obsevratory, very educational inside the planetarium, and astonishing views across the city and of course the hollywood sign. Parking is a pain though, especially if there is activity at the theatre halfway up the hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyD2777
40,Could be nicer only if we researched about the place well.,"This is a story of our stupidness. Our mistake was we didn't researched about how to access to the place in advance with an optimism. Went there at a sunset time only with relying on Google maps and drove up Western Canyon road which was closed beyond a parking far below the destination. Then we continued by walk on a trail and then off the trail to climb up a hill for short-cut as many other visitors was doing. The short-cut hill was slippery and dangerous for the way back to the parking in a darkness. So we couldn't enjoy the observatory well worrying about safety way-back and left there earlier.At sunset time around, only Vermont Canyon Road is accessible to the observatory. The parking lot and parking space near the observatory are full occupied at evening, but may have chance to find a returning visitor's car.Even you can't find parking space near the destination, still it's far better to park at the road side space than an unexpected dangerous trek.We visited there after enjoying full day at Universal Studios. But we should have left US earlier to avoid extreme congestion at weekend's evening.Fantastic place to go if you learn how to get there and enjoy yourself properly in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koncha108
50,Best View for LA,"Great place with very great view, you can see Hollywood sign very clear from this point, have an outstanding view of LA and you can use the telescopes (50 Cents for around 2 mins) for better view for the city and Hollywood sign. I recommend visiting it in the morning it's stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnawito
50,Famous landmark in LA,"If you've never been to the Observatory, make the time. It's beautiful and historic. If the sky is clear, there are great votes of the city and all the way to the beach. Parking is a mess so wear comfortable shoes if they are diverting traffic away from the main parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293dianay
40,Interesting way to spend an afternoon.,We recently spent an afternoon here and we enjoyed it. Parking was $4 and everything else was free. There were some films to watch for an additional fee but to just wander around and view the sights was free. It was fun to see the view of LA and it was interesting to go through the small museum at the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655nb655
30,Chaotic,We tried to go Friday at lunch and Saturday night after 9 pm. No parking available either time. People everywhere. Very disappointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apert
40,See teip,Nice place to take clients for a brief bit of sightseeing. It wasn’t open but was still worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike5632
50,The perfect view of a perfect sunset on a perfect day.,"Fantastic place to watch the sunset, along with some stunning views of Los Angeles, and to see the Hollywood Sign.Ideal way to end a day in Los Angeles, whether for a picnic, some photography or for some hiking.I recommend this to tourists as one of the best places to visit on your holiday and to see the cityscape of LA in all its wonderful glory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pale_Blue_Dot_85
40,"Excellent views, parking can be a pain though","First we tried visiting early evening but parking was a pain - they weren't letting anyone drive up the top and it was rammed full on the hills leading up to the Observatory so in the end we gave up. We came back the following morning though and it was much better. Plenty of space to park in the spaces leading up to the observatory and in the spaces at the top.Parking is $4 for an hour but is free before 12pm (we didn't realise this till after we paid, stupidly). The views are amazing from the top over downtown LA and the hills area, and you also get a decent view of the Hollywood sign (though its still quite far away).Queues for the restrooms were long. Observatory wasn't open when we were there strangely, must open later in the day. Worth a trip up there though whether its open or closed as the views really are excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olihenryy
20,What’s the point,"When I think observatory, i think of powerful telescopes so we can see amazing things and sign ups for guided night views. This didn’t deliver. Yes, I’m sure people will say that’s not what this place is.....but again, what’s the purpose then? Just call it a place to look at the city and the Hollywood sign. In retrospect I shouldn’t have got my hopes up. Tough to see much of anything in southern CA. Otherwise I gave it a 2nd star because it’s not a complete loss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xamers
50,Great place to visit; great views of the hills and the city,"I have always wanted to go to Giffith Observatory. Thankfully on a recent trip to LA I was able to make my way to the top and get the wonderful view over the city.Plenty of people hiked up and if I return I would like to do the same as it would be a nice, if not a strenuous, walk with plenty to see while doing it.The observatory itself is a wonderful building, very grand with wonderful architecture throughout. Unfortunately I was unable to make any of the shows that they have on, but even just walking the building was very informative and fun.The views over LA and the surrounding hills is possibly the best part. There are plenty of areas to just lounge and watch the city below.Definitely one to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drbinoche
50,What a beautiful view from there ...,... a good idea for a perfect sun set (except the Santa Monica Peer) location. Beside the great view also the exhibition is interesting and worth to visit. Pls be carefully as many others would have the same idea - so parking might be difficult. Uber is a good alternative to go there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JUW65
40,No need to stand in the heat for 20-30 minutes,"So the views are amazing. If you go to the planetarium they say you have to queue 20 minutes before the show starts - they helpfully have a tent but it’s in full sun and Very hot. There is no need to show up ahead - stay inside looking at the exhibits in the ac and show up 2minutes before it starts. Just don’t be late. The planetarium is huge - loads of space even on the weekend. Why they don’t let people in ahead of time into the ac planetarium is also a mystery to me. Lastly the road is one way - So even if you are parked at the bottom of the hill they make you drive with everyone else up the hill to go down again - all the visitors appreciated our carbon dioxide. They have a 2lane road can someone apply some common sense, maybe have half the hill drive straight down to go out?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angmohs
50,Beautiful Viewa,"Great place to stop by. The views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign are amazing. The observation telescopes are pretty cool also. The only downside to the place is the cafeteria. It’s dirty, really bad food and extremely expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kris_goku
50,Be Amazed and Increase Your Celestial Knowledge,Spend an afternoon at the Griffith Observatory and come away smarter and exhilarated.Interesting and well documented exhibits provide concise explanations of many aspects of the heavens and the universe. The planetarium film show is a must-see that will increase you knowledge of the cosmos and raise your spirits by revealing waht an amazing place the universe truly is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuckG_12
40,Arrive early if you want to park here,"We went twice, the first time the whole area was close for filming and the second time we arrived early. We were still directed down the hill to roadside parking as the limited parking at the observatory was taken. There are great views of La and the Hollywood sign from the observatory. They also have a mid day free demo of a large sundial which works when the sun is at its highest point. Worth observing if you are there around midday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
40,Great place to see the Hollywood sign,"Since you can't just go up the Hollywood sign, this is one of the best places to see it and LA. Parking is self pay and becomes an issue early, but people are coming and going constantly. There is parking further down the road, but then you have to walk up a little ways. I noticed that most visitors don't go into the observatory, they are just their to see the sign. One recommendation. In order to get a good picture, check the position of the sun for the time of day and time of year you are going to visit. Try to make sure that it is behind you which occurs later in the day. A telephoto lens is also recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuanOquendo
40,Awesome,"This place was awesome. I am reviewing this a year later as we are back on a second vacation this year. It was crowded and we had to park down the canyon, not fun at first. It made the adventure better though. Great views of Los Angeles on the 15 min walk up. You can drive to the top and drop off or handicap park. Check first though to be sure of the exact rules. There is a lot of history here. Be sure to look on the ground as you walk up to the observatory. It's the solar system map in a sense and you will be amazed at what you see. There is a Tesla Coil demonstration inside and other cool lessons. Great views and very worth it. Hidden gems inside from sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scoot1966
50,A must,"The park is a place of natural beauty and it’s fair to say the higher you climb the better the views of the city.From the observatory, you can get a good picture of the Hollywood sign and have fantastic views of the city.The observatory itself tells an interesting story and has a lot of interactive displays along with the planetarium.The planetarium has three different shows, we only saw one, but throughly enjoyed it.If you are in LA, I would certainly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJA_7
20,What a waste of timd,Went here to get a look of the city and the Hollywood sign. I am not sure if there was an event or it is always like it but we had to park halfway down the hill because there was so many people. Get to the top and the sign is ages away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelH369
40,Night view,Great experience definitely worth going at night if ever going to la.try to go during the week when. The observatory is open.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hpracas
50,Very nice place,I didn't know this place at all until my firends got me there. I just fell in love with it. This place gives you a splendid view where you don't want to leave. The observatory is really nice you couls spend an entire day in it. Too bad the parking is so exxpensive...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alinangie
40,Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign,Good place to visit if you want panoramic views of the city of LA and the Hollywood sign. The building wasn't open to tour. Also many walking trails to the canyon are accessible from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixie955
50,Amazing during day and night,"Easy to get to in the mornings, when the observatory is closed. Free parking until 12:00 PM. Has amazing views of LA.Also went in the late afternoon and stayed as night fell. the views are even better at night.Saw Saturn and its rings through one of the telescopes which was very cool, also caught a show at the planetarium, highly recommended!If you are arriving with a car, make sure to get there before 6 PM to avoid the traffic and get a chance to find a parking space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natansil
50,Probably the best view in all of Los Angeles!,"Time your trip if you actually want to drive up and park for free and walk around in a calm atmosphere. We tried several times to get up to the Observatory on our trip: Once at night we were in a traffic jam on the mountain going up, then down the hill and gave up. Another day we arrived shortly after 9:00am... quick drive to top, lots of parking before the observatory opened, so we were able to walk behind and take pictures from the hills and see the skyline of Los Angeles. Less crowded at this time as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain
40,"After a day of strolling through Hollywood, try this gem...","I've been going to Griffith Observatory since like 1st grade, over 50 years ago. Having moved to Hawaii some 40 years ago, I seldom get back to L.A. When I do get back there, Griffith Observatory is always at the top of my list. Extensively upgraded, it's no longer the observatory of my youth. Exciting new exhibits abound, & the upgraded planetarium theater is amazing. After dark, line up to gaze through their new digital telescope. Excellent educational opportunity for kids, the scientifically minded, or curiosity seekers. Great photo ops with the Hollywood sign in the background, & see the city lights stretch all the way to the horizon. Admission is free, except for the planetarium which is just $7.00 for adults, & $5.00 for kids & seniors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawaii96815

Went at perfect time, seen the sun set and watched it slowly get darker. The twinkle of all the lights was so pretty. I got to see the moon and Saturn through the telescopes they provide. This was really cool. To anyone that stays in California or visiting and haven't been here. GO (:",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bettscockburn

30,Awesome views,Went on a tour which took us so early that we only got to go around the outside. Therefore I can’t comment on inside. Outside the views over LA are amazing and the building itself is impressive to see. We literally just walked around it’s outside so nothing special,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mytravel-7202

50,Sunset visit,"Caught the LADOT shuttle bus from Vermont and Sunset station...50 cents per person. This appeared to us to be the best way as the car park was full and even people who had parked near the Greek Theatre hopped on the shuttle to head up the hill.Great view from the top....arrived just before sunset and then stayed to watch the lights of LA below.A great way to spend a few hours, get some great views for very little cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniG
50,Great views of the city,"We wanted to visit the observatory as fans of La La Land and were not disappointed with our visit to this attraction which has free entry.

50,An excellent evening under the stars!,"Despite the traffic getting to the observatory and some difficulty getting around the area, it was a fabulous evening due to the special events provided by United.Catering was outstanding, service impeccable and the events in observatory, attended only by the special invitees was wonderful. The education at the observatory is unmatched. Take your time when you go. Read everything. It is just amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/llvassoc
50,Beautiful View,Parking is ridiculous! Takes too long to get to the location. Traffic cops were unreal! Observatory was cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieann425
50,Ideal to see the sunset and the stars,It's important to plan ahead. Be there before the sun goes down and see the city. Make the line to enter the big telescope that opens at 7pm. Usually takes 40 minutesSometimes the volunteers take their own telescopes to the ground in front of the building to show the planets tooYou can do this free or pay for a video presentation too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandramendi
50,One Great Experience!,"Amidst L.A.'s hustle and concrete jungle madness, Griffith Park and Observatory is a welcome respite and a chance to get away from it all, even for just a day. Whether you're a nature-lover, photographer, science or history geek, hiker, people watcher, or just plain one bored soul, this place will do you good. Yes, parking can sometimes be an issue and can add to the stress you might be trying to unload but nothing is ever 100%, right? Bonus: The drive to get up to and down from the Observatory can be an adventure in itself! Don't forget to look into the other features of Griffith Park other than the Observatory, including night time events! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinggoy2
50,The best spot on Los Angeles,"The Griffith observatory is my favorite place to view the stars, planets, occasionally the nebula, learn about planets and our solar system, and watch the sunset over the entire city. The tickets to the phenomenal shows at the planetarium are conveniently available and affordable, a must do every chance you get. Highest possible ratings!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813deboraht
50,Beautiful view of LA,"It's very nice ride up to the top, especially if you are driving. Can be a little overcrowded on the weekends and hard to find parking, which is free btw. The best thing about this place is walking outside. There are a lot of hiking trails if you like that, otherwise you can stay at the observatory and go inside and walk around the building. Little knowledge doesn't hurt anybody 😊. View is really amazing of LA downdown and the Hollywood sign. There is also a cafeteria where you can get bite to eat or bring your own and have a picnic. Weather you go for sunrise or sunset, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy and have fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albanm955

Hear it is also beautiful in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhang389
50,Sunset Strolls,Came here with my soon to be wife and it was great! Awesome view of the city from multiple look out points.

50,A must see place to visit in the L.A. area,"I was hesitant to visit this place. It meant less beach time. However, it was incredible and now I'm still amazed how many times this observatory shows up in various TV series over time. The view from here is incredible, though smog does obscure the vista at times -- especially in the morning hours. On some evenings there are musical concerts being held nearby and so the road to access the place can be crowded.. Also, this is NOT a good place to hike to the Hollywood sign from, even though some websites claim it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/359lynna
50,great view,"a great view of the sky, hillsides and LA. worth the time to visit. inside the planetarium is very interesting and interactive for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjzepp
50,Super Cool!,"This is a pretty cool spot to visit! My Father lived in California when he tool me to this Observatory. I was not aware that this is the one that they used in the movie ""Independence Day"" (with Will Smith), so that made it even better for me to want to go! It is up away from the valley pretty high. Once you get up there, its really cool to look down in the valley of L.A.. Once we had walked in and started looking around, this place was super cool! A place you definitely would want to go see and take your children as well. I cant say enough about it really so, I will just say this, ""Go""! Enjoy your visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngiC138

50,Surprise lesson in astronomy!,"We arrived at the Observatory by Uber (a good idea as they can drop you at the Observatory rather than having to park ~200 - 500 m down hill) and were looking forward to enjoying the sunset. We took a quick look around at the exhibits and one of the friendly staff started to chat to us about solar eclipses, and she was so engaging that we ended up asking her questions for 20 mins or so. She was so passionate, and it meant that our visit was so much more than we'd anticipated! Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronhS8193UA

50,The representative wonderful spots in Hollywood where you can see the breathtaking wonderful night view of Los Angeles,"言わずと知れたハリウッドを代表する天文台です。特定の駐車スペースがありますが、展望台にたどり着くまでの道沿いにもたくさんの駐車が。夜になると路肩は駐車の長蛇の列ができ、展望台まで少し歩くことになります。その分、展望台からのロサンゼルスの夜景は息をのむほどの美しさ。この夜景を見るだけでも行く価値は充分にあると言えます。単に巨大な望遠鏡が望遠鏡があるだけでなく、展示を含め天体を身近に知ってもらうための設備やサービスもたくさんあります。例えば建物前の広大な広場に、小型望遠鏡がちらほら。解説員が丁寧に星の解説をしてくれます。ハリウッドでの素晴らしい思い出になること間違いなしのスポットです。It goes without saying that the observation deck is one of the representative wonderful spots in Hollywood. Because it is tremendous popularity even now, parking at night is full. There is also a long line of parking on the shoulder along the road. In some cases, you'll walk a little from the parking location to the observatory deck, but the night view from the observatory deck is worth it.The attraction of the observatory is not only the breathtaking wonderful night view of Los Angeles. There are lots of exhibits and services for getting familiar with astronomical objects. There are small telescopes somewhere in the open space, commentators will explain the astronomical objects politely. It is one of being wonderful memories of Hollywood for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyber0515
50,Love this plae,We visited this place twice on our holiday. Once during the day to do a hike around the park which we loved. The 2nd time was on a night. We watched The Universe Show in The planetarium and were also able to view Saturn through their telescope. An amazing sight which I’ll never forget. The views are just as stunning on a night as during the day around all the view points. This place is worth a visit but park at the bottom and get fit by walking up. A shuttle is available to take you to the top for 50c for those of you who are unable to walk far or are just lazy 😜,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMoffett73
30,wonderful view. SHAME IT IS CLOSED ON MONDAY!,"WE HAD ONLY ONE DAY IN la WHEN WE COULD GO THERE. THE ONE PLACE I WANTED TO VISIT! while the planetarium as closed, they were taking parking for people at $4.00 an hour. All the attendants said to me was Come back tomorrow! trouble was we were on a plane to Australia that night. WHAT you can be open Saturday and Sunday but not Monday. Priorities. I would have loved to visit - never again. It took 3 hours to get a taxi to our hotel. While there, no place was reserved for eats or drinks . I find this sad. will not bother again, as will probably the other thousands who were there as well. Once again your loss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sayitis

50,Allow yourself plenty of time this is a brilliant place to visit,"Parking is badly organised and very drawn out, we recommend you get there as early as you can and then wait until it opens at 12. However annoying the parking it is really worth it.So much information put across really well, we learnt so much about the solar system our own planets and others and we had fun learning with the interactive exhibits and the way the information it displayed it is really excellent. Add to that its in a huge park and it looks down on the pollution of Los Angeles - you feel you can breathe its a great place to walk the views are brilliant and we really did have a wonderful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngiePetkovic

Parking is very limited so we would suggest going early in the morning to get a space at the top of the observatory. If there is heavy haze do not bother as you cannot see anything, particularly if you are going at sunset. You can also see the Hollywood sign in the distance from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessgreen17
40,Amazing to see,I would have given the observatory a 5 star rating but it was so hard to park around there we were unable to go the last time we were to meet a group there. If you could find a bus that will take you there it would be much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobsK4412NM
50,AMAZING!,"One of the main reasons for my LA visit was to see the griffith observatory. And it most certainly did not disappoint, from the views, to focaults pendulum, to tesla's coil to lessons about the stars :)The views of the Hollywood sign and LA were to die for.I can't say enough or praise the griffith observatory enough.YOU MUST VISIT IF IN L.A.!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695charlenev

You can bridge time while visiting the observatory or stroll around to view the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turbonero
50,Interesting place - amazing location,This free observatory offers interesting exhibits and displays throughout the building. I would also recommend the paid for performances in the main planetarium. The one I attended was informative and entertaining also.I visited at sunset and it was very enjoyable to see the sunset over the eastern Hollywood Hills from the western terrace of the observatory. There are also great views of the Hollywood sign also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY
50,A definite must go to.,"Featured in the film La La Land, I wanted to go for that reason but the place is amazing. Built high up near to the Hollywood sign its FREE to get in you only pay for parking. The views across LA are great. The building itself offers a range of mind boggling things to see. If you have children its a very good way to educate them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelemar
50,Fantastic excursion,I hiked up to the Griffith Observatory and the walk was totally worth it! Spectacular views of LA from outside and fascinating exhibits inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/362jennj
40,A Headache Worth Visiting,"I have visited the observatory plenty of times. Great attraction with different activities year round. I also visit this for the great view of the Los Angeles basin and the Hollywood sign that my friends and relatives want for their selfies.Parking is a real headache. Always crowded and the people in charge, last time (10/1/2017) had the poorest common sense to direct traffic and allow visitors to come in. There are two routes (roads) to come in, one in wet and one in east, the parking attendant allowed a bunch of cars in from my side of the road, then a bunch from the opposite side, when I thought it was my turn to ""get in"" the sent me to continue to the other road. I went down the road to the foothill, took a u-turn and came back. Exactly the same situation happened. It happened three times and they did not care to apologize. They only e",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795flaviov
50,LA bus tour stop,"This stop was well worth it, breathtaking views inside and out. Can see the Hollywood sign from ourside the building.

Lots of different depictions of how the sun moves and seasons and planets, etc. This is where the hit movie La La Land was filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714kalier

50,Beautiful view!,"This was totally worth the visit! We took the $0.50 shuttle up to the observatory which was great - we passed by all the people parking their cars and walking up. Going back down, however, was a different story (long line and the bus driver had no control).The observatory itself is beautiful - there is a lot of interesting information inside about astronomy and observatory history. There is a 20 minute film (with Leonard Nimoy) that is worth watching.You can pay for the planetarium (I believe it was $7) but we didn't do it. Line ups were long though! There is also a cool telescope you can look through, but get in line early - it starts at 7pm (in September).There is a gift shop and cafe. Wifi is free but spotty. We spent some time on the patio to enjoy the gorgeous sunset. There is also an amazing view of downtown LA as well as the Hollywood sign. Lots of hiking around too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kari1001
40,Take a day off!,"On the day of the July Full Moon, I just felt like taking the day off and going to the Observatory. In addition to the panoramic views of the Los Angeles basin, being up in the Hollywood Hills held its own charm. The docents and guides were very courteous, and the Gift Shop was well-stocked. What an R&R ""treat"" for yourself, your partner, and/or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodie90210
50,Best View of LA and Hollywood,"The Observatory has many many trails to hike. So if you enjoy being outdoors and hiking / climbing nature trails, this is the place to go.

Treat yourself to the western side of the top roof of the observatory and watch the sun set behind the Santa Monica Mountains.Park at Ferndale Park and walk the trail up to the observatory. Take in the incredible vistas of downtown, mid Wilshire, Century City & Westwood Skyscrapers, both day and night, the vistas are amazing.

50,I always take visitors to LA on a tour of the fantastic Griffith Observatory,"The new layout and exhibits are very accessible and easy to understand for all ages. It is a great way to inspire kids and it is educational even for science minded adults.Do be aware that the parking can fill up early and the only place to park is a long walk uphill to reach the observatory. It is well worth the effort of the mild exercise. Wear walking shoes and sunblock and a hat for the walk.The gift shop is excellent, with a wide selection of great books and toys and gadgets at very reasonable prices. This is a must see for any visitor to LA. The best season is when kids are in school, the crowds are smaller and the weather is cooler.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salc109

If you're not a hiker, you can pay for parking and take a walk around the observatory and the inside has cool exhibits. Great for photos and meeting up with people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaraS1299
50,A must,Historic - having appeared in several films and one of the best places to view Los Angeles and the real stars from.Watch your calendar for astronomical events and check in for the planetarium show. A must see for tourist and residents alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRSONG
40,Added stop before going to Disney,Great place to go we saw two the the shows- easier to buy tickets at the kiosk near the restaurant no lines no waiting the shows are similar and they do over lap a little but well worth seeing both and the speaker is great- great views of the Hollywood sign and LA you can walk up to the Observatory but if you are driving leave before they open as parking is really tight we parked on the side of the road it was pretty crowed later in the day with no parking- very educational could spend all day reading everything but we went through pretty quick as we had limited time- great place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90dianee
40,Best view of Los Angeles,"Is located in one of the top of the hills of Los Angeles, very easy to go there or if you a tourist you can take a taxi too. You can see trough telescopes the city of Los Angeles and the famous sign of Hollywood. You can find a cafeteria or you can package your own picnic and see the sunset there! You can take a tour and do hiking here also.....you can lose this popular atraction in this city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julioaliaga

40,One of the LA must visits!,"We ended our trip going up there, had packed a little lunch bag and we sat on the grass watching the sun go down. It's an easy location to get to, if you are in great shape you can walk, but I recommend taking the car (you have to pay 4$ or hour) or you can take a taxi to the top.You will find the most people up there in the weekend, and do expect to get asked to take someone's picture while you are there.The observatory / museum is also very nice, good and enthusiastic staff. Admission is free, but you are allowed to make a donation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielbB4742IW
50,Best view of the city,"I take everyone who visits me, to this place. The best view, free and if you get hungry or thirsty they have a nice little cafe inside too. Bathrooms are clean too. Even the drive up there is nice! I've always found parking at the very top of the hill after everyone else gives up or gets impatient. Usually plenty of open parking at the top, but you have to pay $. There is also a shuttle you can take as well. Take a picnic to enjoy if you go during lunch but I highly recommend coming here in time to see our beautiful LA sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCexplorerTX
50,Stunning,"We visited Griffith Observatory for about an hour as a part of a tour. The views were stunning. This is probably the best way to get an overall view of both the Hollywood sign and LA below. The Observatory itself is free to visit and is interesting, clean and educational. Be sure to visit the telescope on the roof and the Lenard Nemoy space centre on the lower level. An absolute must visit if in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katabout
30,Miss S,"This is a good day out for sight seeing. The views from the top are outstanding. It was a little hazy when we went but if its a good day you can see for miles. It cost around £4.00 per hour to park near the observatory but if you park in the car park at the bottom of the hill and take the 10 minute walk up it's free and you can spend all day there and even get a few hikes in. The staff give you lots of information about the exhibits there and they simplify it as well so even if you have no astrology knowledge to begin with, you will still understand what they are talking about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasmins947
50,LA by sunset,"Amazing views and vista of LA from the sumit where Griffith Observatory is located, especially on sunset.

The observatory is so beautiful and offers a great view on LA/Hollywood.I went there for the sunset and stayed there until it closed.Saw a movie at the planetarium (for which you have to pay) and it was breathtaking, I wanted to stay there forever.I was able to see Saturn with it's rings and two of it's moon, and our moon with telescopes.There was a lot of people though. (week day/ not holiday)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColineJrd
40,Great views and exhibits,"A great place to spend the afternoon. Griffith Park is amazing in it self. Hiking trails, fun 9 hole golf course but the Observatory provides amazing view of the city. If your kids are interested in astronomy or science they will love this. Parking is tough and I would suggest avoiding the issue by taking a cab or Uber and be sure to indicate Observatory, not just Griffith park or you will be taking a long hike! Also suggest arriving after 2 PM to avoid school trips during the week. Also your kids can run around outside and blow off some steam!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizznyc

50,Griffith Observatory,"An LA must see.Gorgeous hilltop location with stunning views.Magnificent architecture.Well presented exhibits, that will be interesting even to youngsters.The planetarium show is well worth the price and time spent.Parking can be a challenge.

It has one of the best views in all of Los Angeles, and it's a world famous landmark. Those alone make the trip worthwhile.I HIGHLY recommend you go during the week when people are at work and kids are at school. The weekends are INSANE with parking and it could take an hour just to park, you'll have to park a lot further away, and walk 30 minutes up to the observatory, whereas during the week, you'll have much smaller crowds and easier parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MemoriesofaMoonbird

50,'Star Gazing' in LA,"Telescopes are available for 'Star Gazing'! But we have to wait for the night fall...The best solution around is to get in to the planetarium. The shows are all very well planned & shot. It also comes with a beautiful commentary. With telescope viewing; we may not be able to answer our kids wrt star, planet & constellation names. So the suggestion is to take the inquisitive children in to the planetarium & #Simply Relax#",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cshastry2

From here you get a clear view of the Hollywood name board. You will get a birds eye view of the city. If you go in the evening you can have everything.

40,Beautiful view!,We went here on our first night and we were really jet lagged so we got an Uber (i do love Uber!) and it was such a lovely place. We went early evening and it was a really nice atmosphere and a lovely view of LA and the Hollywood sign. We went into the planetarium and watched a short film (we may have fallen asleep but the seats were reclining so who can blame us!).A good place to go when visiting LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurenoflondon
50,Geeked out over all the space and planet stuff!,"We visited on a night when Saturn was visible through the 12"" telescope and it was fantastic! What a view. The docents here do a great job and obviously enjoy what they do. Lots of stuff to do and your kids will love it. Definitely do one of the planetarium shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toy4runr85

Uber is available so it's taxi or you can go with car on even walk from the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizaprivosnik
50,A Beautiful Mix of Art and Science,"I went here to celebrate my 23rd birthday back in November and I was very impressed! I adore the Art Deco architecture and paintings inside, along with the planetarium show, exhibits, Tesla coil, the panoramic shots of DTLA and the Hollywood sign. The fact that there's free admission is a big bonus. This is a place that inspires learning and appreciation of the world around us in both scientific and artistic terms. It's great to have cultural landmarks like this to instill a sense of awe and wonder in people. I can't believe I never visited this place before, because I've been missing out this whole time on a truly great experience! Other than the crowds and narrow, bottle-necked roads, this place is pitch perfect and I can't sing its praises enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
20,Very disappointed !,I have wanted to visit Griffith Observatory for a long time but we never seem to have time when we go to Los Angeles because of other activities. We always use cabs/Taxi's as we don't hire a car while we are there. The observatory is quite away from other attractions therefore it cost us a lot in cab fares. The observatory is free to enter which is a good incentive to visit. We personally found it along way to go as there is not really a lot to do when you are there. The staff at the observatory that we came into contact with were very unhelpful and caused us a lot of distress as we couldn't get a cab to leave when we had finished our visit. We asked 3 members of staff how to get a cab. 2 just had no idea and couldn't even provide names of cab companies and even though the 3rd guy did provide us with details of how to get a cab his attitude and customer service was disgraceful. We would definitely not recommend this activity unless you are on an organised tour or you have other transportation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandyB679
50,Nice view!,"View is great, I went on a weekend so the observatory was packed - it was worth any ways.Just pay attention where you park, otherwise you can get tickets. Make sure you know we’re your parking and for this it will not be very close to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837mar_liac
20,Paying the LA LA Land price!,Whenever in LA we always enjoy a ride up to the Griffith Observatory to enjoy the fantastic views and walks. However this August it was a traffic nightmare with queues all the way to the top and parking chaos. The tourist crowds were just huge and you couldn't move around comfortably. Hopefully the LA LA Land hype will have faded by our next visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheThrifyFiftys
50,Beautiful spot to catch a sunset,"Ubered to the Observatory to appreciate a Californian sunset and wasn’t disappointed. The view of the city is beautiful. You can see te Hollywood sign from there. Get a good spot and will enjoy a breathtaking sunset. It gets a little bit chilly as the sun sets, so recommend to bring a jacket. Traffic gets a little heavy going down, so you might have to walk about 10-15’ to get an Uber/Lyft to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaDulces
50,Great at night!,The observatory was VERY crowded and parking a challenge. The line to the telescope was so long that we didn't get to look into it. That was ok because the sight of LA at night was still spectacular! We watched a show in the planetarium and was so relaxed almost fell asleep!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famw2girls
40,Don't even have to enter,"It's totally worth to visit this, even before or after the opening hours, because the view is awesome! Note that the parking is gratis before 12.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrkNilsson
50,Outstanding,"Great place to visit. So many interesting things to see and much to learn here. The pendulum that is just inside the entrance is quite interesting and there are several displays covering the cosmos that are worth the time to explore. Entry to the Observatory is free, but parking is extremely limited and $4/hr unless you have a handicap permit. Those spots are scarce as well. If there are no spaces available, make a trip back down the hill and then come back to try again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g3times
50,The view,"The view here is a must see, the Hollywood sign, L.A and the building its self. Perfectly located, when you go there you can eye off all the beautiful houses going up the hill. We took a Lyft there. The building has so much free activities to do, very educational about the solar system. Well worth the 2-3 hours. Wear good shoes as you will be doing lots of walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzydzioba
50,Must visit in LA,"Unfortunately due to an event taking place next to Griffith Observatory the parking was full so we had to park c.40 mins away and take a hike up to Griffith Observatory. The walk was actually nice (however wear trainers and be prepared for a steep uphill walk!)amazing views in the evening, great to take photos of the city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrey157
50,"Unique , educational and great views","Nice to see there is a wonderful and educational venue that is free to enjoy. Terrific family place for all ages to enjoy.

Many international visitors enjoyed this special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iris24
10,Nightmare,We drove up to watch the “golden hour”. Unfortunately another trillion had got the same idea with their millions of cars. So we found us selves in a massive traffic jam with the hope of leaving as soon as possible. But we saw the observatory when we passed it in our car.Too many people. It was a nightmare. We definitely won’t be coming back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikkiDenmark
40,Amazing and informative,"The place takes you back and forth in time with deep routed knowledge and on our solar system and the universe plus amazing view of LA.For a good experience take the bus from the Vermont station exit, takes 50 cents to the observatory and skips all traffic. Taking the car would mean traffic and horrible parking scenarios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shivam_Behl
50,Saw Saturn through telescope!,"Worth the visit! The observatory is open until 10pm but the line for the telescope on top of the building closes at 930pm sharp. They will tell you there are no exceptions based on how far you've traveled or if you have disappointed kids and we did see them turn people away. On the night we went, we were able to see Saturn. Great views of LA and Hollywood on a clear night from the outside decks. We parked our car on the side of the road leading up to the observatory and walked up. To note the area up to and on the observatory grounds is fairly dark at night. There are restrooms available outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelg
50,If you are in LA don't miss that place.,This is totally worth it but in the weekend they can be some long lines. I probably would visit this place during the weekday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yvesg
30,Museum,"This place brings back lots of good memories back late 80,s I was growing up in HollywoodWe used to go up there at night or day hang out see the view of LA night life and dream about life some day we gonna get rich or famous and find me a pretty girl friend and get married this place right next to Hollywood big sign during that time I was working at Hollywood wax museum life was so fun like Hollywood rock star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammadsR779VN
50,Beautiful viwes,"As part of an LA tour, we stopped here for the most amazing views of LA. It had just rained and the skies cleared for a beautiful view of the surrounding city and Hollywood sign. The observatory was not open yet so we couldn't explore inside but I would recommend this being a spot on anyone's trip to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJP-LJK

50,Bike Ride to the Observatory - September 2017,"If you're into science and in particular, astronomy, this is the place for you! Best thing about this local attraction...entrance is free (somewhat). About 10 years ago, this place went through some renovations. I finally made it back and got in to see the changes. There are not many changes in the main entrance exhibit area, but it has been cleaned up (not that it was bad before). They opened up a downstairs exhibit area and added a restaurant with a view! Now if you want to see one of the shows, there is a minimal charge (currently $7 for adults). They do offer discounted tickets for children, seniors, and active duty military. I took in the show...they've upgraded the seats. I was really impressed with the live narration that lasted for nearly 30 solid minutes! If you see a show...the back seats are the best to view from.On the outside of the observatory, there are telescopes for looking around the city skyline (coin operated). You can see the HOLLYWOOD sign as well from here, but you're not really that close to it. Some people hike up from the bottom as there are lots of trails. I rode my road bike up from the zoo area as there isn't much vehicle traffic from this direction. There is a charge to parking at the observatory...and you may still have to walk up a hill for a little ways. If you're in shape or just want the exercise, you can park for free at a couple lower lots and walk up...you can also park at the Greek theater for free and walk as long is there is no event scheduled (check before you park here). There's also free WiFi...at least outside.They do have special events here...especially if there is something astronomically occurring...like the recent partial eclipse. These can be very crowded times to visit...but are usually worth the extra hassle. Check or call ahead if you interested in things along this line.Although this place has become really popular and get get quite busy any day of the week, for me, I really like this place. If you have the time or are interested in getting in a little more sightseeing after visiting the zoo, this is a good place to stop and spend a couple hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kitman
50,A good place to view the Hollywood sign,"We took a trip up to the observatory because our daughter wanted to see the Hollywood sign. My son likes the sciencey part of places like this, so we thought we'd give it a go.Parking is at a premium once you reach the top. And parking is $4/hour. People are coming and going all day, so I wouldn't worry too much about not having a place to park.Admission to the observatory is free. It's a beautiful view of the city. There's also a lovely monument to James Dean.I would highly recommend visiting Griffith Observatory if you are looking for a nice place to visit. There's plenty of open space to have a little picnic in the grass.We didn't stay any longer than an hour since the shows we were interested in were about 3 hours after we intended to leave. Maybe try to be there first thing in the morning or later in the afternoon around dusk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321christab
50,A Los Angeles Icon and a must see!,"I always bring friends and relatives who are visiting L.A. to the Griffith Observatory.It's a beautiful and interesting building with cool statues of astronomers, the orbits of the planets laid out on the grounds so you see the relative distances between them, a bust of James Dean because some of Rebel Without A Cause was shot there, neat old science stuff inside and great views of L.A. all the way to the ocean. There is a new wing with cool huge maps of the cosmos, a cafe and a nice gift shop. You can hike around there, too. There's lots more to do there, as well but that's the basic (and free!) stuff to do there. You can park for free if you find a spot on the roads leading to it and you don't mind walking or you can pay to park in the lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926jimmye
50,Planetarium in LA,"I love going to the Griffith Observatory. Actually, this is my go to place to bring out of towners to a place where they not necessarily know it exists. You can spend a couple hours just to hang out in this huge place for free. On the weekend, the parking situation can be crazy, but it is still a great place to see the Hollywood sign fairly close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaHappyAllTheTime
40,Beautiful views - and you don't need long to enjoy it,"A great place to see gorgeous views of LA. We arrived early at about 10am and it was not too busy so great for photos. We enjoyed walking around and every angle of the observatory is beautiful so we got snap happy!No need to spend hours there, we didn't have long in LA and so spent roughly 40 minutes here which was plenty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellejbut

50,Heaven Meets Earth!,"First, if you are a hiker this place not only offers the mega telescope to the stars, but take a hike around the Griffith grounds and see the city views that are absolutely gorgeous on a sunny day. The best time is sunset and during full moon, a memory of photos to last a lifetime. I've come here when they have the big telescopes out and saw Saturn's rings first hand, I love the exhibits and it is definitely a family fun yet educational experience you won't forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dale363

50,See LA at Night,"The Griffith Park Observatory, atop THE Hollywood hill, is a must-see in LA. There's no better place to view the city, spread out below, in all its twinkling glory at night. The planetarium is a fun visit and a beautiful building. The drive up is picturesque. It is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELinsky2015
40,Quick visit after a hike up the hill,We went on a Sunday about midday after walking up to the top viewing point above the Griffith. By this time it was pretty busy so we didn't stay long but the views are great especially if you don't want or aren't able to make it further up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FioHu

50,You can't miss it - amazing view and more,"The observatory is at the top of a cliff, so you have the most amazing view of the city there. The sunset is unbelievable from this place, so I suggest you arrive early to find a good parking spot, check the nice exposition and get outside to see the sunset. There is also a great view to the Hollywood sign from the road between parking and the building",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcastelucci
30,"Fantastic view, long wait.","Wonderful exhibits, keeps both children and adults occupied. Didn't enjoy the long ride/walk/wait for the bus though. Guess not the place for people who hate inconveniences.Since it was a very busy evening, most of us parked a mile away and had to take the bus, for which we waited for about half hour. The return wait was more than 45 minutes. The wait for planetarium was even longer( more than an hour). The show was not very impressive but good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAria009900
50,Highlight of LA,"If you're a lover of space, the universe or even just a good view, this is the place for you. I'd recommend arriving just before sunset as the views onto LA are breathtaking. Parking is awkward at busy times and you might have to park far away to get a spot. The museum is amazing and there are various shows to watch in the dome which is awesome. At night they bring the telescopes out so that you can look at planets (we saw Saturn) and the main telescope on the roof allows for a cool view into space.For me, the best thing to do in LA and it totally recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ygs38v

50,Amazing,"The Observatory has amazing views and inside is very interesting.We came quite late so I would recommend to come early so you have time to see everything.We left the car at the bottom and walk up by the mountain, it wasn't hard and there were too many cars, we knew that to find parking in the upper part was gonna be imposible.We enter to watch one of the documentaries, the last one of the day. I don't remember the name but it was super. If you go to the observatory make sure to buy the ticket and be in line 20 minutes b4 the show.We couldn't see the stars from the main telescope as there was a long long line and the when they close it doesn't matter how many people still in line but the good news is that they have small ones in the front and sides and they keep those longer and the lines are shorter. They are good as well, one of the staff told me that you see the same like in the main one.When we were walking back it was dark but I could see a small deer very close to us.For sure I would come back if I ever visit Los Angeles again.Higly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazlyl2015
50,Try to go late in the day so you can see dusk night views also,"Amazing, we drove up and could nt get parked first time round, went up to the top, over and back round and found some parking ;-). As others have said,t he views are stunning, we also did the planetarium visit and had the tour of the solar system presentation - this is a real highlight, the Narrator presenting kept the audience fully engaged with his delivery. as dusk was approaching they pulled out a couple of large telescopes so people could see the moon, this was only 2 days after the lunar eclipse. lots of information inside the observatory, this was a fascinating please to visit and a great place to have your pic taken with the Hollywood sign - better on a clear day though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sc_uk01
50,A beautiful view of LA!,We got to the observatory at around 8pm on a Friday. It was insanely busy but well worth it. There's lots of exhibits to look at as well as a 30-year-old telescope that you can go look through. While we were there you were able to see Saturn. Up on the roof you can see all of LA including the Hollywood sign and it's beautiful. The only downside is that there is an exhibit based on the sun and it is not visible if you are there at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/illusoir3
50,Spectacular views,"We came here in the evening so unfortunately didn't get to go inside the observatory however the views don't disappoint. The whole of L.A light up right before is a wonderful sight, it's honestly beautiful. One thing that did disappoint was we had to pay for parking, everywhere, no matter where you go seems to charge a small fortune to park up for less than an hour it's just so silly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glos690
40,Views,I went here at night time so it was hard to see the Hollywood sign but you can still see it if you look very hard. Got to see over the city and look at the beautiful stars. Now where we parked at it was quite a hike to get here but well worth it. So bring your most comfortable shoes because your going to be waking uphill for awhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_basementboy

50,Every Time!,"There is no place like it! It is my favorite places to visit every time I go to Los Angeles. You could definitely make a day of your visit. Start with a nice hike, then do the activities and shows offered, have a chill lunch while looking out at the breathtaking view, take pictures but not too many(make sure you take in the atmosphere) then hike back down!!! ENJOY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qube30815
50,Great Views and informative visit,"We enjoyed our visit to the observatory, surrounded by such great parks and easy to get to, parking can be really difficult and it is busy. Wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign. If you don't get parking the hike is quite big, wear comfy clothes. Rangers were friendly. The observatory itself has great displays, interactive and lots of interesting information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedusasRiot
50,L A Observatory too !,"A must stop when in LA. Apart from a world of experience about our universe , commencing straight away from the entrance with the science of Foucault Pendulum ....to the 360 degree view of your own space in L A from on top of the hill outside, you would not regret having spent time for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212manju
50,Amazing Views and Great Museum,Wear Comfortable shoes because you will have to walk up hill to get to the observatory. But boy is it worth the walk... We went on a very clear day and you could see for miles...The observatory is a science museum and it has very cool exhibits. We spend a good two hours walking around and enjoying the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GIGTRAVELS
50,What a View of LA.,It takes a full day to really enjoy this place.We ate an early hearty breakfast and then brought a little picnic to eat outside. Go earl to park in the tiny lot or risk parking on street and walking uphill.I wore good walking shoes and brought spending money for the gift shop. We took lots of photos.I learned new things. We even looked at stars with telescope at night.There are stairs and walking. The sun is still bright in winter here but bring jacket and rain boots just in case.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSReviewer007
40,Day to night,Visited the observatory just before sunset there are great views across LA and we got to see it in daylight and then at night as the sun set and the town lit up. It's a steep drive up with parking along the way as you get closer to the top about $2 I think or there is parking at the top if you don't fancy hiking up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinm3662
50,Awesome and must see!,"This is an awesome place! It's high, when I visit around 11am, it was windy.The building architecture is perfect and well maintained .What's inside is something we all can learn although it's not a full fledge science center. The show is paid.Parking however, you need to be lucky to be able to park up there. Don't forget to take photo with the hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinamelody

50,"Dusk, Obseervatory and the ""City of Angels"".","Late one afternoon I hikrd up the path leading to Mt. Hollywood. The trail head starts there connecting the north side of the Observatory parking lot. Over looking the city of Los Angeles the Observatory is always a pleasent place to get away and enjoy the city landscape. General entrance is free however if you want to see the shows it's an added entrance fee. So much cool things to see. Walk around to the front, the south side, and stand on the massive building to see the sunset over the beach. Walk up to the very top of Mt. Hollywood and experience a cheap exciting and healthy hike. Takes around 30-45 minutes to get to the top. Well worth the effort. During certain times the telescopes are open for viewing. The educational booths and displays are very interesting for everyone. The Observatory has a new refreshment shop and has done major additions to make it even better than before. The Hollywood sign is very close and the entire get away is quiet and peaceful. Plus pretty much free. They have changed the parking deal however. It's free to park in the morning time. At some point they will charge for parking. Around 2 PM or so. If you don't mind a little extra hiking you can always park for free on the road which leads to the top where the observatory is found. Sometimes in the afternoon it gets crazy crowded with school buses and it may be tough to park with out paying. A fun day/night. Check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steadicamdaddy
40,Great fun way to Learn,"I took grandchildren 5, 9 and 11 yr old for their first trip to Observatory. They loved seeing how much they'd weigh on other planets. The show for children was ok. Not the one that peeked my interest as a school age child to align stars to form Big/Little Dipper at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonna04
40,Amazing Views for FREE!,Amazing view from the top of the hill and even better from the top of the observatory. Great displays about the solar system inside the building and knowledgable tour guides walking around to answer questions and explain the different displays,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773devanc

40,Well worth it but be smart,"Twice this summer our family went to the Griffith Observatory. It was terrific, once we actually got there. The first time was a zoo as we didn't think to check if any concerts were going on at the Greek theater. There was and the traffic was horrendous on a Saturday night, especially on those narrow 1930's streets. Add to that that once you get a little past the Greek the road narrows to one-way, single lane traffic....all the way up and all the way down. My husband dropped us off but had to park at least a half mile away. They'll only allow those with physical ailments get through to the parking lot if they have a handicap placard or license plate. Once we finally got in and realized we wanted to see a show or presentation we had to get in a long line for tickets, thus shortening the time we had to look around. There is a ticket machine in a small vestibule but tit wasn't working that evening. The next time we went it was earlier on a Thursday, no concert, and it was still packed but not quite as bad. We got there early enough to have a light dinner out on the balcony by the cafe and the view was amazing! We had plenty of time to look around and get tickets and see a different show. I was amazed at how many people go to the observatory. We heard all kind of languages and there were people from all over the world. It was great. If you live near the Los Angeles area or can visit during the fall I would highly recommend to go after daylight savings time has gone into affect. That way, the sky is dark sooner, giving the crowds a few extra hours to view things. I realized after we went than the sun sets later in the summer which is why there were so many people there after 7:00 p.m. Starting in early November sunset will be around 5:30 or 6:00 p.m. If you have a telescope take it; there are always lots of people to help you spot things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlashbackFour
50,Must see location - especially after watching La La Land,"Such a beautiful place to visit, especially at night. However, we did not anticipate the huge lines of cars entering the park. It did not help there was a concert at the Greek Theatre that night which added to the traffic congestion. We arrived a little after 8 pm and did not arrive at the top until close to 9 pm. We lucked out with being able to get a parking spot in the parking lot at the top, but didn't have a back-up plan if we weren't able to find a spot. Luckily, we were in the left lane going up which allowed us to get access to the parking lot (but missed any parallel parking spots - not that we saw one - that were on the right). We missed getting to look through the large telescope as that line cuts off at 9:30 pm. If given the opportunity to visit again, I would look into the buses you can take to get up there, although we also saw the large lines of people waiting to get onto a bus to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chanss

50,A must see in Los Angeles,"My sister-in-law and her daughter came to visit us in Los Angeles and we hiked up to the Observatory. We've done this hike several times and love spending time looking at the interesting exhibits. Sometimes the telescope is closed but if it's open, you can see amazing things. And they have a Tesla coil that is electrified every so often (maybe every hour??) There is no fee to enter. And you don't have to hike up if you don't want to! That's just what some locals do. A really great place to see in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elanach
50,The View of the Skies from the Hill,"Our visit is the result of wanting the grandkids experience the view of our solar system... the planets, the moon and the stars. This started from a simple question from the eldest granddaughter, 'What is out there, papa?'This prompted us to plan a trip to the observatory. It is mind-boggling to be up there in the observatory. You learn things you haven't learned before, or have come across in theory in classrooms. You get to learn the movement of planets, the sun, the moon and the accompanying explanation on how they move, how far from each other, etc.The tour is awesome! You leave the place with some understanding of how the heavenly bodies rotate around the sun, and our solar system system in relation to other systems and the universe as a whole.Add to this the unforgettable view of the city from up there - it is just so breath-taking!Spend time outside with the view of lights at night, then gaze upwards into the dark sky and you can somehow connect what you have learned in the observatory with what you are witnessing outside. We were also allowed to peer through telescopes set up outside to view the lunar eclipse.All in all, there is so much you can take home from the experience... and you will never be the same the next time you look up the skies especially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hexelspixels
50,Griffith Observatory an Amazing Place,"The Griffith Observatory is an amazing place to visit while in Los Angeles. Recently renovated, it boasts amazing views of the city of Los Angeles.General admission is free however, if you'd like to visit the planetarium and see the laser light show called ""Laserium"" there is a fee for that.At night time, you can view the Stars from the telescopes available in the observatory.The Griffith Observatory is located in the Hollywood Hills next to the Hollywood sign. Getting there is easy via Uber or Lyft or through the bus system.How about some movie trivia? ""Rebel Without a Cause"" with James Dean and Natalie Wood was filmed at the Griffith Observatory.Have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamSellsCalifornia
50,Can't believe it's free!,"It's hard to believe that a building with so many cool things to interact with, and learn about has free admission. Not to mention the views of LA and the surrounding canyons. If you want a pretty picture with the Hollywood sign, go to Griffith Observatory close to Sunset - spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolinaPel
40,LA icon,"I've been at the Griffith Observatory numerous times over the years and it never fails to deliver. If you are a Stargazer or have even a passing interest in our Universe, then do make it a destination.If you go on specific evenings, you can take a brief look and listen to a guide about the main telescope array. The Observatory will also have a few, much smaller, telescopes to gaze at celestial bodies on the main lawn (warning: the light pollution from the city is still very high).They have a permanent exhibit in the lower level where a lot of info about the known Universe is given, along with actual rocky debris from space.There's a big Tesla coil in one of the corners (always a weird sensation when it lights up) and a pendulum in the main hall. Part of this level is also a walkthrough of our solar system.Another attraction is the Planetarium, which I believe offers three different shows, but I've not yet managed to see one. Entry to the Planetarium requires a ticket, but it's very cheap: around $7 if my memory doesn't fail me. Next on my list.Parking can be very tricky, depending on the day and the time. My recommendation would be to go in the morning, early, but definitely before noon. Also, dogs are NOT allowed inside the structure, but it's not marked with signs, so you'll be escorted out with your canine friend if you do enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucb280
30,Not as I imagined,"This place was crazy busy! For some reason I thought our visit there would be serene and romantic but it was just so busy - especially with families with children running everywhere. Also, given that we are midwesterners we didn't know about smog and that we wouldn't be able to see the Hollywood sign all that well. It was hard to get any photos just because of all of the people. Traffic was crazy too. We took an uber which posed its own issues -- at the Observatory we had trouble getting cell service t contact an uber to get back down the mountain. It would have been better if we would have had a local take us and show us the ropes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraaV6468CL
50,Great Fews Hours,We went up here really just to get a good view of the Hollywood Sign and I'm glad we did . The Observatory was a great free activity and was really interesting I would highly recommend.A tip is to go early or late as the parking is a nightmare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gresty35
50,"Spectacular views, a must-visit","The observatory, in itself, is really very nice and visit-worthy but what makes this a must-visit trip is the view of the city, and especially at night. Spend some time walking around the plaza and take in the world-famous view of the Hollywood sign, watch the sunset, and go to a show in the amazing IMAX theater. Absolutely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rajan_Munshi
50,Just like in the movies - fantastic view,"I had never visited the Griffith Observatory before. I went late in the day and the view was amazing. Then as the sun set the views changed with vibrant colours. Bring food and drink - there are big lawns for a picnic. There was a long queue of cars to get up there, and my driver dropped me off some way down the hill. Also there was a huge queue for the bus to go down again. But it was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ausmike_1968
50,Brilliant view of the Hollywood sign,"Must visit in LA. Has stunning city views, as well as the Hollywood sign. Free to go inside, though not quite as exciting as that scene from La La Land!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemBright_UK
50,Utterly eye opening! You must check it out!,"We go to LA quite often but this place is like nowhere else I have ever been. Have taken my kids several times.The plaza outside usually has some interesting patrons. Kids should be mindful as there are often devotees of the leaf smoking out there, sometimes right by where the school buses are off loading.Right outside you can look over the short fence and get a really nice view of the Hollywood sign, one of the best spots to legally view it.Once you get inside there is a plethora of stuff to do. The educational exhibits and video presentations are uniformly intelligent with out being boring at all even for my less academically oriented kids and for those that love space oh mamma!The main auditorium where they do the laser light shows is not to be missed no matter what the content is on that particular night though you can make sure you go on the night that has your preferred show by checking out the website.The best attraction of all for me was the telescope itself, the big one. I have not seen a terribly long line any time we have gone and they are efficient but nice in getting you up to the eye piece and into position, then out.Overall this really is something not to be missed. Bucket list type stuff for me, at least until I can catch a ride on Virgin Galactic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frodolives11954
50,Great view,Nice drive up the hill and great views over the city and the Hollywood sign. Seemed. Like lots of walking tracks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NannyKate29
50,Class Field Trip,"I don't really know what changed, but in 5th grade (last year) we went to the Griffith Observatory. Going in was a blast! Locating a the tiny circles on the sidewalk was so much fun with my friends! At first we didn't know it was our solar system, but then we got to the sun and laughed at how stupid we looked while trying to figure out why a bunch of planets were on the floor. And that was just the entrance! It was so cool looking at the walls and messing with the little activities they had. Like seeing how much you would weigh on every planet! We also looked at this HUGE telescope and saw the moon during they daytime! And some of my friend looked directly at the sun! How crazy is that? Not to mention this was all a learning experience. So if want an excuse to do something fun and/or get out of the house, I recommend Griffith strongly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battlewing101
40,Great place for sightseeing,"Weather was great for a weekend sightseeing. The only part I would complain was the parking. Beside that, it is a great place to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IcyK
30,It was just ok.,"The benefit is that you get to see a good view of the Hollywood hills with the Hollywood sign. The planetarium show is what we know already but wld be great for kids. On the way in you get to drive thru the tunnel used in back to the future. The downside is that there's alot of reading which i didn't really do much of. Once you walk around there's not really much to do. Its a fair drive up the mountain, but the building itself is pretty to photograph and the views are also nice to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecksPoint
50,Should be a must place to visit while in Los Angeles,"It's beautiful and free, a mark of LA that allows you to see the city and the observatory has lots to see for your entitle family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liviero2016
50,Reach for the Stars!,"Both externally and internally this is one of the wonders of Los Angeles. The building is perched above the city offering outstanding views over L.A. and also the Hollywood hills, including the Hollywood sign. If you have the time take one of the tracks into the hills for more outstanding views, there are many that lead from the Observatory site. The Observatory is free to enter though there is a charge for the planetarium shows, it is well worth paying for at least one of these just to see the dome transferred into a galaxy of stars. The displays were well set out and informative, offering something for all age groups. A fascinating place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennyl478
50,Great view on the city,"Crowded in night time but great landscape view on the angel's city. Lot of free astronomical events, paid parking as everywhere in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truth122
50,"Beautiful, romantic and best sunset in LA","Best sunset in LA!! Went in may, so the sunset is at 19:45! At 19 the parking lot was almost full!! Took a walk around the observatory, looked at the free telescope and close to the sunset time got my self in the best position to admire the most perfect sunset in Los Angeles!! If you go, get early and by car!! By bike, it is a long way up and in the night it should be easier to get lost!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodrigof879
50,Awesome views inside and out!,"Great views of all of downtown LA-day or night. Come here when the observatory is open (they are closed on Mondays--we went twice in the week) so you can look through their massive telescope. Lots of interesting exhibits on the inside, but the sunsets at night are awesome to see! Parking is VERY limited at the observatory. My recommendation is the park for free at the Greek Theater and for 50 cents you can take the DASH bus up to the observatory, and then they will take you down for 50 cents. Just make sure the Theater does not have any events going on, otherwise you can't park there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebStr2016
40,Better than expected,I found this building astounding and didn't expect it to be so impressive.Perfect for photo opportunities and panoramic views of LA.Parking is $4/hour which you pay for at a machine that takes cash (no change given) or card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305chelseaj
50,Go here!!,Wow wow wow!!In a town where everyone is trying to take your money this place is fantastic and free (except the planetarium show) and very informative. The exhibits inside are designed with everyone in mind.On a clear night there are telescopes set up outside to show you the stars (real ones not Hollywood stars) for free.The views over LA are also worth it especially as the sun sets and the lights start to come on. We were treated to a lightening show over the other side of the city.This is a must do for any visitor to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercL3377CG
50,A must-do!,"Such an iconic building. Amazing views of the entire city. There was lots of traffic, but plenty of parking spaces available in the adjacent parking lot. Gorgeous place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendybayer

40,Come early for parking,"We came mid day on a Sunday and the parking lot was full. We could park further down and hike or take a bus up, but as we only came for the view we just drove on. If you are there for the view only it is better to go on a Monday when the observatory is closed and it is easy to find parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SawadeeOslo
50,Fabulous views,Very well organised parking. Lots of vantage points to see the view of Los Angeles. Really beautiful at night. Observatory is free and a really interesting Art Deco building with multiple displays. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8487HQbarbarac

40,Good and interesting place to visit,"Very nice place with a great view of Los Angeles. You should stay until the sun sets, it gets beautiful and you can take some great pictures during the day and also sunset and night. From observatory you can see a Hollywood sign, it is not that far away. Observatory itself is very interesting with many things to see and hear. There are tours and guides for free and some attractions that you can see when you pay. Employees there want to make each person who gets there special and they answer any questions you ask, even show you what's the next thing you should see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bojanb532
50,Great place To visit,I love this place! Amazing tour. I recomended To take the tour. You can eat inside. The exhibition is great. Take sunscreen and water. You hav,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandrabraun
50,Well worth a visit,"It really is well worth a visit. The views are amazing as is the actual building, its beautiful in fact. We could see the Hollywood sign easily from its grounds. We went twice at different times of the day and evening to watch the sun set and both times it was very crowded so be prepared for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5Maxine1966
50,You must see it but plan ahead for parking,"Griffith Observatory is an LA icon and should be on your list to visit! The biggest issue is getting there...parking fills up quickly (don't even THINK about ""squeezing"" in a space that isn't really there or isn't marked--you'll be ticketed and/or towed) and traffic up and down the road can be very slow. I recommend parking at the Greek theater on days when there is not a show, and then you have 3 options: Take public transit up; take a ride-share (about $4); or hike up a relatively short but steep path, in full sun if it's daytime. We did the ride-share up and then walked back down in late afternoon, when the sun had gone somewhat behind the mountain. Took about 20 minutes to descend; fairly steep, would not recommend for anyone with mobility or knee issues.But the observatory itself: wonderful, even though very crowded when we were there. Excellent exhibits; enjoyed the planetarium show (no problem getting tickets); and also watched the free film about the renovation of the observatory (Leonard Nimoy was a little creepy as host, but since it's free and otherwise interesting -- OK).Would recommend visiting at sunset if you can (we were there in late afternoon but did not stay until sunset)--views would be spectacular. And the telescope does not open until close to sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler918
50,Great place to visit and hike,The observatory is a fun place to spend the day. There are a lot of great views and you can hike all around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancysF7832RY
50,best sunset view of the city,"we went up to watch the sun set over the city and the view was amazing.The observatory itself is beautiful, the building is so elegant and we also went to the telescope and got to look at saturn which was pretty cool.A lovely place to spend the evening",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3060XIannar
50,Great but you have to plan your visit ahead of time,"No doubt its a must see attraction. Just some tips. Check the show schedule on their website first and make sure you arrive on time. They are very strict and wont let you in if you're late. Make sure there's no concert at the greek theater because if there is, you wont be able to find parking and it will take you an hour to get to the observatory from the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessa51910
50,Amazing place to visit!,"Griffith Observatory is much better than I had expected! The views are stunning (you can see the Hollywood sign), and as the sun sets there are plenty of spots to watch it go down. There are brilliant views of the city and hills. This alone is worth the 50 cent bus trip up the hill (from Sunset/Vermont). The observatory itself is brilliant- free entry! I spent $7 on a ticket to the planetarium and I wasn't disappointed. Best planetarium show I've seen- excellent quality show and brilliant, engaging content and delivery. The telescope was open to the public and we saw Saturn. The telescope staff were fantastic! This all cost just $7 (for the planetarium show), everything else was free. Quite a remarkable attraction and an absolute MUST SEE for LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanelske
50,Great views from a classic building,"Griffith Observatory is like going back in time. Beautiful, Art Deco architecture overlooking the LA basin. The observatory is free to get into, however parking up there is $4 per hour and is extremely limited. If you can utilize mass transit, the DASH observatory bus runs from the Vermont/Sunset metro (red line) station and costs only $0.50 each way.The observatory runs films and planetarium shows for a fee. Exhibits are very interesting and educational. Plus there are spectacular views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JNFII

40,A great place for people of all ages,"I've loved going to the Griffith Observatory ever since I was a kid. From the amazing views of the city both day and night (which make a great romantic date), to the fascinating interactive displays inside, the observatory captivates both locals and visitors from all over the world. Even in the 1970s I enjoyed visiting, but ever since they reopened after renovating in the early 2000s, it's even better. My favorite part of the observatory is the lower-level area where models of the planets hang from the ceiling and you can see how much you weigh on each planet, too. If you want to splurge, you can pay to see a show in the planetarium, which is always worth the price of admission. Just make sure you plan ahead and don't be surprised if you have to park down the hill from the observatory on the street because the parking lot is almost always full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreapandria68
40,"Very busy, planetarium great, food offer poor","We went here in one August afternoon and it was very busy, which did mean that we found it very difficult to see the exhibitions especially those on the ground floor round the entrance. We bought tickets for planetarium show whilst there - the queue was long but moved v quickly. The show itself was very good and decent value - there was a person in there doing the actual narration which was good. The only major downside, apart from the crowds, was the terrible restaurant on the top floor - it was dirty, and extremely poor value - $16 for 2 ropey sandwiches. Also for us it would have been really useful to have access to Wifi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelab354

50,"Fun, stunning views, good value & educational",We are a family with 14 & 11 year old children. We all enjoyed 3 hours in late afternoon through sunset at the Observatory. We got an Uber to drop us at the lower part of the hill and enjoyed the walk up. We scheduled in a slot at the planetarium which was inspiring and visually stunning @ $7 per adult and $5 per child. This was all we needed to pay. There is free access then to all the exhibits. We also then had plenty of time to take pictures overlooking both LA and the Hollywood sign at sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyd437

50,Beautiful place that makes you think big,"I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have been fortunate to be able to visit this place as often as I want. It is a magnificent place to walk around and just absorb information. No conversation needed..it's all there for you to read, watch, or just listen to. The architecture is beautiful and you can't beat the location. I make it an entire day thing. Picnic at the park no also walk the entire facility. Seriously what's the point of hurrying around here. You might miss something.My advice for first time visits is of course to check the website for events and familiarize yourself with the map. It's really fun for kids.I happen to enjoy going alone and casually view the exhibits. It's a great place to 'put you in your place' and see that we are just a small part of something big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melomaniacRED
50,Locals favorite hike and views,"As an Angelino, I've been coming to Griffith Park for years. The hiking trails alone are worth the visits, but it is also great for the views, the observatory itself, the golf courses, the LA zoo is settled into the eastern part of the park, the bike trails, and the Greek Theater also resides here. If you come in the summer/early fall - go early to beat the heat and bring water. Or go later in the day to catch a beautiful sunset. You'll see many locals within because we love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X902NWpaulag
50,Its always great!,You must visit if your thinking about Los Angeles. Its iconic & has the sign.The $4 parking is new but could be helpful in controlling traffic but the locals are not happy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anka146
50,Iconic Must Do Visit,"I highly recommend locals and visitors to discover the beauty of this most iconic landmark in Los Angeles. Yes, the observatory has been in many films, but seeing the beauty and grande personally is breathtaking. The views of Los Angeles and the surrounding areas are astonishing. The cost is FREE to visit the Observatory, but there are charges to participate in some of the extra activities. It is well worth the cost. I would highly recommend going as soon as it opens, but not during the weekday.Many schools take field trips here and it can get crazy busy. Try the weekend and as soon as it opens. Parking can be challenging, so look into other ways to get there. If you are going with someone who has a handicap parking pass, parking is doable. Check out the Metro, public bus or other parking options listed on the website.Visiting the observatiory is a most do!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G-whiZ2015

I am handicapped; I walk with a cane and cannot stand in line for long at all. The handicapped parking was plentiful and very accessible.

Each pointed to something different and their was staff at each telescope to tell you about what you were looking at.I'm assuming it's not normally as busy as it was the day we visited but even with the crowds it was really fun.Definitely go!

You really must view this deck.If you love the solar system, universe, planets etc., this is the place for you. I think it terrific for kids. Jessica was able to provide us with a universe of information and fun facts for kids. She is incredibly knowledgeable and fascinating to listen to and an asset to the Griffith Observatory. She took the time to explain the moon and its universe to the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranFromFlushing

I suggest walking down the hill afterwards since there are some nice views on the way down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thephotopeddler

There is also the telescope and various things to see and learn about the planets, sun etc. Parking is a real problem so, because most of the time it is really crowded, especially for the sunset and the night for the spectacular views, but there is a shuttle bus going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb382
30,Beautiful vu terrible parking opportunities,"Arrive an ½ hour before sunset, vu the Hollywood sign and the vu of the city, admire the sunset from here and after sunset the vu over the lights of the city is remarkable. and yes a lot of people in cars are there as well, and the logistic is not very good, Read terrible, but its all compensated by the vu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenrikC_12
50,Holiday from Melbourne Australia,"Good place to take photos and look back on the city views.there is a bus line that goes up there, but we took a taxi $35 return for 2 of us it's ok as we were on a time frame due to a tour we booked for that afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914rickt
50,Great Views!!,The observatory was fantastic with many levels to explore. My favorite was the attraction with the electrical lightning circuit things hahaha!! They is also an out of space exhibit on the lower level where there's a scale that tells you your weight on the moon. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnathank299
50,Vacay,"Amazing views, be prepared to walk, bring water. The parking was a little difficult but we managed. First time visiting the observatory. Once inside staff was very helpful and gave talks on the different exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lah823
40,Go early to avoid traffic,"My boyfriend and I originally planned to come to the observatory on a Saturday before sunset, see the sunset, watch one of the videos then check out the public telescope. We had checked the traffic earlier and had planned to arrive for 7. Due to bad traffic in the city then a concert at Griffith Park which left cars going up the hill at a stand still, we didn't arrive until 8 pm. We couldn't see the Hollywood sign in the dark, we missed the show and the line up for the public telescope was massive so we left dejected.I came back again the next morning around 9:30 am and was so happy I did. No traffic issues and no issues finding parking. Just a great view with no hassle. I highly recommend getting there early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonC9891
30,Beautiful view over LA and the Hollywood Sign,We came to this place mainly to make a selfie with the Hollywood Sign in the background. Best to park the car at the Greek Theatre and take the shuttle bus for $0.50. View over the city is beautiful. Thought of coming back at night to see the true meaning of City of Lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterjanse
50,Planetarium Fun,We headed to Griffiths to take in the views of LA and see a show at the Planetarium. The views are spectacular - especially at Sunset - and there is a lot to see by walking around the Observatory. We headed to a show about the Northern Lights which was informative and very entertaining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candz214
50,Popular tourist attraction!,"The observatory is a popular tourist attraction with a good view of the Hollywood Sign. Admissions is free! It is hard to find parking if you don't get here early.Enjoy the views of the city once you are up there. We were there at about 9:30AM and the parking lots were already full. One alternate place to park is near the bird sanctuary/where the restrooms are located at the foot of the hill.Parking is usually available here and it is a 7-10mnts walk up the hill to the observatory. At the observatory, you can also see several space and science-related displays. City views in the evening when the lights come on will be spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222sridhart
50,"Very cool place, plan to spend hours there","Griffith Observatory was very cool but the parking is brutal. Just beware it may take a while to find a spot but it's not too expensive. Make sure to buy enough time as you'll want to stay for a while. We explored the entire place including the exhibits. Make sure to see at least one show in the planetarium. We walked around taking in the views of downtown, the hills and the Hollywood sign. Go later in the afternoon so you can watch the sunset and the lights come on in the city below. We also took a walking tour with a park ranger. And we stayed long enough to view the moon from one of the observatory's telescopes, very cool. There was a line to view but it moved pretty well. An LA gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jschrier
50,Great views of the city at night,"One of the best free places to go to when in Los Angeles. I come here at night to see the lights of the city below. It's free and the views are incredible. Just hope that when you go there at night, the skies are clear and you can see all the way to downtown to the left and Santa Monica to the right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerrytan
50,Spend a few hours here,"When visiting LA plan to spend a few hours here. Great property and views of LA LA land and the Hollywood sign. Parking is limited, so take an Uber. Uber driver will take you all the way to the top. Uber pickup location for your return trip is within easy walking distance. If you take your own car, plan to walk...a lot...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripping20166
50,An LA must,"The views from the observatory are fantastic for both LA and the Hollywood sign. And if you are into space stuff, what is in the observatory is fantastic and interesting too. The drive up to Hollywood is always great. Don't drive all the way up the hill as parking is limited and expensive. Instead, we parked on the roadside at the bottom of the hill around Fern Deli Drive. The walk up through the park is lovely but it is not paved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1899QXjamesc
30,Hollywood sign was disappointing,"The observatory was closed the day we visited and the traffic was still a mess, taking about 20 minutes to reach the observatory parking lot.Since I wasn't interested in paying $6 to park just to take a picture of the Hollywood sign, my wife got out, took the picture and came back to the car, traffic was slow enough this was no problem. I was able to see the Hollywood sign, but it is so far away, the view was definitely not worth the cost of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952robinh
50,Still the most advantageous place to see the city!,"The parking was a little confusing but after that, we were able to walk around with ease. Unfortunately, we arrived on a Monday when the Observatory was closed, but the park itself was still full of people and the view, in spite of the heat, was still beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adegamarra
50,An L.A. must see,"It's loaded with tourists and locals, but it's a must see. Be prepared for crowds and be prepared to walk, if necessary, especially uphill. There are buses but with the traffic in the area, those buses might not get you very far very fast. But make the effort when/if you can. Good stuff, good views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGavin
40,Amazing view of L.A.,We did not visit the inside of the Observatory but came only for the incredible view of L.A.Originally we planned to arrive before sunset but the traffic made it impossible. But it was still worth it! The view from up there is really breathtaking.You get a feeling how big this city is.One negative point is the limited number ofparking spaces and it gets really crowded in the evening. So plan some extra time for parking. But it is worth the trip since you will be rewarded with a view of L.A. like no other.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller338251
50,Really nice views but crazy getting up to it!,"Came here w a friend while wasting some time before a doctors appointment. It took forever to get to the top and finding a parking spot was insane! I actually got out the passenger spot and ran to the open spot I seen and stood at the end of it so no one else could park there. I had like 5 ppl get pissed, 1 tried running me over and this old couple cursed me out!!Once inside it was busy as well, we kind of skimmed through it because of the crowds. It was okay… nothing marvelous! I won't go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
40,Beautiful views,This was one of the things my family had on our list while on vacation and I thought it was very good. This place is free and opened to the public. Very interesting stuff and the views were absolutely beautiful . It was a little crowded to look through the telescope at Mars but definitely worth the wait . Parking is tough here you have to be very patient but all in all an excellent experience. Would definitely recommend and return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
30,Nice view over the city and to the Hollywood Sign,A short drive by car through a curved road than you can join the nice view over the city. A lot of Rangers are there and organize the traffic. The ticket machine for your parking fee 4$/h are very slowly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jochi_KN
50,A must for families with young children!,Griffith observatory offers spectacular views of Hollywood hills and the sprawling city of LA in addition to the displays of solar and celestial objects. Presentations are offered daily at the Planetarium that can be enjoyed by children and those young at heart alike.Do check on the estimated access times before you leave as the parking areas can be crowded and a long walk may be necessary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDeSilvas
50,Amazing views,Wow amazing views of down town LA. Parking was a slight issue as it was very busy but eventually we did park quite near the observatory. You also get a great view of the Hollywood sign. You can wonder round for free and there is also a cafe but we didn't use this. If it's a hot day make sure you take plenty of water with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skybop3489
40,Nice Observatory with a good view of LA from the peak,Nice location to have a good view of LA with some huge telescope for astronomical observation. The telescope is open for public in the evening hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelAbrol
50,"Beautiful place, great view for sunsets",We went to the griffith observatory to see the sun set on the city and over the hollywood sign. It was absolutely worth the trip but get there early as parking will get increasingly difficult with the sunset approaching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lara1070
50,Visit the stars,Arrive early and you might score a parking place. This was added onto a number of years ago and gives more opportunity to learn about the heavens. In the evening they have some of telescopes open for viewing. Nice overview of Los Angeles and photo opportunities of the HOLLYWOOD sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobandmargieg
40,Pleasant surprise,"We googled places to view the ""Hollywood sign"" and this came up. We had no idea what it was but thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatherineH82017
50,Unbelievable,"The views are absolutely amazing also great with the whole feel of the place, not only great views of the city but also the Hollywood sign, parking is a little hit and miss but well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling-Dave1961
30,Great panoramic vue,We came here to view the panorama of a part of L.A and the Hollywood sign wich was good and nice to take pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wergie1
50,Must See in LA but Be Prepared of crowd and crazy traffic,"Getting there was definitely hectic. We tried to go there on a Friday night, first of all, Fern Dell Dr (one of the two ways to get there) was closed at 6pm. Took alternative route Vermont Dr but there were events at and next to Greek Theatre, as well as events at the observatory, which caused traffic jam on the way to the observatory and made it impossible to find parking. Came here again on a Sunday afternoon around 1, parking at the observatory was full so the staff just directed us to find street parking either at Western Canyon Road or E Observatory Road. The problem is, there are blackout time for street parking at E Observatory Road and vehicle would be towed parking on these spot during this time. We were driving around and finally was able to find parking. Outside of the Observatory, there are awesome scenic spots to spot the mountains with ""Hollywood"" sign, as well as the city of Los Angeles. Tons of interesting educational resources at the Observatory. Don't miss the show at the Planetarium, it's very fascinating. Highly recommend to anyone visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveler2888
50,Stunning,"The materials and architecture of the Griffin are stunning. The exhibits are very informative. I especially liked the ""Earthquake"" monitoring exhibit. The views over the LA Basin are beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twaone
50,Excellent!,"When you are in LA, this is a must stop! A nice place to get away from the traffic and constant noise. Well worth the parking fee of 15 dollars. Ended up spending 3 hours in just walking around and enjoying this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476victorw
40,Must do while in LA,"Great view of LAI went early, around 6.30am.I found it quite hard to find my way around and the walks aren't very well sign posted but its all worth it for the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phoebe_ferens
50,Favorite in LA,"My favourite thing by far, went there just as the sun was setting and got spectacular views of the city. Might get a little crowded in the way there and parking is complicated - we took a Lyft, but we could see the parking spaces were all topped off - but worth it nonetheless",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silviacristiana
50,OMG the landscape!,The landscape from here is amazing! You can see all LA from the top. And inside is also like a science centre! So GOOD. I reccomend this to all of you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GianGian00
40,A great place to learn and observe,"Nice Location and the view from the top is superb. A picnic will be an excellent day out plan if you are thinking of visiting. The observatory is full of knowledge from past to the present. You can see the whole of Los Angeles, downtown and more...Had an awesome time. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841niranjanl
40,pleasant lunch with a view,quick eat after the visitwolfgang puck packaged yoghurt tastydining outside was pleasant for the view but the bees/wasps worried some,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnycash3630
40,Great views and interesting attraction. Go by bus or LA tour,"Superb views of LA depending on haze/weather. Astronomy observatory has interesting displays and activities, great for kids (we are a couple only). Parking is bad and may require a long hilly walk. Suggest getting there by bus or on tour (what we did). Sunday we went was very crowded, so go during week or early if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoodlee
50,"This place is definitely worth a trip, but go EARLY!",This was definitely worth the time and effort to visit. Parking at the top fills up fast! I was there an hour before it opened and got one of the last surface parking spaces in front of the observatory. Good place to combine exercise and sight seeing! plenty of parking down the hill but it's a heck of a hike up the road. A great piece of LA history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azroyalsfan
20,Parking Issues,"Wanted to view the observatory and walk from the bottom parking lot the top. Don't know what was going on but appears that their was some Parking Lot line painting that was going to start.Anyway, 2/3 of the parking areas were closed down during the mid morning and there were alot of people looking for parking spaces. Can't see why they couldn't have done this at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/todg959
50,360 view,"This site is a good vantage point to see the rest of LA. The Observatory is Grand, you also get a pretty decent view of the Hollywood sign a definite plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigger845
50,Great place to visit,"We went there only for the purpose of taking pictures with the Hollywood sign in the background, not expecting that the observatory itself would be a great visit. We were lucky to get a parking space at the bottom part were there were parking meters. Then we did a little hike to get to the observatory, which wasn't so bad. It was so nice to take pictures outside.After a while, we went inside the building. Admission was free except for the planetarium. Even without buying tickets to the planetarium, there were so many cool things to see. My teen-age daughter and 5 year old niece loved the place, too. I definitely recommend this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellopusa
30,Crowded and no parking,No parking and we got directed away from the observatory. This photo is all we got. Went to Hollywood lake park in stead and got a much better view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs476
50,Great fun for everyone!,"What can I say, this place was great if you have any interest at all in astronomy or science. The Tesla coil was amazing as was the telescope. We went on a day when amateur astronomers and enthusiasts had telescopes set up on the grounds to let people look through. It was pretty awesome to see Sirius through a telescope in broad daylight! Plan on a couple of hours if it's the weekend as it will be very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikeh727
50,Stars can actually speak,"Amazing place, the best view ever, all that LaLaLand movie promised you is basically here and around.I wish I had a chance to study Astronomy visiting this magical beautiful place! Must see in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gotsaoligova
40,Nice hiking to the place,We went here to get picture with the Hollywood sign except it was too small. The observatory itself worth to visit if you are first time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/154AndreS
50,Phenominal,Take time out of your trip to visit here. It is some of the best and certainly most unexpected scenery I have ever seen. I won't go into to much detail so that it is the awesome surprise my wife and I had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Just182rf
50,Wow! We saw Saturn!,What a unique experience! Crowds were big and clouds were thickening but we managed to view Saturn thru the observatory telescope! The staff did a great job managing expectations and providing context while we waited in line. We arrived at 8:15pm. Wish we had more time to see the movies and view the exhibits but we waited in line about an hour for our turn at the telescope and the facility closes promptly at 10pm. Well worth the visit and would return again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyandalan
50,"Good place, too many people","I was planning to come here because I am both a fan of astronomy and La La Land. The place is great, and I observe the Saturn and Jupiter. There were huge amounts of people than you can imagine. I have to park my car at the foot of the Griffith Park and climbed to the top. It takes me around 30 minutes to get to the observatory. The view of LA in the evening is beautiful, and I can see the sign of Hollywood in the far away mountain.One thing needs to be mentioned since visitors always wanna observe the stars, normally when you finish your visit, the sky is already dark. So you might need to find some friends to go together on the trail. It is said that there are large animals on the mountain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fengzejiang
40,Great experience,"I arrived to the park first and it was a little bit hard to find our way, it will help if there are more signs showing the way up, once you get up there you face another challenge, parking, but we got lucky and found a parking space really fast, after that you can enjoy the city views and it's a good spot to see the Hollywood sign as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolitav988
40,Don't go here to view Hollywood Sign,"If you google map 'Hollywood Sign' chances are you will directed here. There are fantastic views and facilities but the Sign is very distant and it is a three hour round hike to get up close to the letters plus it is horrendously busy at all times of the day and hard to park close. If you want to get close to the letters access Griffith Park from Deronda Drive where parking is equally hard but at least you get really close to the letters and there are less crowds. However the Observatory has rest rooms, and vision centre and the views are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesixtysix
50,Amazing park and views!,"There are so many activities here, it's incredible! There is definitely something for everyone and all ages. There are many different hiking areas with varying degrees of challenge. The observatory itself is magnificent with lots of history and information. Great views and photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeF827
50,BIRTHDAY VACATIONS,"We went to Los Angeles, California and we went to see the Hollywood sign from the Griffith Observatory and we enjoyed every room on it, we loved the views, they were stunning, you can see the entire city from there, it was a great experience, will go visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8391WSmariam
50,Amazing views,Get here early as parking is tight. Also there is a shuttle bus that cost 50 cents per person.The views are really special and this is a must visit spot if you are visiting.Just be really for crowds as it is very popular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/froglogic
50,My favorite place,Visiting here was incredible. You see it in movies growing up but to see it in person actually got me a little emotional. The views are breathtaking. We drove to it but there is a trail you can hike as well. A definite must-see for any LA trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelp732
40,Great views but tough parking,"Since it's free, the Griffith Observatory is always crowded and limited parking will make it very tough to secure a spot at the top unless you're extremely lucky. Most people will end up parking well down on the access road and making a hike to the top. Once there, you'll enjoy great views of downtown LA, especially stunning at sunset. The observatory, made famous in La La Land, is less impressive inside, especially with the huge crowds jamming the limited and dated displays. But come for the views, and bring your camera and hiking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwwyjjliu
50,Apart from the parking - great !,"Great views, and well worth the hike/drive up to view LA and the Hollywood sign ! Parking was an issue when we were there, but not their fault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neil_warner99
50,Fantastic views,"This is well worth a visit. Views are spectacular. Don't bother trying to find parking on the road up to it, park at the Greek theatre (free) and either walk up , easy 15 min walk, or get the free bus which goes every hour. Free entry into the observatory and lots to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suek447
40,Must see,"We took an Uber to this place but the drive up to the observatory was closed that time (not sure why). We were determined to trek up 1 mile. It was a bit difficult. But most difficult was the part that there was no clear cut instruction. There was only 1 sign board showing the track. There should be more markers on the way. In fact, one park employee pointed us in the wrong direction. We asked people who were walking back several time to go in the right direction. (the path to the famous Hollywood sign also bifurcated from here). But at the end it was well worth it!The view was great from the mountain top. The planetarium show was very well done (Centered in the Universe). We could not see through the telescope due to a very big line. Again, I felt there was no information center to give out information about this or how to plan your time there.While coming down we took the dash bus (fare only 50 cents) .We will visit this place again and hopefully see through the telescope!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlust_rd
40,Great scenery,Great place to go and take pictures but it takes forever to get there. There's only one road so it gets packed on weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babipgod
50,Great views of los angeles and the hollywood sign,Make sure you go early here. There are long lines just to get in and once parking is full then you have to keep circling the hill just to get in and park or park somewhere downhill and walk up which is not pleasant in the scorching heat. But on the whole the place is awesome and yeah there is no cell phone network either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KL4587
50,Top of the World and Top Class!,"There are so many reasons to visit the Griffith Observatory before you even get to the actual observatory and planetarium! The world class views of the Hollywood Sign and all of greater Los Angeles create wonderful photo opp's, and many movies were shot here! There are great hiking trails for the avid hikers in your group (you may even see a celebrity hiker on the trail!). Once inside the magnificent Art Deco building, kids and adults alike will marvel at the easily accessible astonomy and scientific displays. Older kids will love the Tesla Coil with it's lightning-like electrification! My favorite display is the central pendulum hanging from a domed ceiling painted with murals illustrating the astrological signs as well as scientific elements. Look closely at the different types of marble lining the walls and floors, and be thankful that the entire experience is free of charge, unless you choose to add a visit to the planetarium. Take a picnic and eat on the grassy lawns or eat at the cafe on the grounds. ONE TIP: take someone with a disabled pass which will allow you to park at the very top of the hill, almost right at the front entrance to the observatory. Failing that, avoid weekends and aim for weekdays at off peak times, otherwise there is a danger of being turned away right at the top after a one hour plus drive up (what normally takes 10 mins)!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjjSD
40,Very busy but well worth it!,"We tried to visit here last summer, arriving naively at 6.30 pm and couldn't get parked, so this summer we set off at lunchtime on a Sunday. The place was still heaving and parking was made a little harder by parking near the Greek theatre being closed off. However, we managed to get roadside parking and as it was Sunday this area was free to park. We walked up to the observatory, sensible shoes and water - a must. We spent time in the observatory and watched the demonstration of the Tesla coil. We had lunch in their café which was reasonably priced and offered veggie options.We also did a short trek up towards the Hollywood sign, which gave stunning views over the Hollywood hills, but as this was the middle of August, the heat was intense and we didn't make the full distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanF361
20,Too Much Traffic and Cars - No Place to Park,"It was a tremendous drive to get here only to discover it was too crowded, too many cars and we could not park our car anywhere and had to drive away. A lot of time was wasted. This was on a Sunday about 6pm - who would have thought it would be so busy then. I have checked this off my bucket list. My suggestion, if possible, is to find out how crowded it is before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kabear
50,Beautiful views!,"We used the dash bus to get here specifically to see the Hollywood sign. It was the closest we got to it and I managed to get a decent enough (ish) photo. The views of LA are really beautiful. I also wasn't expecting the observatory to be so good, and free! Very informative. Would definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deathbyblackcat
50,Bucket list,From here you can admire the fantastic Los Angeles skyline! I was here at night and the atmosphere was incredible.Need to come back to see it for the sunset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carmenstaiano
50,Amazing view and facilities,I know this place from the movies and clearly this place is very good for learning and studying as well besides the charming view and good place for tourists too. Enjoy this place very much,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tahugejrot
50,View at sunset is amazing,We took a Lyft ride up at sunset. There was a show at the Greek theatre so traffic was horrible. We ended up walking the last half mile or so. Sunset was beautiful and the planetarium is worth the 30 minutes it takes. We took the DASH bus down to the Vermont/sunset metro stop and took Lyft to our hotel in Hollywood. That was an economical option.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaMu88
20,"No parking...my mistake perhaps, but...",Would have been nice to stop and see it...but there was no parking on multiple attempts. Maybe there is a bus or shuttle available but we just didn't check prior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKellock
50,Fun,"So, a few weeks ago, we tried to come at like 2 or 3 in the afternoon. It took us an hour to get to the top, and there was absolutely no parking. Took another 20 minutes down. Never found parking, so we left.So, this weekend, they opened at 10am. We arrived at 8am. It was kind of busy. The lot was full. But, we got a parking spot on the side road, right at the top.Get there as early as possible! Spots fill up fast. Parking is free until they open. Then it's 4 bucks an hour. You pay at the kiosk. You can pay while it's free. They calculate it to start when paid starts, so you don't have to go back later.We walked around the Observatory, while it wasn't crowded, and got some great photos. It was super hazy, and had no idea where the Hollywood sign was. As soon as the haze lifts, there it it. An AMAZING view! If you are facing the observatory, it's to your right. You can pretty much see it from anywhere on that side. It's not hard to spot, once it's visible.We ate donuts, and drank some coffee. (We brought it with us). Walked around. There are a bunch of telescopes you can pay to use. The views are amazing, from every angle. There are few hiking trails. One that goes closer to the Hollywood sign. It's about a mile and a half. We didn't do it. Next time!There are bathrooms outside, if you get there early. Not portapoties. But actualy bathrooms. But they are absolutely disgusting! Filty, and smelly. Bathrooms inside the observatory are much better.So, there isn't a ton of stuff inside. But it's cool. A free Leonard Nimoy video about the Observatory. It was interesting. Then they have the shows at the planetarium. We paid 7 bucks each. It was so worth it! Amazing!There is a cafe, but it's not associated with the Observatory. It's crazy expensive, and not good. Bring food! There is also a crazy expensive gift shop.We spent about 5 hours here, and never bored. Definitely a must visit. Just get there early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/healonwifey
40,"Awesome view of LA,parking is a nightmare on some days,popular tourist spot","Tried visiting this place on a Friday evening and had to turn around coz we couldn't get a parking spot. Place was packed, traffic everywhere. Only option was to park like really far down the hill and make the hike up to the observatory and that wasn't an option at the time. Tried again the following day, Saturday morning and enjoyed the visit. The views are breathtaking, astronomy buffs will get a treat inside the observatory will all the stuff on display. Place gets quite full as it's a popular spot for tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShakaReri
50,Watch out for moon!!!,You should visit this place in the evening around 6 pm....you can see the hollywood sign during the light....and at night you will find some students with their telescope watching various planets.....ti is really cool to watch other planets.....do watch moon at 2 floor....i got goosebumps while watching all these galactic bodies......do talk to students about their telescopes and how they focus and find planets....it is really insightful...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nishantagni82
40,Nice view of the hollywood,Nice place to visit and view the Hollywood area and Hollywood sign. the views are nice and drive is ok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kapildalwani
40,Good eye view over entire LA,"Its on hill top next to Hollywood mountain , but just avoid going on weekends , as cos of heavy traffic and lack of parking, they would divert parking to down hill parking and then from there you need to take bus with $ 5 per person ride up to Griffith observatory, these shuttles are not so frequent and there could be long queues.View from Observatory is mind blowing, and once you are at observatory its a place to explore lots of things about astronomy and telescopes I would say spare entire half day for the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJAYKUBAVAT
40,L.A's most iconic observatory!!,"This place once you step inside,it's magical.The observatory is a must see.Best of all its free.This was on my top list when I came to L.A from N.Y.Many movies where filmed here,Rebel without a cause.The Rocketeer.and others!!Griffith observatory is iconic and full of surprises.The panoramic views here are awesome too.Dont leave L.A without visiting this one of a kind museum!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emberte2015
40,great afternoon!,the views were amazing and the building was so cool and very educational on the inside. loved the big bong swinging in the centre of the observatory and the hiking trails around the building were neat as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskville
40,Fun place with great views but parking is a nightmare!,"Granted I'm sure we were there in busy season, got there about 1pm on a Wednesday but we had to circle the loop three times to find a spot and of course it was at the very bottom of the loop. I guess it's to be expected since it's such a popular tourist attraction. There is a small lot but of course it was full at that time of day. Parking was $4 elsewhere at the meters.We had a great time though, great views of the city and Hollywood sign. Lots of fun exhibits and shows. It's a one and done though, I don't feel the need to go back when in town again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandy621
50,Gorgeous architecture and view!,We were there in the early morning to start a guided tour with a great view of LA; we enjoyed the view but could not get inside the Observatory. Plan on limited parking and bigger crowds the later you go in the day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skrose21
50,A must go- day or night,"We went at night. The city had large telescopes in the front promenade you could see Saturn, etc. Employees were nice and did a good job explaining what we were seeing. Can't believe the City of LA pays for all this... free for you! (Except for parking, which isn't bad.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougD1390
50,Awesome views!,This is where you go to get the best view of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA. It is just an awesome place to visit and walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mxlovers
50,"Intelligent astronomy museum, plan to arrive early","The view from the balconies is stunning, the observatory shows are beautifully narrated (live), and the astronomy museum is very intelligent and interesting. Not appropriate for younger children. Older elementary school kids and teenagers will get a lot more out of it than younger crows.The box offices open at 12:00 and the place gets VERY crowded in high season. Plan to park your car no later than 11:30 (parking is an issue - you'll need to park on the slope of the hill and climb the rest on foot). If you're late, you'll still be able to see the museum and the scenery from the balcony, but the shows will be sold out,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaM792
50,"Neat place, nice view!","Nothing bad to say about it, great location with an amazing view and cool, inspiring interior. Definately worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncouthL
30,Super busy and limited to no parking,"I brought my niece to visit the observatory, she wanted to go because of La La Land. I wanted to go as a former California resident whom never got to go, but had always heard about. I must say I was disappointed with the limited parking and how over packed the place was and there was zero crowd control. We were able to get in an see what were came to see and even watching a movie there. The telescopes were not open for viewing, but the planet exhibit was the coolest thing we both enjoyed. You can see your weight would be on each planet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshW937

50,Must see,Well worth a visit and would suggest that you couple this with a walking tour of the Hollywood Hills as we did.The building is iconic and has featured in many films (Rebel without a cause - LA LA Land).The exhibits are very interesting and there are very good views over Los Angeles from the balcony,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226ChrisW
50,Great plave to visit and learn alot,The Griffith observatory is a nice place to visit alone or with family great views also a great place to walk around and learn more about our universe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358catalinav
50,So much fun!,"My friend and I went to the observatory mainly to see the views of the city and the Hollywood sign which were incredible. However, our favorite part was in the inside of the observatory where they had tons of exhibits about space. A lot of the exhibits were interactive and awesome for anyone with even a slight interest in space. We easily spent over an hour inside the observatory. They also offer short films that you have to pay for but we did not see any of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hi2kaila
40,Nice but super busy,Tried going at night and failed due to the Amoy t of traffic and lack of parking. Went during the day and again same crap and no parking and extremely busy. Be prepared to hike the hill to get there if you don't get parking close by and bring water and food shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allenlee71
50,Fantastic Park with Great Views,We only visited here as my wife had watched LaLa Land and wanted to go and what a great choice. We got there about 10am which is good as parking was easier. By the time we left at about 11.30 traffic was really heavy. The walk around the Observatory gives great views of the LA area and also the Hollywood sign.Would also have been good to have had time to hike to the top of the peak.The observatory doesn't open until 12 so we didn't go in but park alone is worth the drive up there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434davidj
50,What a view,"This is the place I most wanted to go to in LA simply due to the view that you get of the whole city. You've all seen it in the films and it is striking in the flesh. So peaceful in many ways when you are looking down on about 8m people. LA is manic as it would be but busy as this is, it does seem a little removed from all of that.Inside it's got plenty to have a look at, plenty of learning around what the observatory is all about including a pretty cool electrical charge thingy.Plenty of viewing room and if you have the time you can go out on trails from there to climb higher or lower depending on your preference. There is a whole country park around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andhewittscores
50,A good place to see the Hollywood sign,This is the best place to view the sign but also good views of the city. We did not go inside but was there to view the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMM22101963
40,"Interesting, great view but very crowdy","We visited at day and at night. I specially loved the night view, it is amazing. The Griffith observatory is very educational, appropriate for all ages. You can visit the telescope. We had no problem finding parking, but paying for it is something else. You can only pay with credit card. In the evening it can take up to 30 min to get to the top. Beautiful view of the city, you can also see the Hollywood sign. Entrance is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abeillesgee
50,Free activity,Awesome view to see the Hollywood sign and taking nice pictures of the landscape. No entry fee! It OPENS at 12am!! Super cool stuff to see and learn about the planets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliatV2682AG
50,Amazing,"The observatory was a great trip, totally worth it. The shows were also amazing and better to sit in the rows behind. Be sure to view the times of the shows before you arrive to manage your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nellster13
50,Pennsylvania,We visited on a Monday and the building was closed. You had nice outside views of LA. You could see the Hollywood sign from a distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharissaA5
50,"Superb, suitable for all ages & levels of interest","We only had an afternoon for our visit and wished we could have spent the whole day.The short film about the Observatory, narrated by Leonard Nimoy, was excellent - we are both Trekkies and found it emotional to see him speaking passionately about something that was obviously important to him.The exhibits are engaging and informative, well laid out and great for all ages. The views from the building and surrounding area are fabulous. We didn't have time for any of the planetarium shows but others there said they are great.We took the DASH bus there, which was very cheap and easy, much better than dealing with awful traffic and queues to park.Best thing to do in LA by miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purplegoddess
50,Don't miss it!,"This is an amazing place to visit - a great place to learn about the Earth, planets, and universe. Go at sunset - it also has picturesque views of the city, Hollywood sign, and stick around for a view through the telescope. There is a line - but it was worth it. On many nights astronomers set up their own telescopes in front of the museum. We saw the moon, saturn, and a nebula through these telescopes - it was interesting to speak to these astronomy enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sabrasworld
50,Love this place!,Make sure you go through the entrance by the Greek Theater. Expect to be in line for at least 30 minutes to get up the mountain. Parking is available at the top for about $4. Bring binoculars if you can. Sometimes the telescopes are broken or being used by all the tourist. I personally like going at night. The view is amazing! If you like hiking just park at the bottom and make your way up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/405christis
40,"Beautiful hike, crowded at the top","The hike to the top of the hill was great!! But the observatory itself was very, very crowded despite how misty it was. Still had beautiful views of LA regardless. Wouldn't recommend as a must do, but if you have a spare couple of hours and the weather permits, it's quite lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Omegakappa
50,Historic and Iconic,"Great place to visit! If you want to get the most out of it, be sure to go on an off day. There is plenty to see on the side of history and science, but the hollywood icon that it is makes it extra special. Lots of great walking/hiking if you like that sort of thing. But be aware, people really like to visit this spot, so plan ahead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jastein
40,"Terrible parking on weekend, we had to leave","After sitting on the road in traffic going up to the observatory for about 45 minutes, I turned around and spent another 15 minutes getting back down the hill. There were two parking spots and the walk from there would have been about an hour each way. The parking is $4 per hour. This was on a Sunday at 3 pm. If you want to go, pick an off time, or you better be fit to make that uphill trek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
50,must see in Los Angeles,"The Griffith Park Observatory venue is more than a one stop sightseeing attraction.It's a great place to hike, view the surrounding cities especially at night and the Hollywood Hills and Hollywood sign. The observatory has many astronomy shows besides the various displays and techno gadgets.Just below the Observatory is the Greek Theater with live concerts.The biggest drawback is parking, I suggest using the LA City bus line that serves that venue.One of my favorite destinations in Los Angeles and a must see for anyone visiting Los Angeles.Good for 3 hours to 8 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622kamala
10,Terrible Parking - Did not get to see it.,"This is a review for the parking or lack of it. Do not go on a Sunday, we drove all the way up and all the way down again with absolutely no parking. In the end we left and did not get to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lh427
50,Wonderful,Want can I say? This is well worth it. One of the best attractions in LA for sure. The views will literally take your breath away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/379nickm

50,Brilliant views over the city of angels,"One of the must-sees in LA, I visited on a sunny, clear afternoon/evening along with many hundreds of other sight-seers. Great views out over the city and of the sunset in front of the famous Hollywood sign. Only downside was the very long wait for a bus back down the mountain late at night - but to be expected given the number of people visiting this famous landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamblingProf
50,Interesting,I hiked up to the Observatory from Los Feliz Boulevard on a really hot day. It is easy to get to and completely worth the half hour hike. The views from the grounds are beautiful and the information and detail in the statues and observatory pieces are great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ennjaydub
50,Worth the trip,"The views alone make this a must see. Hollywood sign and all of downtown LA. Free admission and $4 parking, can't beat it. Very nice facility, worth taking your time to walk through it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AED324
50,Best view in town!,"If you visit LA then you simply have to take a walk up to the Observatory. The view really does take your breath away. The view that you have seen a thousand times in movies and Tv shows, right there in front of you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jakewoolmer
50,Gaze at the real Stars!,If you take the tour it still does not give you enough time to look through the entire Griffith Observatory.Plan on spending at least one half a day learning about our universe.Not great for very small kids.Will be VERY busy on weekends!Walk outside and also see fantastic views!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronbR7652TH
50,Excellent venue with best views of LA an the Hollywood sign.,"Wonderful, free, venue with some excellent exhibitions and presentations inside (including the chance to touch a piece of the moon and hold a meteor).Incredible views across LA, which are best later in the evening as the smog clears, and also unobstructed views across to the Hollywood sign.Suggest getting an Uber, which can drop/collect almost at the door, rather than driving as you could end up parked a long way down a steep hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theoriginalchrz

40,Beautiful Views,"It took us three attempts to get parked near enough to the observatory in order to visit. Parking really is a massive problem here. We decided to visit prior to the opening at midday, just for the views and some external pictures. The views are great of both the Hollywood sign and downtown LA. The building itself is lovely to photograph. Parking is free before opening. It gets incredibly busy even 2 hours before opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda4471
50,"Excellant view of the City, Planeitarium Exhibits and Hollywood Sign","A visit to the Griffith Park Observatory is a must for an Los Angeles visit. Incredible views of Los Angeles and good distance view of the Hollywood sign. The Planetarium is worth a tour, especially the downstairs area. If time permits see one of the excellent planetarium shows. The downside is there is limited parking and road leading to the observatory is clogged with tour buses and frustrated parking seekers. The LA Dash buses now serve the observatory 7 days a week rather than just weekends. It is $0.50 per rider and drops you off right in front. Park in Griffith Park lot near the Greek Theatre (free) and take the shuttle to the observatory. If you want the exercise you can hike down the road back to your car. (Note unless you are in great shape and a cool day, don't try the hike up, it's steep) The trailhead for the hike up to the Hollywood sign starts near the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel92630
40,"Traffic delays, but worth it","We went three different days and could not get parking. My daughter requires assistance to get around, and it was not sufficiently handicap friendly. We had to park down the high hill and walk a steep slope. The views are amazing, but we missed a lot of it. There needs to be better supervision.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lzk2
40,Sunset family visit (parking sucks),"Luckily my LA-native brother was driving us around, because had we been on our own I'm not sure we would've found a spot within close (5 min) walking distance before giving up.They closed off the closest lot and my brother said that happens every day. He told the traffic dude he was going to drop off his 7yo and 21mos old nephews, which was true, but when we got up to the drop off someone just left a spot so how could we not? It was a paid spot anyway and worth it to save us an uphill hike surrounded by the masses with a stroller in the dark.There are many great photo ops at sunset, so we did those then stood in line for the big telescope. There are volunteers everywhere which is nice if you have questions or if you need constant reminders to stay off the ledge lol. While we waited in the long line for the big telescope one them started shouting facts about the observatory and telescope which was nice.As a mom of two littles, who I know can make their presence known fairly well when on vacation with their routines askew and sleep schedule off, I definitely appreciated the sweet blonde young lady volunteering inside the telescope. The toddler didn't want to be held while we waited for our turns in the tight quarters and started squirming and squealing, and immediately she came up to him very quietly - twice - and started talking to him, that's it, and he was so caught off guard he remained calm enough for us to take our turns. So thank you, whoever you are, we appreciated your kindness!We also appreciated the later gift shop hours til 10, but were disappointed they didn't have a pressed penny machine and were out of pins.They had lots to look at inside the observatory, my favorite was the Foucault Pendulum, but they also feature regular demonstrations of their Tesla coil, which we didn't stay for because of the tired toddler but sounded fun.Good visit, nice view of the city lights and Hollywood Sign (during the day), most don't know it's here.I'd recommend getting an Uber and being very patient any time you plan on going; once there you could easily spend 1-3 hours. Lots to see and do. We didn't get a chance to try their other 3 ground telescopes but those looked cool too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adje1124
50,A must visit location in LA,"A trip is worth just to see one exhibit: the swaying Foucault Pendulum. This is a 240 lb pendulum that demonstrates the Earth's rotation. There is more to Griffith than this one exhibit. The planetarium has great programs as well.The 240-pound bronze ball, suspended by a cable 40 feet long, swings in a constant direction while the Earth turns beneath it. The pendulum is mounted to a bearing in the rotunda ceiling that does not turn with the building as it rotates with the Earth. A ring magnet at the bearing gives a little tug on each swing of the pendulum to keep the pendulum in motion. As the day passes, the pendulum knocks over pegs set up in the pendulum pit and indicates the progress of rotation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jawa13
40,Great views of LA,Visited the Griffith Observatory and had an awesome time with the interactive displays. Learned a lot while enjoying the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryla222_13
40,Best view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign,I have been there many times and it is always fascinating to get this wonderful view towards downtown the Hollywood sign and on a real clear day even the Pacific Ocean.The tour of the Observatorium is equally amazing and one should make the effort to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deeschilling22
50,Wonderful show,"Wonderful observatory in a great location. The views over the city ar fantastic. And the show, held multiple times during the day, simply superb, with the presenter clearly someone who loves her job and conveys that passion to the audience. Yes the parking spots are limited near the top, but the buses are frequent enough for that not to be an issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamShubsTar
50,Great View of LA,We were lucky to even find a parking spot by the Greek Theatre and proceeded to walk up to the observatory. Glad I didn't now how far or steep it was or we'd likely never attempted it!! It is a fabulous view but by the time we got up to the observatory it was 30 minutes from closing and extremely crowded. Our family was there on a Friday night from 9-10 pm so there may be a better time to go in the daytime when it's less crowded. The planeterium and other features were closed but the view of the lights of LA were fabulous! Fortunately we caught the bus back down to the Greek Theatre where we parked to avoid the downhill walk in the dark. Be warned the walk up to the observatory is pretty strenuous if the parking at the top is full but the bus was only 50 cents. My family of four had no idea what we were in for when we began walking up in the dark but we had lots of company!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyHumbleOpinion
50,View of Los Angeles,A must see when in LA. Unfortunately was very hazy on our visit however to see the Hollywood sign a must. The observatory is great and you can walk around it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvinandamanda

50,Well worth the trip,Only for an uber driver told us about this place we would never have known about it! Spectacular place with amazing views of the city and an up close view of the Hollywood sign..go in the day and at night and try go early so as to avoid the crowds trying to get the shuttle bus later on..definitley a top thing to do in LA though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507lorrainem
50,An LA must do,Yes have seen in movies and the place lives up to it. We went in time to see the sunset. The view of LA at night made the madness to find a parking spot all worth it. For sure if you plan to catch the sunset go early to allow time to find a parking spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6632KZdavidc
50,Amazing must visit,"Highly busy and it took a while to drive up due to traffic we were very lucky to find a space just as someone was leaving , the parking was chaotic so plan to get there early we arrived around 840pm they close 10pm , several telescopes were available on the lawn which we didn't queue for but would recommend as we are amateur astronomers , the views were stunning and the observatory was really lovely and special a definite place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frequenttravels3333
50,Fun trip - too short,We took for teenagers to Griffith Observatory in the evening. We saw a great view of the city. And we walked inside and briefly saw what we could've been doing earlier that day. Mr. Griffith really had a lot of passion for astronomy and this observatory is his legacy. It's free to visit and there are a few activities that you can participate in that have minimal fees. Parking was relatively cheap too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaelyn777
30,"Great view, lots of people.",The view was great. You can see the cityscape and the Hollywood sign. There was paid parking. The meters were a little complicated (not just for me) and slowwwwww. Only 4 bathrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phavorite
40,Great Views but Super Crowded at Sunset,"We had long wanted to visit this most famous of LA tourist spots and managed to take a Lyft up to this beautiful mountain top observatory in the heart of Griffifth Park while visiting LA in late June. Parking is a nightmare with huge crowds at sunset so a car service was ideal (though getting one home was more difficult afterwards). The crowds are massive as this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in town but if you can find a spot overlooking the city its well worth the effort. From the glittering cityviews to the hills of Hollywood, Griffith has the best vantage point overlooking the city of Angels. Get there early and be prepared to fight the crowd however",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJDC19
10,Complete waste of time & fuel,"After reading the reviews this morning we decided to go to the observatory primarily for the views of LA and because of LaLa Land. It started badly with the sat nav directing us to a road that gave no access. We amended our route and although we arrived shortly after the midday opening, it was so busy that the car park was closed off and we were directed to carry on away from the observatory. People were parking roadside for at least a mile in all directions. We didn't fancy a mile plus hike in midday heat so gave up. Instead we went to the Hollywood shopping mall. $2 parking was money well spent. A much better option for seeing the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandab70
50,Fantastic views on the exterior of the observatory!,"Great little outdoor trip to take if you're hoping to see the view of the whole LA city. Especially beautiful if you arrive at dusk!The observatory's interior is very fine and simple, if you're a fan of outer-space and cosmic universe, its a plus to come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N9031ZLnathanc
40,Great views,"Great views of the city. We were looking to go to the Hollywood sign, and apparently Google Maps takes you here. The inside was kind of interesting; planets, stars, etc. You have to pay $8 for parking or trek way up the mountain. It was pretty packed and we got there before it even opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonb128
50,Amazing views of LA,"How could you come to LA and not visit the iconic Griffith Observatory? It is a must! The views of the Hollywood hills and out towards downtown LA are amazing.

There's lots of interesting information about space within the observatory, which is well worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo
40,Excellent but extremely busy,"To be expected I suppose but on a very hot day in the school holidays, you maybe won't want to stay too long.Views are absolutley stunning and the building is iconic.There's a cheap shuttle bus that takes you back to East Hollywood if you don't have your own car (parking was a nightmare at the Observatory - glad we didn't drive there).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MallorcaLover

50,Cool place,Getting up to the observatory is really good exercise if you go hiking or biking. It's a great view of the city from the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moupim
40,Very busy and slightly underwhelming.,"You have three options when visiting here:1) Park down at the bottom (free) and walk to the observatory. This takes about 15 minutes, but is quite steep.2) Park at the bottom (free) and take the shuttle to the top (.50c PP) and takes about 5 minutes, but you may have to wait up to 20 minutes for the bus3) Drive to the top and hope that someone is leaving as you arrive so that you can park near the top ($4 per hour).The first two are the easiest, cheapest and probably the quickest, all things considered.The views from the top are impressive and you can appreciate the sheer size of LA, however the view of the famous Hollywood sign is very underwhelming and not great. Plus, on most days, the horizon is hazy, making pictures unclear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0908267
50,Beautiful views...,"Nice hike up to the Observatory! Saw awesome views of Los Angeles and a great show ""Centered in the Universe"".

50,Next to the Hollywood sign and the stars,"There is nothing like a visit to the observstory...it is not just looking at the sky, but it is looking at the glorious city lights of Los Angeles. Best time to visit is just before the sun sets. The city is turned on in a panoramic scale...and then the observatory itself is like a stellar delight...not to miss the planaterium show...worth a million. Not to miss the crown jewel of the city of lights and stars. Been visiting since the 60s...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maria112050
50,Classic tourist must see in LA!,"Griffith Observatory is a classic tourist must see in LA! The location, the views, the center, etc. are second to none!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
50,The SKY's the limit,Spend the day above the noise of the city and valleys and enjoy the day. It is a short drive through the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuxBB
50,Summer night of stars and city lights,"Went up at around 7 did not arrive at the observatory till close to 8pm. Which was perfect for stargazing, but didn't leave enough time for lines at the telescope and the planetarium show. I would suggest going up at 6 or earlier, bring a picnic, and wait for the sunset and stars. Beautiful place to see the lights of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattyhuang9
50,Breathtaking,I always love coming here the vews of LA are spectacular from here. there is so much the see and learn and you get the best of both worlds because there is so much to do inside and outside the building. My wife and I like to come here for romantic sunsets and to walk the trails around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474khalila
50,A good day out,"Driving up to the Griffith observatory you follow the road as it winds up the hill, then it opens up and the building appears in front of you gleaming white against the clear blue sky.It is a fascinating place to visit with lots of things for the kids to see and the planetarium where you can relax in the comfy chairs.The views from around the building are stunning where you can see right across LA all the way to the coast.There are also several walks along the dirt trails where if you are feeling brave (it's a long walk) you can get pretty close to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djworrall
40,Interesting,When there's not a lot of people is the best time to go. There's great views and interesting things to see for the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pajg245
40,Fun experience,Loved the planetarium. The shows were amazing.so much to see. The kids had a very pleasant afternoon:) Parking was a bit crazy. Cafeteria was pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scm77
50,The views!!!,Hike up the trails or walk up the short walk up the hill. Skip the long wait for the shuttle! Enjoy the breeze while taking in the views of downtown or the coastline. Once inside..be sure to make your way to the less crowded bottom level. Find out how much you'd weigh if you lived on Mars. This is a nice day trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seesumigo
50,"Newly renovated, great shows","Came with my 6 and 13 yo during the Winter break. Bring jackets along with you it would be cold when you walk back to the car and your car might be a mile away since it could be packed during the Winter holidays.The first time you enter the door first thing find out when the shows will be on sale, if you come to see the show, because for us it was hard to stand in a long line especially with my kids wanting to look around instead of stuck in a line. Staffs were helpful.Lines to the bathrooms were always long, secret is use the bathroom in the cafetaria downstairs. There were no line at all.The shows and exhibit were great, informative and entertaining. Hollywood sign can be seen from here. It's also a great spot to see the sunset and LA city skyline/light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akewan
50,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"Not only is all of the scientific displays and information in the observatory very interesting, the view of LA from above is fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wpg_Mike
50,Good overlook point for LA panorama and stargazing possibility,"Definitely recommend this location. It's free, except for shows in planetarium, which cost about $ 7. Good spot for night stargazing or full moon observing, they offer free telescopes (waiting on the line) in the courtyard after dark. Might get crowded unfortunately so prepare to walk up the road as this may take shorter than the shuttle DASH bus ($ 0,50 one way from nearby Metro Red Line Station). Also good spot for Hollywood sign pictures, but this is better in the morning with sun from east. Walks and talks are also organized, but this I found more kid targeted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcins90
40,A Gem! A Trove of Knowledge!,"We brought our daughter there to meet up with her friends. It was a Thursday in July. We thought we will avoid the crowd that way. But with the popularity of movie Lalaland and the eclipse coming up in Aug it’s still too crowded. At 5PM the crowd was still manageable but when the sun sets, that’s when the surge of big crowd came as people brought their personal telescopes and set them up. The atmosphere is actually nice and like a community coming together and sharing things they have common.The only bad thing in this place is the parking. The traffic police would discourage vehicles to park in the parking grounds even when there are available parking spaces. They would harass drivers not to turn in and will signal you to park elsewhere like on the side of the road. So we see people parked so far from the observatory which is sad to see especially the old people.The observatory itself is full of marvel; a trove of knowledge. There are so many things to see and ponder about this universe and beyond. There is a $7 ticket for adult to get in the planetarium for a half-hour show and free to go watch a 24-minute film at Leonard Nimoy Theater but it’s only on every top of the hour. Be sure to check time if you want to go in. Also be aware that bathrooms on the first level are always full and the lines are long. Check the lower levels. Go outside the promenade walkway to see the view of the city. But to see the Hollywood sign you have to be on the West Terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calimomof6
50,An LA Favorite,This is one of my favorite places in LA. The building looks as impressive as ever and the views of DTLA and Hollywood are amazing. If you're from out of town come early and go for a hike at a trail that begins at the back end of the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feliperZ7653EL
50,Educational and Majestic Site,"It's a great place to take young children- there is a lot to learn. We went during the daytime. And it was still great. Good spot to view the Hollywood sign from a distance. The cafe is expensive, so it would be good to take snacks and plenty of water. It's a big place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jr0202
40,LA city tour,it was a great tour - we went up to Griffith Park where the Observatory is and took pics having the Hollywood sign on the back is awesome and overlooking LAhighly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alailevaoc

For adults this is especially amazing at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseCohenGershon
50,A must see for all LaLa land lovers,Great pictures and views. And interesting exhibits inside. Be prepared not to find parking on your first pass by at busy times. Worth the drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judy92015
50,Vacation,Such a breath taking view. Its a must visit. Roads to get up the mountain very fun to drive. You can see the city plus the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chandanies2017
50,Classic Los Angeles,If you are showing someone Los Angeles and it's their first visit this is the perfect place . Wonderful view of the city and a place that has been the location of some great movies. Go inside and enjoy a Stellar museum experience. Easy parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343dickb
50,Iconic visit to Hollywood,The Griffith Observatory is where you get to see the great view of the Hollywood sign. It also has a planetarium with movie options at an affordable price. The road up to the observatory is quite the site with all the cars lined up along the road. Finding a spot to park can be a little tricky so be prepared. If you are able to make it for the sunset that seems to be a perfect time to get great pics!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollybrightstar
50,Beautiful view,"Take pictures of The Hollywood sign, a perfect view of Los Angeles city, perfect day for family and friends. You can go for a hike and make a small video of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33ceciliam
50,A trip into space,"if you visit LA a must see is the observatory, i been going there since 1969 before its classic renovation. it was always awe inspiring and a look into space and science. to top it off a spectacular view, day or night over LA. a site to behold for sure. since its renovation it has taken on a special charm and experience you should not miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomlG1461HJ
30,Wanted to check it out since the remodeling,"I remember visiting this as a kid and yeah the observatory back then was even getting kinda dated (late 60's). The remodeling is a waaaayyy much improved observatory. For Spock fans this should be a pilgrimage site for the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon. For the movie buffs you can see the memorial to James Dean Rebel W/out A Cause. And for the not so science and movie inclined there are the great views of LA. Griffith Park Observatory is just one attraction in Griffith Park, along with many others like the mini train (with the Disney barn) the train Museum, Autry Museum, Zoo, Carousel, plus great views, hiking tennis horse trails golf hiking. If by chance you might even catch a glimpse of P22 the mountain lion. This is an attraction that is at least equivalent to Central Park in NYC, albeit a somewhat different experience. A worthwhile visit. Hint: before you go check out any videos on the internet especially ones with Huell Howser, interesting and informative",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surprisedtraveler
50,Worth the views!,"Loved it!! I really wanted to go there because of the James Dean movie, Rebel without a Cause! The views are wonderful!! We went on a Monday, the day they are closed. Not a big deal, we really didn't wanna go inside we were more interested in the views!! Great place to take pictures!!! Free to walk around!! Another bonus!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretchenm3
40,Good visit,Was able to have an excellent view of Los Angeles. I always visit this place whenever I am visited by family and friends. I always pick up something i miss before. Also I like to hike as close as I can to the Hollywood Sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raquelita1985
50,Nice place,The place is nicely located on the tophill with a great view of the city. The location is great! The crowd is decent. The observatory has quite a few good things to understand especially for kids loving science and geography. The best part is the view of Hollywood sign... a bit far buy clear view. During weekends or holidays the area gets too crowded and finding a parking becomes a Herculean task unless u park downhill and are ready to walk for more than a mile. Overall I liked the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saher2015
10,Stay away on the weekends,"Griffith Observatory is a great place, but stay away on the weekends. So crowded, it ruined the experience. Parking is a joke, and the shuttle bus service is what you get in LA - totally off-schedule, slow, and jam-packed, with forever waits. Plus, the crazy weather ruined the nighttime view. I wish I'd taken my family to Mt Wilson instead. Staff was pretty nice for the most part, but the crowd is overwhelming. The POS system for the planetarium is from the 1960's. I hate this about LA - this is a clear example of something that should be an LA showcase, but someone's brother in law is running it, and it shows. The staff is good- it's a management problem. Stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmcgus
50,Beautiful at night on a full moon,The walk up the hill was well worth it. On the roof we it was gorgeous. Anywhere was a breath taking view. I recommend going just before sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryHude
50,The view is all of LA,"The view is so expansive from the backside of the observatory that you feel you are seeing all of LA at once. Even if it's a bit smoggy, it's worth it. The architecture of the building itself is unique and magnificent. And the feel of being in the hills of Griffith Park really takes you away. It's a popular attraction, so expect lots of people and cars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomLag
50,Griffith Park Observatory,"Remodeled ... great and interesting, truly enjoyed it. Great universe information, great learning experience, browse around for free, buy tickets to interesting shows, or relax and dine upstairs , as well as buying one of a kind souvenirs. Highly recommended especially for its location in the Griffith Park which is great for relaxing or hiking 😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolajoy
50,Observe the Classic View,"For anyone visiting LA for the first or 21st time, this is a must see .... morning, afternoon or night. Dusk is the perfect time of day if it's Clear in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalya24
50,Fun for 1st timers,"Get view of the city, gets pretty busy all day everyday, parking is a pain but you can find it. Best right after a rain storm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanw129
50,Very nice and special place the only one problem some times is the parking,Very interesting to know about the stars the earth move and other things. You will to spend a time an a great experience. And at this time you can take picture with the Hollywood sings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107juliov

50,One of LA's best,Another excellent place to take family and friends when visiting LA. Will provide hours of education and entertainment for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skystars
50,Amazing views for Free,Anything free in LA is a must do. Nice walk up the hill where you can continue onto the Hollywood sign.We went back up later in the day on the 4th of July to watch the fireworks displays across LA.Get out your trainers and start walking to up to the Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A7021ZIwilliamc
50,Fantastic Visit and Stunning Views,We visited one evening. Probably not the best time of day as the traffic up the hill was a nightmare - took over an hour.Parking is just a bad - we got to the top and could not park and were told we had to go around again - no way!! But we were lucky to find a spot just as we went down the hill. Be warned once you start your journey up the hill it is a one way system so very difficult if you get fed up of the queue and change your mind.The Observatory is beautiful and very interesting - the views are amazing and it is lovely to see the sunset. So persevere and get to the top! It's La La Fabulous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warsie
50,Must See If In LA,"This building is iconic to Los Angeles, and for good reason. This is a must-see for all of those visiting LA. The view is absolutely amazing, and completely FREE. I would, however, recommend taking an uber as you will probably have to park a mile or more away and walk up the mountain if you drive yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/landanj
50,Wonderful views - odd parking arrangements,"We have a lovely couple of hours here - there is loads to see and the views are amazing - all the way across to the Hollywood sign. Entry to elements of the observatory are free an there is enough to keep the kids occupied without paying. There are paid for parts that where very busy (and we had missed the opportunity but overall we didn't feel we'd missed out). Parking / access is a little odd in that you can pay $4 to park on the way up on the side of the road (which was rammed), the car park at the observatory is very small so was full but if you keep going round towards the theatre there is loads of free parking and a shuttle bus to take you up (I think 50c per person) - so keep going and use the bus would be my recommend. A really great couple of hours and well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poperobert
50,Awesome place!!,Went there with our kids and had a blast. Both our 12 year old and 18 year old children enjoyed it. Actually I may have had more fun then them. Other then parking and the planetarium everything was free. Diffinatly recommend visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwr1976
40,Fun & FREE (TIP/ADVICE on visiting this place),"It's FREE, you don't find much of that in LA, so looking for something to do that won't break your budget and this is it. Easy to get to, the hills you drive up aren't bad at all. Parking is terrible, they don't have near enough space, but they do control the traffic and parking situation pretty well. If the top lot is full, which it seems always is, then they'll direct you to park along one of the hillside roads leading up to it. Not a bad hike, pretty simple really. Observatory itself is pretty cool, I thought it would be boring but had a good time. Some good exhibits. 4 levels, one underground (space and planets) one main level (cool info on astronomy and our sun and moon, as well as the planeterium), roof has some telescopes you can view for 50cents, but not much else.TIP/ADVICE: Bring bottled water for your hike up here from wherever you park your car. There is a cafe on-site but it's pricey.TIP/ADVICE: Great views of HOLLYWOOD sign for your picture taking can be done on the roof or north terrace above the restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucep460
50,Family visit to an Iconic site,"There was something here of interest to all of my family, an Iconic location in itself that also featured in the fantastic film La La land and also in Star Trek episode Futures End.. We visited late Sunday morning and had to park at the Greek theatre. We waited nearly 50 mins in baking heat for the shuttle bus which cost 50 cents each and were packed like lemmings.Thw return journey was alot quicker thankfully.Wow , what amazing place the Observatory is, something for everyone with magnificent views. It is free to enter and you pay to go into the PlanetariumUnfortunately, our timings were out and we missed the shows I wanted to seeWe spent a good couple of hours there, toilets inside (better)and out (not good). Café on site but we took our own picnic. You cannot visit LA without going here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M159KRcarolinem

50,Observation Excellent!,"Free attraction with so much to offer. Cool inside. Beautiful exhibits and information, Elevators as well as stairs. Nice Cafe in the lower level. Would liked to spend more time there to really explore all that is offered. The observatory does offer tours that you can buy tickets for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherrysPortkey
50,Great views over LA,"We were only able to walk around the observatory as we arrived around 11 a.m. and it did not open until noon. There were a lot of tour buses and difficult parking already, but a nice opportunity to view the grounds. We had children (ages 9 - 11) and they were impressed with the sun dial and various displays around the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann_MarieC324
50,Great views,"Didn't expect the observatory to have all the space/science things in it and we enjoyed strolling around the entire place and reading everything.Can get perfect views of all of LA from here, and the Hollywood sign.My family and I had lunch at the cafe here and it was just okay. Wish we'd brought lunch and enjoyed it out on the grass somewhere.We went on a walk down from the observatory and only went for a little bit but we got a thorough workout. Loved seeing everyone else out and about enjoying the weather, as well as the doggies :)It was only mid April and already super hot, we all got sunburnt!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristymayk
50,What a location and superb views!,We didn't go into the observatory as we were there too early before it opened. However we were glad we were as parking was already scarce (before 9am on a Saturday morning). Great drive up into the park and simply stunning views over L.A. and of the Hollywood sign. To be highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tim-J-W
50,Amazing Views,"Having queued in our car for a while to get up here, we can safely say that it was worth the wait. The views over the city are unbelievable and are worth it for that alone. The observatory itself is excellent and educational and in line with other reviews here, the place does get very busy !Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmyh432014
50,Quick visit,"We only had a few days in LA and unfortunately the day we chose to go, it was ""closed"" but that didn't stop anyone...it was packed!!! Walked around the entire outside, some great views. There were people everywhere! Hate to see what it would be like when they were actually open!! Parking was a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flygirl1993
50,Wonderful point of view,"While visiting LA, you must go there. To see both the city and the Hollywood sign.Be careful:- the best moment for the sign photos is before 4pm (or after the sunset)- the best moment for the city photos is... during the afternoon of course- it's very complicated to access with your car (as everybody want !)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davric73
50,Best view of LA,Be prepared to walk to the top as there are many visitors. Go early to avoid the lines and the heat. Get your camera ready as the views are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stavreez
40,Loved it,"The only place i actually enjoyed with my kids in LA was here... stayed until 8pm and watched the stars. And they had telescopes for people to watch the moon, Saturn and Jupiter... However it is best to take the shuttle bus up to here .. other wise it's crazy to find a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zahalt2015
40,The place where you can see the Hollywood sign,"The griffith Observatory is one of the few places in Los Angeles where you can see the Hollywood sign. It is quite far, a long walk up hills, but the view worths it! Inside the Observatory, everything is also very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilian_dreis

50,Amazing night views!,"We arrived on Friday evening just in time for sunset, it was PACKED! We left our Uber behind and walked the last 200 meters or so. It was supercrowded, but we found a little place in the garden below observatory and enjoy beautiful views on LA in the night. One of the best places to see in LA, but better go on less crowded day/time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sterlling

Yes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packcal
30,Very busy,"Queue of cars up the road to the top so parked at the free parking down the hill - fair hike up the road to the top.Observatory - very busy, full of people, probably pick another time of day to go (we were there about 12.00).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marksteel
50,Seeing the Tesla Coil is worth the visit!,"There are so many details to see while visiting this Observatory. Besides all the tourist activities and things for kids to do mentioned in other postings here, there is a lot here for adults interested in the history of science and cultural history. Just to be able to see a real Tesla Coil is worth the visit! There are lots of Masonic Symbols in the contruction of this iconic building. Look at the metal entry gate to the museum. For us oldies interested in film history, it was fun and nostalgic to see the show in the same kind of low seats shown in the film Rebel without a Cause with James Dean. Worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyNorwegians
30,"Hike up, shuttle down",We decided to walk up & even though it was scorching hot we enjoyed getting a sidewalk view of some of the luxurious homes. The view from the top was nice but expect the LA haze to obstruct long distance views. There are shuttles to take you up & down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrMarek
40,A Must See for Free,"This is a beautiful place, but go at night. You can see all of Los Angeles. Bring your camera for photo shoots and selfies. This is a free venue and if you come at night you can see some planets. I saw Saturn and Jupiter. Tip.....Get there before dark or traffic is hell. Only one traffic at the top and there are a lot of people. You can park down low and walk the trails up. We did not and got stuck in traffic for 45 minutes to travel the 2 miles up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854rodneyt

40,Vacation,Very beautiful views. Awful parking. Received parking ticket Evan after asking the guard is the area ok to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kushlagirl
50,One of the kind experience,"I have been to Griffith Observatory several times. It is always fascinating.Great place to spend during a cool morning or afternoon. Try to avoid summer months. The place attracts people from all over the world. During the rest of the year students visits are very frequent and gets very crowded.The park surrounding the observatory is very nice to hike, picnic or just enjoy the outdoors; so, pack lunch and water.Since parking is really bad, I would take public transportation to the closes point and then walk. If you cannot walk all the way up, I would suggest using a taxi or Uber. Clear days and evenings are the best to get a greater view. The sunsets are stunning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evelucille
50,beautiful,"great place to see the views. Was closed the day we arrived, but was still worth the trip up the mountain to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentm500
50,Must see....go early!!,"One of those must see attractions whilst in LA area and surroundings. It has been used in a number of films also, so all very easy to recognize. Also nice views of the Hollywood sign, although closer to the sign is nicer. Would go early though. Parking is very limited, the later you arrive, the further down the hill you need to park, which is OK if you want to make your steps of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasEMM
40,Great view of the city,Wonderful place for a great view. A little crowded but worth it. Would park below and walk up or take shuttle as parking was a little crazy. Lots of educational items inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifer1216
50,Must see in LA/Hollywood!,Gorgeous views over the Hollywood Hills and Los Angeles. The Observatory itself is really worthwile (and free!). Go and see the Planetarium-show (not free); quite an experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineEssink
40,Parking is atrocious other than that the Griffith Observatory was well worth the visit,"Parking was a complete nightmare. We went on a Saturday evening at 6pm hoping to get there for the sunset at 8. It takes 20 minutes for us to drive to Griffith park but it took just under 2 hrs to finally and luckily find parking driving up and down the hill for a spot. Ever since the movie LaLa Land, this place has been packed according to our Airbnb host. We watched the last plantarium show of the night and it was well worth it. Was a funny day with a lot of fog and cloudiness in the air. The building is beautiful art deco style and I remember it from the James Dean movie, Rebel without a cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drifting_nomad
30,Good views,"Awful parking, very busy. The observatory isn't top of my list but you can get some decent photos of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanjaap
50,Views alone are worth it,"We made nearly an hour drive to get up here and I'm sure others come from much farther away. The views from the south slope of Mount Hollywood are simply breathtaking. The observatory is obviously appealing to anyone interested in weather or astronomical conversation as well. The site hosts basically a small museum, planetarium, auditorium for historical shows, Tesla coil, seismograph, Foucault pendulum, a solar telescope (coelostat), and a twelve-inch Zeiss refracting telescope. After 7pm you can use the telescope on clear nights for various viewings. Tesla coil demonstrations and planetarium shows run throughout the day. The planetarium shows are only $7 for adults. Plan ahead as there are different ones and they begin seating about fifteen minutes before each. It is a beautiful observatory inside and out, and the planetarium is fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hizzysimz

Great views in downtown and other parts of LA, but note that the smog is a problem, so get a good camera. We saw a hummingbird (a first) in the gardensWe didnt go inside the observatory, but the area around is fab. , good to spend 1-2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abhit_12
50,Must See Land Mark of LA!!!,"Going to see this Observatory is like a 3 in 1. You get education, great photography and opportunities to get exercise by walking the mountainous trails nearby. Most people want to get their picture shot of the ""Hollywood"" sign from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247
40,Closed on mondays!,I was super bummed that when we got there on a Monday it was closed but still has a great view of the Hollywood sign and nature. If you're feeling active bring your hiking boots as there are cool trials to see. Although we didn't get in my fiance and I got some amazing pictures and would go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simplythetruth21
50,Fantastic views and interesting science,"Having escaped from the evil clutches of Hollywood Boulevard, this gem of an attraction was literally a breath of fresh air. It's an impressive building in an impressive setting. The science exhibits are very well done - appealing, interesting and informative. The cafe balcony was a superb stop to refresh and take in the views. A highlight of the trip was holding a 9lb meteorite . Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsHC7
50,"Great view, but sta away on the weekends",Everthing was nice except the traffic going up and down. Supposedly it's not that bad during the week.Great view and interesting free exibit. Once s month the astronomer club puts up lots of telescopes so we got a close encoynter with the mooen snd also saw Saturn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/t0rkelf
50,Californiaa dreamin🇺🇸💛,Wow! Bare wow for en opplevelse! Jeg fikk gleden av å besøke stedet 2 ganger i løpet av min språkreise med EF Education First! Jeg ble helt sjokkert over hvor fint det var!Vi reiste opp sent på kvelden og fikk 1 time der til å se. Vi tok masse bilder og fikk de flotte lysene og den flotte byen å se på! Skjønner nå hvorfor den heter City of Angels! 🌆Wow just wow! What an experience to be there! I got the pleasure of coming to this place twice on my Language trip with EF Education First. I was shocked over How nice the wiew and the place was!We drove up late at night and got 1hour to see and take photos. We took allot of photos and got the beautiful lights and the beautiful city to see! I now get why it's names City of Angels⭐️🌇❤️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneMarteFolstad
50,Super Fun and Educational,My wife and I took our 2 kiddos here and we had a blast! We started out at the playground in the park below the observatory and hiked up the trail to the front entrance. It was a nice hike and rewarding at the top. The observatory itself has amazing exhibits that teach you a ton about our universe and Earth's place in it. Anytime someone new comes to visit us we usually take them here (especially because you can get a great picture of the Hollywood sign from out front of the building! I recommend doing the hike up because parking is extremely scarce near the building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hakej
50,A must see while in LA,"It's a bit of a winding drive up to the observatory but so worth it, parking is well organised.Although it doesn't open until midday get there early as you can still walk all around the park and observatory and see stunning views of LA and the Hollywood hills before you enter- even if you don't go inside the outside views are stunning.There's quite a lot to see and do inside and most of it is free, you just have to pay for certain areas and screenings.We saw hummingbirds and huge butterflies hovering around the flowers- just beautiful.Would definitely go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorraine048
50,"Great museum, even greater views","We hiked up to the museum. It was quicker than it looked. The museum was pretty neat. We really enjoyed the planetarium and the amazing views. We watched the sunset between the hills with the Hollywood sign. We took the bus, cost 50 cents per person. I'd figure out how to get down before getting there. There isn't much cell service at the Observatory and the information desk was closed when we were trying to figure out how to get down, but I found a staff member who wasn't busy, and he told me where to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginap426
40,Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"We took a bus tour up to the observatory and the views were spectacular. If you're looking for a photo of the famous Hollywood sign, this is the place to go. Tourists are not allowed any closer to the sign anymore so this place is your best bet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chiggins91
40,Awesome place,Great views and tours. The lights of LA were fantastic. The observatory is an artwork itself. It does get busy so we took a tour. The drive up was fantastic could not believe it was the middle of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgier15
50,Great visit,Parking is tough and so be prepared to walk up the hill!The views are spectacular and you must go if in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemP1560SN
50,Great views of the Hollywood Sign and great place for families,A friend suggested we visit here and we were not disappointed. A lot of cool activities inside and great views of LA and the Hollywood Sign. All free except maybe for parking. Very fun visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyMcN
50,Beautiful views,"We got the local bus here from Glendale , lots of people around but not packed. Beautiful views of Los Angeles , if we had more time we would have gone on some hikes . Inside had lots of things to see . Great information for kids and adults .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJDW2011
40,Nice stop,"We went there in the afternoon, watched sunset. It's not a big place, but on top of the mountain, great view throughout the day.I hope we could stay bit later, but it was really cold out there, so we left early.I would recommend this place to families with kids or anyone interested in science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRCreator
40,Lovely view over LA,this place can get really crowed and parking is very limited. It is worth even going only for the view so be here early (before they open) then parking is free and you will have a very good viewing point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BYTALG
50,breathtaking city view,"If you are going to LA, definitely visit the observatory. Since it was closed during our visit, we still enjoyed the view of the city and the famous sign ""Hollywood"". Also if you are not on a car, take a Uber ride. It is easier that way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saidakbarp
40,People interested in science will love it,"I love science and astonomy in particular, and Griffith did not disappoint in the least. The museum inside of it was very interesting. But unfortunately, it was way too crowded and finding a parking spot was nearly impossible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770bachirh
40,Worth the walk,We went late afternoon and stayed to watch the sun go down near the Hollywood sign. Plenty of free parking at the Greek theatre (check if there is anything on first!) it's a bit of a walk but worth the effort. Pretty much everything is free once you get there. Loads of interactive visits and some very accessible science.Fantastic views over LA. Just had drinks so can't really review the restaurant but food didn't look great to be honest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFundraiser1
50,Beautiful spot,We spent the afternoon exploring the observatory on our first day in LA (recovering from jet lag). It's a beautiful spot with excellent exhibitions. We paid for tickets to see a live narration in the observatory itself and it was well worth it. Also great to see the famous LaLa land staging. Well worth a drive up there to see the famous Hollywood sign. Only issue was the parking which was difficult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmachambers2016
50,Beautiful at night.,Beautiful place to visit at night when the twinkling lights of LA seen to sparkle as far as the eye can see. Very crowded was the only drawback. We caught an Uber up and back but I believe buses do run.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176leonie
40,Get some exercise and walk to the top!,"While the traffic getting there was stressful, the time spent was relaxing. We parked in the free lot at the bottom of the hill and chose to walk up. (there's a bus for a small fee) I'm in my early 60's and had a knee replacement the previous year and had no problem with the walk. I didn't walk briskly, but made it eventually. The views from the top are amazing, including the famous Hollywood sign. There is a cafeteria up the, but it ain't cheap. Typical prices for souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mzznlink
40,Free science visit with a view,Great view of L.A.Many nice science exhibits. No charge to enter. Parking is reasonable.Children can enjoy it.You may need to hike from parking to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perryville_John

50,Beautiful views - a must-see in LA,"Beautiful building, great exhibits, amazing views! It is worth going up for at least 2 hours, more if you decide to watch one of the presentations.Note: parking is $4/hour as you get close, and there is limited parking. Go early, if possible, it gets very busy as the day goes on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniekessler
40,Beautiful place!,"Sadly we didn't get to go in as parking was full and stretched to the bottom of the hill. We went the next day early to at least see the scenery. From the outside, its beautiful and the views are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielK708
30,Mother & adult daughter trip,A fleeting look due to it only being a stop on the bus tour.I recommend more time to explore. There is lots to see. The immunities could be improved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandravW6496AL
40,La La Land,"Very interesting place to visit, i.e. astronomy especially the beautiful mural on the ceiling.Wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign. It's always a very busy place to visit many school groups, buses and parking can be rather difficult when driving.After visiting the Observatory I was most excited to see the movie La La Lands opening scene was inside the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjj960
50,Great visit,We have visit there at the sunset.Amazing view of the city and interesting museum.It's free!Friendly workers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lior_m77
40,Griffith Observatory,Very interesting place. Educational and well laid out. The views are amazing. The plates outside that show to scale the distance between the sun and each planet are incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8224PMamandah
30,"Terrible parking, Some hiking info","Although we knew it would be difficult, we had no idea how bad trying to find parking would be. We tried twice to get to the observatory in July, first around 4:30pm on a Tuesday, then around 45 min after it opened on the following Thursday afternoon. Both times the road was bumper to bumper, all parking on the side of the road was jammed full and the observatory lot had a sign out saying it was full. Even if you got a spot on the side of the road it's not a great thing, as there is no place to walk up except IN the road. There are no sidewalks, no edges, and steep drop offs on the side. Fortunately, though narrow, it is a real two-way street all the way through the park.At the bottom of Western Canyon Rd. there is a sizable parking lot on the right. We parked there. Across from the lot towards the observatory is a hiking map sign labeled West Trail Head - West (a little below that is a picnic area). It gave observatory trails to the top but didn't seem clear or time efficient. The observatory trails seemed to start further down (of which I saw no real parking for as we drove out). A local person suggested the best way from that point, although steep, was to walk the trail up from that sign to West Trail to the top by the observatory parking lot. Hindsight it was likely the best way up. However, be prepared. The dirt-sandy trail is wide enough for a vehicle all the way up. There is almost no shade, so wear sunscreen and maybe a hat. Wear shoes to handle the steepness to be able to push off some and brace yourself coming down in places, like hiking boots, sturdy tennis shoes, sturdy Keens - NO flipflops or the like. Have water. It took around 30 minutes to hike it one way with two teens and two middle-aged adults. Sturdy elementary school kids could do this hike too. Don't know that I would want to hike it down after dark though. Would definitely need a good flashlight.Note too, that the cell coverage at the lower parking lot is not great and may not work, so have your route out of the park figured out ahead of time. Don't rely on being able to get to Google maps to find your way to your next destination.Was it worth it? Maybe. The Observatory, though smaller scale (we are used to Chicago Museums) was a much nicer place and more well done than I thought it would be. I was disappointed because, due to the parking problems that really messed up and shrunk our time line, we missed the three shows I really wanted to see. We did see an alternative show in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium, which had a very nice dome screen, comfortable reclining chairs, and a real live person doing a marvelous job as the story teller.It is possible to see the Hollywood Sign from next to the observatory. We took pictures with it, but after getting back from our trip and reviewing them the sign didn't show up too well and was in a bit of a haze. Oh well, we know it is there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCZS2017
40,Amazing view,"Very crowdy on wednesday night around 8:30-9 but enjoyed very much of nice night lights and sky. Parking was a breeze with $4 an hour and lots of spaces were available. Not sure why so many people in crowds walk up all the way from the bottom but I like parking right beside the building and avoid the crowds, so it was perfect for me. waited just about 20 min in line for the rooftop telescope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gklgkl
40,Great View of L.A. & Hollywood Sign,The Bad: we arrived minutes after 10AM on a Saturday and the parking lot was full?!?! We had to park probably 1/2+ mile away and it is a steep walk uphill to get to the observatory.The Good: great view of L.A. and the Hollywood Sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreye799
40,Great views of the city,"I came here on a weekend in May and overall the Griffith Observatory is a good place to visit, if you take into account you may have to park miles away from the Observatory itself. The Observatory isn't architecturally stunning or a must visit, but it's still not a bad way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
40,Very good views,Lovely views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. The museum inside is very good and there is lots for everyone to do. It is very busy to get up there and there was a lot of traffic but we got the bus for only 50 cents from the Metro so that may be the better idea.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142beni
40,Parking Nightmare,"One of the worst places to try to park. Maybe it's easier on certain days, but it took us about an hour to park. The walk up the hill is a bit steep. Can see the Hollywood sign from the top. If interested in astronomy, check out the exhibits indoors. Even if you don't, it's worth a walk through",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astecklein
50,Weekend visit,"We visited this place last month on the long weekend and this place was much crowded that day, struggled a lot to find parking space. Nice place for people who like more astronomical stuff. Old scientific things and inventions are kept for people to observe. We can see LA downtown from there. Also we are able to see Hollywood Sign from the observatory park. Clicked some amazing pics over there with friends. Overall good place to visit once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604rajeshb
30,"Great views, average museum","I visited recently as part of a trip me and my son took across the country for his birthday. He is really into science, but was really bored with this particular museum. Not much int he form of interaction, mostly just reading and information about our solar system. He said it bored him because it didn't have enough interaction. Good place to catch a glimpse of the Hollywood sign and views of downtown LA. But the museum is free for a reason. Not a must do IMO, but not a waste of time if you want to see the Hollywood sign and get a little education at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/717RichardG
50,Must go,"Giant telescopes, amazing sunset, facts, dispalys, views to los angeles city. Stars etc.. must go.Go before sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elsa_Cervera
50,Worth the trip,Visited the observatory around 8pm at night. It is crazy busy! We thought there was a special event that night but the staff said it was just a usual night. So I would advise that you have good walking shoes on because you will probably have to park on the road and walk up. We walked at least 1/2 mile to reach the observatory but what amazing views of the city and we looked at Saturn and Jupiter through the telescopes. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. One recommendation is to arrive well before 9:30pm because they close off the road up to it and close the doors to the telescopes (even if you are in line),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danieldp2017
40,Stopped on a City Tour,"This was a pretty cool place mostly for the views. We didn't have a ton of time to review all of the exhibits inside but took a quick walk thru to see what they offered. If you are into space, physics, stars this is the place to be. Lots to see. It was extremely crowded as buses dropped people off constantly. Again the views (including the Hollywood sign) are what was most intriguing about this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billcC6252BH
30,Traffic nightmare but a good view,"Visited on a Friday afternoon and the traffic and parking were a nightmare. Having crawled to the top of the mountain, we were turned away and had to find our way back to the bottom of the hill and Greek Theatre to park and catch a shuttle up. Waited for 45 minutes for a shuttle so took more than an hour to get back to where we started.Observatory was (understandably) crowded. More than a 90 minute wait to look through the telescope so we didn't. Missed all the shows we had planned to see.So, it was in all a time-consuming trip to look at a pleasant view over LA and the Hollywood sign (which is not that close).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandDragon
30,Griffith observatory,Took decided to see the observatory in the evening and see the lights of LA at night. So we picked up some food to go and headed up. There was a ton of traffic!! The greek theater is just below the observatory and there was a concert going on. It was a complete zoo! It turns into a one lane loop when you get up the hill. Once we finally found parking (you have to pay for parking) we did find a little spot near the trailhead to eat that was quiet. We couldn't believe how many people were at the observatory. One local couple walking their dog up the trail asked us what was going on that it was so packed on a Sunday evening. We had no clue! We walked over to the observatory saw the city lights but did not really get a chance to enjoy the inside because of all the people. It really is a beautiful place and from what I saw it is well done and an informative observatory. Would love to go back when not so crowded. In other reviews I read said to head up early because of the parking but didnt read anything about it being packed at night so most likely it was just a busy summer night?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1477OImichellew
50,Incredible views,"Stunning views from this iconic place. We went late in the afternoon and was glad to use Uber as parking can be tough when it is crowded. I wish we had time to walk the many trails. The observatory was beautiful and we watched one of the shows in the planetarium. We enjoyed watching the sun set, but wished we gave it more time. Cell service did not work(t mobile) and wifi can be spotty. It did make it tough calling for an Uber, but many were around picking up people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bkmiker
50,Wish we could have stayed longer,"Really enjoyed the experience. If theme would have permitted, we would have stayed longer. Regret not staying until dark and getting telescope access after 7. One watch-out is that cell reception is limited in certain areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84clarkj
50,Gorgeous views,This was a stop on our tour and we enjoyed visiting the area. The views of the city are amazing! Inside they offer a video to watch but we didn't have enough time to stay to see it. It is a nice attraction to at least visit. There isn't an entrance fee and the views are worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1594VQcc
40,Great,"Too much people on weekend, impossible to find parking space, they close the roads when to much cars around. But it's a nice place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWINN66
50,I LOVE GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY,"If I could, I would hang out here every day or night.What's not to see and love?It's like being on a gently beating heart.You can see eons of history and thought....art and architecture.You can see the greatest city on the planet. You can see Hollywood and James Dean. You can see Galileo, Copernicus and other great minds of astronomy. You can see thoughtful youth. You can see lovers holding hands on a strole. You can see the heavens. You can see a greater world.What is not to love about Griffith Park Observatory?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArmchairC
50,Great views,We got there right before the rush of people got there so we got lucky enough to park in the parking lot right on top. The views are breathtaking! The observatory itself is closed on Monday's but you're still able to go up and take in the views. You can see the Hollywood sign and Downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocjax
50,great views!!!,awesome spot for pics!!!! Parking was a little tough but so worth it! I highly recommend a visit! Great spot for pics!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleyl2016
50,Great for kids of all ages,"enjoyed the building, exhibits, and the star show. I understand it is open at night for star viewing but we didn't do that. Located high up (of course) in Griffith Park, with a great view of the Hollywood sign and LA spread out below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fivecontinents5
50,Great place given it is free to get in,We stopped off here as part of a tour of LA. We didn't really have enough time to do it justice so if you like anything to do with Space and planetary observation I would recommend you try and spend a couple of hours here. They have some really interesting exhibits and there are also plenty of people around to answer any questions you may have. Great views of the city from up here too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewardj70
50,Griffiths Observatory,Nice exhibits and displays in the Observatory. Tesla's Coil was really cool. Do not miss cool photo opportunities around and a picture with HOLLYWOOD sign in the background is a must have for all tourists,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sivaramas
50,More to do than you think,Explore the park and take in some science ! It's a good view of the famous Hollywood sign and the obvious one too so does get busy but go on an organised tour and you bypass some of the queues,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/druceyd
50,A must see for those who like to explore and learn,We drove up as the day was too hot to hike. Great historical building and beautiful surroundings. Astronomy and star gazers this is a must. Pick a cool day and hike. Worth the view also,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosabomadi
40,Stunning Views ~ Difficult Weekend Access,"This is considered a must do for folks visiting LA. The views are stunning on a clear day. We where there on a weekend around mid-day and access was painfully slow and parking nearly impossible up at the observatory. However, down below is Griffith Park, very nice family friendly ~ easy access and great place for a picnic. Perhaps during the week is a better for the observatory (unless time is no issue).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seashark7
50,Love this place!,I would recommend spending half a day up to a day here. there are so many things to do and see! i went here for the last 2h and wish i had allotted myself more time. they have a planetarium and interactive models/displays of the galaxy/solar system/universe. has a nice view of LA at night and also good for star gazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvo_kid
50,"So, so, so busy!","We parked down at the Greek Theater and got a bus up for 50 cents per person, as the car park was full and we were directed down there. Lots of people parked on the road and walked up, which felt incredibly unsafe.We just didn't have the time to see everything, and it was so busy it was difficult to get around. My 9 year old is fascinated with space, and we will absolutely return at a hopefully quieter time of year (if that exists).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superdella
50,Griffith Observatory is a Must Do !,"Busy park, plan for at least 2 hours min. Parking tough, we parked along road on hill and walked up quite a ways as parking in park was full. Spectacular views. Don't miss it. If time allows plan to take the Charlie Turner trail up the hike to the higher elevations where you get even better views..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J7029ZYdirks
50,Such a beautiful place!,Please visit! It's a free attraction and you can hike there and have a picnic and visit the Observatory. Wonderful date idea!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princessLW96
50,Must see and free!,This place offers so much to visitors! One of the few places you can go to for free in CA and it's worth it! The views are great on clear days and nights. I have been here a few times now and the telescope has been broken or the sky wasn't clear enough so I will have to try again when in the area. But even so the cool displays and knowledge you will come away with just going inside and taking a nice look around was worth the trip. And you can take a hike and get some great views of LA from up here as well. Just park where you can find a spot and walk up the hill. You'll see the streets lined with cars and just find a spot even on busy days it's not much of a walk up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peppertaz
30,Didn't get to it due to HIGH traffice,"Up and Up we went through neighborhoods with beautiful houses, but no parking was available anywhere!!! We tried for 30 min to find a place, but to no avail. We did find a place, but it was really far from the observatory. We tried hoofing it, but wow, we had an uphill hike:( They need more parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauriev2013
50,"Nice view, extraordinary guide","We were visiting place for taking photo of the Hollywood sign. It was very hard to find place for car close. We left it 1mi to the place. Observatory very clean, full of interactive machines with information about sky objects. At 1pm guide showed clock, which catches sun glare, and displays on mechanism. Really worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/925mantasg
50,A nice stop in LA for families with children,"A free observatory in LA, learn more about stars and planets, children will love it.The downside is the parking, as you might park a bit far and need to walk with the kids to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769fawzib
40,Amazing views of LA and the Hollywood sign combined with an amazing science experience,"The observatory offers many different things. Great views of LA due to its vantage point, great views of the Hollywood sign (the closest you will get without head to the lakes) and is an amazing science location with great exhibits including the tesla coil, pendulum clock and the Leonard nimoy theatre. It is well worth spending the time here as a part of any LA tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ant-across-the-world
40,"Awesome view of Hollywood sign, be mindful of crowds","The Griffith Observatory has a lot to offer and many of those activities are free. The main reason we wanted to go was to get some good views of Los Angeles and the famous Hollywood sign. We did get to experience that, but it wasn't that easy. If you're going to visit, be very mindful of crowds and the timing that you visit. The parking lot for the observatory is very small and most of the spots require you to pay. We weren't even given the option to do that, and were sent down the hill to park along the right side of the road. We had to park so far down and then hike all the way up to the observatory. We are athletic people, and it still took us about 30 minutes to walk from our car to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115trishe
30,Amazing Views,Didn't go inside the observatory but the views from surrounding grounds is amazing. Great view over LA and beyond. We drove to the top but there are walking trails for the keen walker. We went early morning and the atmosphere was very peaceful and relaxed. A nice way to start the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyte_123
20,Hope you're ready to hike.,"Yes, its free to go. Parking however, is not and is at the bottom of the hill. Once we made it to the top, and in the very crowded observatory, we located an employee to ask about the laser show. We were informed there is no longer a laser show. I jokingly told my kids ""well let's go, we drove all the way from oklahoma to see the laser show"" the employee proceeded to them tell me ""I should have looked it up, they have internet in Oklahoma don't they"" after that we stayed away from any of the workers. And just simply did not ask any questions. Rather than have a confrontation in front of my children with an obviously frazzled employee .I'm not sure if there were extenuating circumstances as to why it was so busy, or if that is the daily and normal attendance. But it seemed rather under staffed. We did enjoy seeing the moon through the large telescopes, and our weight on all The planet's. But over all this was one trip that did not leave us wanting to return, which is a shame really, as my husband grew up in the area years ago and was so excited to bring our children there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfellenfisher
10,Disaster - Not sure we'd bother evening trying to go there again,"Always wanted to visit so planned our trip - wish we hadn't bothered. We were only staying 4 miles away and it took us 2 hours to get to the top - traffic was terrible. OK it's LA and you have to expect these things. Parking on the meters on the road up was full and we just sat in a queue going nowhere for half an hour. I got out to ask one of the staff about parking as I could see space in one of the lots - she said yes but you have to pay, I said fine and she directed me to pull the car over to colleagues on the barrier. We did this only to be told they were not letting any cars in even though there were spaces. They said you can go down the hill and come around again and we might let you in!! We started driving down the hill to leave and there were numerous spaces with traffic cones in them - the member of staff informed us they were for staff only - how many staff do they have there? There were dozens of empty spaces. It took us another 30 minutes plus to get down the hill and we ended up spending the best part of 4 hours on a 8 mile round trip. I get these places are busy but the staff were rude and unhelpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcusM777
50,Great spot,"The journey up here is worth it for the view of LA and the Hollywood hills alone. The building is gorgeous and space nuts will love the displays and shows inside. Definitely worth a visit, especially since it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerAS80
50,Hike and planetarium,Great 30 minute hike up. I suggest parking at the park and hiking up- much quicker than finding parking. Steep but not overly difficult - much easier on the way down! Enjoyed a show at the planetarium. Planning a return visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simstreet
40,"Daytime - Hollywood Sign, Nighttime - The Stars!","It's busy but if you arrive at the right time it's about an hours hike to the best view of the Hollywood sign you'll be getting in LA - be sure to bring water though as it's hot work!In the evenings the observatory comes into its own, allowing you to look into the night sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willhI1106EJ
50,Unbelievable views!,"Took the trip to Griffith for the perfect view of the Hollywood area from the hills! Didn't have time to do the planetarium due to our tour group, but heard second hand while there that it is a must-see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metsfan2017
50,Hiking to happiness!!,What a great day for a hike. It was an amazing experience. The view was spectacular. Bring lots of water to rehydrate yourself during the hike. They have water and bathrooms at the the facility. It's so rewarding to get to the top and see the view. A must for any traveler! Cheers-Tiff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanieMPiker
50,Finally!,I hiked up here (which is an amazing hike) and ended up coming to the Observatory! It is absolutely amazing. There is so much to see and it's all free. Highly recommend everybody comes here (locals too)!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianla1331
50,Excellent!,"Best Observatory been to so far, beautiful view, easy access, and the inside museum was awesome and it was free of charge, the staff was super helpful and explaining things as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643ninai
50,Great view of LA!,Not only is this a beautiful place but it is also a great place to get a good shot of Los Angeles during the day or night. It is a tourist attraction so there are always a lot of people especially on the weekends. The parking gets to be a little difficult to find.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNicoleS375
40,Good visit but plan for a hike from your parking spot.,"The Griffith Observatory is a great trip, on your own or with the family. On your own, plan for at least 3-4 hours to really enjoy each station, exhibit, telescope and if you'd like...the near by hiking trails can make it for a whole day event. Children, at least my kids (despite all three of them being 5 & under) really like the big displays and scales on the floor. They and I also enjoyed the telescope and having a picnic out in the front grassy area. If you don't want to pack a picnic basket, they do have good food options downstairs and off to the side though a bit pricey for my budget. The actual observatory is free though for those that want to get there by shuttle/bus, I believe there is a fee. You can expect to put in a good hike from your parking spot as its up the hill. Parking on the road is free and they do have a lot up front but don't count on a spot as they are hard to come by. Bathrooms are up front with sinks outside and restrooms in the observatory as well. Wear sunblock as though they are trees surrounding the area, the grassy yard and sides where you can enjoy a meal are not shady.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaEspie
40,see hollywood from the observatory,aside from parking visiting the observatory is a must for tourist. you can see Hollywood and LA from the top . you can also hike the Hollywood sign from here( half the length ). kids love the observatory very informative,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kent2009
50,Griffith Observatory,A must see place to see if you are in Los Angeles. Be aware that is hard to get parking and get pack pretty fast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6776LQjaimec
50,Great for family night,"Free telescope viewing, lots of exhibits, and it's free! Great for a date or family night. Parking is scarce, especially the nights when there's a concert at The Greek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C_Stap
30,"Very crowded, hard to find parking, good view of Hollywood Sign","Try to go there a little early to get a spot in the parking lot in front of the Observatory and take photos of the Hollywood sign. It's not a very big lot giving the large crowds that go there. Parking wasn't that expensive, but I believe that there might be a limit, 4 hours? We got there an hour before the Observatory opened, so it ate up an hour of our time inside the Observatory. We rushed through things inside. You could spend half a day there. There are no shade anywhere. It was very hot waiting outside for the Observatory to open. Everyone tried to squeezed in for any little shade they could get. If they open the Observatory earlier, people could get so relief from the sun and heat, and it'll be less crowded, parking spots will turn over quicker. The first time we went there, they turned people away because there wasn't any parking available. Also, there was some sort of festival going on in the park, Greek?, and it was impossible to find parking. We left and try again the second time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIKEITIS1000
10,Plan well ahead!,Attempted to visit the Griffith on a weeknight. Arrived around 745pm. Was told there was no parking near the Observatory so we were told to go to the Greek Theater and take the shuttle. Found parking there but the shuttle was horrible. Waited 25 minutes for first one and it arrived half-full. Long line so it moved slowly. People had to pay 50 cents each and took time paying. Only about 20 people fit so we had to wait for next one. Waited another 20 and decided to give up. Left around 9pm. The line was too long -- we would have arrived at closing. We saw numerous empty school buses go by. Why rely on public transportation that comes every 25 minutes in high tourist season?! Lots of people were walking but there is no sidewalk and lots of uneven surfaces. And it would be a very long walk. Very disappointed. Drove to Mulholland Drive instead for a nice view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
50,"plan your time to visit the ""show""","Lovely place to visit. Caveat:: parking is 'tight' no matter the time of year. We live in Los Angeles thus have been several time. Very interesting, informative. Weather seldom is a challenge so we try to make our visits in ""off"" periods, not so many people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seniormrs
50,Great experience! Educational and beautiful,Great visual and hands-on exaple of science at work! Astronomy and history to the max. Also breathtaking view and relaxing gardens and paths to stroll.Strenuous hike to the HOLLYWOOD sign as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnandbobf
40,Great View,"Nice experience even though we couldn't stay long. Parking was awful cuz there was an event going on so very controlled. Still enjoyed the drive up and down, view of the Hollywood sign and the view over downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JefeHenk
50,Its a must go place for kids & who love science,"This place is surely the best in LA, the observatory is huge, kids will love it so does adults who are interested in science, The shows are super cool & you must watch if you are visiting here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankitpandey
50,awesome!,"took my son for a sporadic dad day out and i couldnt have been happier with the decision; especially after getting ready and not really expecting much from an ""on the whim trip"" but we were very happily surprised by all the activities there was to do, places to exlpore, and my boy loved the solar system set up! def do it again...!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milvetmac
30,Nice view of city from this point.,"The observatory was a very crowded when we went Sunday. The traffic was very congested getting up to the observatory. The""view"" of the Hollywood sign was not as good as I had expected. Especially with the haze. It was very hard to get a clear picture just on a smart phone. I would definitely recommend bringing your actual digital camera with a zoom if you are hoping to get a close up picture. The view of the city is better than the view of the Hollywood sign. The observatory itself it very nice but it was crowded when we went on Sunday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177katlynt
30,Beautiful to look at but hard to visit,"The Getty on the summer day I visited was very crowded, impossibly so. The view of the outside building and the panorama vista is very worthwhile but the inside displays are mediocre. The films are worthwhile but there is a charge for them. Hiking around the area is worthwhile",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnolds637
50,Surprised by the Breathtaking Views,"We went on the evening of a full moon and a Sunday, so maybe that is why it was packed. Or maybe it always is packed. We took an uber, which I was very thankful. Because it was so crowded, there was no parking in the very small parking lot at the observatory. People were parking along the road on the side of the mountain which is not an fun or easy walk to the top where the observatory is located. I would suggest finding public transportation to drop you right off at the door. Another suggestion, pack a meal to eat on the front lawn at sunset. Everyone does it and it would be a lot better than eating at the overpriced cafe. We did eat at the cafe, and I had a delicious salad but my son had the worst hot dog of his life and it was around $7! They also have free high powered telescopes you can look through. The night we went we were able to see Jupiter. Definitely worth going to. Be ready to take a lot of pictures of the sunset and the Hollywood sign and the city and the mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/all4relaxation
50,One of the most under appreciated Tourists spots in LA,"The grounds and buildings are iconic and remind all of an era when government undertook great, big publc and educational ideas without the whining of shortsighted, no vision, no tax folks. The telescopes, museum, and planeterium show are manageable for a half day visit.....and overall cost, with a lunch at the onsite Wolfgang Pucks is not expensive as compared to other tourist sites. You will learn something new here each time you visit and always be amazed the views of the universe and stories that accompany its history. All found here at Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestEastOne
50,NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT!!,"Although we have been to many other Observatories on the globe, the Griffith is the winner.Was born in '38 within walking distance so have known this attraction for a very long time. Cannot be beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbrodek
40,Good,"It's not a good option to go with children, it's a cultural attraction, not a funny thing.But if you like astronomy you must go",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jos_arturm2017
50,Go At Night!!!,We saw the amazing show on stars and got to learn so much. I would definitely say go there in the evening so you can look in the telescope and see planets. We also looked around the museum and learned lots about the planets. If you have the time go here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T606EJlaurac
50,Stars are seen here!,"The real stars of our amazing universe can be seen here daily. Encased in the art deco style facility, you can learn, enjoy and be awed by all things celestial. ....plus the views from the grounds of the city are unparalleled. ....go Griffith!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8495JLmichaelg
50,Great Place to Visit!!,"I went on June 2017, Great place to visit, the view is very nice, it's very interesting and they have parking. I recommend to go early because the parking is not too big. The building is exceptional, and the view to Los Angeles is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smiletraveling
40,The best tourist attraction for very little money.,There is no charge unless you go with a tour group. The los Angeles dash makes daily bus trips to the observatory for 50 cents. The Leonard nimoy show is great. They have a cafeteria and shop on the lower level.is a great palce to visit and get great views of los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelkX9643MN
50,James Dean and Beyond,The remodeling of five years ago truly enhanced an already great observatory. The museum underground did not break the original lines and included many new and interactive exhibits that would keep a child entranced for hours. Just visiting the grounds and going up the steps that gives one a view of Los Angeles 360 degrees brings memories of James Dean and La La Land Just sitting on the front lawn at night is an exquisite experience. Take a shuttle and don't pay the $4 parking fee because you will stay for many hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casimirot909
40,Jupiter is really cool!,"We stood in line to look at Jupiter through the BIG telescope, and it was worth the wait. There was a science-smart-guy talking at the telescope, and he was explaining a lot of super smarty pants stuff in a really understandable way. I know that sounds silly, but it was really helpful, and I'm not making fun at all. As a teacher, I appreciate the time he took to make complex things understandable to those of us not astronomers. It was very informative! It was crowded, but the staff seemed to be moving people around and handling the numbers easily. The biggest problem was that there was a concert at The Greek, which caused a total traffic and parking nightmare. My advice: consult The Greek's schedule before you go to the observatory.Bonus: you get a great view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIsaMarie_112
50,Excellent,"Such a different day out than the rest of LaLa Land. Educational but interesting and such a beautiful building. Love this location, so peaceful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175sarat
40,One of the best places to visit in LA,One of the best places to visit in LA. The city view from the observatory terrace is awesome specially during late evening. Make sure you reach before 8:30 p.m. to have a glimpse of the celestial objects using the main telescopes inside the roof top dome. We reached around 9:00 p.m. and could not have the chance as the queue was big. the observatory closing time is 10 p.m. but the officials close the queue at 9:30 pm itself. We still managed to see some planets using the telescope which was placed outside dome. That was an unique experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dev_undone
50,Very nice views of LA and nice Show!,"Enjoyed getting up here and taking pictures of all the beautiful views that we had. The valkyrie show was very nice and relaxing break from the heat, almost feels like your lost in space in the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615tahat
30,Super crowded- great views- interesting exhibits,"As a tourist in LA visited here on a sunny, crowded, Sunday late morning. 30 minutes to get near the top but we lucked out finding parking. Tremendous vantage point to see the the entire LA area if in fact you could (too much smog). The observatory had interesting exhibits but as I said it was way too crowded to fully appreciate. Don't know if there is a good time to go. Sunday in July is definitely not",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/czar13653
40,Wonderful views of LA,"We went up in the evening, on a night that there was a show in the park so be aware of the traffic that that can occur in order to get up! There is a $2 bus that you can get up or down!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiar251
40,Beautiful,Nice to visit and beautiful place to stay with your friends at sunset. They show me the moon through their telescopio. Beautiful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giorgioz549
50,A MUST SEE,"GO, one of the best experiences we had when seeing LA from a view point and learning more about our planet, galaxy etc. Its free too!! One quick point to note, get there early and allow ample time for parking and traffic. You may need to be hiking up a hill if theres no immediate parking, good exercise but needs to be considered especially for elderly and unfit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopheraK4263UZ
50,Wonderful Exhibits!,"Griffith observatory has been in my bucket list for long time. even though I stay in SD (2hrs drive from LA), have not visited this place since 2011! At last in May end long weekend me and my wife decided to visit Griffith Observatory. after reading reviews, I got a feeling parking here will be very bad and hence I got a uber from our hotel to drop us to Observatory (one less headache!). Observatory has many exhibits with detailed explanation and I did enjoy going over each of those exhibits. specially looking into Mars using Telescope was a life time experience! This place has a nice gift shop and a small café for coffe/snacks. View of LA from top of observatory (specially after sun sets) is mindboggling. even you can easily see HOLLYWOOD sign from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sudipk
50,Beautiful views and interesting exhibits,"Don't miss going to Griffith observatory. We watched two of the planetarium shows and they were both good. They were $7 each, but pretty much everything else was free. Catch a viewing of the Tesla Coil, fascinating. Great views of the Hollywood sign, too. Do yourself a favor and take a Lyft. Parking was almost nonexistent and $4 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B0bbieJ
50,Most interesting,"Amazing place. Full of interesting and fun facts. Give yourself at least a half day or better still late evening until 10pm. See LA at night , brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jckfxy

50,"Amazing Views, But Horrible Parking","The visit is well worth it, but the parking was a nightmare. Sections nearest to the observatory, were closed-off despite it being paid parking. The free parking was anywhere it could be found on the hills, which meant a steep hike, and limiting access for others. The observatory is great and interesting, but was overwhelmed with visitors, however the views of L.A. and the Hollywood sign make it worth while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rb123456789rb
50,Great view.,"Take uber to get here cuz parking is a pain. We went an hour before sunset and it was beautiful!! Great location to see the sunset over LA. Nice grounds to walk around. The observatory itself is simplistic but has some nice displays. I've been to better planetariums, but you go here for a great view of the city and the stars are secondary. Plus you can't beat free so that is really nice. We paid for the star show and that was very cheap also. So all in all definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dipikar2017
50,"Educational, Great view, So much to do","There was something for everyone. We did arrive 30 minutes before opening to get a parking spot which fill up very quickly. Again, as soon as we got in the door we got our show tickets since they also sell out quickly for the entire day. The show we saw was about water in our solar system. It was very professionally done, the presenter extremely knowledgeable on the subject. The exhibits raised numerous questions from the youngest to the oldest to the staff who were available all over to help you. One staff member had a meteor rock he was having people hold to see the density and how heavy it was for its size. We were in the building for over three hours and had we not had another commitment, we could have stayed until closing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspZ9286SG
50,Best View in Town,This was recommended to us by our Uber driver and is a little difficult to find if you don't know about it. Once we got there it was amazing panoramic views of the city and best place to see the HOLLYWOOD sign. There is also a walking track you can take to get even closer to the sign. DON'T go on Monday's as the actual observatory / cafe is closed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTAGbyJD
50,Amazing Vantage Point!,"The views from Griffith Observatory were breathtaking! My children took in spectacular views of the famed Hollywood sign as well as the city of Los Angeles. A bonus was a peak at Stahl House.The hike to the top isn't for just anybody, so be sure to get a parking spot as close to the top as possible.Once you're at the top, make sure your camera is ready. We went at dusk, but I can imagine the view must be astonishing at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernMama2
50,Amazing views of LA,We hiked up from Fern Dell Drive - it's steep in places but the view is definitely worth it. Takes about 20 mins. Recommend going late afternoon to be able to see the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairesP6164EE
50,Great Place to View the City at Night!,"We fought the crowds to view the LA at night! It was pure mayhem getting to the top and finding a parking spot, but well worth the craziness on a Friday night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ45150
50,Best View,We visited with the intent to see the stars and visit the planetarium. We did not expect the fantastic views of the city and the Hollywood sign. The Tesla coil demonstration was very cool as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451richd
50,Equal parts educational and fun,"There's a lot to see. From the moment you get out of your car, the views grab you. You can see the ocean, the Hollywood Sign, Los Angeles cityscape and a whole lot more. During the day is interesting but if you see the views at night, it will take your breath away. If you have a camera that can do long exposure, this is a great place to use it. This is all just on the walk up to the exterior grounds.Once you get on the actual site, there is a kind of homage to the Greek (if I remember right - could have been Roman) gods and the relation to the planets. Pay attention to the Ley Lines on the ground marking the sunset and moon rise and other relevant information. The monument or sculpture in the middle of the grounds leading up the the main building deserves some time.Once inside, there are numerous things to see and do. Much like an interactive museum to the solar system. One of my favorite things to see is the Foucault Pendulum which swings with the rotation of the Earth while knocking over a peg essentially turning it into a perpetual motion timepiece.Laying back in the ""theater"" to see the ceiling turn into a movie screen that takes up your whole view and watch as it takes you on a tour through space and time is amazing. I have a VR headset and it still doesn't compare to that presentation.There is literally too much to list but it is worth your time. Great for kids, visiting friends and relatives, date night and a whole lot more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanmG4029WX
40,Go early to park,Griffith Park Observatory is a wonderful place to visit. It's got great exhibits that'll interest young and old plus the planetarium show is Fun. The views from outside on top of the hill are outstanding plus since it was featured in la la land it's become even more a popular destination. I would go early especially on weekends as parking is nearly impossible on the narrow roads leading up to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gpsenrab
50,Awesome place,"Too bad that we came on weekend. It was super crowd when we get there. And the queue to try on the binocular was obviously super loooong. But the view is totally worth the hike. Well, there is actually a parking area in front of the building. You can get it if you're lucky (that's why don't come on weekend).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rizkidwik
50,Breathtaking views of the city,"Since we had already done the Hollywood hike the same day, we decided to go up by car. Let me tell you: it was probably not the best option. If you have the chance, do a hike till the Griffith Observatory as the views you will find are a complete reward at the end. Make sure that you go on a clear day so that you can see literally every corner of LA. Simply amazing and worth visiting if you are visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vvpprr
40,great view on a clear day,we got there about 4pm on a Sunday so parking not flash about a 20min walk up the mountain to the top. nice sunny day so great views. hands on things inside to do great for active kids or adults alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angwr
50,What a hike!,"Don't get suckered into hiking up to the observatory (we didn't, although the uber driver tried to convince us we should). Once you get to the top, the view, WOW! Breathtaking views! Well worth it! The observatory was closed which was disappointing. All in all I'll do it all over again. Did I mention we hiked down the 3.3 miles? Fun but tiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanng659
50,Great start to LA Visit,A mile hike up to the observatory helps unkink legs from a long car or airplane ride. Great place to get the lay of the land and to get a generalso idea of where things are. In addition to views observatory is interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annieis3
40,Super cool,Great place to visit. Beautiful location. It is highly recommend to arrive around 7 pm to watch the sunset and then observe the stars via the numerous telescopes. Very crowded. Parking is hard to come by. Best to drop family off near the top (they will have to walk 1000 yards) and then have one member park the car and walk up from parking g area (10-15 min walk).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2DavidF
50,Wonderful views,The parking was very tricky since it was nighttime and they had a reserved area. We ended up parallel parking along the road with the rest of the crowd. It was a very long walk to the actual observatory but it worked out and was a peaceful walk. When we got there it was an amazing view. We went up the stairs and took a bunch of pictures. I'd go again to see what it looks like during the day time hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crimsonrika
40,Interesting museum,"If you are interested in the solar system, the cosmos and what that's all about Griffith Observatory is a good place to visit. There is a lot to see, we stopped off on a one day LA day tour and I will go back to see more of the exhibits and the planetarium. Our tour only gave us 40 minutes at this venue but it has a lot to see that takes more time, so recommend you plan for 3 hours or 4. Great views of LA and the ""Hollywood"" sign. Recommended..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franke561
50,Unique LA,if you're visiting the Observatory be prepared for huge crowds. This place is a real favorite among natives and tourists alike. Lots of families but also lots of young couples and singles. Public programs fill up way in advance. Parking is a bit of a nightmare. At night you'll have to park and take a shuttle. Still all the trouble is worth it. The setting is gorgeous and the exhibits make it more than worthwhile. And.......it's free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyP868
50,Fun and Informative!,"Fun and informative small science/space museum. The parking is limited so be prepared to walk 0.5 - 1 miles (worth it). This is a great place to relax and have a beautiful view of the city, as well as learn/review some basics about the universe. I bet kids go on field trips, but it could be good for families as well. I went on a date and although we knew the majority of information, it was still really fun! Can be done solo or in conjunction with a hike in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975steffa
50,Knowledge centre,"We went there on a 90deg hot weather day. But it was worth it. You should visit this place. You would learn plenty of things. No parking in the area, so you should walk a bit to reach the observatory. Free entrance, except if you want to see the show. Just $7 per adult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertMadi
50,"Great view, awesome planetarium show!",Had a great time walking around the park and looking through the space info. Watched the stargazing/planetarium show for a really good price! Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorR1078
50,Beautiful Sunset Views!,"We came May 2017 to California and had to come see this. Our friend from Palmdale drove us up to the Observatory which she noted was much busier than before. She thought perhaps since La La Land the tourism has picked up. She dropped us off and waited for us to be done. You get beautiful views of LA and the Hollywood sign from this hill. It's a great spot for sunset, and many were even having a picnic on the lawn there. We didn't end up going into the Planetarium as we had just missed the start of the show and were not interested in the next viewing. There are some really neat things to look at inside, but we probably enjoyed the views outside more. They also had telescopes set up you could stand in line to look through them (we did not). All in all we were there just over an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tatijanap

50,LA's heart,"Draped on top of the Hollywood hills site the beautiful white building with its distinctive domed roof, from Hollywood Bld, the LA freeways around you can see this building proudly perched and overlooking the city of LA.Up close its even better, a small hike up Griffith park or hop on the DASH bus from sunset/Vermont station. the view is extraordinary, you can see for miles! downtown, Beverly hills, Santa Monica, the Hollywood sign, the exhibition inside is free and so informative of the history of the observatory. I highly recommended visiting here to see some of LA's best history and to of course get a snap of the famous Hollywood sign.enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesnB8039SE
40,Get here early,"The car park and surrounding areas fill up very quickly so get here early. The observatory is positioned on top of a hill and the views of LA and surrounds are superb. Also, the 360 degree film in the auditorium depicting the stars is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TopcatChris
50,Fabolous view and very interesting show,"The Griffith Observatorium is located on top of a hill. You can see Los Angeles city, the Hollywood sign and the Pacific Ocean on a Clear day. Very interesting exhibitions, and not expensive. Do not miss the lightning machine and the show",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anea660
50,"Great views, amazing exhibits, free !!! (parking is a challenge)","I went to the observatory with the family in May 2017 and felt that it was worth the trip. However, please keep in mind that it is very crowded in the summer, and parking is limited in the observatory parking lot so you may have park in a lower level parking lot and take the bus(you need cash for the bus) . But overall, it was worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeninT488
50,LA's Pride,"Living here in LA since 1988, I'm proud if Griffith park. It is one of my favorite place... to go just to relax and enjoy the magnificent view of Los Angeles, the HOLLYWOOD sign, nature at its best... I have brought friends, family, guests here so many times.Now that I have grandchildren, I bring them here to have fun and enjoy what I have enjoyed thru the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brillobeatriz
50,Best spot in L.A.,Awesome experience without being too pricy. Lots of places to explore inside... the tesla coil is awesome! Great place to wander around.If you come before sunset and stay through... you can see/photograph the city as the sun sets and the lights come up. It's stunning.Often they will have telescopes set up outside that you can look through and see the celestial show.Avoid holidays and weekends if you can. It will be packed and there is not much parking. It can be quite a hike to walk up when the parking is full down to the main road. So depending on physical fitness and/or weather... it may or may not be a hike that you would enjoy. There are also many trails to hike once you are there if you are up for it.I'm serious about avoiding holidays though... you can easily just get trapped in gridlock driving through the park and end up not being able to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/name303
50,World famous and Amazing Views!,"This place has always been amazing and more so now with renovations. However, the grounds have become extremely more busy through out the year, but well worth the trip to Griffith Park and the Observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shayokd
50,Beautiful inside and out.,"The history is amazing, the views are breathtaking, the observatory is beautiful inside and out. We also enjoyed the museum in the basement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryP772
50,Fantastic day,"This was one of ""out of the world"" experiences. This is worth the visit whilst in LA. There is just so much to discover about the solar system plus you get lovely views of the city from up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286luckyl
10,"Is this a good place to visit when in LA? If you can find parking, it might be.","Like so many others here, we suffered through mid-week LA traffic to get to this place only to site in a long line of cars looking for a place to park. There is one way in...and one way out. So once you're in line, forget trying to turn around. The road is partially 2 lanes to the top, then log jams to one lane at the top. We noticed quite a few empty spaces but they were all marked ""authorized parking only"" and roped off. Taking the exit and going back to the bottom, we passed more empty spaces along the road, but these too were marked ""authorized"". Parking at the bottom and taking the shuttle up is an option, but after a long wait the bus that made the stop we were waiting at was already full. Besides, the bus has to wait in the same line to the Observatory. We were going to walk up, but after a few hundred yards we deemed that to be a bit dangerous as cars went flying past and you're pretty much walking in the road. Unfortunately, there is no staircase or wakway directly from the lower parking areas to the Observatory...which would make a lot of sense. We pretty much wasted more than a couple of hours to see nothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ply72rr
40,"Amazing views of Hollywood, a lot to see for free","This is an amazing site in the L.A. area, and it's not to be missed if you are in Burbank or Hollywood. We went on a lark during the busiest weekend (July 4). With patience we were still able to find parking. The greatest thing about this is that it's mostly free. You can walk in, walk around, check out the exhibits and not spend money. SO rare for L.A. area. The biggest asset is the view of the city below. Truly breathtaking and so, SO close to the iconic Hollywood sign.The only downside and reason for the 4 stars (instead of 5) is the fact that this place is painfully crowded and parking is a real bear. With patience and time, you can overcome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwinlyngar
40,"Visited on a very hot, sunny day in July when it was very busy and almost unparkable!",Very interesting exhibits and the Planneterium experience was exceptional and unmissable.If you are oldies like ourselves arrive early to get a high parking spot otherwise the walk up can be formidable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/291JohnB
50,Great views of LA,This is a must do attraction in Los Angeles. The drive up to the hills is pretty easy and there is sufficient parking spots to park and walk up to the observatory. The observatory itself is pretty cool with a interesting pendulum but definitely go for the views and for the pictures...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler
40,Classic L.A. Find,"Spring Break found my husband and I visiting this Los Angeles location. I had not been here for about 20 years but ever since the remodeling, and because of my love of all things outer space, the husband and I had to visit. The main structure exterior looked the same. The interior still maintained the 1930s flooring and mouldings around the displays. Very much the art deco architectural look. It's a lovely art form that represents a very structured look but that appeals to me. The star gazing theatres are incredible. The acoustics are vibrant np matter where you sit. We saw two shots in the domed theaters. The season's and constellations were almost dizzying but enthralling. The artwork on the main rotunda was beautiful and extremely well-maintained. A must see. The only issue we encountered was the parking situation. It is so limited and packed with traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciamM8221JF
50,Walked to the top,We parked at the bottom of the hill and walked up to the observatory more for the view of LA than the place itself. It's all worth it and the walk is a great way to avoid the traffic queues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellE7404VT
40,The views and the information that I gained was inspirational.,"This is one of the most Iconic landmarks in Los Angeles. For good reason, the history of this monument alone is worth exploring when you get there. The views of LA and the surrounding area are some of the best offered by this public forum. The architecture of the era of Art Deco is obvious all through the building. Spending time in the Observatory itself is a wonderful exploration of the constellations and the planets in our solar system. The information at the Observatory is both entertaining and enlightening. I would say always arrive early as parking is limited and the roads are not perfect for parking down from the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crashmav
50,Family fun for the science/space fans!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful architecture besides the plethora of information that the observatory has available. I went to the demonstration of how to make a comet, and it was quite interesting, and fun...also was free. Parking is a bad only because so many want to enjoy this beautiful place. There is a great museum that's free, as well as the demonstration was free. It is a reasonable place to attend. If you are lucky to get parking, it's only $4, and the only other cost would be the films if one would want to watch them. They have a variety of things to do at the park on different days (or evenings). Be sure to check their schedules for their interesting events. They have something for everyone. Be sure to visit the gift shop as well. You can also see the historic Hollywood sign from the observatory...an added bonus.They have so many informative areas, and this is a must for your science/space geeks in your family! Loved it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurerdreams
50,Fun Visit!,This is a nice family friendly venue. There is so much to discover with kids and at the same time have a lot of fun.And if you and your love ones feel the need for a sandwich or snack go to the West part of the building where you can find something to drink or eat for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/35marvc
40,"""Griffith Observatory"" another must see Los Angeles Landmark","Visiting Los Angeles?, to complete your sight seeing, I do recommend visiting Griffith Observatory.So many Hollywood movies were shot inside and around the Observatory.Adults and young children can tour, learn and enjoy the scientific and educational displays inside.

50,A MUST SEE in L.A. at night,We drove up to the Griffith Observatory after dinner to see the spectacular light of Los Angeles on a clear night in July. We went about a half hour before the park closes (closes at 10pm) and that was just enough time to enjoy the view and snap some pics! If you are a La La Land fan this is a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanc4540
50,"Went for the hike, stayed for the observatory","Go early in the morning if driving to find space. Also this time of year is hot. Plus, the hikes may be busy.

50,Great place to spend half a day and have overview of LA.,"We live in Los Angeles and have visited Griffith Observatory many times with our guests from overseas. Every time I visited I learned something new at the observatory.Plus there is picnic area outside, plenty of parking on weekday mornings.There is also a hike that can take you higher elevation for even fantastic view. There is a cafe outside to take a break from a hike.Must visit if in LA.Better to check website for open hours, tours and parking info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fellowtraveller688
50,gorgeous views,"I love hiking up to the observatory and taking pictures all over this beautiful museum. There is something here for everyone. I wouldn't say this is a place to say the entire day, but a great few hours. Go in the morning, afternoon and/or evening and you get completely different photos and views. =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/estherb687
50,Great place to take pictures,It was a little crowded but what a beautiful place to take pictures. Day was clear and found parking fast. Will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180maritzaa
50,"Oh my gosh, I love this place!","Beautiful views of so much. The museum is fun especially if you are a science nerd (and even if you are not)! There are so many places to walk. Parking can be a challenge depending on the time of day you go. Visit during the day or at night. Both are exceptional, unique experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NayNay_Carlos
50,Griffith Observatory,"Since I love stuff like this, I don't know what to say.If enjoy obtain information about the stars and solar systems, you will really enjoy this. If not, I still think it is fun to see at least once. You will enjoy the museum downstairs.On the con side, I don't like the parking situation. Very limited parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcopQ2910OR
50,one of our favorite weekend spots!,Hiking up to observatory and eating at trails afterward is one of our favorite past times- then we hit up the carousel/ pony rides and choo choo train. Fun for all ages. The observatory itself is great for date nights - get there before sunset for best views in the city then look up at the stars and watch l.a. light up at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsoley
50,Never disappoints!,"Besides being a historical must in Los Angeles, the Griffith Observatory is a place that is fun for all and at anytime of the day. I've been here several times with guests from all over the world and the Griffith Observatory never disappoints!If you can come at night then you get to see the stars or you can come during the day and see the view of the city and on a clear day see the ocean! Be sure to allow enough time to catch one of the short film screenings and if time permits walk one of the nearby trails.Parking is limited so if you are visiting during peak hours be ready for a walk up a somewhat steep incline. Overall let your inner child be free to explore the wanders beyond this world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gogovinda108
50,After hours for sunset!,We visited the Griffith Observatory while the Observatory itself was closed as we wanted to take in the views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign and enjoy the sunset. The traffic through Griffith Park getting to the Observatory can be nightmarish. We gave up on our first attempt but made it through on our second. I'm glad we did. The grounds and building are beautiful and the views are incredible. Definitely include in your timeline a half-hour or so in just driving through Griffith Park to reach the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88tarat
50,Great views.,You can see many interesting things about the skies here. However if you walk around outside you can see the Hollywood sign and views of Los Angeles. It's good for an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misanu33
50,Best Night Time View of LA Basin,"If you were disappointed by the lack of ""sparkle"" on Hollywood Blvd, I cannot recommend enough going up to Griffith Observatory in the evening. The observatory offers an incredible night time view of the LA basin. You won't be disappointed. You can also take advantage of the free public telescopes to spot real stars!And if you're looking for a fun and educational place to take the kids, you can't beat the observatory. There are plenty of FREE activities and I've always found the staff to be incredibly information and engaging. The Planetarium is especially cool.Disclaimer: I proposed to my wife on the back deck of the observatory, so I may be a bit biased :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waterspit
40,Great museum with an even better view,"This is a legit museum with free admission. Optional is to see a Planetarium show (extra cost about $15-20 if I remember correctly. Worth seeing the show once, but it can definitely get pricey if you have the whole family in tow. Nice grassy area out front for you to relax and eat snacks. There is a cafe with a gorgeous view of Griffith Park with your average cafe/snack type foods. Parking can get super crowded during peak times like summer and when there is an astrology event (like an eclipse etc.).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATravel12345
50,Beautiful!,Beautiful views and incredible science! Love this place! It is one of my must visit sites when I have visitors in town and giving them a tour of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hizstories
40,Must see in LA,"When you think about famous landmarks in LA, this is near the top of the list. From the outside views, the planetarium, exhibits, the Hollywood sign, and nearby trails, it's a must see if you've never been. Parking can be an issue on nice days so plan accordingly. We made it through in a couple of hours and even went to the planetarium. Great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnP247
50,"""Stellar"" Experience across the board","The observatory has become more crowded over the last few years, but don't let that keep you from visiting. As a matter of fact, you can plan an entire day to visit. Aside from the museum, which can take you anywhere between 2 and 4 hours, if you're immersed in the interactive exhibits, there are several new films to see in the theater, and the planetarium shows never fails to impress. On the First Friday of every month there is a free lecture series with top scientists sharing the latest discoveries in space that is always fascinating. There are several hikes you can take that start and end at observatory and a cafeteria to eat at. Once the sun finally sets (it happens nightly), it is not uncommon to find members of the Sidewalk Astronomers with huge telescopes pointed at Saturn of the Orion Nebula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soulart99
50,A Los Angeles Icon You Can't Miss,"There are definitely ""better"" planetariums elsewhere in the world, but taken as a whole, the Griffith Observatory is an experience like no other. It ranges from very old-school pleasures like the Tesla coil and gravity clock, to state-of-the-art interactive displays. The planetarium show itself is a combination of both: live narration by a real person, combined with current star-show tech. And then there's the special magic the place holds for movie and TV fans, with so many classics having been filmed on location here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywoodRichard
50,Beautiful Location,"Came here for 4th of July. What a great experience. In addition to the usual telescopes, there where 3 others set up to look at the moon, Jupiter and Saturn.

50,A Must-See Classic,The iconic Griffith Observatory is a must-see stop for any tourist coming to L.A. It's classic design and amazing views have been featured in countless movies. You really only need about an hour to see everything. On a nice day you can combine this with a hike in Griffith Park for a great day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeInWeHo
50,Beautiful / Hermosa vista,"We couldn't spend too much time and even though it was a very foggy day it was still worth the trip. I would love to return on sunset or to do hiking as we saw so many people taking advantage. That's in addition to the architectural gifts of it's building. I'll return for more...Muy a pesar de no haber podido estar mucho tiempo y el día no estar claro, la vista fue hermosa, además el edificio de por sí es muy bueno para tomas fotos Me gustaría regresar a ver un atardecer desde allá arriba o poder caminar por los alrededores como hacían muchos visitantes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mamina3
50,Do not miss the museum downstairs,"Our family of five, kids ages 15, 12 and 9 visited the Griffith Observatory in June 2017. It was an excellent choice to wear our sneakers because it was quite a hike from our parking space to the observatory. What a wonderful man Griffith Griffith was, to donate the land and ensure that everyone could witness the heavens through a telescope. We stood in line to see Jupiter through the original telescope Mr. Griffith had installed in the observatory for the public. The exhibits explaining all aspects of earth relative to space--seasons, tides, lunar phases, etc., and the development of telescopes and the types of waves were excellent. Our favorite part was downstairs, where each planet was modeled to scale. Each planet had lots of information and a scale to weigh ourselves to see the differences in each planet's gravitation pull. There was an entire wall made of a photograph of the night sky, showing all of the stars and planets we can see, which are only a very small amount of all that exist. The movie narrated by Leonard Nimoy about the building itself was entertaining as well as informative. Very cool place to visit for space buffs of any age!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X1513WDlisac
50,Awesome and free!!!,This was my second visit in 2 years.Great views of the city and overall enjoyable night. Cafe is a nice break from the cool air and has a variety of food and snacks.Parking can be very tough and can include longs walks up the mountain if your not lucky enough to park on top.It appears several buses drop visitors off and unsure if they are apart of a tour group or if a bus service runs from the bottom of the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonerbandit
50,Must visit place for visitors,The observatory is free for visitors. The staff sets up a number of telescopes for viewing a particular celestial object. Parking is about a mile away down the hill. A bus ferries visitors to the observatory. Parking is awailable at the observatory itself but is very limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/600shyams

20,Major major traffic,"Went to see the observatory and without any warning spent 2 hours in traffic just leading up to it with no parking and poor management they could have at least stopped letting people in, LAPD truck at the bottom of hill they could have had traffic stopped from entering knowing they had way too many people and cars in the park, was worse than rush hour on the freeway never got to see the observatory im sure it was great two thumbs down for park management",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingfamily1996

40,Amazing views!!,"We could not believe the views from the observatory! Just amazing. You also have a view of the Hollywood sign in the distance. Very crowded driving up to the observatory. Parking at the top is challenging. There is a shuttle at the bottom of the mountain that will take you to the top. Bathrooms are available, as well as bottled drinks for purchase.

50,Unexpectedly Entertaining,"We went primarily to do a hike up to and down from the observatory. I hadn't actually given the observatory itself much thought and didn't know what to expect, especially since it was during the day. It was crowded and I was very happy not to be driving up in the traffic and trying to find a place to park. The observatory has done a great job creating engaging and informative displays. We really enjoyed the experience, and the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksprott
50,Amazing place,"Put aside the fact La La Land was filmed there (!) and have a good look inside the observatory, it's brilliantly done and very interesting. Views outside are also amazing.

50,Excellent view!,"Visiting this place is something is a must if you visit Los Angeles. The view is great, it's free and totally worth it. Parking is a problem because there is not, but you can park outside without paying 4 dollars but you must walk uphill depending on where you park. There is so much to learn in this place. Outside you have the opportunity to see the Hollywood sign and the city of Los Angeles. Highly Recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melarreolar81
50,Fun place to visit,I love to visit the Observatory. I brought my family for the first time and the kids loved it just as much as I do. It was a lot of fun to go through all of the exhibits. The biggest hit was the scales to see your weight on each planet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la_womn
50,A must see place in LA,"This is a free space science museum which can be visited during day for many of their science exhibits and evening for sky view. There is also an IMAX theater and cafeteria. We watched 'Centered in the Universe' in the IMAX theatre and the presentation was excellent. There are also live demonstrations and interactive exhibits that can be enjoyed by the whole family. For the price of nothing, it is a great place to spend 4 to 5 hrs thanks to the charitable contributions of visionaries like Griffith.You can get a great view of Hollywood sign and Los Angeles city from this hill. A walk to Hollywood hills and back will take about 4 hrs. Be prepared with water and something to protect you from the unrelenting sun as there is very little shade along the trail. The walk is of moderate difficulty as you are climbing a small hill in hot sun, but it should be manageable for most people.The difficult part is parking, particularly in the morning hours on weekends. You can find parking on the sides of road if you are willing to walk a bit. Allow some time to find a parking spot. It will cost you $4. There is no public transportation to this place, but you can find taxi rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sub580
40,Worth a visit for the view alone,"Nice spot to see the sun go down, use the DASH bus to get up and back, cheap, great view of LA and the Hollywood sign.Great end of day activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottb869

30,Kind of neat...,"We stumbled upon this place following directions from Google on where to best view the Hollywood sign. Although the view of the sign was great, it was from quite a long distance away. The sign shows up as very tiny in our pictures from here. Other than our original purpose for going here being kind of disappointing, the view of LA was spectacular, and parking wasn't too much of a rip-off...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventurerRich
50,Awesome view!,"Even if you don't go into the observatory, the view from outside is amazing. I wish I could have spent more time here. There are also lots of hiking trails nearby. So plan on spending a couple of hours at least. But like other reviewers mention, the traffic is nuts. I got lucky and found a parking spot. But I would recommend taking a bus, cab, or Uber instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImaPickyTraveller
40,Impressive!,"Had some mid-morning time on our hands so we picked this over the Getty. The drive there was beautiful, with gorgeous homes in the adjoining neighborhoods. Arrived around 11:15. We were lucky to get a great parking spot with just a short walk up top. Impressive views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Doors opened at noon. Once inside the real magic began. They have a working Tesla coil, a camera obscura, an early telescope and an incredible planetarium show on water in the universe. Good luck with parking in the late afternoon. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMSCHO23
40,Beautiful Views of LA for the price of parking,"The worst part of visiting is finding a park. I think it was $4. We went shortly after it opened at 10am. Many people appeared to have been hiking. The inside part did not take long to look at, but the admission price cannot be complained about. We mostly just enjoyed all the beautiful views even though it was not a very clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyw2012
50,Amazing!,"This is a must see place if you visit LA. It has great views of the city and it is also very entertaining as well as educational. Kids have a great time there. Parking can be a little tight specially if you go on a popular day, but it is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starfoxxx
50,A must for LA 1st Timers,"I came here the very first time I visit LA, and it was a great introduction to the city. You can see the landscape of the city, the Hollywood sign, and it's just a cool spot all by itself. Get there early! And expect an uphill walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jordana
40,Great views especially around sunset,The observatory is great. When we went there were people that work there out on the lawn around sunset letting people look through telescopes at Jupiter. Be aware it's very crowded the closer you come to sunset though and parking is limited so get there early or you will have trouble with parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrew752017
50,Great views of the city,"This place is a great free attraction. The car park does charge, but you can legally and safely park on the approach road which is only a 5 minute walk away.The gardens are manicured and are a nice relaxing place to picnic or just stroll around with great views of LA and the Hollywood sign.The observatory buildings are striking Art Deco designs and access to and on top of them is free. The rooftop provides wonderful views on all sides. It was our favourite place in LA and it was free - we were so pleased we nearly tap danced like Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling!! Well, maybe not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672WayneS
40,"Great hike, great views, big crowds :(","We parked at the bottom of the mountain, where the trail begins. The hike up to Griffith Observatory is about 30 mins or so, and is fairly easy (not recommended for elderly or young children, bring a good pair of walking shoes). As other people have mentioned, the observatory itself is very crowded and chaotic. I would recommend going at a known time when it is not so busy. Although the area around the observatory offers some great views, the hike continues upwards to even more spectacular 360 degree viewing. Worth it for the hike, if thats your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pyramid_livin
50,Much more to see than we expected!,"We took the reviewers' advice here and hiked up the hill after parking our car. We took the short-cut which was through sandy slopes (don't wear white sneakers!) but it was a nice hike even with a young child. Once at the top, we took in the best sweeping view of LA! I would highly recommend that you go there for the sunset - it's very romantic. We were surprised to see that there were lots of interesting things to see inside - facts and information on our galaxy, the sun, moon and stars, etc. I wasn't expecting it'd be educational, too so that's a huge bonus. It's an observatory for both adults and kids. We ended up staying there for only 2-3 hours including the round-trip hikes, definitely needed more time than that if you wish to see everything inside including the shows and all exhibits. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NawalL
30,Massive traffic jam and so much smog,It took forever to get parked on a Friday afternoon just to get some pics of the smoggy Hollywood sign and downtown LA area. $4 to park and we were there no time. Not sure why everyone comes here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RestaurantBully
50,Awesome at Night,"You have to go the Griffith Observatory at night! It is Outstanding. Watch out for crowds, however. There is a bus service from the bottom of access road for @ 50 cents each way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airlinefamily36
20,Parking is a Problem,Attempted to visit on a Sunday afternoon. Waited in line for 20-30 minutes and never found a place to park. Highly disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cekane89
40,An important place to go in Hollywood,We wanted to see the Hollywood sign which was clearly visible from the lab. We wanted to see the movie but were too late for one and had to leave to go to the airport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prasan68
50,Awesomeness,Well worth it! Hard finding a spot but even finding one and having to make the dangerous walk to the building is worth it. Great views of the Hollywood sign and just California in general. All free. Inside is nice. The kids loved learning about earth. 100% recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDad84
40,Griff,We went here early and got here when it opened on a weekend. It was already busy by 10am. We looked through the astrological exhibits and thought about seeing a planetarium show but it was so crowded we decided to enjoy the grounds instead. There is a path that takes you to the Hollywood sign and you can also see the Hollywood sign from afar from many places around the Griffith observatory. You can walk up on the roof for more views of LA and beyond if it is clear. It was not clear enough when we were there. I'd like to be here at night to use the telescope on a clear night someday. We parked by the Greek theater where parking was free and walked up. Enjoyed the views on the way up. Parking at the top seemed limited to handicapped spots and staff. I saw a sign that they charged for parking ahead so that is why we parked where we did. I am not sure if that is so or not as it was not clear to me as we walked up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sutrotower
40,Worth the parking,"Yes, parking is terrible, yes it is crowded, and yes it is worth the visit. The observatory didn't open until 12:00 and that is when the meters start charging. We were lucky and got curb side parking right in front of the line. The charge for the planetarium was very very reasonable and the show was narrated live. Excellent performance. Lots of free exhibits and of course the views were awesome. Too bad the pollution is so bad it was haze. I remember visiting it as a child and what a thrill to take my girls. As soon as we drove up, they recognized it from the movie La La Land.I would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriasH7135RB
40,Fun and space sience for free,"We had not planned to visit this place, but we were glad we did. However we might have choosen another day than a sunday. It was crowded. Hard to find parking even with parking assistents. They apparently don't communicate with eachother, so we (and everybody else) spent a lot more time looking for a parkinglot then necessary. Inside we were lucky to get tickets to one of the shows inside the dome. That was awsome! The exhibitions was interesting, and the view was stunning. But stay away from the cafeteria. The food there was awful and the area a mess. We also did get the oportunity to gace in a telescope to the moon. Long lines and waiting for all of the telescopes. We stayed until sunset. That was just beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeKv
50,Wow,"Great view, nice little hike and science geeks in family loved it plus now we have to watch rebel without a cause",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676mrh
40,Great Views,"This was on our must see list and for good reason. The views were great and the exhibits were interesting. My teenage boys loved it, especially see the Tesla Coil.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clm863
30,Crowded observatory,"We visited the Griffith Observatory on June 21, 2017. The internet said it opened at 12 noon but when we got there at 11:45 A.M. the streets leading up to the observatory were already packed with cars and people. Many people had to walk way up the hill in the summer heat to get to the planetarium. The observatory was free but the crowds were so heavy that it was difficult to enjoy the many exhibits and shows at this wonderful location. Our suggestion is that the materials put out by the observatory do not mislead you to think getting there at noon is the right time. Perhaps the movie ""La La Land"" has lead many more people to go up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0semary66
50,A surprising highlight.,"This was somewhere we hadn't really intended to visit, but so glad we did. If we found it interesting then it will blow your mind if you're interested in science and astronomy. We got tickets for one of the shows and it was fascinating. Would highly recommend. Parking is an issue if car park at top is full. You just keep having to drive round waiting for a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1660QDhelens
50,Worth the night view!,"Went during the sunset and it was beautiful. There was a lot of traffic on the way up to the observatory, so we decided to get out of our Lyft and walk the rest of the way up, and we ended up seeing some amazing views. It was very crowded but we were still able to explore around fairly easily. Our visit was only for about 90 minutes, and it was enough time, but it would have been nice to stay longer. It gets a little chilly up on the roof.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishelle719
30,Griffith Observatory,All I can say for Griffith Park Observatory is they need more parking we tried two different days and neither time could we get even close to the observatory so I really can't tell you how it actually is. The two pictures are from the road and that's where the traffic had ended as far as people parking on the side of the road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryt9596
40,Totally packed,It was so crowded and the traffic up to the observatory was insane just to get a shot of the Hollywood sign. Get on Sunset Blvd for a good shot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591debl
50,Best West Coast Sunset,"Everyone should go up to the Griffith Observatory during the sunset. It is beautiful. Also, the view of the Hollywood sign, the Los Angeles Area and the city lights is amazing.Must Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518calvint
50,Great attraction,Had to kill some time before my flight back to Chicago. The walk up to the observatory was very scenic the mountains the valley breathtaking. You can see the famous Hollywood sign in the distance. No charge for admission to look at the exciting attractions. There was a small fee to watch the show in the planetarium. I would go again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richzemail
30,An hour waiting on the bus back,Don't go here if there is a concert on nearby as the bus was stuck in traffic and we had to wait for an hour before it made it to the attraction to collect us. The weather had changed that evening and it was very unpleasant to wait in the cold for a bus!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5516BKlouiseh
50,Beautiful early summer twilight visit,"Took an visit to the Griffith Observatory the first night of our first visit ever to LA. We drove up with a friend who picked us up and parked in the $4/hour area, which was worth it. Absolutely magnificent views around the city and of the Hollywood sign, we were able to watch the sun set behind the hills nearby. Mid-June weather, crystal clear, not too hot or too cold. The exhibits in the Observatory were maybe one degree less than the finer Natural Sciences museum, but not by much and it would be a fine diversion for a few hours on any other day. We pretty much breezed through the museum proper but would have stayed longer if circumstances had allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryw607
50,#VIEWS,"I thoroughly enjoyed Griffith Observatory. The views over the LA metropolis are quite something. The museum is very interesting - and free! And, time permitting, there are plenty of hiking trails in the hills around the observatory.Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshAFC
30,Underwhelmed with it all,I have to say ranked so high was expecting more. It is crowded and hard to get in and out of. If you have to park at the bottom of the hill figure it is a nice hike just to see it. No direction to the flow of visitors so trying to see the displays can be difficult. If you are very nerdy or like the educational side great. If you are a hiker great but average teens can last about 10 minutes there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546jts
50,Must see,This was my favorite experience in LA. I love looking down on the city. The views are one of a kind. And all the information inside the observatory is fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaysNuts
50,A must do,"A scenic drive through Griffith Park starts off the adventure. There is parking up at the top by the observatory however, we were lucky to find parking on the feeder road and then we walked up. The views along the hike were great, the views from the observatory itself are amazing. The show regarding the renovation of the observatory was informative and interesting. Take some time to wander through the exhibits and take in the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormLWat
50,Educational,"Nice view of LA many things to learn about the planets and the universe, inventions and researches, a perfect place for kids and adults",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harouts20
50,Best views at dusk,"Grab a pizza and a beverage and head up to Griffith Observatory at dusk. You might have to walk a little way from the car, but the view as the night lights of LA come to life, make this a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7743CKkarenp
30,Stunning views of the city,We visited when the observatory was closed. But the trip to the top was worth it because of the beautiful views of the city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RochelleF7781
40,Good experience,"Hello, car park area is limited and 4$ per hour. It was full in weekday. Traffic staffs give directio to roadside but it bacame very long tail. It is better to put the car in the beginning of the park and take the shuttle bus. For the observatory it was amazing. You can see there also HOLLYWOOD sign. Enjoy...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cagrih2016
50,LA Perfection,"This is one of those LA spots, when you get here you realize that you've been here 100's of times in the movies. It cost us nothing to park and walk around taking in spectacular views of the city. We'd love to go back again for events, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goesaroundcomesaroun
50,So interesting,Came to LA to see this was even better than expected. The park it's self has fantastic views and walking trails even get to see the Hollywood sign. Very busy even weekdays huge car park was organised fills up quickly. Took the Dash bus from Vermont/Sunset station takes you right to the observerty. More to the observatory than first appears free to walk around. The Lenoard Nimoy 25min documentary was very interesting. Even if space is not your thing this is a great place to visit. Closed on Mondays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123LS
50,Simply Beautiful!,The views are breath taking and all the trails make for lots of fun getting the perfect picture! a much see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514melissat
20,TRAFFIC!!!!,I recently visited the Los Angeles area on vacation. I am originally from LA and would frequently visit the observatory as a teenager. I was very disappointed with the amount of traffic to get up to the observatory and once you finally reach the observatory there is no where to park. FYI......don't park on the road like most people do.....they will give you a ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anao804
40,Free and Fun!,"Really enjoyed this. Would recommend getting the bus as the traffic is a nightmare. It only costs 50c and leaves from outside a metro station. I went about 5pm and the crowds had calmed a bit so was able to get some fantastic photos. The exhibits inside are mostly free and great for a budding astronomer. I got to look through a telescope and saw Jupiter! Great for the views if nothing else and is a cheap, fun activity in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BexBennett9
50,Great to see and enjoy,"Interesting place, history science and fun for all, only cost is the parking or a 50 cent shuttle. Lovely sunsets and free use of telescopes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisandJulieM
40,best view of LA,"This is by far the best place to view the city at mornings, nights and evenings. The planetarium and grounds are free to the public. It really deserves a 5 Star review but I only gave it a 4 because parking is a nightmare. There just aren't enough spaces to accommodate the heavy traffic. Which leaves people parking along the side of the roads. My parents are 70 years old and definitely cannot walk up to the observatory half a mile away. LOL. Go during the week, Monday-Wednesday to avoid the weekend rush.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25huyd
50,A Great Place for Science or James Fran Fans,This place has been around LA for a very long time. The Good news is that it has been very nicely remodeled. The displays are interesting and is a good place to take the kids and family to. The only problem is that parking can be difficult as it is on a hill.So I suggest that you come early. It is also very warm here during the Summer and early Fall.Also the view on a clear day is just awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,Perfect view,Griffith observatory houses some great attractions like the pendulum and the tesla coil + planetary science facts. Be sure to check out the view of Los Angeles by walking the terrace all way round outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mathiasd862
40,Great view!,One of the best touristy attractions in Hollywood. Better to visit right after rain so the smog isn't covering half the city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Primula555
50,The best view in LA!,"For locals and tourists alike the view from Griffith Park Observatory is by far the most breath taking in LA-I know I live here. Not only the views but the amazing hiking trails you can take from this location, get to understand the true expanse of LA in all is glory-enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3250XHannaf
50,Relaxing,I been coming to this place since 1988 it's been one of my favorites places to go the the feeling to interact with nature and science!I will definitely recommend this place after 5pm so you can see the beautiful view while the sunset takes place!!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/169nrr
50,Amazing,Super nice view .. you can parkYour car in the end of hill and not in the way like everyone does .. the parking is US4 for 1 hour and the entrance is free if you don't go to the planetarium ( US 7) museum is amazing and you can learn even about solar sistem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ontheroadb
30,What a view,"We visited the observatory after the zoo. Not too easy to get in and out of if you are driving but we took an uber. Amazing view. Crowded!! Visit at night, so you can look.our the telescope... bummed we didn't realized that beforw",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ak_childs
40,Iconic Location Has Great Views But Is Crowded,"This is an popular location that has been in many movies and television shows. It's a beautiful Art Deco style building perched on the pinnacle of a mountain in Griffith Park, so you can see for many miles if the weather is clear. The Hollywood sign is visible from here, and the downtown L.A. skyline. Admission to the observatory and telescopes is free, but planetarium programs cost extra. Admission to Griffith Park is also free, but they do charge for parking near the observatory ($4/hour) and space is limited. We went early on a Saturday before the observatory opened. We arrived about 8:30am and it was already very congested. They do have handicapped parking spaces available if they aren't full. If you are physically able, it's possible to park at the bottom of the hill by the Greek Theatre and hike or bike up. There is also a public DASH Observatory bus that runs about every 20 minutes from the Vermont/Sunset Metro station for 50 cents. Expect crowds and bus tours and try to go early on a weekday. There is a public restroom near the parking area that is separate from the Observatory (for when it isn't open).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
50,Fantastic view of Los Angeles,"Great, I could have spent hours up here, but you need a long telephoto lens to get a good picture of the Hollywood Sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurdickens
50,A must see in L.A.!,"A must see in LA, get there early and parking isn't an issue. Such breathtaking views of both the city and the Hollywood sign! Such a beautiful building and surrounding areas. Bring walking shoes and you can hike down to Griffith park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyno39
50,Very cool! Good time for all ages.,I was in LA for a few days during a business trip and only had time time for a few fun things so of course I had to check out the legendary Giffith Observatory! General admission is free but for a small fee you can view a presentation in the planetarium/imax theatre which was so worth it! My favorite part about the Griffith Observatory is definitely the views of LA. I hiked the trail to get to the observatory on foot and highly recommend anyone physically able to do so! It really made the views at the observatory that much more awesome for me. Great day time excursion for a first time visitor to LA. I will be back :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammeir
50,Amazing,Amazing views of Los Angeles! Only regret is not having enough time to spend here. The shows in the planetarium are interesting and child friendly. There are many things to do here and there is a very inexpensive shuttle bus from the red line train stop at Sunset & Vermont. One of our family's favorite events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LB91068
50,Gina and I,it was a nice visit accept my fiance fell while running in the rain We enjoyed looking inside and outside the Griffith observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marc4747
40,At least it looked interesting on the outside....,"I took a bus tour to see the Observatory and Hollywood sign. The park guards only give buses a 5 minute time zone, which had I have known I wouldn't have bothered with the trip. I would get an Uber to drop me off, go and take photos, have a look at the observatory at my leisure and then get an Uber back. If there is more than one member in your party this will work out cheaper, I am sure and at least you will actually get to see what you came for, instead of going to all that trouble of hotel pick ups, office drop offs to check paperwork and wasting time waiting for someone to finish their toilet break. UBER IT",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63

50,A must if traveling to LA,"I grew up in LA and never tire of visiting the observatory. This is my favorite place to take out of town visitors. I recommend it to young and old alike. This is a great place if you like science, history, architecure, nature or juat beautiful scenery. There are shows, experiments, hands on fun. There places to eat and just relax, too. The only negative is the parking situation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel72
50,Griffith observatory,"We went to the observatory one afternoon near the end of our trip, we had to hike up a hill which for us both Asthma sufferers was a trek but a trek well worth it when we got to the top, the observatory itself is a great looking building with some breathtaking views of the city, also a great place to get a good picture of the Hollywood sign, the observatory had quite a few exhibits which we found very interesting but the thing that makes this place so special is the stunning views of Los Angeles, if your going to L.A.

50,You do remember Rebel Without a Cause...,"So much more than just where the movie was filmed. Great show and exhibits; very interesting, educational and appropriate for all ages. Try to visit on a clear day because the GO offers beautiful views. But be warned, parking can be horrible! You can drop off passengers but may have a long walk, uphill after you park your car. Of course summertime is very crowed as are weekends and holidays. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412suzih
50,Lovely building with a fantastic view of the city & the Hollywood sign,"Unfortunately the observatory itself wasn't open when we visited as it was early morning. However there were plenty of people taking advantage of the fantastic views from up here. And as a bonus - parking seemed to be free before 10am when the observatory opens!

The views were beautiful, we could see the hollywood sign and the hills of LA as well as the downtown. We also had a pretty cool view of Jupiter through one of the telescopes! There are lots of interactive components and free things to experience. The staff are knowledgable and friendly! The sunset was beautiful behind the hollywood sign. It was very packed up there, but you could likely have a nice picnic there as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swalk237

40,A hidden treasure,OK. This was my...dad's... educational choice. The observatory admission is free but that is it. Parking is a nightmare and costly. Or you can walk a ways and park free. The exhibits are good. But the view is great. Probably the best of the metro area. Made it worth the hassle. Everyone enjoyed it even the kids. We did not do the planetarium. We also found a park to see the Hollywood sign. Found that on the Waze gps app. It is a nice side trip. We did this after the Warner Bros. studio tour. Worked good to combine them. Also went to Bobs Big Boy restaurant in Burbank. Great meal attentive staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottt456

As a bonus you get glorious views of Los Angeles one side and views of the Hollywood sign the other.It was extremely busy at the time of our visit, a Thursday early afternoon, and I'd imagine this to be the norm at all times.

50,Unbelievable Free attraction - DON'T miss this on a trip to LA!,"I confess - we visited this because of La La Land! We saw it featured in the movie, and decided to visit. I'm so glad we did! I was stunned to find out that all of the exhibit halls and telescope viewing platforms are free to visitors. If you visit the Planetarium (which we did), it does charge a ticket price, which is well worth the experience. The planetarium's live narrator must be a trained actress. She is ready for Broadway or a movie or both. Only in LA will you find that quality of entertainment in a science oriented exhibit! The Leonard Nemoy hall was well designed, and we only wish we had more time for this visit.Here are a few tips:Don't go on a weekend - too crowded and hard to park.Take a picnic lunch at 1:30 or 2 and find a picnic table that overlooks the Hollywood sign. Then, enjoy the exhibit halls, take in a Planetarium show, and the telescopes open at dusk.Give yourself plenty of time to visit - but you can see most of it in 2 hours if you don't read everything and skip the Planetarium.Parking is tough, but you can park and ride a shuttle. We got lucky and found a spot on the road near the top, but don't get panicked at the bottom of the hill and park, unless you are wanting a major hike. People are coming and going all the time at the top, and your kiddos will NOT want to walk up that hill. And you will NOT want to carry them.Don't miss this fantastic attraction - it's A++++!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_recruiter
40,Amazing place to visit- especially for the views,"We had planned to visit the Griffith Observatory in the morning, but parking proved to be an issue, so we came back in the afternoon and managed to score a carpark pretty quickly. We would have loved to have stayed for the night time viewing, but some people in our party were starving and there is only a Coffee Cafe/ shop onsite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edleg
20,Poorly operated,"Although the views are amazing, parking was horrible, they block off about 30% of the spots for staff even at night after the observatory has closed, so you can easily waste 30 minutes searching for a car spot. Not well operated at all :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarquin999
50,Nice observatory,Good exhibition and very informative. You can spend hours over there. You still can take the Hollywood sign from quite a distance. The only challenge is to find a parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffrey_Teh_2000
50,Great hikes/views/free fun stuff,"This place was super cool, but VERY touristy. Big crowds, but the cool museum atmosphere is worth it. It is a very LARGE place, and you can do a number of hikes. Again though, if you aren't into big crowds of tourists, don't come too often. Def super cool though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordons471
50,Pleasant surprise,"Had not been to the Observatory in twenty years, imagine my surprise when I saw the updates. Building was raised , the grounds were improved and the new displays are everywhere. The Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theatre is informative and The Big Picture display is must see. They did fine job keeping the outside intact and views of LA are spectacular. Take the Dash Observatory shuttle up to Observatory as parking sucks. Very enjoyable!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J679XGthomasp
50,Wonderful place to visit and a great view from the area!,"We visited the Observatory to get a look at the Hollywood sign. What we found was so much more! We started out on our hike toward the sign and upon realizing we couldn't get the picture we wanted decided to hike a little more. When we got to the top of the trail we were on, what a view! So worth the hike! And many different trails to try. Once we made it back down, we went into the observatory (no fee to enter) and it is beautiful. You can see the area used in the recent movie Lala Land. You can pay a small price to experience the planetarium or just walk around for free. The bottom level has an entire space/planets exhibit with a guide providing presentations. There is also a cafe for a snack or lunch if needed. We arrived early so there was plenty of parking available. Parking is free of charge until noon when the observatory opens, and then $4 an hour. A must do for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamihayes95
50,We hiked up,We hiked up here after travelling for 24hrs we needed to street our legs. It's really beautiful up there. Great views of the city & to see & do inside. It was a Friday night & it as packed so be prepared for tourists! Great place. I would go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandamonkey
50,So Interesting,"Our A DAY IN LA TOURS took us to Griffith Observatory, they were able to get us right in, dropped off in front of Observatory and let us have a nice visit of the place after giving us much of the history as we drove in. What a beautiful place. So much to see and again a place you could return to and spend more time at. Would love to do the night tour and see the stars from the telescope",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraC4981
50,Hilltop wonder,"A 'must see' on a trip to LA. Beautiful building (loved the entrance hall ceiling murals) stunning views, excellent exhibits. Only downside is parking, however we were directed back down the hill to a free parking area where we easily picked up the shuttle bus that dropped us right outside the Observatory and picked us up again. Runs on a regular schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jowX5232YF
50,Night cap over that Los Angles City,First time visit for myself and my stepson. We were lucky enough to visit during the evening time watched the sunset and star gazed. Met Jupiter through one of the telescopes provided by the observatory. Which totally amazed my stepson. My husband has been many times as a child and says nothing but good things about the park. It was his first time in the evening and later hours. I would definitely go back again and experience it during the day with hopes to see if again as the sunsets. Possibly check out the hike that leads you to the back of the HOLLYWOOD sign. The Los Angles skyline is gorgeous. Parking wasn't bad although it does stay busy so pack your patience it's worth it for sure. Keep in mind it's free to visit but parking isn't. Worth the few bucks.Happy Star Gazing ✨,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olivemonkey81
50,Lovely way to spend a few hours,Very informative - you have to go up to the rooftop to see the views of the city!Dont miss the telescope and tesla,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879gaila
50,Stars and Kids,The story is told by the building itself. It is a fantastic place for all and especially children. The show is impressive and informative. The time and effort is worth it go and enjoy and remember to bring your camera!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracytC4033WY
50,Great views of LA,"We went up early in the morning, to get a great view of the city. The observatory opens at midday, so parking until then is free. The viewing platform is open, so you can get great views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cpt-Beano
50,The TESLA Coil!,"Stopped here to check out the observatory & to get some good views of the Hollywood sign. Wasn't disappointing. We went in the late afternoon so we were able to get some good shots of the sign before the sun went down, and some good photos of LA lit up at night. The observatory itself is jam packed full of information and exhibits. We skipped the show at the Leonard Nemoy theater due to the time, but this gave us more time to walk around. On a clear night, they open up the dome for the telescope, point it at an object, and let visitors take turns looking through the telescope. Unfortunately, we went on a kinda cloudy evening so the dome was closed, but we still got to see and learn about the telescope itself. There are plenty of spots to stop on the roof and look out over the city, too. If you're using public transport to get around, there is a metro bus that drops off at the observatory. Or, you can park at the bottom of the mountain (for free) and instead of hiking up (it's a pretty long walk) the metro bus has a stop there, too. There is a small parking lot at the top for the observatory as well as some closer, but they are all expensive and limited space. I'd definitely make this a spot on your list if you're planning to visit LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchthis0905
40,Holy sunset batman,The views are amazing!!!! Arrange your uber or lyft return before you go cell phone signal can be sketchy at best even with free wifi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garenb2017
40,Nice Visit,"It's an observatory, so it obviously isn't the most exciting thing to do in LA. But the views are great and you can see the Hollywood sign. As far as the observatory itself, the shows are the best thing to see while you're there. The exhibits are a bit lackluster, in my opinion, which is why I'm only giving it 4/5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorr55
50,Hike from the bottom worth the effort.,"With every twist in the path another breathtaking view, and when you reach the top you have amazing views of the whole city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelz268
50,"Amazing place, but very crowded","Griffith Observatory is an amazing building with an even more amazing view of Los Angeles. Great to come here if you want to take nice pictures of the LA sunset. It is very crowded going up though, so expect traffic jams (like everywhere in LA)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64jv
50,Lovely,I guess a lot of people go up to this observatory to view the Hollywood sign. Don't waste your time as there are better places to see that from. This site deserves a visit in its own right. It is in a lovely setting at the top of the park. At busytimes parking can be a problem at the top so park lower down and catch the complimentary shuttle bus up. They present things really well and you could easily spend all day here. There is a good restaurant for lunch with nice views from the balcony outside while you eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeantRoo
50,Awesome,"Amazing view!! Awesome building design with so many things to enjoy. Inside offered just as much from dining, educational display to gift shop. Many decks with different views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDW1964
40,Griffith Observatory,Took entire family. Great place with great views. It was interesting to look at everything. Parking is terrible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinegridonatelli

40,Glorious,"Always wanted to come here and I wasn't disappointed. Inside is great and interesting facts especially from the staff, great knowledge, but the view is just amazing! We were lucky our day that the smog was low and this is a good place to see the Hollywood sign but word of warning, if you are not driving up or on a tour beware that no taxis wait up here and there are few and far between that just turn up and if your thinking about Uber or similar then you better hope you have the strongest phone in the world cause the signal is non existence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottishred74
50,Beautiful views at sunset,"Parking was tough, but worth it. The observatory is beautiful with educational displays inside and breathtaking views from outside. Sunset is amazing. And unbelievably-it is free to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dznydreamer
50,Great place to visit!,I love coming here! The views are amazing and the observatory is always a hit. The summer months can get rather busy so parking is some times hard to fin (much like the rest of LA)There is a main lot and people can also park on the side of the street. We have also parked in Griffith Park and have hiked a few miles to go to this spot. The hiking is easy to navigate and worth it on a beautiful day. They do have a cafe too so you can refuel afterwards :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarX2854XA
50,Exciting and informative!,"Loved it a lot: scientific facts explained in fun and interesting ways, lots of interactive tools. And surrounding area is really beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905natashas
20,"Parking NIGHTMARE, didn't walk all the way up because that line was LONG.","View of the Hollywood Sign is not great, and was the primary reason for us going. Of course it was during June gloom so YMMV. Parking was a nightmare, the parking lot monitors/security guys kind of lounged around and would arbitrarily let people in or block the lot and direct them down the road......we were on of the lucky cars that got directed down the road.....about a 2 miles walk from the observatory. We almost all the way up and saw the line, took a few quick pics of the Hollywood sign from the sidewalk where we were, and decided to abort and return to the car- HOT day after walking miles. Maybe if this facility was better managed it would be a better attraction? Maybe if they had real sidewalks instead of dirt paths lining the road which really is the secondary parking lot? My wife and I were not impressed, if I had to do over I would have chosen another vantage point, maybe on Mulholland drive to see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillsWebSpace
50,A great hike in LA,"Pack a bag with food and drink and enjoy a beautiful day at the Griffith Observatory. If you are feeling good, continue up to the Hollywood sign! This is a great outing and can be very romantic or family oriented. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrickelyPear
50,"Best view of L.A., where stars were filmed, costs nothing, but time , most of the time","I have walked the trails from Greek Theater to Observatory for 50 years. The best place to see 90% of L.A. & on the far side of venue to see 90% of the San Fernando Valley.You can stand where Jimmy Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo & Lord knows how many stars & how many film crews ,have manuevered to use this location.Go inside for a few shekels, view the Planetarium show.Hell, just go-----",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWalter

20,Don’t come here for the view of the Hollywood sign,"After reading some reviews here we decided to go to this place for a nice picture with the Hollywood sign on the background. Don’t do it! The sign is very far away so you will only see tiny letters. On top of that, when we visited it was misty so that made it even worse. There is a nice view of Los Angeles City here though (although a bit misty). Parking is $4 per hour with a minimum of $4 and the parking guides are useless. You will have to wait for someone to leave for a spot. Don’t park down the hill on a hot day since it will be a tough walk. The view of LA was nice but only for that I wouldn’t have made the drive here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronaldo070
50,Worth It!,"Very photogenic, so interesting inside. The building itself is beautiful and the gardens are well kept. The view from the top is perfect and inside they offer infotainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/170miaj
40,Star dust,"I did not know what to expect at this tour. Nevertheless it was facinating and educational. Not to mention stunning views. Although I was sad that I did not get to see in the telescope because I visited in early daylight, it was a unique experience that revealed the secrets of the cosmos. Being able to touch the metorite brought out my inner child. Such is the effect of star dust.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lendyl
40,Beautiful views.,This is the place to go if you are an avid photographer. The panoramic views of LA are splendid. The Hollywood sign is also clearly visible from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E128XQalexc
40,Great Views but very crowded,The views were amazing but we went on a Saturday and it was very crowded. many parked alongside the road and walk up to the observatory but some of them had to walk more than a mile to get up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523krish
50,"Beautiful views, lovely history","I love the old Hollywood Golden Era and this attraction has that feel in leaps and bounds. The road approaching the Observatory is quite narrow but well worth the drive.With a lovely view of the Hollywood sign, the Observatory is seeped in history with its interior walls and rooms. The bathrooms are still the old original style bathrooms that make you feel like you are in the 1920's. What a wonderful place to visit, not only for the astounding views but for the sheer feel and ambiance of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386brigetteg
50,Pure Awesome,"You can hike for hours (all day) or short hike, many choices.You drive through an old neighborhood with houses inculcated within the hills with overgrown trees. We went on a weekday so the parking lot was not full but it was still very busy.You can also visit here without climbing up where you can bring the family (children) because there is a playground and picnic tables nestled under large trees next to the parking lot. If you veer to the right of the parking lot, there is Bronson Caves. There are different trails like Mulholland, 1.1 miles, the actual Hollywood/Hollyridge Trail sign, 1.9 miles, Tyrolian Tank, 2.3 miles, Mt. Hollywood Drive, 1.4 miles or the Griffin Observatory, 3.1 miles. We did not go to the latter and some said you cannot really see the H sign there. On the top, it is sleep and loose dirt so watch for your footing and the rattle snakes.Bring lots of water and sunscreen. It is hot but worth the climb. Then you can say, “Hey, I’ve been there!”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indiana_Jonesse
40,Great views but very crowded,"This famous LA landmark has a excellent view of both downtown LA and Hollywood. Due to these views and the exhibits within the observatory, the parking lot on top of the hill fills very quickly. During the late moring and afternoon, you may end up parking over a mile away and need to trek uphill to access the observatory.One of the highlights not to be missed is the solar noon presentation outside the cafe. Also, the solar system exhibition under the observatory is very interesting.If you can get there early enough to get parking near the observatory this attraction is great for the entire family and is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moiHere

50,AMAZING,"By far my favorite part about LA. They have a fantastic presentation called ""Center of the Universe"" that they put on in the planetarium. The observatory itself is incredibly beautiful and they have really fantastic displays that inform you without overwhelming you. It's free to get in; you only have to pay for the shows should you want to see them. Get there as soon as it opens so you don't have to park halfway up the hill because it's a very long walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katier942
50,I've always wanted to go here!,"I've been to LA several times and have never had a chance to go because the parking is always terrible. Be prepared to walk far up hill if you do not find a close parking spot. Luckily this time we were able to. You get a great view of LA from here. We went today and the smog was really bad. Overall, there are lots of things to read and learn about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsquared86
40,Beautiful scenic spot,We went on a Sunday & parked on the hill which was free to park. We had fantastic views of the whole of LA. Only problem was that the telescope took our money but didn't work. Great day out and full of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowsh

50,"Amazing view, great exhibits","Getting there is no easy task if going in the middle of the day as you may have to park quite far away. While driving up we were directed to go down and park at the free area and paid parking wasn't even suggested while it was reasonably priced and a lt closer with plenty of spaces. View is amazing, you can see Hollywood sign, LA skyline, tesla exhibition. Definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175martynasm
30,Amazing Views,"Well traffic in L.A. is horrendous. It took an hour to get there. So, when we get there, there's no parking. We went on what was supposed to be a less crowded day. I found out there aren't any. The 7:45 show sold out so we went to the 8;45. After, we wanted to go look through telescope. Nope they close it early. I would think night is the best time to view the stars. I was really disappointed at the whole experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferw394

50,Amazing Sunset & Night Views of LA,"My wife and I went on a Monday when the Observatory was closed, but we still had a great time with great views at sunset and our the city lit up at night. We brought a bottle of wine and would have loved to pack a larger picnic to sit under the stars and enjoy the scenic evening. This is a must do for everyone visiting LA, Waaaaayyyyyy better than the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXLonghorn
50,Worth the bumper to bumper climb to the Observatory,"The drive up was slow and you wonder if it's worth it after awhile. We went on a Saturday which might not be the best day. There are places to park on the way up but you have to be lucky to find one. At the top there is a pay lot, $4 per hour, and we got one of those. If your impatient it might not work for you. The Observatory itself is a fantastic building containing telescopes, artwork, etc. If it's a clear day you can see L. A. which in itself is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685JimM
40,Beautiful location and building,"The location of this observatory gives your great views of the city and is a pretty building with pretty grounds.1) The drive up here can be a little bit of a trick. You drive up the hillside and as you get closer, you start to notice cars parked on the sides of the road - these are cars parked to go to the observatory. There is limited parking at the top near the building and the traffic make a big circle - up the hill, through the parking lot and around down the hill and then back around until you find a space to park. For our trip, we had a limited amount of time so my husband dropped us off, made a couple of round trips and then picked us up. We went on a Tuesday. A local tour guide told us that Saturdays are nearly impossible, due to crowds.2) The museum inside is kind of small but contains some really great things. We particularly enjoyed the TESLA coil and the periodic table that actually contains actual samples of all of the elements.3) The views are outstanding from the grounds and the roof. It is easy to move around here - although we went on a Tuesday and it was still busy, but we were able to walk around on the roof and take pictures.4) There are restrooms, but I did not see any place with food or drinks for sale - although my trip was fast and I may have missed it.5) I did not get to look thought the telescope, but there was one there - I wish I could have",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lollie777
50,Stunning views of greater Los Angeles,"The Griffith Observatory is a wonderful way to see Los Angeles and surrounds. You can also get a good view of the iconic Hollywood Sign. Make sure you take the time to take in the views from every direction. You can walk to the Observatory via the walking track but I would recommend good walking shoes and a bottle of water as it is not an easy walk. The Dash bus is an alternative and costs only 50c each way and will take you all the way to Vermont Sunset Metro Station. Alternatively, Lyft and Uber drivers are allowed to take you beyond the general parking area to the top of the Observatory so also a good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandarK201NO
40,"Crowded, foggy. Great exhibits.","It was overcast, chilly and late on a Tuesday evening when we visited, and still we had to park about a mile away down the hill.

Just go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMB378

50,Amazing experience,"The Griffith Observatory offers the visitors a wide variety of fun from hiking to space exploration. If you have seen La La Land(2016), then you may also feel like you were a part of Hollywood as it was featured in the movie.The visit first starts with a parking along the road and a hike to the observatory. Depending on when you arrive and how lucky you are, you can park pretty close, or a mile or so away. There is not sidewalk, so you are forced to walk on unpaved paths and sometimes in the street, but most cars are courteous enough to drive slow.Once you are at the Observatory on the main grounds, pause, and reward yourself to a quick break and a few quick selfies. There will be more photo op locations later. Facing the observatory, and with a high zoom camera lens or binoculars, about your 3-4 o'clock position, you can see the famous Hollywood sign.The inside is a quite a site to visit for all ages. There are a lot of things to see and explore inside. There's even a rock specimen from space. Once you are done, visit outside and climb the steps up toward the telescope. It's quite a view from there.Once you're done, find your way back inside and enjoy the air condition and gift shop. Perhaps take a break at the snack bar before your trek back to your vehicle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O346WMdavidw

40,A must go for star gazers and hikers....,"Been to Griffith twice in my 5 day holiday in LA. I realised that although it is closer to Hollywood sign than any other public location, I realised that at some point from the Walk of Fame area, one can get a better view. The view from Griffith is a bit slanted. If you are hiking and want to star gaze at night, going there is a must. My only regret was that I did not have time to hike upto the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonmoyp2017

50,"Great views of downtown, get there before sunset.","We flew into LAX and went to the walk of stars and dinner, then to the Observatory. I wish we would have gotten there earlier, it was already dark when we got to the top. Still great sites. The Hollywood sign is NOT lit up at night. Parking is extremely limited so if you are able, pick a parking spot on the side of the road and hike the rest of the way. Hide your valuables in the car, we saw one that had been broken into. The telescopes close by 9:40 and the place closes at 10. It would have been wonderful to watch a sunset from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaylad0421

50,Must see,If u come to LA u have to go to the Griffith observatory this place is beautiful make sure u bring your camera hat sun glasses and sun cream but well worth seeing and don't get tricked into paying big $$ on sum dodgy tour bus take a uber there plus book a return trip before leave just in case u can't get wifi while u are up there.. give yourself about 2 hours the observatory is free admission,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unclechownza
50,Very Interesting,"We had another activity planned and almost did not visit the observatory, but afterwards we all agreed that we were so glad that we did. My husband and sons (14 and 20) all loved it. My husband is a bit of a science/astronomy nut so he really enjoyed it. Parking was an issue. We went on a Tuesday...arrived at 11:30 a.m. They do not open until noon. There were cars everywhere! We were rerouted from the designated parking lot and eventually found a small lot on the side of the road. It was a short half mile hike back to the observatory with great views so it actually worked out well. The best part is that this attraction is free. There are a few exceptions but for the most part it's free. Great for the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXGirlie
50,"Visit to Griffith Observatory, Los angeles","Like every silly tourist, we climbed the hill all the way & spent huge amount of time looking at Hollywood Board & things around like sunset, illumination in the city etc. We also enjoyed rolling on green lawn front of Griffith Observatory. But unfortunately it did not dawn on us that the we were few steps away from the best attraction at the place.Finally when nothing else was there to do, we entered into the Griffith Observatory, only to be stupefied by the contents in it. When we realized the closing time was not far off, we hurried through the exhibits, descriptive boards etc.Then we really chuckled silly to have wasted our time outside for no reason & did not contribute it to enjoying the inside exhibits.The exhibits (& some of them are even outside on & around lawn) are related to astronomy, laws of physics, cosmos, planets & the facts about them. Lot of information was bestowed on us through moving exhibits, which can be self operated. Many scientific facts are easily illustrated in such exhibits. From that viewpoint, students & scientists should really spare enough time to spend here, rather than wasting it outside in the lawns. EVen common person, without scientific background too can enjoy the exhibits.Hats off to this particular monument (it is so, since it was erected way back) & especially to the person Mr. Griffith, who donated that entire estate to the state government to erect & maintain this for the benefit of the public at large. My advice to the scientifically inclined or handicapped tourists...go enter the observatory first....spend sufficient time there & at the end only emerge to marvel at the beautiful surroundings of LA & Hollywood hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmodak
50,Beautiful,The view of the city is beautiful.We watched an interesting sky show; the pendulum is also interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrinaS_608ZK
40,Good Views and FREE!!,"A beautiful building in a special location. A wonderful view of the Hollywood sign. Best of all its free, and has a lot of intresting exhibits as well as a planetarium which you can see shows for a small fee. Worth a visit as not much is free in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberleyB692
40,worth to visit.,the best part is the 3d movie --its must. although the telescope is interesting but not always open depends on the weather.the view is special .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakov13
40,Quick Trip,Just a quick trip inside not much to enjoy for me. But the views of Los Angeles are amazing. We took some very beautiful pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618tashah
50,Amazing views😂,"The Griffith Observatory is an amazing day time attraction. I went for the first time around 5-6 months ago and it was an amazing. What is one of the coolest parts of this museum is that it has the perfect view of the Hollywood sign if you go on a nice day. The mountain that it is located on is walkable if feel like walking a huge mountain. The science behind it was incredible. My family and I learned so much and there was great discussion on the way home. My personal favorite part was the movie that we went too. It was only a few dollars, but you stare into a screen that is almost like a bowl up in the air and it shows you cool videos. For mine, we went up to space and into the ocean. If you get motion sickness though, you might have to step out because it feel weird when the screen moves just a little hint. The observatory its self is free, but I would suggest paying the 5-6$ for the movie. You could seriously spend hours in the museum its self. Please go and you won't regret it. Also, if you are huge La La Land lover like I am, this is where Mia and Sebastian share there first kiss, in the seats where the movie plays!!!(I totally fan girdled😂😂) totally go if you can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/542jillianr
50,Hiking at its best,We went here on a Sunday afternoon for a hike and a view of the Hollywood Sign and this did not disappoint. We wandered the trails and took lots of photos. Great views of the city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeMeToCabo
50,Beautiful inside and out - A must see.,"I'd recommend hiking up to the observatory from trails cafe. Always a nice hike and view over Los Angeles on your way up. Then, you can see the hollywood sign from the top too! The Observatory itself is very picturesque and nice to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637katherinem
50,Beautiful Sunset,"My wife and I went here to watch the sunset, and viewed it from the rooftop and it was amazing. We also took a tour of the actual museum while we waited. Pretty cool place to visit and beautiful sunset. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregBrownjr
50,Must see day AND night,"The Griffith Observatory is a Los Angeles iconic spot. While the interior is lined with murals and beautiful marble reminding one of the craftsmanship of days gone by, you are surely to be equally impressed with the panoramic views of Los Angeles. Want to have your breath taken away? Visit during and after sunset to see the beautiful city at night!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronh118
50,Can see the whole city,This is a great place to go to see the views. Our group took lots of photos and walked down the trail to the park. It was a great workout. Make sure you wear sneakers or good walking shoes and do the trail going down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lianat2016
40,Pretty neat,We came here as part of a walking tour we were on. If you are into astrology this is the place for you.It's a very neat building with a lot of history. It personally wasn't for me but the architecture of the building was very neat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melisx33
50,Great Stop for 3-Generation Family Trip,"My wife and I, our son & daughter-in-law, and 3 grandchildren stopped here as our first ""tourist stop"" in Burbank area. All of the family loved the observatory with its exhibits and lectures. Different members were interested in different things - periodic table exhibit with examples of elements, action explanation of lunar eclipse, workings of telescopes, relative sizes of orbits of planets around the sun, etc. Everyone also enjoyed the views (and photo ops) of the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign from the front of the observatory. Would love to come back at night for star-gazing. Overall a great stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaroonDawg67
50,Interesting place.,A must for all astronomy fans. Also great panoramic views of the Hollywood sign and city.Well worth a visit. It's a short taxi bus ride from Hollywood area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christhursfield
20,Forget Finding Parking on a Saturday,"I had been up here years ago with no problem, but on a Saturday in early June, forget about it! They were towing illegally parked cars en masse on the way up and there were all kinds of electric signs warning of limited parking at the top. Then, we started to see $25 ""event"" parking signs. The traffic trying the get uphill was terrible. We gave up and went for arrive along Mulholland Drive instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pabirds
50,MUST DO if you are in Los Angeles,So good. My family loved this. It's all free admission except the planetarium. The views are amazing. We spent over 3 hours here and didn't see the same thing. New exhibits keep it interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FeSanch72
50,Must go place,"Had an amazing experience specially kids enjoyed most , Tesla Coil was a bonus , always plan to see a show at Planetarium , parking was bit of an issue but they have good shuttle service too, any ways parking on hill top will always be like this .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saurabhrangoli
40,Nice place however no parking !,I've visited with my friends however couldnt find a good parking spot. It was crowded and very nervous to drive and park there. But interesting place for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unkienstein
50,Highlight of my trip,Definitely recommend hiking up the hill instead of driving/bus. Lovely walk and gorgeous views that you'll miss on the road. Building itself was gorgeous and very informative and interesting inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578jaredc
30,Average food,"get what you pay for - canteen style, food was ok, facilities clean. Cannot complain and good for a break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter7098
30,And on our left.,"Looked cool. Closed on the day of visiting? Great views. Not hedge maze like in GTA. Tour guide on the bus was drunk. Nice visit, especially seeing all the houses and mountains on the way up. Genuinely nice place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Re_Journey
50,A must,"An amazing place to visit, no matter what the weather is. A stunning view of all of LA and a beautiful building full of history to also visit.The hidden bonus is, if you are a back to the future fan, the classic scene in the tunnel of the first film, is filmed in a tunnel you drive through to get to the Observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick-ward84
50,Scenic!!!,We went when it was really foggy but nonetheless it was an incredible attraction. Free admission and lots to see and do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noslenf
30,"Terrible cafeteria, pretty place",What a shame to have such a poor quality and poor selection cafe in such a gorgeous setting. Let's it down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danae70
50,Stunning place,"Great place to visit, take a few hours to enjoy your visit, stunning views over LA and of the Hollywood sign. Great for walk if you like to walk. If you can get to see over LA when it's a clear day and not hazy you not be disappointed. Never had any problems with getting parked, have been here a few times over the years and at different times of the day. Not used the restaurant there yet but will do as I will always visit this place when am in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PexyScotland
50,Amazing Views but rather crowded on weekends,We loved our visit to Griffith Observatory. The views of LA are tremendous. Don't miss it. The staff was friendly and informative. We had the opportunity to view Jupiter and the moon through two different telescopes. The place is quite popular on weekends so be prepared. It is free and great for couples and families. We also walked the trail to the bottom of the mountain. Tip: Wear good walking shoes as it is sandy and rocky but wide and safe enough. Many hikers were using the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrannyD2013
50,Great location to look upon the city on L.A.,My wife and I traveled to the Griffith Observatory at night looking for the Hollywood Sign. It was late (9:30 pm). We didn't see the Hollywood sign but we caught a nice view of the city of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/993isaiaha
50,Must see!,"This was on our list of Must See places, and it did not disappoint. The exhibits are interested for all ages. The views are stunning whether it is day or night. If you can stay to sunset, do! The sun setting behind the Hollywood sign is magnificent. We weren't able to use the main telescope in the building. The line was long and then it was closed by 9:30. There were some free telescopes set up on the lawn which provided amazing views of Jupiter. The Center of the Universe show was excellent too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEFowler
50,Beautiful views,What a gem. Lots of neat exhibits and full of interesting info. The grounds are beautiful and walking around gives you some of the best views of LA. The Tesla Coil was especially neat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paranoidgirl1013
40,Fun outing,"Took Uber to avoid the hassle of driving and parking. Good view of LA and the Hollywood sign though it was a hazy day. Observatory, though not very large, was a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld
50,Spectacular Views!,"We spent all day here as there is so much to see and do. The views are awesome and you can see the Hollywood Sign. The exhibitions are so interesting and informative but the highlight for me was the Panetarium Shows, we went to two, both were excellent. Walked around the grounds and had lunch in the restaurant and stayed until it started to get dark to see all the lights of Los Angeles spread out before us! A magical place, highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondie2969
50,Must go to attraction,"Perched within the Hollywood Hills, with interesting exhibits and stellar information with breathtaking city views.Convenient public and ride sharing transportation services to and from the city centre. Free wi-fi throughout property",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoobybeagle
50,See the Hollywood Sign,"Despite being overcast in LA, visiting the observatory gave a great view of the downtown area, Hollywood hills, beach areas etc.You can also visit inside the observatory and learn about how the Griffith Griffith observatory came to be, yes it was named after a guy Griffith J Griffith !Go figure...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/well_travelled330
50,Magical place,Incredibly interesting if you like science stuff. With the most amazing view of L.A. Great place for a picture at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstebanSolis
40,Worth it for the views,"I made the drive up to the observatory - there is free parking on either side of the hill but i wouldn't suggest that for anyone with any walking issues.The views are stunning, be it of downtown LA or the Hollywood sign and the observatory itself seems well set up for educational visits.Sadly I didn't get time to go to the Planetarium and if I did the trip again I would definitely go for the sunset/evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ch3wy
50,Completely a must!,"Griffith Obersvatory is a must when visiting Los Angeles. It is 25 mins aprox from LA downtown. The best time to go is 1 hour before sun sets and enjoy the views. You can see the Hollywood sign and a beautiful view of LA city. The exhibition at the observatory is free of charge and it is really worth of visiting. Very convenient for families with children. I would say you can spend up there up to 3-4 hours. There is a café and restaurant (some way overpriced) so, you could think of bringing your own food and drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/366cristhianm
50,Beautiful at night!,"Quite a nice place in Los Angeles! Must visit, I would definitely hike if I go back during the day time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda1LG
50,Take you time here. It's magical.,Brought the girlfriend up here to experience the splendor of this place. We arrived on a foggy night in August 2014. Driving up the winding road can be a little haring especially in the fog. We got to the summit and it was perfectly clear. Plan to spend at least 2 hours here with all the cool astronomical displays. Amazing views of LA at night. Must see for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dougenstein
50,Beautiful at night!!,"On a dark clear night, you can see so many stars! It's an amazing experience especially looking through the telescope to see the moon's craters. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodnessgraacious
50,Great views in every direction!,"We visited in November 2016 - drove to the top and walked around. There are great views in every direction and it's really beautiful up at the top. Lots of people, easy parking and lots of room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/594abigailm
50,Worth The Slow Drive,The ticket here is to go in the AM before it gets crowded and when there is no smog. The day I went I got lucky since I went in the PM and I got a close spot and the smog was not too bad. It is a must do when in LA anyway!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachee1313
50,Well worth a visit!,"Cool drive up to the observatory, although parking was really tight so had to walk a bit. Great free science observatory with fantastic views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trickyvillains
50,Great viewpoint,"*Note we went on a day it was closed to the publicWe caught an uber from Sunset Blvd for approx USD$8. We knew it was not open but heard it is worth going there stil, and after being there yes we would agree. We went about 4pm, had great weather and spent over an hour enjoying the view and surroundings. Can see Hollywood sign in the distance to the right and huge views across the city of LA. Looks like there are some walking tracks to/from. The Observatory itself is a great sight too, even though we didnt get to explore what it has to offer when it is open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/566jasminew
50,Lives up to the hype,"We visited on a Monday morning and it wasn't particularly crowded, we were able to get a parking spot about half a mile from the observatory. The smog wasn't too bad. We could see most of LA quite clearly. This really is a must-visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556carriey
50,Best Spot in LA,"I was in LA for 3 days and I'm in no particular rush to go back. It is not a city I can picture myself living in, and there were only 2 things I really enjoyed; Venice Beach and Griffith Observatory.The Observatory is very interesting and I ended up spending several hours here. Firstly walking up to the observatory, walking around the gardens outside, looking at the views and at the Hollywood sign. Then I went inside to look at all the information and collections they have on display. If you're interested in space you could easily spend hours reading all the information cards. They have talks inside, such as around the pendulum where you can literally watch the earth spin and have someone explain this to you.The observatory is also a good spot to watch the sunset as the city skyline changes from day to night the views are incredible. Go 30/45 minutes before sunset and then stay until dark. Once darkness comes you should queue immediately to look through the big telescope before the line gets too long and it gets cold. Worth the trip - oh and it's free which is surprising for LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240kieranf
40,City Vews,"I put this on my must see during my latest visit, but being a weekend, it was extremely packed and there was a lot of traffic just to get into the parking lot. I wish I could have stayed here for longer as there was a lot to explore in the conservatory, but the crowds really showed how busy the attraction can get. The views from the lookout were great (less crowded) and the Hollywood sign is visible from the parking lot as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621fs
50,Great family day out!,"LA's landmark 1935 observatory opens a window onto the universe from its perch on the southern slopes of Mt Hollywood. Its planetarium claims the world’s most advanced star projector and after dark staff wheel, additional telescopes out to the front lawn for star gazing. Inside you will be able to see many interesting installations and amongst them the phenomenal Tesla's Coil (the smartest man on the Earth was my country man, no biggie). 😉😉😉😉 This place is great for people and kids of all ages and also FREE ADMISSION is appreciated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarmCoffeeHubBlog
20,Very busy no parking,The observatory was very busy and parking is rubbish. Therefore did t get chance to get up close as we had someone that couldn't walk far. Suggest going on an organised tour if you really want to go. Also be aware of the sea mist as it can destroy the view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeEMorris
50,Great hikes and view,Nice getaway from the city with many different hikes to choose from and a beautiful backdrop for photos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raincouverbeauty
40,Great Iconic destination but very busy,"This was on my list of must do locations this time around and it didn't disappoint. I would like to have stayed here for longer but, that's the price of visiting with friends who aren't as into a place as you are.Obviously the views are spectacular but it's the exhibits and information inside that will have you wanting to explore.Parking is a pain and there are buses that go up and down the road but they are packed and not frequent enough. Either use larger buses or pick up/drop off on a more regular schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/281craigm
50,Observatory is Closed Mondays-But the Grounds and View are Still Fabulous,Be sure that you that the actual observatory is closed on Mondays. We still enjoyed the view and grounds. Parking is available at the top and the cost is reasonable.There are bathrooms available outside. We enjoyed looking down on L.A.Thanks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581carlv
50,A must to do in LA!,"Every time I visit Cali, this is always the place I talk about/want to go to. Experiencing the sunset at this observatory is the coolest thing. The place is packed as the sun starts to go down, the experience is unlike any other. Parking is difficult as I've usually had to walk about a half mile to a mile but definitely worth it. These stunning views and atmosphere just bring the whole LA feel and vibe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshw_travel
50,Great place to see the skies and city,We liked this place in spite of having to drive in the winding roads and having to park a long way down and walk up. As it is located at an elevated place it offers great views of LA downtown. We visited the place after nightfall. During daytime you will get a photo opportunity of the HOLLYWOOD sign. We missed it!I think the right time to visit this place is couple of hours before sunset to couple of hours after sunset. We also saw a show at the planetarium which was impressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurudathbaliga
50,LA views!,"Fantastic place to spend half of a day in LA. Great views of the city, the hills and the Hollywood sign! a must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryqueen79
40,Very Nice,It was Friday evening and luckily we could get parking near to observatory. Car parking is a problem on weekends and one may have to walk up the hill for longer time. Observatory is very nice and we could watch stars as the sky was clear. Visit during evening/night is preferred to enjoy the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sureshhulikunti
50,Amazing visit to Griffith Observatory,We visited the Griffith Observatory and was amazed by its architecture. We also did the Mt. Hollywood hike trail during our trip there and was able to take plenty of photos of Los Angeles. It is advisable to go early especially on weekends in order to secure the parking lots just outside Griffith Observatory. Parking fees are reasonable considering the time we spent over there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldseah
40,Views across LA,"Great place to see the Hollywood sign, and views across LA. It is touristy, but there is space to get your photos taken too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KdofMelb
40,Interesting place and great views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"This is an interesting and nice place to visit, it's in a national park and has great views across the whole of LA. It's a good spot to get a photo of the Hollywood sign too. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289hilarym
50,Intergalactic education for free!,"This iconic observatory in griffith park is a must see in LA. The views are outstanding, the exhibits are informative, and it's free!Park down at the Greek theater and walk up approximately 1 mile to reach the observatory, and the parking is free too.There are presentations in the observatory, including a tesla coil. There is also a series of planetarium videos you can pay to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25wanderlings
40,Definitely worth a visit!,"Unfortunately we had severe time constraints during a recent visit to Los Angeles. Going to the Griffith Observatory seemed to be mandatory just because of its location high above the city, and from information given by friends it has a great deal to offer. We arrived there at 10.00 only to find out that the Observatory buildings only opened at 12.00. We were thus unable to enter the building and had walking around the outside of the Observatory had to suffice. We were treated to incredible views of the city of Los Angeles and surrounding landscape. The markings on the ground which give some idea of the magnitude of our universe and the planterary system was almost too much to comprehend. It certainly is a must during a visit to Los Angeles. Just make sure of the opening time before going there, so that you are able to utilise all that is offered by a visit to the plantetarium. Parking wasn't a problem.....seeing that we were too early for opening time. It seems as though it could be a long walk up the hill during peak hours. Perhaps a good idea to go early and find close parking - and enjoy the views outside until the actual Planetarium opens. I would certainly go back if I should ever have the privilege of visiting LA again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61RobertaW
50,Griffith Observatory - you can see for miles,This observatory is great for taking the kids. It has lots of information and displays. The view is amazing. It was really busy so car parking was a little difficult. I caught an Uber from my hotel and there was no problem with dropping me off up the top near the observatory. Well worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancypantsdancer2009
40,Wonderful Views,"We were deciding whether to go to Griffith Observatory or do the Runyan Canyon walk, but opted for the former due to it being closer to our motel. We were not disappointed.The walk up to the observatory was great; it was a bit of a hike but if you have water and good walking shoes then there is no reason why you can't just enjoy it, especially with the views that you get along the way.From the top, you can see the Hollywood sign clearly and I got some really good photos. We went around 8am on a Thursday morning and there wasn't many people around either.We didn't go inside the observatory, however I believe it's a great addition if you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenj907
40,To see Hollywood sign,"The observatory houses a walk through of educational displays on the solar system, the moon and planets. I remember one section on the image of the sun reflected live from the telescope. There's also a giant telescope on the roof.Outside the observatory, you will be able to see the iconic holly wood sign though the sign looks rather small in photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganchowa
40,Parking is terrible....cool place tho,"This was our perceived highlight of our trip to L.A. That was until we actually go to the Observatory. It might have been the day that we went, but there was a 15-30 minute line just to get to the top where the observatory was...to turn around and try to find parking along the side of the road. We eventually parked in a spot behind a bunch of other cars to only come back to our car with a ticket on it. Apparently is was a Temporary Tow Zone....The ticket wasn't $35, $50, or even a reasonably $60...$93 was the cost of our ticket. The city of L.A made a bunch of money that day..because about 50 cars were parked in the zone.About the Observatory:It was super cool to see ALL of L.A. from the top of the observatory! They had a bunch of cool science/planetary exhibits. It was just extremely hard to get to any of them, because the site was packed full of people....as in squeezing through people tight. We went to one of the shows, and it was neat to actually experience that, but on the other side it was a little corny, and I fell asleep during the show (comfy chairs, positioned in a perfect angle for sleeping). Personally, I do not plan on going back, but I am sure others might enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillym17
50,Search for the stars,"This is an easy place to get to from Downtown LA - just take the Dash bus. The observatory is really interesting and it's free! From here you can see the Hollywood sign, see a Tesla coil and a Foucault Pendulum. There is a wealth of information about the solar system and the way the stars are formed. The Griffith Observatory is a fascinating attraction; put it on your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sstoney52
20,TOO MANY TOURISTS,"As residents of Los Angeles for over 40 years, when our nephew came to visit for a few days, we thought of how nice it would be to take him on an excursion high into the hills of Griffith Park to see the Griffith Observatory. We had been there many times over the years and always enjoyed the park-like setting, the architectural structure, the view, and the small town vibe of the Planetarium itself.However on this particular Wednesday afternoon, instead of finding a pleasant location to spend an hour or two walking around the grounds, we encountered unruly mobs of people and parking lots filled to the brim with cars. There was simply NO PLACE TO PARK! We drove up...and guided politely by uniformed parking attendants....we were waved through and OUT! We drove past the Observatory...catching a glimpse of the buildings....and on down the other side.What has happened to this iconic LA landmark? Has the widespread use of social media driven hordes of tourists to this once peaceful location and transformed it into something like Santa Monica Beach on a Sunday----packed with so many people that there is no room left for enjoyment?So many things have changed in recent years.. and while some of these changes have been for the better, other things have changed for the worse. The overwhelming number of tourists descending on LA in recent years has turned the simple, quiet, low-key pleasure of visiting The Griffith Park Observatory into a madhouse of noisy crowds, taking selfies and filling the parking lot, until not one single space is left. I must repeat: this was on a Wednesday afternoon. Unfortunately, now, an aunt and uncle who want to show their nephew one of the most unique and beautiful locations in their adopted hometown, must find other things to do when they want to take a young family member on a tour. And please don't suggest the commercial UNIVERSAL CITY WALK! It's just another mall!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607karle
50,Amazing Views,"You travel up a windy hillside and may have to park along the side of the road. Take a good pair of walking shoes to get to the observatory. Once there, absolutely beautiful scenic views of L.A. Inside, informative and creative displays of astronomical insights. Great for family trips and all ages. People even brought their pets to lounge and play around in the grassy area in front of the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrealara1212
30,Take Uber or Lift,"We had planned to spend one day in LA the Observatory was top on our list. We drove our rental car up and over the mountain pass. There was not one parking place to be found. There are many places to park. It is really busy.The drive was beautiful and well worth a look. If your goal is to see the Observatory, consider an form of transportation that does not require a parking space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hezzie101
50,A must see.,"This is one tourist attraction in LA that doesn't let you down. It goes without saying that God views are amazing. However, the inside of the Observatory is also not to be missed.

50,Views,"Great skyline views, definitely take a Lyft parking would have been a nightmare. Watched a show and saw the Tesla. Great photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniat701
40,"Nice View of LA, Educational","Go early since the slog through the parking lot looking for a space can be slow. Once parked you are rewarded with a view of LA which can be either spectacular or totally hazy. The inside of the Observatory has extensive astronomy and space exhibits, including a Foucault pendulum. There's a cafe terrace with a nice view of LA. Great for those who remember the scenes from Rebel Without a Cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/areview28
40,Too far from Hollywood sign,Nice up in the hills but it's a bit too far from the Hollywood sign if that's what you're going for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polloRemuera
50,So much cool stuff here!,Wish we had more time. There are so many cool and interesting exhibits here. You could easily spend days looking at everything. My kids (ages 12 & 8) loved it! The soup in the cafe is delicious!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renae0118
50,View is worth the trip.,The view is worth the trip. All of LA laid out before you and the Hollywood sign. Best picture spot in the city. Parking is a bear so get there early for night viewing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chakalkar
40,Amazing views,Great place for adults and kids. Plenty of hiking trails and amazing views over LA. The kids loved the interactive experiences within the Observatory itself,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveMcNalls
40,Quite the Place,"There's plenty to see and do at the Griffith. There are some nice live exhibitions and the area is delightful. You can see forever. It's a bit of a hike from much of the parking, so be forewarned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ace4444
50,"A true gem. Great views, hiking and exhibits.","We just love the observatory. We visit every time we come to LA, which is a lot. Don't miss the planetarium live show. It never gets boring. Views are superb and the hiking from the observatory in the hills in Griffith Park is wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureBiker21
50,"Beautiful Views, and Nice to see where they filmed some great movies!","It's best to get here early as it gets packed early and quickly. We tried (stupidly) on a Saturday late afternoon to go and see the sunset and got stuck in a long line. Between trying to see the views and a concert going on at the Greek Theater, we wasted almost two hours and had no sunset to see in the end!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622tarynm
50,Amazing,"I was not expecting such an amazing view and amazing place. We went at the end of the day in order to see the sunset and it worth it. we could watch the moon from the telescope an the children got really excited about this experience. This place became one of my favorites in LA, and I cannot wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/336AdrianaC
40,Amazing views!,"When you're in LA and you are looking for a place to go to with the whole family, this is it. The ride to the top is fun and when you get there, the views are amazing! It really is a must see. If you ask me, you have the best view of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiegoChinASen
50,Great visit and free!,After hiking to the HOLLYWOOD sign we decided to make a brief stop at the observatory. So glad we did! There's so much to see both inside and outside. We did not have time to watch the movie. I would definitely recommend this spot although it is packed with people!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureamy1
40,Cool place to see.,"Definitely worth checking out. Great views of LA from the top. Depending on how busy they are, you may need to park further away and walk up a hill. So definitely bring comfortable shoes and be in the mood for a decent hike up a steep hill. Worth checking out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spikeminoda
50,"Neat museum, iconic building and location",The Griffith Observatory is an iconic building that everyone has undoubtedly seen in a movie at some point. The building is quite beautiful with an amazing view of LA. The museum itself is pretty neat. I'm a science nerd so I like to geek out on some of this stuff. I didn't realize they had a Tesla coil which was very cool seeing one in action.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathleenw529
50,Beautiful views!,"This is a must-see when visiting Los Angeles. So much of the city can be seen, including the Hollywood sign. It is beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180emilye
50,Amazing place!,"I fell in love with this place. The view of LA skyline is gorgeous. You can also see the Hollywood sign from there, so it's like you have the whole LA at the reach of your eyes. But the best park is the show inside the planetarium. It's a must-see. It costs $7 to enter the show so it's inexpensive and it's gorgeous! The parking at near the observatory is 4$ every 2hrs or something like this so want to time your visit well. But I think it's possible to park for free but you'll have to walk a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agnieshka_83
50,A place to observe A great LA view,"A must on your bucket when visiting LA but get there early as the car park is not large and is filled quickly. Try during the week as its less crowded. If full, you will find yourself parking on tne road and facing a steep walk. It has been the star of many a film and TV episode over the years , one of the latest being LA LA Land.The Observatory provides a marvelous vista view of LA which is only beaten when you go at night. There are lots of exhibitions to see and you can taken in a show / lecture at the Leonard Nimoy theatre. On the lower floor there is a great shop and restaurant with an outside balcolny to enjoy the views. There is a monument to James Dean: Rebel without a cause to see along with a great view of the Hollywood Sign. Overall worth spending a few hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neil-1138
40,Griffith Observatory,"Lets start with parking, its now on one side of the street. They also made it into pay parking if you park near the observer tory. If you park on the street going away from the observatory, the parking is free. Traffic on weekends, weekdays a lot better.Great view of Los Angeles. On a clear day, you can see Santa Monica beach. If you bring a basket with food, great outside area on the grass. They have food, and a great place outside to sit and eat. They have indoor sitting, but on a nice day it's worth being outside.Inside, you can learn about the earth, stars, planets, etc. You can buy tickets to learn more, but you can still look around for free.Great place to bring friends, come alone, family, etc.Great hiking trail. Come for a hike, bring your dog, and enjoy a relaxing day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationthisway
50,Great place to visit....,"Terrific views of the city and Hollywood sign!! We missed the planets/stars viewing using telescopes as that's only available late evening but if you have time definitely do that.We parked at the Greek theater (as soon as you enter the observatory) and took the DASH bus for 50cents/pp. It dropped us right in front of the observatory.Reading all the reviews about parking/driving on busy weekends we were a bit apprehensive as we visited on a Friday of the Memorial day weekend. But it was an awesome experience. And it wasn't too crowded either. If we had time we'd stayed until late night to see the city lights and the planets thru the telescopes.The exhibition hall have great information for young kids about eclipses, earth's rotation, tides etc.We also missed the planetarium shows due to limited time but plan for at least 5-6 hrs to enjoy all the activities the Observatory has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikj
50,Fab tour and trip,We went on a Tuesday. A little windy but very good weather and a clear day.Stayed for 4 hours . Parking fee a little steep but worth it . Took plenty of pics with the Hollywood sign quite distinct in the backAll in all a great day trip and a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/REKHA91
40,Great view,"Great view. It tend to get very crowded as the day goes on, so get there early to get a park. The view of downtown is amazing. Inside the observatory there's a pendulum and some other exhibits inside that educate you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rociog416
50,Amazing tourist attraction!,"If you have seen La La Land, Griffith Observatory was a prominent feature of this wonderful movie. Getting up to the observatory is difficult has there are cars parked everywhere and people walking up the mountain. Lots of traffic.The Observatory itself is a marvel in itself. Lots of great exhibits to see and a spectacular view of L.A. that is beyond compare. Tremendous views of the city and the Hollywood sign. It's a sight I will never forget.Visiting this landmark is a must when you visit Los Angeles. I would recommend you go early in the day to avoid all the traffic or perhaps during the week.But in any case, go see this beautiful building!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyS746
50,Terminator!,Just standing here where part of terminator was filmed was enough to excite me! Absolutely loved the view! I can't remember much about the inside of the building as I think I was mesmerised but everything else. Would definitely visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wynterb2015
30,Don't go on sat/Sunday,It took us an hour to get to the observatory from the bottom of the hill. There was zero parking places and we had to turn around and come back down. It was horrible how the security guys just stood around and didn't help direct traffic. They have a parking lot on top but decided to close it so only handicap could park there. I saw 6 parking spots and they wouldn't allow anyone to go in. Someone needs to make this more convenient for visitors. If you do go the view from up there is fantastic except for the fact that there's so much smog over L.A that it's not a very clear view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoliP1
50,A must see when visiting LA.,Very impressive facility and the views are amazing at night and in daylight. Parking can be a challenge so be prepared to park down the mountain and have to walk up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4666XHmichelm
50,LA 2017 trip,Good family outing after a good drive around LA. Very good for family getaways on a good sunny weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikasChhabra67
50,Best Views of LA,"This place offers the very best of iconic views of the LA area. From here you can see the famous ""Hollywood Sign"", downtown LA and other sights. Parking can be quite tricky. Try parking at the very top near the observatory. If space exists, you will be glad for the short, level walk to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607jayb
40,"""Star""ring the Building itself","Aside from a good view of the Hollywood sign and being able to touch a meteorite one of the best things about visiting Griffith Observatory is the Art Deco Building itself. Lovely touches of Art Deco are in details throughout the building. Another unexpected but exciting experience I had during my visit is seeing a Tesla Coil. Why you might ask why is there a Tesla Coil at an Observatory; because it was gifted to them and who says no to a Tesla Coil was the answer. Unless you are not in a hurry and are very fit, I would recommend driving up to the paid parking. The 'show' we saw was a bit underwhelming in a melodramatic kind of way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thymegrower
50,Amazing Views on LA,Although I didn't go inside - I made a point of taking a drive up there at 6am to beat the crowds! It's probably THE best location for taking photos of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign/surrounding areas. It was a Saturday morning and although there were quite a few joggers and sightseers up there - it was a lot quieter and parking was free (as before 10am). Well worth it for the all important Los Angeles views.*tip - they don't tell you about the little annoying flies...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philparry1
50,Breathtaking Views,"Let me start by saying that the parking situation was horrendous the night that we went. It was getting close to sunset so that may have been the problem, but we were stuck in traffic and fighting for a parking spot for an hour and a half. We ended up finding one on the side of the road a mile down the mountain and just walking up. Do not wear shoes that you care about getting dirty if the parking situation is bad.I will say that all of that was worth it for one of the most amazing views I've ever seen. This is definitely the best view in all of LA. You can see all of LA including the Hollywood sign. The sun sets just near the Hollywood sign and it is gorgeous! The other big plus is that it's free to get in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508marissar
50,The best places in LA,"The best places in Los Angeles. You will have a good view over the city, a good view to a Hollywood sign. There are interesting displays, like Teslas coil. Pay enough parking time - towing is quick, we see several, when coming away. Worth to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
50,Great trip!,"Lovely view point, very interesting observatory. The parking right next to observatory is $4/hour. Watch out it gets really crowded during the weekend and it might be hard to find parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300ewar
50,Must see in LA,"Do not miss the Observatory at Griffith Park if in LA. This is the very best place to see the city from above, with good views on the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Park. Well combined with a trip to Pasadena or the LA Zoo. Bring your own pic nic as there is not too much food and beverages to chose from and everything is expensive. Parking is difficult on week-end and sunny afternoons, so plan ahead and be ready to walk a bit, which is actually quiet nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochassot
40,One of my favorite LA spots,The views can be amazing from the Observatory and surrounding hiking area. You can see a large part of the city. They museum inside is worth a look and the Planetarium show is worth checking out.The parking can be a pain sometimes as you either park at the bottom and catch a shuttle up or park on the way up and walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DynamicFly
40,Great place to view the smog!,"The observatory was closed but the views it offers of LA is amazing, even if you gotta deal with all that Smog. I would love to go up there and see what the telescope can get in this city environment. Not to mention this is a HUGE filming location for many films including ""The Terminator"" and ""Yes Man""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InASenseLost0909
40,Went there thanks to LaLaLand ... but discovered so much more!,"The ride up to the Griffith is already an exceptional thing to do. You get out of busy LA into a world of its own.The observatory is superbely located on top of a hill with amazing vistas over downtown LA and the Hollywood sign.There is a lot to see and explore within the observatory.Don't miss out on the movies in the 3D theater.Although the terrace of the restaurant is great because of the views, the food is appalling and not at all at the level of such a great place the Griffith Observatory is. The quality and choice is mediocre. There is really much room for improvement here. It's like a school canteen with bad quality (and overpriced for what you get) food. That is why I give a very good instead of an excellent.I recommend you walk down from the observatory through the nature reserve to the entrance. It's an amazing walk, not too complicated to find your way down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
50,Incredible view and interesting attractions,The view of LA from the Observatory is amazing. A must see when in LA. You also get a lovely view of the Hollywood sign.The Observatory itself is very interesting with lots of exhibits and demonstrations. A must do is watch a movie in the planetarium- it is spectacular and the highlight of the observatory!We parked around 30 minutes before the observatory open - paid parking does not start until the observatory opens so we got a little bit longer parking for free. It also gave us time to look at the view and take photos so we then had a full 2 hours in the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieDewing
40,Great place... horrid parking,Great views of the Hollywood sign and of Los Angeles and definetly an educational visit for groups and families (make time to visit the planetarium) but the fact it is next to impossible to park (We had to park down the hill and make our way up for about 20 minutes) it does put you off from it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriqueg974
40,Heavenly Bodies,"Visit is spritual as well as educational. So much to learn about facts that in schools stay abstract become concrete here. Excellent presentations on elements and their combinations, time and space. The use of the building in movies make it a must visit on the LA tours list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/231romanas
50,Great view spot,Wow the city views from here are amazing! Definitely worth a visit also the inside is very informational with a lot of things to walk around and look at,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vampslayer01
50,Amazing views,The view here was breathtaking and got some fantastic photos with the hollywood sign in the background. The observatory itself is educational and the cafe has some great options to sit with a view and have a coffee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28becd
50,One of my favorites in LA,"Whether it's for a date night, to show family and friends who are visiting the area, or simply to hike around and get some great LA views, Griffith is always a crowd pleaser. There is a small lot at the top for parking and areas near the top to park, but definitely plan for a small trek to the entrance and allow a buffer time if you're trying to get there at a certain time. Bonus, it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsmetheresac
50,A must when in LA!,"We found out about them gem the night before our last day in LA. Wished we would have had more time to hike some of the trails. The view of the city from the Observatory was amazing!! Lots to do within Griffith Park, check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cpc2177
50,Amazing experience,"What a great experience we had here at the Griffith Observotory. We were able to take a couple of good pictures, see the Hollywood sign (which btw was the ultimate for me) a must do when visiting LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765nataliem
50,Great to visit during the day -- and night!,"We visited Griffith Observatory twice in one day! During the daytime, we hiked up the trail, which was much more difficult than it seemed. We had to take a couple of breaks to catch our breath! But by the time we reached the observatory, it was so worth it! The view of the mountains and the city were stunning! There were a lot of interesting things to see within the observatory, too, including the Tesla coil. Later that night, we drove up to the observatory and took in the view of the LA skyline at night. What a beautiful sight to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganp500
40,Cool Place !,"Well Griffith Observatory is definitely something you should not miss if in LA. The observatory offers breathtaking views of the city and at night you can actually see through the telescopes too ! There are plenty of cool things to see inside the observatory i.e. the Fucul Pendulum and the Telsla coil etc. It is a must visit for science lovers. Also, you can see the famous Hollywood sign from this place and take cool pictures. Or you can take the hike to the sign itself ! I loved the hiking part particularly.Must Visit Place !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mutahirr
50,One of the coolest place on earth,Really love this place . The general entrance is free and there is a couple ways to get there . You can drive all the way up but I warn you go very early or plan to park and walk or you could park at the base of the park and use the trails to get there. I like to read and discover new things so I had a blast. I went with my big brother from Las Vegas and we had a blast. Tons of info . Depending on your speed you can spend from somewhere from 1h-4h it is pretty much up to you. This is a must see to visit . Five stars will not make justice to the Griffith Observatory. By the Hollywood sign that you see on the movies is across from the Observatory if you take the walk trail you can actually go to the sign. God Speed and enjoy your visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Futbolking
50,Panoramic View,"Panoramic view on terrace, free interesting & informative tour in the building. There are both free parking and pay parking at $4/hr. So happy to be here, a good place for good photos taking too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hweeleng65
40,Hollywood Sign,It's a great place to visit and learn about observatories and your able to see the Hollywood sing too. I prefer to go to the Hollywood reservoir for a closer and better view of the sign. On top of the observatory you get an excellent LA and it's smog.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpapadopoulos80
50,fantastic views,done the tourist bus to see more venues the view fro here was breathtaking and got some fantastic photos with the hollywood sign in the background,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhona26
50,Going up the hill for nothing...,"I am giving to this site 5 stars because I have been there several times and the views are spectacular. But, this last past weekend I had 6 friends visiting from the Netherlands we weren't allowed to get in... nobody provided us any kind of information when we asked why...! They just rerouted us out of the park... they were very rude. I was very disappointed not being able to show my friends the view of Los Angeles from that landmark, I was very upset...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AugustoGuerra
50,It's the TOP of My L.A. Must-Sees,"The Griffith Park & Observatory offers so much. From the unique view of the Hollywood sign to the fascinating astronomy exhibits, it is the perfect free & quick tour stop on any L.A. visit.Access is easy and both times I have been, found parking either in the parking lot or along the access road a short walk up to the Observatory. The grounds are clean and have so much to offer, and the Observatory is a beautiful building filled with interesting displays. The grounds are fun to explore, including a hilltop view of downtown, and the rest of the Los Angeles basin that stretches for miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain

50,Seen in movie so many times,"I wanted to see the structure and area around it because of seeing it in movies yet it was fascinating. The position of the observatory looking over so much of Los Angeles with the Hollywood sign also. The different displays were very interesting. Even the lobby was painted with details and of course I had to see where they filmed LaLa Land.The structure was most impressive. Interesting doors, nook and crannies everywhereThe staff was friendly including the parking area staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabykat7
40,LA,"Parking was difficult, but not impossible. Little annoying that it gets dark later, but the site still closes at 10 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millerle25
50,Interesting and great views,"The observatory has a lot of shows going on each day that are very well done and interesting. Plus, there are displays on each level where you can meander around and actually learn something new. Surrounding the observatory are spectacular views of LA. It is something you shouldn't miss while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfc4749
50,"Amazing views, amazing show!","This is an amazing LA institution and you could spend all day here if interested in space and astronomy. Secondly, the views are out of this world. In one direction you can see up to the Hollywood sign and you have unbeatable views out to Greater LA in the other direction. The Planetarium show (get your tickets early, it's popular and there are queues) shouldn't be missed and is a steal at USD $7 for an engaging 40 minute trip into space (the rest of the exhibits are free). The exhibits are numerous and high quality and the information on display is extensive.In summary, this is an LA experience that needs to be on the top of your list. Lots of movies have been shot here too (the most recent being La La Land, though the planetarium scene was a set as you cannot film in there). Food is average and I'd avoid the coffee unless desperate for a caffeine hit. Try to stay until sunset for the best views and photo opportunities. I'd also recommend coming early in the day as traffic up the hill gets crazy after dark.A memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7
40,Great view of LA from a short drive,"I hike from Griffith park to the observatory, landscaping wise is not impressive but you can see the city while going up. Building is pretty from outside but nothing special in the inside. It is free to get in but you have to pay for exhibitions, as usual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josu_n184
20,Turned out to be ok!,"We googled ""Hollywood Sign"" and wound up here, paid $4.00 an hour and hiked up a steep mountain side only to find NO Hollywood Sign!!! Not the Observatories fault.Since we had already paid the parking we decided to partake in the Observatories amenities.My Daughter enjoyed it and it made for great memories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599trishp
50,Best welcome to LA,"First time in LA. Local friend decided this would be my first LA experience. It did NOT disappoint. For any astronomy lovers, this place is everything.

40,Griffith Park Observatory,"Great outing for both Tourist and Locals.The museum, park grounds and spectacular views are free.Parking is limited and difficult.

40,Views of Los Angeles so pack a picnic,Great views of L.A. take you time strolling or hiking the area at your leisure. Pack a picnic if you like and just lay down a blanket on the front lawn area. Hiking trails and horseback rentals nearby. There's a theater and museum like displays inside the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatvr4

50,A peaceful retreat away from the city,The Observatory itself is a beautiful art deco building and the surrounding park is great to explore and hike up to get even better views across the city to the coast. It is all free to go around and there are decent toilets and water fountains inside. There are some exhibitions inside the observatory and you can go up to the telescope/upper levels which give great views. There is a bus from the city you can get up to the park/observatory but we waited for hours getting it back in the eve due to delays linked to a concert at the Greek.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judokick
30,Griffith View,Great view of the city and the Hollywood sign. It was our second visit and would definitely go again. Lunch at the Little cafe was good and reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueC1965
30,Great views of LA and Hollywood Sign,We went at night and were able to park right at the observatory. Although the building is closed in Monday's we were still able to walk the grounds and see great views of LA. Unfortunately the LA sign is not lit up at night. I recommend Lake Hollywood Park for viewing the Hollywood sign during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmaier1969
40,Quick stop in,Pretty cool place. Wish we would have had more time to hear the presenters. Incredible views. Get there early or prepare to walk a ways in. It's with the walk but if you avoid walking like the plague then be early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T126UTjamesg
50,Great place,Very nice place to walk around. We had our two dogs with us and it was nice to walk around outside and there were wonderful views. I went in alone to look around while my husband sat outside with the dogs. But I didn't stay long or really explore since it wasn't as fun without my husband. Wish we would've gone back though at night to see the pretty views because I'm sure it is beautiful too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/947mycas
50,Are we alone in the universe?,"Though is an old telescope, you can still watch the stars; inside, you can learn about seasons, eclipses, stars, planets, and everything you always wanted to know about the universe.

40,Excellent views of LA,We caught the bus transfer which dropped us off right outside the Observatory. A lot of people parked and walked but you would have to be relatively fit. Pleasant stroll around the observatory. Have a coffee and admire LA from high plus the Hollywood sign. Not much haze on the day we visited. Excellent guide informed us on the noon time on the sundial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/668DavidM668
50,A must see when in LA!,"It's FREE! See the famous HOLLYWOOD sign in the beautiful Hollywood Hills. Amazing view of the city! Time well spent! You can either drive the winding roads to the top and view from your car or choose to park along the very crowded roads and walk up to the observatory. Uphill jaunt but take your time and enjoy the beauty of trees, hills, and blue skies. Benches are set along the walk if you want to pop a squat!! Great place to people watch as this is a very popular park and attraction!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lareinej
50,Hike here,"I hiked here from Hollywood Blvd during the day using Google maps - it was great exercise then afterwards I walked down the hill and caught an Uber back to my starting point because I had been out for the whole morning and needed lunch ASAP.Wear sunscreen and take water, wear good shoes and take heaps of photos. The view is worth it. While I was there nothing was open so take some snacks as well just in case.I didn't get to see it at night but I have heard its really nice, I wouldn't recommend hiking there at night alone though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/574nicoleb
40,"This in a nice place to go hiking with family, friends or even by yourself.",You can go for a hike and then go to the museum or just simply go for the nice view of Los Angeles at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alhdz89
50,Worth Many Visits!,"The Griffith Observatory is a place that even I, as a native of SoCal can never get enough of! We started with field trips as kids, but now, there is just SO much to see, with a lot of interactive displays. It's really a lifetime of interesting things to see and do. My husband and I usually try to go twice a year. We never seem to get tired or bored up there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lab-girl666
40,"Beautiful view of LA city, the Hollywood Sign. If you like hiking, this is the place for you.","The drive up to the Griffith Observatory is actually fun. Parking space may be difficult specially during weekends and long weekends. However, once you make it to the Observatory, you actually enjoy the breeze, the scenery and breath-taking views of LA city and surrounding communities. Best time to travel is during spring because of the greenery of the vegetation and cool weather. If you are into science, you may actually enjoy the museum inside the observatory. What makes the observatory special for me is actually ability to be out in the open. You may hike up or down the many trails around the observatory. The hikes are from easy to moderate so families with small children can actually enjoy the many trails. If you like taking pictures, the observatory will not disappoint you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/780arturom
50,Worth a look!,So much better than expected. Stopped for a photo opportunity and ended up going into the observatory. It was amazing and none of our party has any interest in astrology.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crawfora
50,Family fun,Amazing! A true LA gem!!! If you come to LA this a must see spot! You can enjoy the great views at any time of the day! It's a breath taking place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221leticiag
40,Beautiful views,"Historic observatory with great views. Interesting museum, but pretty crowded the day we were there, making it hard to really take in the exhibits (we were there in the late afternoon). Buses with large groups of folks taking many, many pictures. We had not realized that it was such a huge tourist spot. I'd suggest getting there first thing in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LI-fam
50,The best LA has to offer!,"Los Angeles is extremely challenged when comparing it's attractions to other cities, even within California. The city has nothing to compare to the Louvre or the Tate Modern, or even Balboa Park, but the Griffith Observatory is the closest thing to the real thing as a genuine attraction. The exhibits are extensive and fascinating, the planetarium shows are inexpensive and highly entertaining, and best of all, Griffith Observatory has actual ambiance! That's something highly lacking at other LA attractions like Hollywood and Universal City.One downside is that the parking at the Observatory level is limited, so if you drive there you may need to be prepared to hike (and I do mean hike) up to it from a lower parking lot. And in Los Angeles in the summer be prepared to sweat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483warrenm
50,A must see while living/visiting LA!!,"Gorgeous views, incredible architecture an a real treat for all ages! It is one of the many things you have to visit (at least once) when you are in LA. Go during the day or at night, and I guarantee you... you will be mesmerized!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627mariaelenav
50,a great panoramic view of LA...a must if you are in LA,"I love the atmosphere of the Observatory,you can spend a day ther if you wish,so much to take in ...always a crowd..summertime they will have different activities on certain days,holidays...check the web for that kind of info",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lahotelsLosAngeles
50,Be prepared to walk.,"This wonderful get away has hiking picnic beautiful scenery, bring food!!The observatory offers art, science and some interactive toys!! A must have everything gift shop. A place to eat, but it is often crowded. Bring your camera, the scenes and places to capture beauty is limitless. The hiking trails have hidden fun gems so you have to explore, from swinging ropes to climbs to see all of LA. Enjoy the different species of plants and trees. It is hard to get this adventure spot done in one day. Don't forget the concert hall. When your done a drive down the hill to some food, can't be picky when so many different options to choose from...Hope you enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8376LAninap

50,A trip to see the real stars,This Los Angeles landmark has to be seen. It is not only educational but scenic and and lightning. The stars you see here are the real deal not the ones on the big screen it's. It's an LA landmark don't miss it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolfgangkupka
50,"This is a must see site in Los Angeles. Perfect view, day and night. Perfect art deco monument building.","This beloved building has been a star in Los Angeles both in person and in movies.

40,Nice Mother's Day,"Went up to Griffith Observatory with my family. Didn't think it would be so crowded but everyone had the same idea. Very crowded! We were able to park down the hill and take the bus up, only .50 each way for adults. Beautiful views and a lot to see. All of the planetarium shows were booked though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/logandf
40,Welcome to CALIFORNIA,"Great place to go with Kids, you can walk, strollers, or teenagers.nice way to teach the kids about our solar system and earth.

10,Griffith Observatory Parking is Terrible.,"My Nephew and his wife were visiting from China. Having visited the Griffith Observatoryyears ago, I thought they would be impressed with the view and the Observatory.I thought going during the middle of the week and during the early afternoon, it would be an easy visit. To my dismay, there was absolutely no parking unless you were in the mood to take a 30 min hike. We drove around the area several times, but no luck.It's a shame what has happened to tourist driven LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palihi
50,"Beautiful views, great shows, information galore. For all ages.","I was surprised by the amount of information clearly labeled and exhibited with hands-on exhibits. The shows were also movie industry caliber and very in -depth. I went at 12 and then the next day at 2pm. Both times the parking lots were full but helpful staff directed you to empty spots. I did not take the shuttle to the top and instead Ubered up there, but it's available for those who need it down at the bottom of the long drive. There is a decent cafe with a Childrens Menu. Loads of seating areas to eat and take in the view of the Hollywood sign. This view is THE best of the Hollywood sign I've ever seen from many different LA spots. There are many terraces and levels to explore. I went back twice because there is too much to see.At night you can stay for the 7:45pm Observatory telescope viewing of the heavens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaC1964
50,Beautiful scenery,"We had heard good reviews of Griffith Observatory so decided to take a look for ourselves. We were pleasantly surprised that it was a free day out - surprising in LA. The inside of the building was very interesting with lots of interesting things to look at and see, especially to those with an interest in astronomy and science.The views were breathtaking, with a great view of the Hollywood hills and of course the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295lob
50,A must see observatory,"I had heard of this observatory and had seen it from a distance on the mountain next to the famous Hollywood sign. Since I am a science teacher I wanted to go. This observatory has so much info on our solar system. The presentations are clear and easy to understand. The Tesla coil demonstration is cool. I also got to watch a planetarium show ""Centered in the Universe"". It was very well done and the storyteller was effective in keeping everyone engaged. The view of the city of Los Angeles puts everything in perspective.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhondal482
50,Educational!,"Outstanding, very educational and affordable. Can't wait to return with the grandkids. We loved the views and the observatory show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyhowitt
50,overwhelming,"The best way to experience the nature round LA and the best view over the city, is indeed to take a walk through the Griffith park and up to the Griffith-observatory. The views are truly breathtaking! The observatory itself is great place to spend and afternoon and learn about our universe. Beautiful architecture as well. Good restaurant. Don't miss the James Dean monument!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tzenko
40,Great place!,"Everything about this place is good, the views, the exhibits but the show was awful, the lady that was giving the presentation was sooo bad! You couldn't even listen to her voice, it was way to dramatic. If someone is reading this review, please tell that lady to tone it down, it's not about her, it's about learning about the night time sky. Anyway, place is cool, it's free and worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I5470VVaaronw
50,Great views and very informative,We enjoyed the visit to Griffith Observatory. The views of LA and beyond are impressive and the interior of the observatory has wonderful educational exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LordFairfax
40,Gorgeous setting.,"This is a good place to visit day or night. It is an educational observatory. You will learn a lot. We were disappointed that there were not tons of telescopes there. The line for the large one was really long so we did not view in it, but we were able to view Jupiter from a smaller one. This is a great place to view the Hollywood sign. And there are lots of walking paths all through Griffith Park. Fortunately there was a shuttle to take us from free parking along Vermont.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1619YVpatc
50,Best Place I've Ever Visited!!!,"When I knew I was going to LA, a visit to this place was at the top of my list. I was not disappointed. The absolute highlight of my 2 week Stateside trip. The observatory itself is free entry and has lovely views of LA from the top, beautiful on a sunny day. The best part however was the Samuel Oschin Planetarium which I can only describe as magical. You feel like you're looking up at the night sky surrounded by all the stars. The narrator made it all the more special. I would honestly go back to LA from UK just to see another show. Truly astounding! Go on a weekend and you can get the bus straight there for like a $1.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbieb856
40,Highly recommend not going on a Saturday night,We decided to just go last minute and check out the observatory mostly just to see some nice la evening skylinesWe had rented a car for the day and had done the pch and Getty VillaFor the evening we had planned to go to the Grove and have a little bit of shopping time and dinnerThat's when we thought let's check out the observatoryBy the time we got there it was almost sunset and severely backed up … But since we were already there and a convertible we decided to just enjoy the surroundingsIt took about half an hour to get up to the top and we got lucky and had a spot just in the upper parking lotWe got some wonderful shots of the Hollywood sign and la at sunset and then on our way out the night skylineWe were able to walk through the observatory and see most of it and also the Leonard Nimoy filmIt was pretty much body to body in the main areas but that would be expected on a Saturday night so we will definitely go back in the future and be sure to pre-book attractions to take advantage of everything they have to offer there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happygotravel2014
30,Nice views atop,"Great views if the city, parking atop, but get there early as it gets crowded. Great place for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipAz
40,Wish we had spent more time here,We tried to pack as much into 3 days as possible and ended going up to the observatory one evening. The parking was tricky but well worth it.The panoramic views of LA were breathtaking. As the title states though I just wish we had gone up an hour or more earlier maybe even at sunset to really make the most of this free attraction!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7835JCbenp
40,First night in LA,"I was exhausted from a full day of travel, but wanted to do something on my first evening in LA. The Griffith Observatory is a free option, located in the mountains of Griffith Park, and offering spectacular views of the valleys, mountains, city, and Hollywood sign. The planetarium show has a minimal fee, but other than that, the entire place is free, and is easily accessed by the DASH Observatory Transit, which also stops at the Greek Theater, and costs 50 cents. The staff were all very friendly, the views breathtaking, and the exhibits interesting. There are also live demonstrations once an hour of a real tesla coil, which was neat. I didn't see a show, but planetarium shows are generally very neat, and the Leanord Nemoy Event Horizon Theater (the other show) is free, so you're not out anything if you don't like it. There is food and a gift shop on site, as well as working telescopes on the roof (with 30-45 minute wait times to use on a Friday night)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
40,One of the best city views,"The final drive up to the top will take you past some stunning houses. As you approach the top you will see signs for free parking but don't get fooled, it's a tortuous walk up from there so well worth the $4 to park at the top (the machines don't take cash). On a busy day you might get moved on and find yourself heading back down with little chance of a spot along the road. Just keep going and you will find the way to drive back up - just tell the attendant you saw someone coming out and he might let you enter the car park. The view of the city is fabulous and the 'Hollywood' sign is clearly visible. Most of the observatory is free to enter and well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginAgent
50,Fantastic building and free.,Griffith park has fantastic walks and the observatory sits at the top. Spectacular views of LA. Interactive activities and shows (7 dollars for an adult) which we thoroughly enjoyed. We took the local dash bus for 50 centand so had no problems with parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edelconn

50,Amazing!,This is not a drive for the faint of heart! Once you arrive it is week worth the knuckle grip drive. Amazing city views! Great view of the Hollywood sign! Nice trails. Very informative and FREE! You do pay to park and may have to walk a little way uphill but is very reasonably priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916stacieg
30,"Views are great, but overrun with people","Parking is a challenge and the place is overrun with people, but the views are great. Be patient and grab the first parking spot you see as you approach the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marblehead750
50,"Second favorite ""museum"" type attraction","Spent hours here! Great for kids! Wonderful for homeschoolers. Highly recommend as a full day, bring a pic Nic basket event.Located a top magnificent views of Los Angeles and the HOLLYWOOD sign.2800 East Observatory Rd. Los Angeles, CA 90027Admission and parking are always free, but parking is extremely problematic.Since we have disabled plates on our vehicle, we were allowed to park closer to the observatory in a specially marked area. The observatory however, is not wheelchair friendly (although it is wheelchair accessible).The Samuel Oschin Planetarium is not to be missed! Ticket prices per show are $3 for children under 13. Adults and Children 13 years and older $7.00 There is no late seating, no exceptions and no refunds, so line-up early so as to not miss the show.We saw two light shows and both were a delight and worth the ticket price.Centered in the Universe – “takes visitors on a journey of cosmic exploration and discovery.” –Observatory siteLight of the Valkyries – “75th anniversary show reveals the wonders of the northern lights.” –Observatory site.Watching our daughter watch the shows, was one of those parental moments that brings great joy. To see her wonder and excitement was a thrill. She has as much interest in dinosaurs as the next child but her interest in astronomy is even greater. She could have watched those shows over and over again.Had our trip been longer, we would have made a second visit to Griffith Observatory, and we hope to go again the next time we visit Los Angeles.This museum was really well designed for taking in exhibits in bite size portions. There are two levels and many of the exhibits are small enough for individual viewing, some even had holograms.The cafeteria prices ranged from affordable to expensive. They accommodated vegans, which was nice. I had a small cup of steamed, cajan spiced yams that were DELICIOUS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glamour_traveler
50,Wow - what a view!,"If you are visiting LA, this place is a must! The views are amazing and the walking options, to get that little bit closer to the Hollywood sign, were excellent. Expect to pay $4.00 per hour to park your car, but entry to the observatory is free. You can choose to pay extra for certain shows inside (around $7), but there is plenty to see and do without having to open the wallet. We fully recommended you add the Griffith Observatory to do your LA to do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidaymaker117
50,Good for viewing and knowledge.,Traffic is more free flowing and organized now and parking is more convenient even with the $4 per hour fee. There are lots or of things to see and some free spot presentations being given by volunteers of the observatory where lots of new knowledge can be acquired or refreshed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drokis0301
40,"Sunset, view of the city",I went around maybe 4pm during the fall and was able to see the sunset. While you are up there you are able to get a view of the city as well as the Hollywood sign. Although not close views but still breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laney0941
40,Great views!,"We were in the Hollywood area and found this to be the perfect, ""quick and dirty"" stop to get a sense of LA before we headed to the desert. Easy access, free parking before noon and wonderful 280 degree views of the city make this a no-brainer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockridgeC

30,Out of the wat,The observatory is really out of the way and the view of the Hollywood sign is quite far. Don't really recommend this unless you want to do the 4 mile hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conanton
50,Amazing Place to Visit,"The Griffith Observatory is very amazing, but it is very busy. Everything is free to see; however, I do recommend that you take a taxi, Lyfte, or Uber because the traffic can be a little busy. Also, you can look through the telescope, however, it is sometimes hard to get a clear night in Los Angeles. If you have time check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessew554
50,An artistic scientific spectacular.,"There is so much to do here at the Griffith Observatory! You could spend many hours just perusing all the displays, but you could stick to the highlights and complete the visit in a couple of hours if you are short on time. Make sure you appreciate the Foucault Pendulum as you walk in from the main entrance and look up and see Atlas holding up the horoscopes; checkout the Tesla's coil; and of course, you must not miss the opportunity to look through the Zeiss 12"" refracting telescope. The view from the roof is absolutely breathtaking and to make your visit even more special, come around sunset! If you are driving, be prepared to walk a fair distance up the hill as parking space at the top is scarce. All of this for free as the observatory was a gift from its founder Griffith J Griffith to the city of Los Angeles in 1896.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinatee
50,A must for nerds and non-nerds alike,"Visiting the Griffith Observatory has been on my To Do list for as long as I can remember. I actually think it's a good thing it took me so long to get around to it because a couple of decades ago I'm not certain that the view of Los Angeles would've been too impressive thanks to the decades LA spent under a thick blanket of smog. Now that the skies are significantly cleaner, the view to the valley below (and the Hollywood sign a couple of hills over) is worth the trip up the mountain even without going inside the Observatory.Having said that, you really shouldn't skip going inside! The displays and guided information offer an easy-to-grasp 101 on the nature of the universe and earth's place therein. It's easy to believe that bus loads of school kids would be happy to spend a field trip here because the displays are interesting and hands on. Meanwhile, adults can be just as engaged - there's a little something for everyone.Plus there's a Tesla Coil that is sure to impress even the most jaded of your smartphone-carrying youngsters.Finally, a small comment on the building itself: it's an excellent (and well maintained) example of its era - absolutely beautiful and so evocative of LA's beginning as a forward-looking bastion of modernity steeped in sunshine and dreams.Don't wait as long as I did. There's much to enjoy in the experience, including getting up the mountain on a picturesque road filled with people out and about, enjoying their day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fiveandfour
50,Best place to go for an amazing L.A. view,"The observatory structure and architecture is magnific. It has different level that you can go to and take pictures of the city or the hollywood sign.It's crowded on weekends and hard to park, so spect delays going up hill and try to find a parking spot near the top by the side of the road to save time, if the top parking lot is full. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariano_Arg10
40,Views are so cool!,"I visited this before La La Land came out and it made me appreciate the movie so much more. Now, if you've seen La La Land, you need to visit the Observatory! It's so cool to walk around inside, and then the views outside are amazing. We went at night and the city lights were so cool to see since we were so high up on the hill! It's free, so definitely check it out even if you aren't into space and constellations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristentuell
50,Fabulous facility,"This is a great place to visit. It sits atop the hills right next to the Hollywood sign. You park either along the curb of the steep hill or in the parking lot on top. Both charge a fee of about $4/hr. The actual observatory is free. There are shows you can buy tickets for which are well worth it. There are many displays that explain planet orbits, seasons, eclipses, and atmospheres. There are times during the day when you can see the telescope room and in the evening you can look through it. The grounds and facilities are lovely. It's a wonderful observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancycA5997LT
50,NEED AT LEAST 2-3 HOURS,"We spent too much time at Getty Center (rated #1) and were not able to see any of the planetarium shows or even see the lower floor exposition. Wee took Uber from our Hollywood hotel as in the evening all the parking spots were taken, as I expected. They close at 10 pm and have a bus for 50 cents that takes people to nearby locations. After 10, taxis and Uber are not able to come up the hill, so you need to take this bus or walk down, unless you are parked somewhere around. Planetarium shows cost $7 per person, all else is free. Great deal for this expensive city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MICHAELTAMPABAY
40,A Fun Family Outing,This is a fun few hours for the family. It would also be a fun casual date. The views are spectacular. The cafe is nice. There is a lot to see and do. A few hours would do it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runningandmusing
50,Sharing time with Family,"Griffith Observatory has been great to visit ever but now after La La Land it has a different magic flavor. You know what your companion and family might be thinking and imagining. This visit would be a time-sharing moment that would create happy memories. Parking could be free if you want to walk but if you preferred to park nearby the Observatory, it won’t be too expensive. I hope you get a clean air day to enjoy the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356pauloo
50,Amazing views!,"So glad we took the drive up to the observatory. We were lucky to have a beautiful, clear day. Views were spectacular. Probably also one of the best views of the Hollywood sign. The observatory itself is a beautiful building. We stopped at the Trails cafe near the bottom in Griffiths Park and it was a nice little stop with great homemade pie and tasty treats. I'm very glad we got to see this incredible place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LORENA118
50,Beautiful View of L.A.,The Griffith Observatory is one of my favorite places in L.A. The view of the city is beautiful at sunset and the museum inside is insightful and free! This is definitely worth a visit and you can have an uber take you up if you don't want to worry about parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelsO9688TR
40,Does what it says on the tin,"Amazing views. There was traffic driving up the hill, don't know if this normal but could prove costly in a taxi. Plenty of spots for a great photo! If your going LA you got to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BacardiGurpz

50,"The views are amazing, but check out the inside too!","The outside views will take your breath away, especially during sunset, but don't forget to wander inside for some truly beautiful interiors in the art deco style. The painting on the dome is particularly beautiful, and there are learning experiences scattered throughout. Check out the exhibits, the shows, and the architecture. Even the restrooms are beautifully decorated. The grounds are also vast and gorgeous, so plan at least an hour or so to explore and see the different views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jambles84
50,You gotta go here to see all of LA spread out,I've been visiting LA on business forever. Finally there for a family event and took the time on a clear Saturday to make it to the Griffith Observatory. I've been wanting to visit it forever. A must see in my opinion. Glad I was finally able to do it. Parking was tough on a Saturday afternoon. Consider a bus/cab/lyft if going at a busy time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399kenn
50,A Must See,If you're ever in Los Angeles this is a must see stopping place. There is reasonable paid parking at the top (only $4.00) but it is well worth it. You can also park on the street but will have to walk a little distance to get to the Observatory. The view is spectacular both during the day as well as at night. If you want to go to the Observatory you will need to check the hours ahead of time. So much to see outside as well as inside. You will not regret stopping here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bnj1984
30,Parking is Horrible,"We've got a pair of teenage girls who wanted to get a good picture of the Hollywood sign. We'd heard this was the place to go. Not the best it turned out. Mid week at mid day is not the time to come. The traffic was insane, and parking was a joke. Halfway up the hill, the wife and girls hopped out and walked up. By the time I arrived at the parking lot, they were ready to hop on. Views of the city were great from here, but local family later told us a better spot for pics of the sign. We didn't return though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffkM2101UB
50,Great place for an easy 2~3 hours,"Was driving around Los Angeles for the afternoon and chanced upon this observatory. You can tell from the number of guests that this is one of the attractions near the city, and the view of Los Angeles was stunning. Exhibitions inside were interesting too, and you can see a gigantic telescope as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unagipai

50,"Wonderful to Visit, but not on a Weekend","We attempted a return visit after a 30 year absence. Our mistake was to go on Saturday. What we found was a traffic jam, with 2 lanes operating at stop-and-go, and no place to park. Had we found a place to park it would have been $4 an hour.My advice is to go weekdays, and go early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nelsuza
50,Worth seeing...Perfect Hollywood Sign Pic...,"Even though the drive up to the Griffin observatory is somewhat difficult due to construction, it was definitely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fatdes

50,Beautiful Views,"Great Place to spend an hour or two. Beautiful architecture with wonderful 360 degree views of LA and surrounding area. The observatory has been transformed into an informative museum with dozens of displays on three levels and a roof-top viewing area. There is also a theater and a restaurant. Expect crowds on weekends. You will hear dozens of languages in this international popular destination. If it is busy, park below and walk up - the crowded parking lot next to the observatory can be an hour long traffic jam to negotiate. It is worth a visit without even entering the observatory, just for the views and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JWBGrapevine
50,Beautiful view and fun to go inside,It can be hard to find a parking spot but if you are willing to street park you can easily do that but will just have to walk a little bit. It's steep but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethW1548
50,Excellent day out.,"Get the bus up otherwise a long long walk to the top. The views of LA are amazing and of the Hollywood sign. The observatory has recently been renovated and extended and has more exhibits. Good to look around. Would be a good place to bring a picnic. There is a small cafe, seemed a bit pricey and not the best choice of food ever. Free to get in to the observatory which is great. Try and walk down the hill if you are able. Would be great to come in the evening and see the city all lit up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jethro12345
50,Saw jupiter and northern lights show,"Fantastic place to enjoy the sunset, night skyline and get a glimpse of solar system buddies. Loved the northern lights show. Parking is very difficult and may require a bit of hiking uphill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetpea_pinkrose
50,It doesn't open on Monday!,We went to see the Hollywood sign from here. The observatory itself doesn't open on Monday. On other days it opens on 12pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazelhuijiez
40,Beautiful views of Hollywood and the LA skyline - Great place to take pictures,"My son and I really enjoyed this experience. The observatory was very busy and we did have to wait a short period of time to see everything. It was worth the wait. We seized the great photo taking opportunities from the observatory. You could clearly see the HOLLYWOOD sign, LA skyline, and Hollywood hills. It was breathtaking. Parking is a challenge. They have two parking lots. I would avoid parking in the lower level parking lot as it is a very long walk up hill to get to the observatory. They do charge for parking at the upper parking lot and it was definitely worth it. Several of the parking pay stations were not working when we arrived. Overall, I would recommend the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anita767
50,Gorgeous views,"Long lines are to be expected to get there, however; I am sure it was long due to the time of our visit. We went at dusk to watch the sun go down. The views don't disappoint!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2480KQkimh
50,Excellent views,Amazing view of the Hollywood sign and surrounding area . Worth a visit and fantastic for picture taking. We did it as part of a tour . Definitely worth a stop . Won't take you long .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724jayd
50,"Top of the world...Hollywood sign, downtown LA amazing views","Was just going for a photo of the Hollywood sign, but this place is amazing. Parking lot is very busy, but if patient, spots open up. Inside the observatory is some really cool free attractions...A huge swinging pendulum, displays about moon phases, tides, planets. You can also pay a small fee to see other attractions inside the observatory, but we just walked around for an hour and still had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slyke18
50,Awesome views,"It was our last stop at the observatory as we wanted to watch the 🌅 sunset! It was spectacular and you can also take pictures with the Hollywood sign from there even a bit far but still great location. Inside of observatory is super interesting, the guides know everything and we learned loads of cool things about star matter and begining of our planet Earth. Parking is a bit crazy but lots of people hike there its not that bad hiking:) have a great time 👌👌",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cvetelinakrokeva
40,Great place,Great displays of interest to all superb planeterium display well worth $5. Science is made undertandable to all with great displays and explanation. Views at sunset outstanding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Razor56
50,Go in the late afternoon to get the perfect sunset view of LA,Good place to have a wonderful view of LA and the Hollywood sign. It will be good to go there 1 hr before sunset to get the day and night views of LA. The parking was full and closed on the day we visited so we just park along the road and walk up the slope. It is worth the effort as the view was simply stunning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WT_Tong
50,Incredible!!,"WOW!👍🏻👏🏻🌟❤️Take a Bow, Griffith Observatory. wife thought we'd stay for an hour - she was happy to stay for over 3!Views of LA were stunning - before and after dark. The trip up was good enough for that alone. Went on weekend so was able to catch shuttle bus up. Photos do no justice to the reality of the views though. Have to see it in person. But inside was just outstanding. ( there were a few LA locals with visiting friends who kept trying to downplay it because of their familiarity but don't care - I went into GEEK OVERDRIVE with the displays in there. non nerd wife loved it too. I think I brought back the whole museum in videos and photos so I won't forget. It's not everyone's cup of tea but for me an early favourite for Best on trip ( Big Bang taping, Seinfeld and New Orleans Jazzfest have some competition!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR
50,Beautiful Sight to see Los Angeles,It is nice to walk around the grounds and look for miles. The parking is hard to fine you have to pay for a meter 4 hrs. It is very busy go in the morning before 12 parking is free and not so busy. You can walk along so many trails on mountain. It is not for people that can not walk the hills are steep even the parking area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546
40,Best views at night,"We went at dust and watched the city light up for us. Parking was difficult due to the popularity from the LaLa Land movie, but be patient, something will open up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StarDazzled
50,The view is worth the trip,"The Observatory is at the top of a high hill in the Griffith Park. It costs nothing unless you pay for a planetarium show and $4 per hour to park. You see the sights of the building itself and get a terrific view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. A winding, narrow road leads you to the top. Expect crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomand
50,Perfect views!,I stopped here as part of a tour and can't praise this place enough!Beautiful location...the views are spectacular! Has a real romantic feel about the place! A must do when in the city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gordejczuk90
40,amazing views but very busy on a sunday,"me and my partner went on a sunday, big mistake i thiink as it was jam packed with tourists, it took us ages to actually get to the observatory as the traffic was insane. once we got there the views were amazing, it was a little rainy to start but once it brightened up the views got better. i would recomend to go on a sunny day. got pics wit the hollywood sign too. the planitarium shows were sold out as there was so many people. our uber driver who took us up says the tourists have tripled since La La Land was released. we thought it would be easier to get the Dash bus back down to town so we waited as the sign says the next one would be in 7 minutes then suddenly jumped up to 30 minutes so we called another uber and it turned up the same time as the bus. dont rely on the Dash bus timetable as I think they just turn up when they can. worth a visit for the view alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anniemoonpie
50,Fantastic Place To Visit,"Visited with 14 & 20 yo and Sister in law and 17yo nephew. Loved this place, heaps to explore, great views over the hills and canyons, can get very busy , highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255100Sunlover
40,Visit,"We took an Uber here which is the best option if you aren't able to walk up that winding roadway to get there.Exhibits were great! Telescope was closed since it was cloudy, which really bummed me out since I had been wanting to see out of one of these powerful scopes!Tesla coil was neat to see in action! An ""ooh aw"" moment!Best of all, FREE! Thank you Griffith Griffith for creating this educational place for all to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpicSpirit11

50,Just amazing,"While on our honeymoon to Los Angeles, of course the Griffith Observatory was on our list of places to visit!It's simply stunning! The views are breathtaking. Never seen anything like it.. And that's before you walk through the door!!The entire place is really impressive! I had a really bad headache when we visited so we didn't spend enough time here to really take it all in. But still loved every second of our visit!I'd definitely recommend and would love to return one day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyrant_virus
50,Best View of LA,"From the observatory you get a wide view is the city of Los Angeles as well as the Hollywood sign. Aside from the spectacular view there several interesting things inside, where you learn about space and physics of the earth. Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabrielfarme
50,Incredible,"""The view was absolutely amazing"" This was one of our favorite stops while we were in California. Could have spent the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496junef
50,Worth the trip,After seeing this iconic building feature in LA LA Land I decided to make it my business to get to it on this trip to LA. Its free but the planatarium experience is 7 dollars but well worth it. At night the view of LA and all its lights is just beautiful. It however gets very busy at the evening and parking is at a premium so i would advise taking an Uber. Well worth a visit especially if you have kids as its very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingdomDublin
40,Coach trip,"Had a lovely few hours here, it a must on a sightseeing tour. Best place in L.A to see the HOLLYWOOD sign unless you can get up close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arran2804
50,Beautiful,"This iconic park is probably one of the best tourist attractions in the area. Not only do you get to learn about the stars but you get to see the Hollywood sign very close. One of my favorite places to visit for sure, it does get crowded so best thing to do is simply get dropped off by uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscomorales
50,Really Impressive Observatory - Good For All Ages - Bad Traffic However,"Visited here on a Tuesday with my teen son on his spring break last month. I loved this place and kicked myself for never having visited it before on my many S. Ca trips. Pros 1) Incredible views of Los Angeles and Hollywood sign! 2) Free observatory, walk around and learn at their numerous stations 3) planetarium show you do have to pay for - they offer student discounts - and it was a fabulous show so worth seeing. Relatively inexpensive. Cons 1) Horrible traffic and parking congestion, even on a Tues a.m. We took a Lyft car and was so happy we did so. 2) LIttle to no wifi connectivity because you're up on a hill so do not plan on using your cell phone. Employees directed me to an area in the parking lot where there is wifi. 3) Avoid their ""restaurant"". We expected something great since it was touted as a Wolfgang Puck menu...but it was overpriced and some of the worst food I've ever eaten. We ate their grab and go sandwiches - horrible. Some people picnicking on the lawn - do that instead or eat before you go OVERALL....loved this place and would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
50,"Education, History, Architecture and James Dean","The story of Griffith J. Griffith, his generosity, his creativity, his paranoia, is a fascinating chunk of Los Angeles history. The views from up here are stunning. Look toward the western horizon and, on a clear day, you'll see Catalina Island. Stand on the roof and get out-of-the-ordinary photos of the Hollywood sign. Go into the building and get educated in ways which have probably never been made available to you before. Afterward, go for a hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobmD9792HR
50,Beautiful Views,"My husband is from Florida and this was on his list of places to go when he moved to California. The view of the city is amazing and you're able to see the Hollywood sign on a clear day. If it's nice out parking can be a bit tricky, but it's a nice way to spend the day with the kids or a date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikadejesus25
40,Fantastic view of LA!,"We trekked up in the afternoon to catch the sun going down, and see the lights of LA. Certainly did not disappoint!!Great observatory with interesting exhibits inside about the universe. Only downside was transport to and from the area, there appears to be only one road in and out, which was clogged with would be star gazers when we tried to leave. The mobile phone reception is also not great meaning hailing an uber or even trying to call a taxi is difficult. Though is certainly a must see if going to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1411WQangelos
50,Great view of the Hollywood Sign,"Living in Washington DC, we get spoiled with free museums. The Griffith Observatory was a great educational adventure on our trip to LA. With amazing views of the Hollywood Sign and a beautiful park, it's a nice break from the hustle and bustle of downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaPetiteAmber
40,"Closed on Mondays , yet the view is terrific","We unfortunately didn't check about the days it is open and reached on a Monday.If you go by public transport, go by the DASH service, which operates from 12 Noon to 10 pm on all days ( Check always beforehand though) from the Vermont- Sunset Red Line subway station, every 20 minutes.It is a short and pleasant ride, good air conditioned buses, and lovely houses along the route.You can get down at the Greek theatre, or the Griffith park, and take the next bus upto the top of the hill, to the Observatory.Though, being a Monday the observatory was closed,Yet the gardens and area around are accessible and the views of LA lovely.We found the afternoon delightfully cool and breezy, and the views of the surroundings, the Hollywood sign in particular spectacular.Glad we made the ascent, even though the observatory was not open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshokP900
50,Exceptional Views!,The Observatory is a must see in LA. It sits atop a very big hill and overlooks the whole city! The view alone is worth going. The observatory does not charge admission and it has dozens of scientific displays for viewing and interaction. Very busy place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992lindad
40,Awesome Attraction (and FREE!),This is a great and necessary thing to see while in LA! The views are AMAZING! And the observatory is something that everyone should experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arwilbourn88
30,Good city view,"Although it's said the best viewing point of HOLLYWOOD sign, I don't think so. But it has the best city view. Too many people inside and outside of the observatory. Too crowded, quite stuffy inside actually. Car is blocked in the middle of the hill, you need to walk about 15 minutes to the spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piaHongKong
50,One of the best!,"I love observatories and try to visit one in each city I go to! Went here with my brother, and loved it! It has spacious outside ground area for walking about and viewing the city in the distance! The observatory itself is great and the planetarium is amazing, I wish shows were an hour long! Def a lovely place to visit during sunset! Highly recommended, one of the top observatories in the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sararJU
50,We went to space ✈️🇺🇸,"I had a once in a lifetime experience of just journeying with those who also sat in the auditorium of the observatory. The story teller described about how water is important to life. She even brought us outside the earth through her stories. It was indeed an unforgettable visit. The museum was very informative, for a person like me who likes stars but didn't have a focused time to study about it, the Griffith Observatory is like a summary and very helpful for me to know beyond what I think I knew about stars, asteroids, outer space and stars. I hope that I'll be able to see different shows aside from the one I attended which was about ""Water is life...""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielleceline
40,A great view!,We went here after reading that it was a good view etc. We parked about 10mins down the hill and walked up which was fine but wouldn't suit an elderly person or anyone with health issues. I have a pretty bad back and made it okay. The views were great and the observatory was interesting. It was super busy and it was a weekday getting through the inside was exhausting so we gave up. I can imagine it would be amazing at night! We enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533katiem
50,You don't have to be a scientist to love this place!,"Griffith Park Observatory is a phenomenal place to visit, even before you to inside. As an observatory, it is, of course, at the highest peak in Los Angeles. That means you can see the city in panoramic view. On a clear day you can see all the way to Santa Monica and the ocean. Of course, you can see the famed Hollywood sign from there, too.The observatory is wonderful for all ages, and nothing is too complex to easily read and wonder at. Two things:1. If you bring children-- and DO! [even if you don't have any, borrow some. Their questions make the visit much more entertaining] know that many of the best things to see are overhead. So look up wherever you go. Every room. Otherwise you'll miss the mural over the Faucoult pendulum and the infrared body heat reader where little boys can be fascinated that their brains are hot.2. If you are not the most athletic 80 year old, bear in mind that unless you come early, you won't be parking close to the building, and again, it's on top of a mountain. TIP: Better than walking up and downhill for a mile, park at the Greek Theatre and take the shuttle bus up.2 hours of wonderfully informative time spent, then outside for unbelievable view, or downstairs for lunch. Oh- and don't forget to see a planetarium show.Below they ask if it is popular with tourists. Locals are the most amazed people there, probably because tourists know what to expect; but one of the best things about it is that people from all over the world are there-- many languages spoken with awed exclamantions. Makes it even more fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happywanderer13
50,Great views,Had a short stroll up the hill from the paid parking. Amazing views and inside was very informative. Ours kids really enjoyed looking at everything. Food in the cafe is expensive for what you get and staff were miserable in there. Take a picnic and sit on the lawns with a great view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencR6482GO
40,Very Informative,Great museum and observatory. One will also see the Hollywood sign of Los Angeles from another vantage point. Be prepared to hike about .3 miles. Maybe hard on a hot day. Free admission. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajiea2016
40,Not easy to get to at times but worth it.,As with the other reviews the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired. If you go before the observatory opens it is a little easier. The view of L.A. and the Hollywood sign is well worth the trip. You get the view of the iconic sign and a nice view overlooking the city. The observatory is very interesting and informative if you have an interest in the our solar system and beyond.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTE1000
10,Stupid parking rules,Oblige people to leave by exit 2. You cannot make any u turn. And all guys in yellow are stupid .2h to go up. 3 to leave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EclairA_12

50,Outside - amazing city and Hollywood sign views. Inside - very interesting exhibitions.,"Outside - amazing city and Hollywood sign views. Inside - very interesting exhibitions. Even if you are not for paid show in planetarium, you can still take a look at exhibits. I really like Solar System area - did not realize that Pluto is so small or that Mars is basically half Earth-size.We have used paid parking (4$/hour) and did not regret it. At around 1:00 pm there where quite many lots and we did not have to climb up the road.Deffinitely worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420agab
30,Overcrowded,It was a zoo after night falls. The traffic to the hill top could be very bad. Hundred of people gather in front of and in the observatory. The view of the city night lights was marvelous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philasian
50,WONDERFUL PLANETARIUM,"The observatory is in a lovely high location in the hills and you can see all of L.A. spread out before you below. Great daytime view and spectacular nightime view of the city lights.The observatory itself was kind of interesting, though I did it find it disappointing. I know a lot about astronomy, and there was nothing new here for me to learn. But it's a great introduction to the cosmos and how incredibly tiny our planet our sun and our entire solar solar system is in the universe.But the planetarium was awesome! A large theatre with all the seats reclined was back facing the ceiling dome above. But when the show starts, the dome turns into an amazing projection of the universe and though the chairs and the floor don't move, you'll swear you are zooming through the universe.If you found this info helpful, please give me a like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cartagia
50,Good place to see night view.,Good place to see night view of LA. You can find invevtion of Nicola Tesla inside of building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayK1217
10,There has got to be a better way.,Left Venice Beach at 6 to get to the observatory by sunset. Bad traffic 1h51 min to parking lot. Aimlessly looking for parking in the dark. Decided to take DASH shuttle. Waited 15 min for the shuttle which was too full to take us and many others. Waited 20 min for next which took another 15 to arrive at the door of the Observatory. We arrived at 9:15. The fog arrive just ahead of us. Many forces working against us tonight. All part of the LA experience 🙁,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9560VKelizabethk
50,Great Views of Downtown LA & More,"Great place from which to see the Hollywood sign and take in spectacular views of much of Los Angeles. Parking could be hit or miss, but the staff was very helpful at the top and if you find parking near the Observatory, it's well worth the $4/hr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/497AndyB497
50,Another Hollywood icon.,"On a cold night we came here, but still amazing.The experience for us was driving up here and from the start it was magical.The road up is famous for many TV and movies being shot in and around this area. We recognised spots like the tunnel used in Back to the Future 2 and more recently, La La Land.Two Terminator movies were filmed here and the hills surrounding it is great for celebrity spotting as many do live in the area and use the trails as part of their fitness regimes.Griffith Observatory has the best views of LA hands down and you get a great view of the Hollywood sign from up there. The observatory itself is unique and the line for the telescope is one thing that you must do.This is one experience I am keen on repeating again on our next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royptravel

50,One of my favorite places in Los Angeles,"This is one of the best places for a hike, to take family to walk around, for a first date, for a last date, whatever the story, this is an incredible backdrop. The planetarium show is mind blowing. The view outside equally as spectacular. Pretty easy to get in and out of as well. I miss going here now that I live 1600 miles away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timj640
50,Appreciate who build this place,"One of the best free place to hang out for a group of friends, tourists, students and whoever love astronomy.Car parking: very well organizedGuider: very cool and friendly, there are several people who can answer your questions about space and planets.View: extremely beautiful! You can see the whole LA from here.Activities: you can see the moon very close, especially its surface. There were several short film shown.Pretty interesting to see things happen to the universe from the beginning and what ingredients make the earth and human bodyThis is one of the places which make me feel that the US people is pretty warm :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VHMVN
50,A true hidden gem,Beautiful views of Los Angeles. An amazing night time experience looking through telescopes at the distant planets and stars. The Hollywood sign so close you can touch it.

40,Brilliant experience,"This place is brilliant views of across LA, its well worth a visit. I would suggest visiting the observatory whilst doing an organised tour of LA. I have been here twice and the first time we made a mistake in using a taxi to get here. That's fine to do but there are no taxis waiting to take you back down again, we had to make the long walk back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisburgess8
50,Perfect!,The view from this place is really beautiful. When you are in LA you have to go to griffith park and observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdelaBlahutova

50,Beautiful Views,It was truly an exprience to visit Grifffith Observatory. The views were fantastic and exhibits inside were very interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3434JRalexk
50,Must see,"During my trips to the Griffith Observatory, I realized there is no good time to go there. It is constantly busy, but with good reason.The grounds and architecture are beautiful, and the view of the Hollywood Sign is possibly the closest you can get legally.Once inside, we paid to see the show inside the Planetarium. Unlike the rest of the place, this is one of the only things you have to pay admission for, and at $7 per person, i'd pay for it every time. The show is incredible and gives you a perspective on the world that you may not have had previously. Sadly though, you don't get to dance in the air like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did in La La Land, but that's a minor detail...The rest of the exhibitions are great to see and you can spend a couple of hours there. Watching the sunset from the Observatory is also great, but be prepared to battle the crowds.Overall, i'd definitely recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patrice2686
50,Best View in LA!,I hike here most weekends and I've learned you need to come early to get parking. They have added metered parking. If you can handle a short hike park below and walk up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denise65818
50,Beautiful place. Must do.,Lots of exhibits and lots of information. Well worth the time to stay longer despite a tight holiday schedule. Cafe price a little steep but expected for such location. Clean toilets in lower floor of the observatory. The outer ground offers great views of the city and worth spending some time walking around too. Car park a headache. We circled round twice and was lucky that someone down the hill was leaving. Do not understand why they have wardens to block out the car park yet we see empty lots in the car park as cars were leaving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pipo2968
50,Action packed day at Griffith,"This was the highlight today at the observatory, but hey what I love most is the seismic detector on the lower ground floor.

The woman narrator had a very clear speaking voice. It was very meditating. Plan on seeing the Observatory again on our next trip. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolS1074
50,Well worth a visit,The Griffith Observatory should be on your 'must do' list for LA as it offers great views of the city and is a nice place to see the Hollywood sign and simply relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Haml
50,Unbelievable views.,"We almost skipped this because we couldn't go at night (I had wanted to look over Los Angeles when it was dark). On a whim, we decided to head over in the day time, and I'm so glad we did. If you don't want to pay for parking, you may have to hike up a big hill overlooking Hollywood/LA. It was so gorgeous, and I was glad we could do that before it was dark. At the top, when you finally reach the Observatory, you'll experience breathtaking views both inside and outside of the attraction. The Observatory itself offers lots of interesting information, 3D designs, and interactive tools pertaining to the sun, moon, stars, and planets. We missed one of the shows, but it seemed there were several movies shown. Do yourself a favor and make this stop a priority.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brooklyn453453
50,"Wonderful site, must see","Beautiful vistas 360. Located up on the hill where you can see the walking trails below, Hollywood sign, downtown LA, Century City, Pacific ocean. Telescopes in many areas to view the surrounding landscapes up close for 50 cents. Free admission to observatory. Daytime sun watching, nighttime moon and star gazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinjaGigi
50,City of Stars..,Keep driving right to the top. We found a space and it saved walking as we stayed till after dark and those roads looked dodgy for walking on. We just loved the view from here especially at night. Would love to come back to see it in the sunshine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mays86
50,Go check it out!,"We don't usually like to check out sights and tourist attractions, but the observatory was absolutely worth our while. The view is just stunning!However, parking can be difficult so we suggest using UBER or Lyft to get up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiyoaki56
50,"Panoramic view, interesting museum and nice view for the Hollywood sign!","During our brief stay in LA we decided to visit the observatory expecting to get the best overlook of the ciy and it didn't disappoint! The observatory itself holds what looked like a very interesting collection, but we saw just parts, as time was really a big constraint. The plus was a close look of the ""Hollywod"" sign, that always holds its magic! From there departs a hike that goes to the sign, but we didn't explore that. Would love to go back in the evening for some night pictures, but even during the day I totally recommend this as a mandatory stop in any visit to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saracX6568XU
50,Educational,Superb exhibits and interpretation. Presentation and layout is top class. Good spend hours there. My LA highlight -along with hockey at the Honda Center. A busy place were parking is under pressure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecilop55
50,"Free Views of LA, Views of the Hollywood Sign. Great Tourist Spot","Whats not to like about the Griffith Observatory. You have amazing views of Downtown LA, You can go for a hike up to the Hollywood sign. You can take a peak in the telescope. You can take amazing pictures of Los Angeles at night. What can I say that not everyone else has added.Plus I'm from LA so this is one of my top places I take people to when they are visiting from out of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dirty56
40,Good free observation museum for great views of Hollywood,"Come here for breathtaking views of the Hollywood sign.For the close view of Hollywood from afar.

40,Great Views!,"Amazing views of the city from the height of the observatory and in the surrounding areas. There are several exhibit halls here as well as planetarium shows that run throughout the day. The info is not too complex and very understandable to a non-scientist like me.They offer telescope viewing at night, but we did not stay around for that. Parking can be a challenge. We arrived at opening but all the parking at the observatory was already taken. We had to park quite a bit downhil. We walked, but I believe there is shuttle service available.The cafeteria was kind of low budget- kind of like hospital cafeteria food. I recommend eating elsewhere before or after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FuzzyKat
50,Worth a visit,Griffith Observatory is perched on top of an hill and has an amazing view of the city. In addition to that it has powerful telescopes which has been deployed for the benefit of the people. There were two operational when we went and we were able to see the Jupiter with its moon as well as moon...best time to visit is post sun set.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
30,Beautiful sunset,I went to Griffith for sunset but I did't had time to visit the observatory.You can walk freely around the place and get a 365 degrees views on L.A.

50,Amazing Views!,"We visited The Griffith Observatory during the day and the views were amazing! Definitely worth visiting, lots to see and a great view of the Hollywood sign. There's a few shows that you can watch however unfortunately the time slots vary so do check them prior to your visit. We would recommend visiting in the evening (sunset) to get the chance to look through the telescope which was closed at the time we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mehar18
50,"Amazing, Must-See Attraction in LA.","We visited on a Friday afternoon on a day with perfect weather. It was a bit of a wait to get up to the park and find a parking spot, but not bad at all. Parking is reasonable ($4/hour) but the observatory and grounds are FREE. Gorgeous views and really cool art deco architecture. The grounds are immaculate, and the observatory exhibits are interesting and informative. For the price, this is a must-do when visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodyPWM
50,What an amazing place,What a cool place to visit. the views of the city are stunning and the hills are even better. We got to see the Leonard Nemoy theater and learn about the expansion and renovation of the Observatory. Hiking around the site was great fun too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773jeffreyj
40,"A lot of people, but nice views","There were lots of people (I guess there always is), the weather was warm so it was nice spending time there. We left our car quite far away, and then walked up to the observatory. Bring good shoes, the path is quite steep if you walk there!Even though the weather was sunny and clear, the views to the city were misty, we really couldn't see the skyline at all.But the views to the Hollywood hills were amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annv359
40,Interesting place to visit,"Very interesting museum to visit. Technological museum that explains about the universe, stars and all related about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RenatoCarneiro

40,Informative,So we went and luckily could see jupiter that day.. The telescopes were set and we could view both jupiter with its moons and our moon.. Quite educational,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddhi261
50,"Excellent views, you learn a lot, and its fun place to go","After living in LA for over 30 years and visiting Griffith Park this was my first time to the observatory. The views were spectacular and lots of people were hiking the surrounding trails. Inside are many displays to teach you about the skies. You can pay to go into the Planetarium for a show but we did not do that, next time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marynaturelover
50,Beautiful View! Excellent show,We went there for the sunset. It was PERFECT timing. Since we got to see the city during the day and a few hours later during the night.We went to the show about the galaxy and the stars in the room where they filmed Lalaland. It was magical. I almost felt in Disneyland. The show last half an hour and the sits are really comfortable.A MUST in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucianaQ
30,OK but not at night with Fog,The highlight was the BTTF tunnel and Roger Rabbit.Tesla cage is good but is was foggy so don't go in evening if you can't see stars from ground. UBER is great to get here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mister2000
50,Breathtaking views,"I am not a very touristy person, so it took me thirty years in LA until I went, and it's definitely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
40,Griffith at Night,"Driving up the hill was a bit confusing as one main entrance was closed. Once we found the other entrance, we rode past many walkers and continued up the hill. It was pretty clear that we should park along the roadway and join the walkers, but my ignorance paid off as I scored an open space right in front of the main building. The employees standing outside the doors stopped everyone from going in but never said why, and they opened the doors with the same lack of information. Once inside, the building was immense, ornate and pretty incredible. The sun was setting, and we walked out (with others) to an area to view the city scape with one of the location's telescopes. After about 5 minutes, we walked back to the same door we'd walked out, and an employee would not let us re-enter. He said we'd have to walk around to the front and wait AGAIN to get in. The entire staff seemed a bit unorganized and non-communicative which surprised me for a major L. A. attraction. We left. I liked the location, and will return, but it felt as if the crowd took the staff by surprise. I recommend trying to park at the top if you can, but I'm certain I just had beginner's luck with that. Next trip, I will park near the Dolby theatre and Uber to Griffith.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimB90277
40,Great place but needs better traffic flow,We knew we were going on spring break but if they know how busy their road gets they should do something about it. It's frustrating to go up the mountain for 45 minutes and not find parking. Better information and direction to the car park below and the shuttle would make this a more enjoyable experience. The Observatory is great and the views are stunning but getting there should be made easier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nopar65
50,Sunset View!,"We hiked up here and had a spectacular view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign. Went inside the astronomy museum then came back out to enjoy the gorgeous view some more!Tip: Go on a weekday (less crowded) and arrive just before sunset. That way you can watch the sunset, then head into the Observatory to check out the different space exhibits, then back outside to see the skyline lit up at night.Must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B_Collins52
50,Day visit,"Great day out, you can park at the bottom of the park and walk to the top if you're very fit, unlike us, so we drove to the top , there's plenty of free parking on the way up, but then the closer you get there's s small parking free. The views are amazing. Plenty to do and see, we even see a wedding take place !! On the way back down, its one way up and one way down, and at the bottom there's a miniature railway line for kids which we went on. Great day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969joannem
50,Fantastic - Must See,We went at sunset so had gorgeous views. Planetarium show was awesome. Check ages if you have young children I think under 6 not allowed in show. We took Lyft so didn't have to worry about parking. Wonderful time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noonanagain
50,Blown Away!,"The Observatory is a must see when visiting Los Angeles. The exhibits are incredibly cool and educational, walking through them is like taking a trip through time and space. The architecture is remarkable and reminiscent of where I'd imagine Ancient Greek astrologers spent their days (don't miss the ceiling above the pendulum- it looks Iike the work of Michelangelo). It's family friendly with guests ranging from all ages. The staff is lovely and very knowledgeable- you can ask them anything. Plus the view of LA from the top is unparalleled! If you go, be sure to visit the planetarium where you lay back in reclined seats as the ceiling transforms into the entire universe right before your eyes. Griffith park below is also beautiful, offering large spanning lawns shaded by large trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msdrshaw
50,Lala Land Anyone,I totally enjoyed the view of LA from the Griffith Observatory. Brings lotsa sunblock if you prefer to visit during summer. The view was spectacular however and i t has free entrance. What more could you ask for. My friends and I spent around 4 hours just taking in the sights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/averywildchild
40,Nice panoramic view,A must visit place in Los Angeles. The panoramic views are interesting and you can get a preview of this chaotic city. Don't forget to visit the interior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexiosVandoros
40,Worth the hike,"Hard to get to if you don't have a car but the hike there is pretty cool. time it so you can catch the sunset and then see LA by night, and a different view if the Hollywood sign.Caught the last planetarium show, which was good, but could have done without the over acted narrator, but still worth the ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veryrary
50,Beautiful view during sunset.,"We were here during sunset and I would definitely recommend that. Of course there will be a lot of people at that point, but the view is amazing. The observatory itself is also very beautiful. This is for free so I recommend it. You will also see the Hollywood sign. Not the best view over it, but still.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeckaJohansson
50,Awesome building and view,If you are looking for a short activity that takes about an hour you should totally visit the Observatory! The view was great of L.A. and you could see the Hollywood Sign. we were skeptical of the paid parking but it only costs $4 and hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LebanonWarrior
50,Educational for All Ages--Plan A Few Hours,"This was my first visit to the Griffith, despite several trips to L.A. over many years. First its a lovely drive on widing roads to get there. While there is 'free' parking on the shoulder of the roads, these spots go quickly--and it becomes a long, longer or very long hike up the observatory. I opted for parking--I advise going EARLY--I arrived slightly after noon and circled the lot to park. The good news is that parking is a cheap (by L.A. standards) $4 per hour as of April 2017. That (other than if you opt to get snacks or light lunch in the cafe) are only fees. The interior of the building has been spectacularly kept and restored; the surrounding exterior and parapet offers incredible views of L.A. This is, hands down, an educational experience for non-science adult tourists, an excellent learning experience for children, and a geek-out trip for science or space buffs. I really recommend the Leonard Nimoy Theater, with a sizable 'universe' display with learning exhibits of the planets. I easily could have spent more than the 2 hours I did here during my stay. I would love to return at night if the telescopes might be in use but mainly to just see the awesome views at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williambJ8243XH
30,Picnic Under the Stars,It was nice to sit on the glass with the blank and picnic basket and watch the stars and people enjoy the city lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/letois
50,City of stars!,"Was the the Griffith Observatory for a couple of hours with friends. We arrived a bit before sunset, just in time to catch the views with light, twilight, and then dark. Honestly, I guess it must be the best place to watch the sunset from. Recommended to go there a couple of hours earlier as the line to get to the top might be busy. There's free parking before arriving at the very top but it gets full easily and then parking meters at the parking lot on top. I think it was 4$ per hour, so definitely worth for the stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fiorels
50,Great views. Plan for parking and delays.,"First of all...parking. If u go around sunset it will be INSANE. However bad you think it'll be, it'll be worse. Not sure what to recommend. get here well bf sunset I guess. There are some lower parking lots you can park at and take the bus up. They have sun telescopes during the day if u can't go at night. At night they have several telescopes around the grounds focused on different elements in the sky. We saw Jupiter and Orion Nebula. There were also very good ab leaving telescopes out even if it looks cloudy. As the sun was setting, the forecast was almost certain that viewing conditions would be terrible (cloudy). Even the people running the scopes said we probably wouldn't be able to see anything. But they would keep them out just in case. We went inside for a while. Maybe 30 minutes or so then came back out. It turned out against all odds to be a decent night for viewing so I was really appreciative that they didn't make the call and close up too early. For people who have never looked thru a telescope bf, keep your expectations modest. Even reasonably powerful scopes like hose used here don't give NASA Internet picture type views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnwtoc
40,Panoramic view point!!,good place to have a peaceful time. Way up on the Hollywood mountain lies the Observatory and can be reached by private car or public transportation. The buses for the same are available outside the Metro station. Try being here in the evening probably around sunset so one could witness the changing colors of the entire LA from up there and the city looks beautiful with lights. The Observatory people will be helpful with the planetary view/explanation of whichever planets are aligned at that time. I was lucky to view Neptune. How amazing it looks from the telescope!! And boy it does get chilly on top out there. So get a thin jacket as it is windy too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flappingfootsteps
50,The best view of the city,"Haven't been here since I was a kid. Brought my boyfriend to see and be amazed and that he was. Great view of the city of Los Angeles. The day we went was a little hazy which made the view, not that great, BUT on a clear day, you can see from Dodger Stadium to Malibu. Very impressive sight to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDoubleU80
40,Wonderful views,Excellent free observatory - car parking close by worth paying 5 dollars for. Great to see big telescope at close proximity. Would recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredaEngland
50,Wow,"Went there because my partner really wanted to go. And I am so glad he was so stuck on the idea. The views are immense, the museum is very nicely made and they explain everything in a very understandable way. For 7$ you could look at the planetarium show. Extremely impressed with this. It was just plain beautiful. The lady telling the story was just wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdw452
50,Nice on a hot day,Parking free at the zoo. We loved the new look (*well not so new) but we enjoyed our day. They do have a restaurant there or eat at the Gene Autry Museum. Kids loved all the things to touch and look at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSS9112014
50,Great,My family and I visit California yearly and the Griffith Observatory is one of our most favourite places to visit. The Observatory is amazing and the hiking in and around the park is wonderful. The views of the city are spectacular too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLWil18
40,A hike to the top,"A nice place to visit if you are looking for a good hike and good view. It is better to visit Monday-Wednesday to avoid the crowds, as it is a popular destination in L.A.. Parking is straightforward for the most part unless there is an event going on. It's a shame you cant go inside the observatory but you can walk around it and see great views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677frederickv
50,Educational!,"We visited during grandson's spring break. Great place to visit! Love the Tesla Coil demonstration. The docent did a wonderful job explaining the exhibit. Also saw the Planetarium show. Very cool! The facility was clean and inviting. Love the various exhibits! Grandson's have a wonderful time! One thing I thought was a little costly is the parking. $4:00 an hour. However, there is an alternate. You can park below for free and take the shuttle up the hill or walk up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GunnerNate
50,Amazing view!,"The view from here is incredible. The observatory was closed when we went, but it was still great just being up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylvias990
50,Exercising,Nice place for sightseeing its free and it is fun.. you are going to love it..you can even take a walk to the Hollywood landscape sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELTEPECANO
40,Nice stop if your in LA. Good place to see the Hollywood sign.,Is you would like a great panoramic view of the city of Los Angeles or you are an astronomy buff then check out the Griffith Observatory. It's free to go on the property and to enter inside. There are a lot of exhibits and learning material for curious visitors. I hear the planetarium does shows but they are very cheap. The site offers great views of the city which can be quite charming during the sunset. It can be extremely crowded as this is a big tourist spot. It's an uphill trek and there is paid parking at the top. You can park along the road leading up to the observatory but it can be really pack making it a bit inconvenient. I recommend using a lift service such as Uber to drop you off and pick you up so you don't have to worry about taking your own car and paying for parking. I'm certain there are better areas to see the famous Hollywood sign but this is a great place to get a good view of it and to take a picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewdL5333IT
50,Perfect Sunsets!,The Griffith Observatory is a must visit when in the area. If you have the strength you can walk up the trail at the bottom of the hill and have the entire city of Los Angeles open it's arms up to you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelidecovolo
50,Top attraction to visit in LA with friends from out of town,"When friends come to visit us in LA, this is one of the must go places. We visited this place with friends from Canada in early March.We drove to the Griffith Observatory in late afternoon. The sunset is beautiful there. But the problem for this place is very hard to find parking space at the limited parking lot. So we parked along the road on the hill and took 5 to 10 minutes to hike up to the entrance.In the parking area on the side, there is very good spot to take picture with the Hollywood sing as the backdrop. The afternoon sunlight is perfect for picture taking.Once get inside, we first bought the tickets for the earth show and we felt it was one of the highlights for our visit. Before the show, we toured the first floor and took pictures with pendulum where a scene of LaLa Land was filmed.Then we went outside the Observatory for a speculative view of Los Angles with downtown high rises in the distance. This is another good spot for picture opportunity. Finally, we stepped to the open observation deck to took sunset picture with Observatory as the back ground.We finished the day by visiting Hollywood sunset boulevard and snapped pictures of the stars' hand imprints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34regisk
50,good place to learn about the sky,"It is free but they started charging parking this year and it is very expensive like $4/hr.It is very worth it to pay for the ticket to see the night sky (Centered in the Universe) in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium. It costs $7. There are hiking trails behind the observatory and the door is open to the public at 12, so we went hiking beforehand. The views are great and you can see the Hollywood sign there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raylingc
50,Revisits Required,"Griffith Observatory is one of the more interesting places to visit in Los Angeles, It is elevated and views from the Pacific Ocean to the San Gabriel Mountains are amazing. On a clear day (and there are a lot of them in the area) you can see these views without much effort. The biggest part of the observatory is hidden under the lawn and planted area in front of the observatory building itself. 12 or more years ago the area was demolished and exhibit spaces were created, when completed the entire approach was reinstalled as it was in the original plan. There are many Science's on display in the Observatory including a sun telescope (heliograph), an excellent Planetarium (cost) but do not miss this venue, it is the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thealeh
40,Great planetarium Shows,"We spent Sunday browsing thru the different exhibits. Attended two different shows in the planetarium. The narrator was superb and really knew his stuff. The cafe was nice and had a great selection of wolfgang puck sandwiches etc ... Great afternoon. Parking is very difficult and the parking attendant berated us claiming we weren't suppose to turn (however he never said anything prior) but went off on us as we exited our vehicle. belligerent and extremely unprofessional, luckily it didn't ruin the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtmcbain
50,School Project,Been dozen times up there for scenic pictures and my guests (tourist's) entertainment but this time was first time with my daughter's school project on astronomy (K-grade😂).... The show is amazing!!!!!! No words!!!! Just must see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275vadimb

40,Cool place,"This was a fun way to spend an afternoon. The views of the city are beautiful. You can get some nice shots of the Hollywood sign. We bought lunch outside of the park and ate it up top. The observatory has lots of information to read and see. Unless you are a hiker, park as high up as you can. Kind of a difficult walk for amateurs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7183WUmariaa
40,Great movie and live-narration at planetarium,"If you enjoy planetariums and astronomical subjects, Griffith is a great place to visit. It's a free entrance, but to watch the presentations you have to pay like 7 dollars or so. If you just reached the place to take a photo with ""Hollywood"" sign, this is not the place. Unfortunately is too far !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcelomorga
50,SEE THE 'CENTERED IN THE UNIVERSE' SHOW & FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN ANOTHER WORLD,"We went at night which of course gives a different vibe from the daytime. The grounds, building and the view is beautiful.Had no idea there that this show would be so informative---you really feel like you are a part of it.Depending when you go there will be crowds and parking issues so be prepared.But the show is worth the experience---you do feel like you are in another world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ultrakat

Not sure if this runs everyday but there is an info desk at the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ochini88

The exhibits are just sort of OK, and nothing of great note, but what a magnificent view of Los Angeles from every angle. The views are worth the visit, however I would recommend that this venue be visited during a weekday if possible to avoid the crowds and to get parking a reasonable distance away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roosterlaw

40,Great little attraction,"Extra hot day and near the end of our holiday made Griffith observatory a little hard to enjoy to its full. It is clearly a popular and very scenic spot, and well worth it especially for family members who are fascinated by space. Lots to see and do. We took uber each way, about $25 from Beverly Hills. Wifi was patchy at best which made ordering the uber back tricky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr6284

50,impressive views of LA,"free entry, but must go early to get a parking spot. you can catch nice night photos of la from there. also good for hiking and biking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fdirisaglik
50,Fantastic evening and views,"Had a great evening at the observatory. Demonstration of their tesla coil, and viewing stars. Had opportunity to use the telescope in the observatory and also had some on the grass which could be used. Apart from bus hoppa, was a free evening out. Recommend to take picnic, as their is limited food and drink outlets. The views are great of the LA landscape and city, and also some good views of the Hollywood sign, but was a little further away than I was hoping, so think there may be better views from nearer locations (but that's no the reason you go to the observatory :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazleech
40,Great views,"Griffith Observatory was worth the visit, and we arrived early in the morning before the rush of cars and people. You could see so much from this location including incredible city views and views of the Hollywood sign. It also had it's own character and you will probably recognize the building from several movies or tv shows. We didn't bother spending extra to tour the observatory inside, so perhaps for some this additional feature takes this place to a 5 star rating for some. For us, we saw it as a bit of a tourist trap and a way to grab more money from those caught in the moment. I think just walking around provides the most value as I could probably learn about the stars in my home town if I wanted, but no pictures will likely ever do this place justice to what you really get to see. LA and the nature that surrounds it is amazing. This is a good place to take it all in, and if you're adventurous there were plenty of trails to explore as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMUrwin
50,FREE AND AMAZING!,"On the top of the hills, it has an incredible view! It's free entrance and everything inside is amazing, the best observatory I have ever been to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronicarQ199KQ
50,Great experience.,"For a very reasonable fee, 6 family members spent an enjoyable day here. The building and the grounds are gorgeous and the views incomparable. The planetarium show was just average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slizzie
50,Great Views,"This is probably the most recognized hilltop in Los Angeles, secondary to the great Hollywood sign. The views of Los Angeles are some perm and I would highly recommend it for that alone. It is interesting the kids would like it from a scientific point of you so I would definitely get this five-star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neuroblade
50,What a view!,"If you are visiting LA I recommend coming here at sunset. Amazing views of the city, at night especially. The observatory itself was very interesting and was a bonus, we went because we were chasing a fantastic view, and we got it! (See pic). Excellent value for money, which was just a few dollars for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorcanb560

10,Couldn't Park. Missed Out.,"We took two young children on Saturday and couldn't park within a couple of miles of the Observatory. And the kids would not have managed the climb.There is paid parking at the top, but it was full. Pity as we really wanted to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931brendanq
50,Views,"So we went because it's the thing to do while in LA. Even my kids 6 & 11 enjoyed coming up here. And taking pictures. We spent about 2 hours here, taking pictures and looking around. We did go inside but only briefly. Parking is $4.00 an hour. Restrooms were available. Drinks were expensive. We go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stryteller

50,Another must!,There is a reason why this is a must for tourists and locals alike. It allows for an unobstructed view of the city and you can see the Hollywood sign into the distance as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joliefolie
50,Stunning views,"We walked up from Hollywood, the walk was hard but made it worth it by the views at the top. The building itself is amazing and really interesting inside, you had to pay for the planetarium but was happy with the rest.Managed to get some stunning pictures and then walked back down.We went back in the evening to see it all at night, it was quite busy still and loads of cars driving up. We parked down the bottom and walked up, they had a bus which was $0.50 if people wanted but we were happy to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909jayg

30,Walk to the observatory,Be prepared for a traffic snake up the hills only to find you can get nowhere near the observatory and cannot park. We parked about 2 miles away and walked up a scout track. Views once up there were great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markbD2344OI
50,we liked it alot,Great inexpensive place to visit in LA. not much parking but worth the drive up to the hill to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/718judif
40,Took a hike to the Observatory and great view of Hollywood sign,The hike to the Griffith Observatory is a bit difficult and steep. You have to be in good shape to walk up and back. It is worth it - amazing views of the city of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swtravelmom
30,Lovely view of the city,"Part of our road trip took us through LA for a few days, and being with our friends who haven't been before, we laid on the sights that we had done previously. So this was another stop while out for the day. We drive up to where the cars are parked on the right side of the road as this is free for parking, although it was only about $2 per hour for parking up at the car park outside. Good for saving a buck or two though?.. the views across the city are pretty awesome although it was pretty smoggy on the day we were there, unless it's like this all the time of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppermint
50,Gorgeous views!,"I was surprised by how much we enjoyed our visit to the Griffith Observatory. The place was PACKED on a Sunday, but we miraculously found a free parking spot and walked our way up the hill to the observatory. There was paid parking available at the top, which would have been worth it for sure. We loved the gorgeous views of the city and the Hollywood sign. There were also some great hiking trails nearby. We didn't stay long, but I'm so glad we checked it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boilerjenni
50,Shows how big L.A. really is!!!!,"This was a great spot to observe L.A. from. With the out door free surrounding observation decks it was easy to get that perfect picture. On the inside there was all the history of the Griffith observatory. This was also a really good spot to get the ""hollywood"" sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2762RUchrisc
50,Fun day amazing view,"We spend nice to day in visit Griffith Observatorium ,there is nice things to see and learn about planet earth and also amazing view on Hooliwood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodtravelandfunking
50,An LA Staple,The trip to the stars and moon is closer than you can imagine. Make a point to go and visit. The earlier you go the more chance of parking you'll have but traffic is at constant rotation so a parking spot can be found after a couple rounds around the lot. The view of LA is amazing and if you go on a clear day you can see for miles. I have yet to visit at night but will soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockyR148
40,Lovely escape,"Lovely way to escape the city. Beautiful views, interesting architecture and fun educational displays. Parking is busy so recommend paying 50 cents for shuttle up and walk down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avwtravel
50,Our abiding memory of LA is watching the sunset from here - gorgeous.....,"Of all the cities and spots we visited during a self drive around California LA was the only real dissapointment - particularly Hollywood. However the Griffith observatorh did give us one great memory from LA to cherish.We got to the observatory something like an hour and a half before sunset but, as mentioned elsewhere, parking is difficult - but not impossible. We found a slot on the road up the hill (Free parking) and walked the 20 min up the hill. Little bit of a hike but well worth it for the awesome views of the City and the view of the Holywood sign (Albeit in the distance).We had not counted on the observatory being up to much - but it's excellent ! Loads of astrological and other alligned scientific demonstrations - really good ones - all for free.We had a cold drink and snack in the cafe attached to the observatory and watched the sunset over the City - superb !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me_n_my_rucksack
40,Great place to visit in LA,"We visited the observatory in the evening and it was fantastic. Apart from all the great things that you get to see within the observatory, you get to see the whole of LA lit up in the night sky. Very beautiful indeed!! The show "" centered in the universe"" in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium was great as well! Would definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hiker176
50,Neat place!!,"Beautiful sunny Saturday morning when we went here. We took the Metro, then the shuttle to the park-both great, convenient and inexpensive. The park is beautiful, the views are amazing. The museums, and observatory are very interesting. Great place for adults and kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/76Sue

40,Amazing View of LA,"If you want to have a great view over LA, this is the place to go. Its always busy, but its worth. Parking might be a pain sometimes, but you will love this place.Reserve around 2 hours to visit this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/219angeld
40,Unparalleled views of Los Angeles but beware of parking,"For the Observatory itself, I would unreservedly give it 5 stars. However, the difficult parking forces me to take off a star. It's located on higher ground so just driving up the hill offers beautiful views of the observatory and the land below. Once on top, you can see the Hollywood sign, downtown L.A. and the surrounding areas. I'm told that sunset is the best time to go but also the worst time for parking. Inside the observatory, there are interesting exhibits about the sun, moon, stars and planets. There was even a Tesla exhibit to explain their innovative technology. Strolling on the grounds and in the observatory are free and the shows are a nominal fee of $6-$7. Just be prepared to wait a while for parking. The lot is small so others have had to park on the curb going up and down the hill, and those spots are not easy to attain. Remember to pay for parking close to the observatory and if you can, go on a weekday/weeknight to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaauoc
40,Fun Day at the Observatory,"We took our grandchildren, 4 and 5 years old. They loved the Planetarium show-we could only get into the first show of the day because of the minimum age of 5 for the subsequent shows. There are enough great things to see and touch to keep even these young ones interested. We attended the show on ""how to make a comet."" The scientist was funny, informative, and engaging. The only downside is the parking. Even though we arrived before the Observatory opened, we had to park way down the hill and hike up and back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/970barbarag
30,Stunning building,Uber up there. Great day out. Stunning Griffith Park. Free entry. Watched a movie which put me to sleep 😴. Huge place to explore. Bit too much to see. Got dash bus back down and it was fine. Especially at 50cents. Worthvisit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
50,Magnificent,Woww such a wonderful place. One of the best tourist place I have visited ever!!! I have equally liked the fantastic view and the museum. It is one of the very few place where I want to go again and again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiriBhat
20,Let down,They don't have very good information on parking although there is parking at the top. Telescope not operational due to weather. Not a lot else to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3603HOlorih
40,Went to see Hollywood sign,This is a great place to see the Hollywood sign and views of the cities. We had a nice time walking the observatory and spoke with a nice docent around the sun telescope. Fun activity for our kids taking middle school and high school sciences. Park along road for free parking. Parking in lot is $4 An your and was very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Campbls
40,"Great views, and its FREE to visit!","We hadn't been to the Griffith Observatory for years, but with out of state guests in town went back last week. The parking was difficult--we had to park about 1/2 a mile down hill and walk to the observatory, but fortunately ""hiking"" was part of our goal. Bit of a shame that our whole hike was along the road... The observatory itself is very grand, and it's pretty satisfying that it's actually free to visit aside from the movie. We bought tickets to the Light of the Valkyries, and it was a little corny, BUT the very comfy seats and the live performance (it's narrated by an actual actor) made up for the corniness. The no-nonsense queue rules are probably necessary, but a little obnoxious--they require you to line up a minimum of 20 minutes before the show begins, which results in a bit of standing around, which felt unnecessary as every seat is great, and you have no choice anyway. I imagine they've learned the hard way that being less hard-nosed about that results in people sprinting in late. Overall, I'd highly recommend it, and be sure to leave time to take in the views from the top and make your way around the educational exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrDCpr
50,Awesome place,The view from the Griffith observatory is awesome. You can view the LA skyline and the Hollywood sign at its best. Must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalesh2017
50,"Great views, very interesting but limited parking",Family of four including 16 yo son and 12 yo daughter had a great time over about 3 hours. Very limited parking so you need to pick your time to visit. We went late afternoon to see sunset and whilst parking was horrendous it was still well worth seeing the view. Took about 30 minutes to find a parking space and had to walk a mile or two up the hill. On the plus side it was all down hill on the way home. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754grahames
40,Just spectacular,"Luck wasn't with us on a cloudy foggy day, but the views were still impressive. Well worth a visit. Easy to get to by Uber but we did find it harder to get a ride back. A short walk down the hill solved that problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilliansays
40,Good to visit for a good view of LA,"As stated, best place to go if you want an exellent view of LA combined with the possibility of getting a cup of coffie or other condiments.Parking was a hassle though but we were there during spring break so traffic was a bit heavyer then usual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellertthor

50,Beautiful Spot! Magnificent views!,If you are visiting LA this is a must see place. Hike up from Griffith Park if you can -- it's fairly but not unduly steep-- or drive up if you must and then the exhilarating sight of the mountains and that quirky inspiring and beloved Hollywood sign await you. The observatory is an interesting place too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
50,Great views but limited parking,The views over LA are fantastic and there are enough viewing points that it doesn't seem crowded. Inside the Observatory are exhibits and you can get tickets for the planetarium shows. The telescope is (obviously) only open to the public in the evening but you can look at it from outside during the day. There is very limited parking at the actual observatory so you may have to park near the Greek Theatre and walk up about half a mile. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
50,"Beautiful building, nice scenery","I loved the building and the scenery, however, we did not get a chance to get inside because it was closed on a Monday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133gabic
50,Top notch Observatory with Beautiful Views,This is a must visit venue if you are in the Hollywood/Los Angeles area. Visiting near sunset is ideal as the views from the hill are gorgeous! The Observatory itself is magnificent and make sure that you stay long enough to stay for one of the evening events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298lori
50,What a view!!!!!!!,Wow! The view of Los Angeles was just exquisite! Griffith was fun & beautiful and we took tons of pictures. We were able to see the Hollywood Sign and get some great shots of it. It is very crowded and parking was a struggle. I think if you don't arrive early you will have a far walk so plan accordingly if that is an issue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrskim99

50,Best views of the city!,"Although we didn't get a change to go into the observatory the drive through the park was beautiful. It was very busy w/bumper to bumper car so bring your patience. There are free areas to pull off and take pictures and also paid parking. Be sure move your vehicle when the no parking times come, they will tow!! We saw them taking vehicles out 2 at a time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickeyMouse915

50,Best views of L.A.!,"Definitely a must see when visiting LA. Awesome for getting pictures of downtown and the iconic Hollywood sign. We went in the evening to see the city lit up at night, as well as the next morning to get some different pictures. It's a little drive to get up the windy hill but totally worth it for the views. There's some trails too in the area to go for a walk or hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932erical

40,"Didn't go in, just went to top",Great views of the city. Don't advise trying to park here. We hiked over from Lake Hollywood park (free parking). Found an uber to take us back after we hiked up and down the hills and started to lose daylight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaCLC
40,The hike is well worth the views,We went on a hike and ended at Griffith Observatory. We were exhausted so didn't spend much time there but the views were fabulous. Next time we'll just go up to the observatory and forget the hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8821HYkarenh
50,"A must see, must do experience!","This was the highlight of one of our days on our recent trip to LA. It is a must do experience, but get there early because the crowds can get heavy on weekends. Do NOT miss out on seeing the movie in the planetarium on the universe it will completely blow your mind. Honestly, it was one of the coolest things I have ever experienced. Spend the money as it is well worth it. Also, the location is fantastic for taking panaramic pictures of the entire city and your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobbyAngelo123

40,Beware of parking,"There were just so many people on weekends. The view was good, and some exhibits were nice, but there are not many of them. I think it is a good spot for a quick drop-off, but we spent almost an hour on Saturday morning trying to get a parking spot (I did try to convince my husband to park at the bottom but he did not believe me). And our phones (ultra.me prepaid) did not work from near the first paid parking area to the top. I frantically looked for my husband for over 30 min. Personally this was a horrible experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yujino880
50,Great short hike,"20 min hike from the bottom. Bring a hat and wearing running shoes. Lots of parking at the bottom entrance, it gets filled up quickly around 930.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janneur
40,Family Adventure,Great views. Best place to see Hollywood sign. Very crowded and hard to find parking but great views of the city. Worth the trip if in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seirshalove727
40,Star Gazing,Went here with a tour and found the place has a wonderful view of Los Angeles and even the Hollywood sign can be seen. The planetarium show was good and informative but the best place is outside were after dark the staff set up some telescopes and place them to see such planets as Mars & Saturn had a great time looking around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigAussie
40,All good...except the parking,"The site offers an incredible view of the L.A. area, and you can lose yourself staring over the extensive city attempting to identify various locations both close and distant. The inside is a fun visit, too. Parking and traffic patterns have recently changed, and are NOT friendly if your plan is to make a nonchalant visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattNisbet
50,Astrology Major Love,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I live 1.5-2.5 hours away from LA but I've visited like 5 times now! I almost wish I lived in LA so I can come here every night.If you're an astronomy/science/sci-fi/architecture geek then YOU WILL ADORE THIS PLACE. Amazing views of LA + science exhibits + such beautiful architecture. At night they will bring out gigantic telescopes that you can look at various planets with (if the skies are clear.) There is a ginormous telescope on the roof that you can look through as well.And let's not forget the Planetarium!! It was the first planetarium I've ever been to and I have a strong connection with it. You'll never forget your first planetarium show. Ever since I watched and fell in love with the movie ""Gattaca"" I've been dreaming of visiting a Planetarium. And this one is top-notch!! Tickets go for $7/adult for a ~20 minute show and it's breath-taking. They offer a few movies to choose from and my favorite is the one about the universe. Because stars.Astronomy exhibits are strewn throughout the beautiful building. It takes 2-3 hours to explore the entire museum. There is a well-equipped cafe on the bottom levels and an extremely geeky gift shop.Great for dates, couples, or even solo trips! Admission is free!The only downside is the parking. Because this place is so awesome it's obviously very very popular. And because it's located on a hill it doesn't leave much space for parking. When I first visited parking was free and insane on weekends, but judging from other recent reviews they have started charging for parking. In my opinion it is reasonable because otherwise there would be absolutely no place to park. I do see they offer a free bus shuttle service so if you absolutely refuse to pay for parking just take a shuttle bus up. Or if you're physically fit you can hike up.The futuristic architecture and stunning views of LA is a photographer's dream. If you're a photographer prepare to have your breath taken away!!This place is so amazing I cannot stop gushing about it. Seriously worth multiple visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiakoh

50,Cannot get a better view of LA,A must see if you are in LA! There are many ways to get there(including an awesome hike but not for little kids!). Parking is a little tricky in the afternoon but the view at the top is totally worth it. The planetarium is also very educational and fun for the kids. Great view of the Hollywood sign and a 360 degrees view of LA and surrounding hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adramca
40,Out of space,Great view from the observatory. Inside is filled with information for those interested in star gazing. Not a high priority hobby for me so my attention inside was limited and I went back outside for the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venoniah
30,Great views terrible parking !,"The views are really beautiful. The building itself is historic and neat. However the crowds are terrible. Best to come early in the morning park next to the observatory and hang out until the building opens. Unfortunately the building doesn't open till 12 pm. The field trip crowds were bad as well.We got there mid morning and there was no parking - or so the parking people told us. We parked on the side of road and hiked up - 15 minute and walked to the top. As we got close to the observatory , there was plenty of spots to park. It was paid parking. $4.00 . I didn't understand why they didn't let cars through .Traffic is worse when there are events at the Greek theater.If you are in LA, you have to see it at least once even if the crowds are annoying.However if I were to go again I would definitely go way earlier and plan out my trip more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Windycity21
30,Not what I expected,"To be honest, I was not sure what to expect. The parking was limited so we had to park on a side road and walk about 15-20 minutes up hill to get to the observatory. There were lots of others there not following the rules (not bringing food in etc). The room with the planet replicas and some previous technology was my favorite. This would be a good place to go on a rainy day, or later in the day to view the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gingilla6
10,Parking is nuts,"Well I wish I could tell you about the Observatory. Silly us, we went up on a weekday so we hoped it would not be so crowded. Oh gee LaLa Land had just been out for a short time. We had just been on Mulholland Dr and seen the haze so knew it was not that clear thus hoped ....alas, the line of cars got thick as we got closer to the top of the hill. People were parking way down low and walking what must have been a long way. By the time we got to the parking lot, it was a mad house; nothing was moving over 1/2 a mile an hour; NUTS. Well we could see the Observatory!Park should set up a bus that runs from the parking lot at the bottom. I know it is LA public transit is crazy. Well maybe a nice foggy day would work? Oh well, I've got to go see LaLaLand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smokeater55
40,Beautiful day for the observatory,Great views of the city and a must do but traffic and parking is a nightmare! There are some great trails right at the observatory that take you to the top of the hills too. Would recommend going earlier in the day vs early afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ko762
50,Best view in LA,"One of the best views I saw in my trips. It can be tricky to get a parking spot, since it is one of the most visited attractions in LA, but it is definetely worth the visit.

50,Great Views and Interesting Astronomy for Free,"Parking costs $4/hr., but there are a lot of cool things to and see for free. They offer free telescope viewing to the public, it's the best place in the city for taking photos of the HOLLYWOOD sign on Mt. Lee, plus you can see Downtown L.A., Century City, Signal Hill, and we saw Santa Catalina Island yesterday, though there was some haze a smog. The coin-op telescopes aren't great, but they'll bring out some details to objects within 2 or 3 miles.There are a couple of very interesting (at least to my wife, our 17 and 11-year-old daughters, and I) interactive exhibits on the main floor and on the lower level. I found out that I weigh 175 lbs. (79 kg) on Mars, and that was fine with me! :-)Right inside the entrance one can learn how it was proven in 1885 that the earth rotates on an axis. The device that is used to do this has nothing to do with telling time, so don't pay attention to the people who didn't read the plaque when they teach their kids erroneously what they think it does!In addition to the many free exhibits, there are the featured presentations and temporary shows that they have on their schedule on the Web site and change periodically, some of which cost a few dollars to attend (a.k.a. ""a nominal fee"" LOL).I grew up in Pasadena and visited the observatory a dozen times before moving to Las Vegas 22 years ago. I went in groups as a teen, I've gone there on dates as an adult (including with the gal that married me), and yesterday I went there with my family. I'm not a ""science guy"" AT ALL, but I somehow always enjoy going to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ETO_History_Buff
40,Wonderful Views!,"It was great to visit this iconic Los Angeles location, although it was very tricky to get here – the shuttle buses did not have the correct destination on them when they reached our stop (very confusing!), and Griffith Park was so packed with people and traffic that it took quite a while to reach the observatory. However, it was well worth the trip – the views over LA are outstanding. We enjoyed a show in the planetarium, as well as looking at the exhibitions inside the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
40,Beautiful Views...,"This place has such beautiful views, but can be a parking nightmare. I went up the hill several times to try to find parking, the lot was full and then they would block off traffic so you would have to go all the way down just to come all the way back. I ended up having to park far from my car, near the Greek Theater, I took the bus up to the observatory. I think it cost 50 cents, and it can get quiet full. There are chilly winds at night so dress accordingly...its a must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItsmeFifi
20,Not worth the visit. Parking is awful.,I mistakenly thought I was close to the Hollywood sign. My fault. The parking was see if you can find a spot and then wait at the pay station. We didn't visit the observatory there were too many people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841marthac
50,Always wonderful,Check your calendar. Sometimes closed. Sometimes special events. 5 and up friendly. Helpful crew. Inexpensive paid parking. Add time in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertzaret
50,Excellent planetarium and exhibits.,"Wow, this place was seriously amazing. My husband, 40, my daughter, 10 and myself 40 had a great time here. The show Valkeries was awesome. The museum is free and a nominal fee is charged for the planetarium shows with live presenters. Highly recommended. Parking is difficult and limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravvenesque
30,Griffith Observatory,"Visiting this place was part of a tour I was on. It was during the early afternoon so it wasn't crowded. The views are amazing. I thought the Hollywood sign could be seen a bit closer but I'm sure using the telescope would fix that issue. Otherwise it was great, nice area inside that gave interesting information about the Planets and the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keonaj2016
50,When to go and the Hollywood sign,"So first, the Hollywood sign stopped being lit years ago, so plane this trip for daylight hours. Also with parking dropping the car in silver Lake and taking lyft or just taking lyft recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chazzarama
50,Fantastic View and Awesome Wonders of Science and the Sky Must Visit,"Great LA views. The observatory itself is awesome. The planet replicas are very realistic. There is a lot to view and if you truly interested it will take time to see and read the information on all the exhibits. There is 2 shows you can view. There is a lot to see and it was very crowded. We walked up the steep hill but they also have a shuttle. Parking down below is free. If traveling with elderly or small kids I would take the shuttle or pay to park at the top. But great site for the whole family. Great for family, dates or friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerondaC
40,Griffith Observatory,Very worthwhile visit. You are overlooking all of LA and a nice view of the Hollywood sign. A nice gift shop and self serve restaurant with seating outside!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyo682
40,Good for hikes and sight-seeing,For those visiting LA this place is a must. It offers a chance to get out of the city and do some walking in a very enjoyable setting. One of the best places to get some nice pictures from LA and its surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33franzf
50,The best free venue in Los Angeles,"I can't believe this place is free. Parking can be a bit tricky during busy times, but you need to visit this place if you're spending time in LA. The observatory is free and has stunning views of the city, as well as many amazing astronomy displays. I can't stress how amazed I am that a facility of this calibre is free. I wish every city had something like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickdreviews
50,Must visit Again,This place is so romantic and after watching La La Land you really want to go again and again. It can get windy up there so take a scarf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/426shannas
50,Inspiring visit!,A very interesting and inspiring place to visit! beautiful view over LA. Awesome exhibition a lot of fun and interesting! And free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterhZ9440GU
50,Day or Night - always a fun trip,"Whether you're a tourist or a local, I will always recommend this place. Parking often requires a little walk up the hill (I've never found a spot in the top lot), but if you're able, it's definitely worth it. Bring some food and picnic on the lawn or the balcony outside.I never pay for the planetarium, and the free exhibits are fun to explore on their own. However, what I really go for is the views – sometimes there is stargazing or planet spotting on the lawn at night, but on a semi-clear day, there is always a great view of LA. I've gone there on some foggy nights and I've still enjoyed it. Several hiking trails in the area too, including one to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432gabrielles
50,Hollywood historical landmark,"Love this place and frequently jogged here when I lived in the Hollywood Hills. Despite being a fixture of past and present Hollywood films, the locating is in Griffith Park, making it a perfect combination to see the universe, and get some fresh air and exercise. Has great sunrise and sunset vistas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legacyLA
50,I loved the view and weather,This place is great for visiting even alone or with couple or group. There is a small parking at the top but you can also park before arriving -down the road - then take a nice walk for 5-8 min. Hollywood sign appears close and go around the building to see downtown LA view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581serifc
50,Must visit,This an iconic spot in LA. A must see if you do visit. Site offers nice views of the city's layout. On a not so smoggy day you can get great selfies with Hollywood sign as back drop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herlitzd
50,Plan to spend some time,There is an amazing amount of stuff to see here with your kids (or just to learn for yourself). See the planetarium show and bring food (just not in the planetarium) because there is no concession.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gfinger
50,Be careful with a date.,"The Griffith Observatory is one of the great places to enjoy in Los Angeles. The architecture is the best, the view is unsurpassed and the educational experience, if your into that, may spark wonder into your child's mind...or even yours.I took a lovely woman there on our first date. We just celebrated our 20th year wedding anniversary. So watch yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeff678
50,Beautiful View after a Hike,"After a long hike the payoff comes with an absolutely stunning view of LA and the Hollywood sign. The observatory itself was really crowded so I didn't see much, but the overall grounds were well maintained and cared for despite the hundreds of people trampling everywhere on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. We enjoyed a few beverages while sitting on the terrace overlooking the canyon below. Be aware that parking is a challenge; we eventually found some but patience is required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robkR5221MU
50,Hike Up the Path and Visit!,This is a wonderful LA spot -- worth a visit especially if you park on the road and hike up along with the locals and their pups!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
50,Dawn start well worth it,We had the best first morning in LA and headed for a dawn hike from the observatory. We totalled 15 miles and it was amazing to spend time at the observatory!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rmac1984
40,"Decent view of the ""Hollywood sign""","My wife and I were struggling to get a decent backdrop picture of the famous sign and the observatory was not only s lovely place to visit but gave us a decent pic of it, don't get me wrong , you are still about a mile away but you can capture it in a clear day , the drive up to the observatory is lovely as well , some really nice homes and trees lining the streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovethehoops67
50,Very educational,"I recommend this place for every one ,very educational specialty for young people to learn about our universe and fun movie theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianbC1862PR
50,Every time i go there it is a wonderful experience,"No matter how old you may be, it is a great experience for every one, especially for kids & teenagers, a great learning experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peteroM817YG
50,Totally worth the trek up in the car and the parking hell !!,"A really cool place with the best view of LA that you can get for free !Oh yea, if you do like that sky thingy and tend to spend a fair amount of your time looking up (space wise) there are some amazing things to see and do at the Observatory.Too bad 98% of the people there just go for the view and tend to ignore the whole universe we live in. (grin) They'd rather take a picture of themselves pointing at the stupid Hollywood sign rather then go see an actual piece of the moon.The plebs that visit there are more interested in Hollywood's stars then those boring real ones in other galaxies ......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davecason
50,best place in LA,"there is something special in this place : the view of LA, the atmosphere, the place, I think it's the place that I enjoy the most in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antonellar551
40,A view to remember,Parking is hard to find. Otherwise the view is amazing! You can see everything and the drive up is amazing! Go do it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariakvs
50,"Takes time, but worth it","We visited on a weekend and the drive up was slow and tested our patience (45minutes from bottom of hill to top), but when we arrived at the observatory we forgot all about it! View is spectacular!I would definitely not want to miss it. Bring water and some snacks and stay and enjoy views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmwell
50,Really informative and also amazing views of Los Angeles,"For anyone that has a vague interest in Space and all things related, then this is the place to visit. The Observatory is really well laid out and very family friendly. The views from the roof are absolutely stunning and I think you'd be hard pushed to find better anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulawDublin
50,Underwhelmed...,"The Griffith Observatory was interesting, but we were there to see Hollywood Sign, it was a little overcast and given this was evidently the best place to view the sign I think it's safe to say we were underwhelmed, but it's another tick box on the bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2621YBsimonh
50,A must visit in LA,Amazing experience when I visited this place. The place has history and character. The views of LA is just amazing. Should experience both day time and night time. At night the city looks breathtaking with the lights. Should check out the telescope that is open to the public after sun set. Can't recommend this place more. True a great city needs a great park. 😊,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samindabandara
50,Breathtaking views,"Got the privilege to visit this big massive place in Hollywood and I must say that I'm still very speechless about the video I watched about the earth. A little in depth about space, mass, stars, basically how the earth also rotates. If you are into physics, geography and science in general, you should visit the observatory and even if you're not into science per say, you should visit. It's very mind blowing and my expectations were met. For students pls go with an ID for discount tickets, it doesn't matter what country you come from, it's still acceptable and I hope you have a nice time down there. Lastly, if you have a professional camera, I suggest you take it with you. Thank me later 👍🏾😆.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queencrez
50,Stars and Stars,The movie buffs will appreciate the James Dean bust as Rebel Without A Cause was shot here.The astrologists and nature seekers will love the hikes up the observatory and the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cpoptrip
50,Unusual opportunity,"Recently renovated, this place is a must.Fascinating and unusual opportunity both for education and enjoyment. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reiserhof
50,Best view in Los Angeles,"I love this attraction/learning institution more than any other public place in LA. The best time to go is an hour before sunset so you can view the solar telescopes and view the Pacific Ocean before the sun sets. The outside architecture is stunning and can be admired in the daytime or nighttime. If the main entrance is crowded, my favorite entrance is the elevator on the west side of the building. It looks like a shed (not attached to the main building) and you might think it's only for employees - hence no line. If you take it to the bottom floor, you'll arrive at my favorite room - I'll call it the room of Planets. As you step out of the elevator, the best public restroom I've ever seen (can't speak for the ladies) is to the left. Proceeding into the large ""Planet"" room be sure to have your picture taken with Albert Einstein sitting on the bench. Notice his hand raised and relate his forefinger to the ""Big Picture"" - the giant enlargement of the night sky represented by just the tiny part of the sky Albert's finger would cover extended at his arm's length. In the Northeast corner of the ""Big Picture"", you'll be able to watch an informative video on the ""Big Picture"". See if you can locate the quasar that is over 6 billion light years from Earth and is the most distant object in the ""Picture"". Hint - it is below your waist about 1/3 of the way from the left side of the ""Picture"". Fans of Leonard Nimoy should catch his free show which is in the theatre on the upper level of the ""Planet room"". If you go through the main entrance, you immediately encounter an experiment in progress demonstrating the rotation of the Earth. Behind this experiment and a little to the right is a machine (down a hallway) which you can use to purchase tickets to the Planetarium show(s) - a definite must see. This allows you to bypass the line to buy tickets. Do this first before viewing the many displays because shows can sell out. As you walk in the main entrance to the left is a replica of Galileo's telescope and pictures of our galaxy taken in different wavelengths than the visible light spectrum. Be sure to catch the ""lightening"" display - a demonstration of Nikola Tesla's genius. To the right of the main entrance are the solar telescopes (check out before the sun sets) and a large periodic table. Outside, after the sun sets, the lights of LA explode - a view I always think inspired Bob Seger's Hollywood Nights. The large telescope is worth standing in line for. Perhaps visiting the excellent snack and eating in line is an idea. Be sure to visit the lovely souvenir shop before you leave. Walking out the main entrance, you can find a staircase to your right that leads to a dirt path (fire road that leads to a grove of trees a quarter mile down (very romantic spot). The adventurous (and fit) can take the path to the right that is a 15 minute descent to the bottom (and an arduous 30 minute ascent). Otherwise hike up the quarter mile and arrive back at the main entrance. A large lawn separates the observatory from the closest parking lot. At night smaller telescopes are brought out on this lawn and trained on the night sky (saw a beautiful view of Saturn once). As you walk back to the closest parking lot, veer to the right and gaze down on my favorite outdoor musical venue - the Greek Theatre. If you're fortunate music from a live concert will be wafting up the hill. As you walk through the parking lot, one of the best hikes in LA begins at the northern end - a 3 mile loop to the top of Hollywood Mountain - 1.5 miles up. When it's crowded, the parking lot is full and access to it is closed. If open, drive up and wait for a spot to open up - never more than 15 minutes. If closed (peak busy times) you will have to park on the side of the road and hike as much as a mile. Bring comfortable walking shoes, water, and a jacket for when the sun sets and the walk back downhill to your car. Obviously, all this can take several hours so plan many return trips or an all day adventure. Enjoy! My apologies for any inaccuracies or esoteric descriptions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9983AGjohnc
40,What a view.,Beautiful view. It is worth the trip. I am not fond of heights but I still loved it.Be sure to go on all the floors & look at the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224tiffanyw
50,Watch the sunset!,Amazing view of LA. Climb the hill and watch the sun go down. You will never forget it. Inside museum is very interesting. The staff is very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3442HDbarbaras
50,Griffith,"Awesome views. A must do if visiting LA. The show on the origins of the universe was fantastic. The narrator was really a fantastic story teller. Easy parking if you go early. Hiking options looked great. Food options were really nice, with fresh options. Buy your tickets at the self service kiosk and avoid the line. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChD1994
40,"Interesting, unique and free","Solid and interesting family activity that costs no money.If you are hiking the surrounding trails, it's a fun stop along the way with some nice vantage points.Planetarium shows can be purchased.Parking is congested during busy times, so you may need to walk a bit or take the dash bus up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veeenie
40,A great spot for learning about the stars and our galaxy!,"Great spot for family learning, but the hard part of the visit is parking! Beautiful views from up at the top of the observatory, and it looks like there are hiking trails taking off from the top of the mountain too. Make sure to allow enough time to enjoy the show in the observatory. The live narration of the history of explanation of our solar system is really interesting for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gail_OCGal
50,We you can see the stars!,I have been going to Griffith Observatory for many years. I always enjoy going there. They are always updating the place. They keep the old attractions that we are always wanting to see. Children really learn so much visiting. It's in the middle of beautiful Griffith Park. A must see place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsF8241KC
50,Tons of Information and you don't have to spend Tons of $$,Loved all of the information you can get for the kids to learn about planets and the different stars. Great place to take visitors from other states to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255nuryr
40,More than meets the eye,"We made our way out to the Observatory because it has been featured in several movies. I was expecting just a simple building with a telescope for viewing the stars. It was so much more. They had amazing exhibits of the history of space exploration, a large collection of meteorites, a camera obscura, and the planetarium. We caught two shows called Water is Life and Center of the Universe. The speaker had this amazingly calm voice and the shows were informative. The view from the grounds was a definite must see. Be prepared to walk a bit uphill if you don't want to pay the $4 parking fee per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScrappyGuy
40,Loved the planetarium,"The admission to the observatory is free but the planetarium ticket is $7 per adult and is well worth it. We watched a show called ""Light of the Valkyries"" about the Northern lights which was fantastic. You can also hike down the park towards the city of LA or to the Hollywood sign. There are free telescopes outside to look at the moon or other objects with magnifying power of 130 times. We loved the experience and will definitely go there again during the weekend to do some hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine671041
40,I spy with my little eye...,"If you get a chance, take a guided tour. The history of how GO was built is very interesting. There are many hike paths that take you to and fro around the area and the gift shop is quite fun to waste some time in. I've visited several times both hiking and inside the museum. I know I should love this place but my attention span is limited. I'd say plan for a couple of hours, enough to take pictures outside and a look-see inside the place. Check out their calendar ahead of time and grab a unique keepsake in the gift shop and consider it a job well-done. It does take some effort finding parking so, plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntitled1
40,Very Good,Free admissionPretty view-Hollywood sign-Downtown view-culver city viewParking is difficult when you arrive there on weekend after 8:30am.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneKim2
50,Great way to spend the morning or afternoon.,We parked at the zoo and took the shuttle to observatory. It is a beautiful building. Inside it has been fully remodeled. The planetarium is awesome. The seats are very comfortable. Outside on a clear day you can see to the ocean and the to the south to the hills of orange. You can also take trails nearby to hike to the Hollywood Sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/explorer1421
50,"Day or night, it's the place to be","Visiting family in the area and this was recommended. Lovely drive through a natural park to see the incredible vistas from the park around the observatory, including the Hollywood sign. Inside, the facility was recently renovated and has theaters, views and scientific exhibits. The central pendulum clock was pretty neat--be sure to ask why there are 41 hours in the day! Then look up at all the amazing murals from the 1930s. Best exhibit has got to be the Tesla Coil--way cool. Be sure to check the schedule to get a front row spot to watch it in action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKop
50,Griffith Park Observatory,"I grew up in Los Angeles so have visited Griffith Park Observatory many times and I love it. To see pictures view the movie LaLa Land. Don,t miss the domed theater! Also you have a beautiful view of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauslu

50,You just might learn somethin',Go for the views if nothing else. And you can picnic around the grounds. The employees (docents??) are knowledgable and love sharing. It's gorgeous. Rebel Without a Cause was filmed there. Parking sucks but you'll get a nice walk in. It's fascinating and wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexa817

40,Wow,We loved the view of LA there. We didn't go inside. It's free to walk around the outside and free to park. It's at the Hollywood sign so that's neat to see. They stay open till 10pm. I recommend day time visits. It's a must do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisnhso
10,Swing and a miss due to impossible parking,"An endless stream of cars and substantially insufficient parking meant we only got a drive-by experience. Really disappointing waste of time. There were parking assistants but they weren't very effective in how they were managing the situation. The city really should consider how they can limit cars (either increase their shuttle services or perhaps require pre-arranged tickets with staggered entry times, similar to The Getty's system) to better coordinate travelers and help avoid disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leebot

50,A must see in LA,What a view! Even on a hazy day the views from the observatory are amazing. The exhibits inside are interesting too. The planetarium show was worthwhile and very well done. Enjoyed a short hike afterwards towards an overlook for the Hollywood sign. A true LA experience. Come early or late to avoid the crowds can be busy even during the week.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicias655
40,Fantastic view of Los Angeles and an informative view of the stars,"I took a Lyft ride up to the observatory and I'm glad I did, if I had driven i would have parked a distance away, my ride dropped me off right up front. The observatory is very informative about our solar system. You can spend hours just reading all the exhibits. The Tesla exhibit I really liked, but it only runs at certain times.Plan on spending a few hours if you want to see it all, also best place to see the ""Hollywood"" sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NNWSLARRY
40,"Beautiful Views, Worth the Drive",Went up on a very busy Friday evening. I would give it a 5 but navigating traffic and parking was a disaster. Mostly because the parking attendants were disorganized and rude.Once we found parking and walked up it was great. I wish we would have had more time as the views are stunning and there was a lot to read and learn about. Would definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeautyForAshes
30,La la land tour,"Getting here on a beautiful Saturday was a disaster. It was so crowded and by the time we parked, rode the shuttle, and walked around we were frustrated. It was an amazing view, however, and we loved seeing the scenes where they taped la la land. I would recommend going during the week and at night when you can see through all the telescopes! Also they did not tape the movie inside the planetarium at Griffith observatory so don't pay to see a show just to see inside ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358carag
50,Beautiful view at sunset!,"Beware the traffic up and down from the observatory is brutal at sunset, unsure if this is all the time or just at sunset. View was breathtaking and worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimwit11
40,The best views of LA,This is the place to capture your shot of LA the views are incredible and of course the famous Hollywood sign. The observatory also contains some fascinating scientific discoveries facts and information. If you have the time it is worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_perrya53
50,360 degree view of LA,Best to visit in the evening. Go around 5pm enjoy the exhibits and the show at the planetarium. Make sure you come back out and enjoy the view of LA during sunset and when the lights get switched on it's a spectacular sight. You can get a good view of the Hollywood sign from here as well.It's a great place to get a bird's eye view of the city and I would recommend anyone visiting LA to come here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeelikaT

20,Parking and getting to the Observatory is a major problem,"Whilst once you are there the attraction is fine, but getting there really coloured my view. The $4 parking at the observatory was full so we were turned away and directed to the ""free"" parking at the Greek Theatre. We then had to wait 30 minutes for a bus which was already over crowded from earlier stops and cost $2 for the 4 of us each way $4 the same as if we had been able to park. If the observatory is not to be a victim of its own success it probably needs to take its parking seriously and get a dedicated 5 - 10 minute shuttle leaving the parking at the observatory for disabled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344MarkH
40,Very nice,"Best is to go after sunset. The fog over the city during the day makes it difficult to see it all, but once the sun sets, and all the lights illuminates, it's really a site to treasure.There are many visitors every night and the parking is limited. You can park freely outside the premisses but then walk all the way up.The Planetarium offers a 30 minutes show which is very educational, especially for an audience with little or no knowledge regarding the issue.We took it and it was enjoyable as well as expanding the horrizon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danny_1957

50,Spring break LA,"What an awesome place! Unbelievable views! As far as I could tell, everything was free. Excellent educational opportunity as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damonw730
50,Fantastic evening at the observatory,If you go after sunrise you can check out the main telescopes and some portable ones they set up in the grounds... All for free. We were lucky enough to see Jupiter the day we visited... Very cool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sufiahw
50,loved it!!,"i'm a total space fanatic so this was an amazing experience for me. i was expecting it to be a little less than what i would have wanted but it didn't disappoint! the only bad part is the parking but i recommend you get here EARLY for parking! and if you get free parking, there's a long walk up to the observatory! it's not bad unless you can't walk for a long time, then i recommend you park a little closer! i went to the planetarium show with my mom which we both loved! itcost $7 each but there's discounts for anyone over 60 and students! also be sure to stop for a bite to eat because if you don't, you'll get hungry walking around!! have some snacks on hand, especially if you're sugar tends to go down or if you have little ones!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samuelleceballos
50,Sunset views are great,"Only cost a few dollars to park, would suggest driving closer to the observatory and parking, rather than the free parking which would be a pretty good hike and you may get lost/miss the magic of the sunset. Really nice feeling as the daylight slips away and the view of the city changes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M4RK_H
50,"Fantastic Views, Lots to Learn","so much cool stuff to see, from the Hollywood Sign to the city below and the sky above. The planetarium shows are also a lot of fun and definitely worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franktH4869SI
50,Don't Miss the Griffith Observatory,"Wonderful place to visit at sunset. The main telescope is really fun to look through since it's such an enormous piece of equipment; but all the non-professional astronomers that bring their telescopes to look at other things was such a great surprise. The view of the Hollywood sign at sunset is stunning. Definitely recommend. Don't park at the bottom and hike up, it's uphill and difficult. Plenty of parking up close to the observatory even if there is a long linel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmbastin
50,I highly recommend to visit while in LA,"Nice view of LA area, you can see the hollywood sign (not lit at night), downtown LA and city of Hollywood. It's definitely better when its lit up at night.Inside the building theres alot of cool educational space stuff, I'd say plan to spend at least a couple hours or more in this spot.Parking is terrible, especially during the weekends, with too many crowd, it's better visit during the weekday, less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badwolflibrarian
40,Griffiths Observatory,Stunning views of the City and the Hollywood Sign! We took some great pictures with these as the background and they are treasured memories.We went during the day which was nice - lots of parking and not too busy.But at night! Spectacular!And nice to have that connection from La La Land! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me8ow
50,Amazing views,"Parked across from the Greek theatre as it was free. Only a short walk to the observatory. The car park at the top was crazy busy so if you are able to take the half mile up hill walking from the Greek theatre it's worth doing. It was super busy and pretty chaotic in the observatory but definitely worth a visit. We ate in the cafe and the food was nice and fresh. We are vegetarian and there were several options. We saw the centre of the earth show which was amazing! And only $7! We then took a walk up to the Hollywood sign. Really lovely place. Saw lots of birds, lizards and butterfly on our way up. Stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziggiy
30,I was more interested than the children,"A really great small, free museum. Good, well explained and interesting displays. However the children (9 and 10) kept telling me they had learned it all at school so they knew it all. Kids! I enjoyed it though. Parking was v busy though, so get there early and walk up mount Hollywood first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smallcar
40,Great fun place,I went there with family and had a memorable time. It is a great place and provides a lot of factual data and knowledge.. Must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/366shriyam
50,Educational but Fun,"Had an amazing time here, with a great view of the Hollywood sign and a great view over all of LA. But went primarily for the observatory. An amazing place and would recommend the planetarium 100%!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dubsy135

50,"Great views, great hiking","This is a must stop for the views alone. You can spend a lot of time here with the museum up top, and the long hiking trails. Still prefer places like Runyon in this area, but this is still a great place for hikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_and_Hedge

50,That Hollywood view,Usually when I visit the states I am just a tourist in the buses but this time I hired a car and drove here. It's stunning such a beautiful Los Angeles view. I'd love to hear back at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvitton
40,Great if you like to see and learn more of our Solar system,The observatory was a great place to visit. We took a guided tour and walked up the hill to view the Hollywood sign and the observatory. It is free unless you want to go up the viewing deck for the Observatory. The tour we took did cost....but it wasnt expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648mareem
40,Light Show Extraordinaire in La La Land!,"If you're in the Hollywood area and the sun has just gone down, drive up to the Observatory just to see the lights-it's unbelievable! My first time up there-was expecting ""La La Land"" . . .but it's not like the movie. In the movie you get the impression that no one's up there, but there are hundred of people (and cars)! Even with all the people and cars, the view of the city lights is worth every minute! I'll have to go back to see the inside of the Observatory, but bet it won't match the beautiful light show of La La Land!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6820QBjamesm
50,Our tour,Nice tour. Interesting. Right with our Hollywood sign hike. Our tour guide Danny was cool. Alot of things to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape702740
50,Great view and show,"The view in the show at the Griffith Observatory was great. Really glad we went. Learned about a lot of things. Only thing we did not like being senior citizens, was standing outside in the hot air as there were no chairs to sit down and we're waiting for the show doors to open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627herbe
50,Great Visit & Great View,The Griffith Observatory provides a spectacular view! I took pictures of the Hollywood sign and beautiful Hollywood hills. I really enjoyed my visit and recommend it to all tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelah80
50,Best views of LA,"I came here in the evening as part of the LA tour my sister was giving me. Besides there being awful traffic getting to parking (welcome to LA), the views were spectacular. You could see the Hollywood sign, see the glowing/twinkling lights of the urban sprawl... It was lovely. And there is a very informative exhibit inside talking about space and time and stars and things that I would have liked to spend more time doing, however we went on a very busy day and there were 100s of people there, making it hard to wander slowly/quietly. We also did the planetarium show, which was very cool, talked about the history of how we came to understand the universe and planets and such. This was overall a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to any newcomers in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrooklynRed1
50,Beautiful View With Parking Issues,"My daughter and I drove up to the observatory on a Monday knowing full well that it was closed. I remember as a young child visiting the observatory with my parents and practically having the entire parking lot to ourselves . . . that's not the case anymore. Parking now is at a whopping $4.00 per hour, if you're lucky enough to find a space. We lucked out on parking because the observatory was closed, but I'm sure that when it's open parking becomes a bigger issue. There were people who opted to park for ""free"" down the hill and hike up. I prefer to pay for parking. Each parking spot has a number and you have to pay at a kiosk. There are kiosks all over the place, but there's only one that accepts cash. Beware, if paying cash make sure you pay with exact amount because the machine doesn't dispense change. I didn't know that and put in a $5 bill, but no change was dispensed. I asked a parking attendant and was told that I could call a number to see if I could get my change. I let it go.The views are breathtaking and spectacular, but we went on a hazy day. The grounds are very well maintained and although the observatory itself was closed there were people milling around taking pictures and whatnot. I would really like to visit the observatory since I haven't been inside for ages, but I would be greatly upset to drive for an hour just to be directed to park down the hill and walk up . . . not happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nereida
30,"Free, crowded, hard to park but worth it","First the parking, get there early and prepare to walk. The lot fills up quickly, which means you have an uphill climb to get to the observatory. On the other hand the parking outside is free and you don't need to go to the gym afterwards.The exhibit rooms are small but quite interesting and well designed. They had a very interesting noon ""sun"" discuss that was fascinating. The cafe food was good.Of course the view is extraordinary and, naturally, you must take a picture of the Hollywood sign!Allow two hours, perhaps more if you get there during a busy time and cannot park close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperiencedTravelers
50,Amazing view & FREE,Amazing city skyline view best seen at night! The observatory itself is a beautiful art deco building not to be missed. Only a few of the scheduled shows require admission otherwise it is absolutely free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler9955
50,Fantastic,The exhibits of the observatory are scientific enough to provide generate new insights but easy enough for everyone to understand. Cues for the telescope are long,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timgilbert09
50,Must-see,Part of the fabric of Los Angeles it is a his historic place t and is a real cool place not to mention beautiful view of Los Angeles anyone who has not been there should go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bagpipeasap
40,Hollywood,If you want to be in front of the Hollywood sign to take pictures then I do not recommend this tour. It takes you behind the sign and if you want to be in front of it for pictures you have to hike down the cliff. Especially do not recommend for anyone who can not or does not want to go hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tebrewer3
50,You must visit it!,Certainly a milestone if you visit Los Angeles. From here you will have an enchanting view over the city of Angels both day and night. During daylight hours is probably also the best spot to see the Hollywood sign on the nearby hill. If you have a good camera you will not be disappointed.Of course don’t forget to go inside the observatory to admire the sky over Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
50,Super romantic lalaland moment,We spent the morning visiting the premises and enjoying the View. Walking around is magic and the Views of LA are breathtaking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankCortesBcn
40,"Great views, iconic architecture","Great panoramic views of the city even on a hazy day, from the Hollywood sign to the ocean, Santa Monica to Downtown LA. A great place to take a visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllaMia
50,What a spot!,This place is good for almost everyone and not just for people who love astronomy and science(it's an observatory after all).You get to see the whole city; you can go for a hike and of course the observatory has quite a few things to see. Apparently on a clear night you can watch the stars as well. This is one of my top 3 things to see in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
50,Amazing view!,"Decided to park and walk up the hill. This place gets very crowded, there's people everywhere taking pictures with the Hollywood sign or the city in the background or the observatory. You can come during the day and picnic here, it is very nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raintreeflower
50,"Fantastic view, nice/clean facility.","Fantastic view, nice/clean facility. Educational materials and exhibitions. Traffic and parking in the Sun night was disastrous. Spent +30 min stuck to find the parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fencer1215
50,Griffith Observatory,"Griffith observatory was a wonderful stop along our tour route, so much to see inside the observatory and the views were spectacular ,we could spend half a day there especially the surrounding trails",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/broganr901
50,Good place to bring visitors of LA,"There are so many things said and movies shot, there isn't much to add.. when you have guests and you spend time with quality visit... then you choose Griffit Observatory... nice views... sometimes nice movies, or shows... kids also can have fun if they are into all that space and things...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bureacrate
50,great view of Hollywood at night.,Was actually hoping to get a better view of the HOLLYWOOD sign and not able to. Still enjoyed the night views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawglovr
40,Nice view,"Visited the Griffith during the day and the centre was closed. It has great views of LA and good walking trails. Dissapointingly,it does not have a cafe or restaurant and public transport is possible - catch the DASH up and down. Definetly worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondenomad94
50,Amazing Views,"We went at night and walked around outside, did not enter the observatory. The views were amazing. With all the lights you could see for miles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clusgluk
50,Saw Orion Stars and spectacular LA lights,"This is one nice place that one should definitely visit when in LA.You get to see ...1. LA City view2. Hollywood sign3. See some stars through the telescope4. Gain some knowledge about astronomy5. Nice photographs6. If you are on time then you can catch up a short movie (40 minutes) as well.Entry as such is free. There is a fee for watching the show which is optional. There is free parking as well.In short, there is something for all age groups.Don't miss this one on your LA trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virag81

50,"Oh, the Views you will have...","This was just a super choice ""to kill and afternoon in LA! Sure we chose a crowded Sunday afternoon...BUT sooo....the crowd was diverse, happy, HUGE, and enjoying everything the OBS had to offer...it was great...And then we hiked the trails to the Summit Overlook above. Just GO...you will have a fine time, indeed. And the STAFF was most helpful!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveN519
50,Must stop by and enjoy,"This is the second time I've been here after a year and I'm surprised at the fact there are no more free parking! I will admit it has cut down on the congestion on top, but the rates are $4 an hour is pretty steep. There is a new addition of a cafe by Wolfgang Puck that I did not experience on the bottom level from observatory, but that is quite a convenience. All the telescopes require 50 cents to use which is fun for the kids. All the views on the deck of the observatory offer amazing views of downtown LA as well as the Hollywood sign. The front lawn of the observatory is a nice place to sit and relax enjoying the sun. A great stop during your LA visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcseven
50,Our favourite spot in LA trip,"This was by far our fav spot in LA with 2 small kids. First of all, it is free unless you get the Planetarium tickets: and you SHOULD see that show! Amazing! Also, pack some lunch/snacks w you and spend time in the front yard by enjoying the views, Hollywood sign, etc. You can easily spend 2-3 hours there and it will be a quality time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElifC293
50,A nust,The observatory is a must when visiting LA. You have a commanding view of LA and the Hollywood Sign. The park is known for hiking trails and it's great for kids as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571barryz
40,Beautiful hike up Griffith Observatory,My son and I parked and hiked up one of the trails to the observatory on top. The recent rains have made the Hollywood hills green and full of wildflowers. We had a snack at the Trails Cafe. We hiked on Monday when the observatory is closed but the hike and views were worth it. Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frij0lita
40,"Great, sweeping view of LA","I like coming here close to sunset time to take pictures of the art-deco architectural details and the surrounding view, and just people-watch. Parking can be an issue because a lot of people come to do the same: enjoying this lovely spot for sunset view. It's a good idea to wear comfortable footwear because you may have to park quite bit away and walk uphill, and once there, you want to explore all the angles for best view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyfulsteps
40,Romantic spot,"I didn't grow up in LA, but this place has one of the most remarkable views of La La Land (plus, it was in the movie). The city looks like twinkling sea of lights - magical. It's a great date night - just kissing under the stars there. In the building you can geek out on some science things; interesting. There isn't a lot (perfect for a date night in my opinion). I've heard this place is a must-do. I'd agree. There are bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamazurek
40,Wonderful evening view,The evening view from here is amazing. The building itself is also an Art Deco gem. The grounds are free to wander but watching a show will require a ticket. They also have amateurs with telescopes that you can use to view the moon. I parked for free at the bottom of the hill and walked up. About 15 minutes up and 10 minutes down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rather_Nomadic
50,Classic SoCal Place to Visit,"Griffith Observatory is definitely a must-see when you're in the LA area. Wonderful views and it's just so iconic. You can take lots of great photos of the Hollywood sign from all over the property.One complaint - parking. We went on a Saturday morning and it was like all of LA was there. We had to park about a mile down the hill. Regular paid parking (if you could find it) was only $4 an hour which I didn't think was too outrageous for LA, considering we'd just paid $18 to park at the Queen Mary the day before. My recommendation is to not go on a weekend if you can help it. But do go!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5280momma
40,"Family friendly, fun to explore and FREE","Griffith Observatory has many interesting exhibits, as well as a spectacular planetarium show. Admission to the exhibits is free. The show (and there are others besides the main planetarium show) has an admission fee with discounts for students, seniors and kids. It is highly recommended---but be sure to plan this part of the visit, because the on-site ticket booth has very limited ticket sale times. And shows sell out. The exhibits feature the history of telescopes, spectacular photos of the sun and planets, and even an actual moon rock from an Apollo mission.Bonus: Picnic on the lawn where there's a great view of the Hollywood sign.Bonus #2: Do not drive up there. We parked in the Hollywood area (corner of Ambrose and Hillhurst) and rode the ""Dash"" city bus (Google the ""Los Angeles Dash bus"" for route and schedule) up to the Observatory. Fare is 50 cents (or less) and well worth avoiding the crazy, crowded, inadequate parking as you go up the hill to the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/like_national_parks
50,A great hike,We did not enter the (free) observatory -- very sad to have missed it - but instead had an early morning hike. Took an Uber to Trails Cafe just inside Griffith Park and walked a fire road up to the Observatory. Great place to see the Hollywood sign and views of the city. Beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherK111
40,Space enthusiasts,"For anyone who is interested in the solar system, this place is a must see. To much information to talk about. Very visual and great for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JD1103
50,Amazing views,"What a wonderful place to see all of LA (not entirely possible as it's so vast) but certainly a prime spot to see Downtown, Hollywood Sign, Griffith Park etc.It's easy to get to via cab or transport (or car if you have one - you need one in LA!) and we ended up getting a taxi up there as we had only arrived the day before, so wanted a quick and easy ride. It was only around $20 dollars from west Hollywood and easy to find and a nice ride to see the houses on route.The views are pretty amazing and you can take some great photos for all parts of LA from here, which makes the trip worthwhile.Obviously being so popular and recently featuring in La La Land, it's immensely popular, so very busy indeed, but still worth the visit.The observatory itself is wonderful, and lovely to get lost in as it's cool and dark, and nice to break from the intense LA sun, and it's reasonably priced too and easy to navigate around, with a nice cafe and outside seating area.We chose to take the bus back down to redline metro and then metro to Hollywood Boulevard, so an easy journey and fairly empty too, nobody uses public transport!The traffic was a pain and the parking is bonkers, so many cars, so I'd recommend a taxi or public transport, or get dropped at Griffith park for a good hard stroll up the hills. Staff that we dealt with were friendly enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadlad
40,photo op,it's not NYCs Rose Planetarium but it IS good enough for the kids and an iconicphoto op spot for romantic shots with the entire LA basin in the background on a beautiful day or a clear nite with city lights on full display. used to have laser light shows at night. not certain if they still exist,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janieB1123
50,Entire Park,"Observatory, Zoo, Gene Autry Museum , Hiking trails, and so much more.This area has so much to enjoy and in a 10 day span we choose to spend 4 days here.The Zoo was so lovely, and such a surprise because we felt you really don't here much about the LA Zoo and we had a wonderful time. The Autry Museum was another pleasant surprise and delightful few hours spent . I would highly recommend for hikers, animal lovers , scientists and anyone loving the outdoors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuePirate
40,Griffith Observatory - a great stop,Was in LA in early Mar and decided to take an Uber up to the Griffith after seeing it from a far. It was worth the effort as the show was quite enjoyable and the view of the city pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cgyguy
50,prettiest place in Los Angeles,"I don't love most of Los Angeles, but I do love the architecture of and vistas from the Griffith Observatory. It is no surprise that La La Land filmed a very romantic and beautiful scene here, because really it is the most atmospheric place in LA. Hike up to it during the day, and drive up at night to use the observatory to see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarameli
20,An ineptly managed facility,"To begin with, the parking is a problem. They installed ticket machines that don't work well, don't return the money or give change and even the employees were complaining about the mess. Better take a tour bus rather than drive there.We wanted to see the meridian instrument which is outdoors. However the observatory does not open till noon and the sun passes the meridian around noon time. The access stairs were blocked with signs ""FOR EMPLOYEES ONLY"" so by the time we sneaked around the signs and went down to the instrument, the sun had passed already. It is sheer ineptitude to accept money from a donor to build a beautiful instrument and then block people from seeing it.Needless to say, there was nobody around to direct us, never mind answer questions.Because of the noon opening there were thousands of people crowding the place waiting to be admitted. Never again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erwinw2013
50,Amazing,One of the best places and must visit in LA. The view is breathtaking and you won't regret coming here. I would suggest to come here during weekdays since it's always busy on weekend you'll have a trouble finding a parking spot. I actually took some pictures with my iphone 7 and they look very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdMoch
40,The top of the world....well LA anyway,"Ok, first off if you don’t know this building, you will almost certainly know the view of the Hollywood hills and LA that it offers, it’s a great place to take a spot and look out over the city (if you can see it through the smog). My first piece of advice is don’t drive up here, it’s a really really bad idea. There is a shuttle bus that goes from the metro station on Vermont/Sunset and it costs a whopping 50c for a return, so just don’t even try.The journey up takes about 15-20 mins but it’s a nice little ride on an air conditioned bus. Remember this doesn’t take you up to the Hollywood sign, although the view is much improved than the one you get down in the valley. I like space, I have to admit, bit of a nerd, and so quite like the fact that this place has a room named after Leonard Nimoy (Spock from Star Trek).The building is beautiful from the outside, first off. Check out the statues and their plaques in the grounds around it. Visiting this place breaks down to two parts.Outside: You have to see the view of LA, and of the Hollywood sign. On a good day you can see for miles and miles, but remember that smog swallows LA some of the time. The view of the Hollywood sign is of course worth it though, especially if you don’t fancy a wander for miles up a hill. The observatory itself is beautiful, Art Deco in it’s design. Have a wander up the stairs and take a look at the telescope.Inside: This place is beautiful, absolutely stunning, with it’s planet room, it’s decorations and the nice food served in the cafe (with a view over LA). I spent nearly 3 hours walking around and taking photos. Go for the outside, but definitely see the inside.On a sunny day, you can expect todo half a day up here easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tengoldrings
40,Breathtaking views,"This place is known just as much for its incredible views of LA, as it is for its top quality museum.We got an uber up here as parking is quite expensive and the place is always very busy too. On the day we were there the museum inside was jam-packed with visitors, so we didn't spend half the amount of time inside as we could have (Such a hot day too)....But the exhibits were very well put together informative and interesting. Lots of interaction too to keep younger minds interested.The view from the rear exterior of this building is simply breath-taking though. You can see right to the coast over in Santa Monica on a clear (and smog free) day. You will recognise the view from literally thousands of photographs of LA, and TV shows, books, movies etc. Its such a famous skyline.After our visit, and as it was such a clear and warm day, we decided to walk down back into the city via the boy scout trail that winds down the mountain. A lovely walk and perfect end to a great afternoon at the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeadSoulsSocialClub
50,Free museum in historic observatory,"We visited the observatory partly to see this interesting building with beautiful architecture and partly for the views of LA. We were really surprised by the large crowds and the distance we had to park down the road. We had to walk about 20 minutes to get to the observatory, all the while wondering if it would be worth it. It definitely was! We were really surprised by the number of exhibits inside that are absolutely free to view. The planetarium does cost money, but we had small kiddos and weren't able to do that anyway. There are great views of LA, views of the Hollywood sign, and a nice little cafe. Highly recommended to anyone traveling to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zdufran
50,Fun visit to the stars and more,The Griffith Observatory is a fun place to visit and learn about our planet and the stars ... And there's a Tesla coil... How cool is that,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8822BGsteve

50,Beautiful,Loved this iconic and beautiful building! We didn't go inside because it wasn't open until 10am. We strolled around the outside and enjoyed the fantastic views while also admiring the architecture. Lots of walking trails in the area as well as a view of the Hollywood sign. Will definitely return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
50,Come by day and night!,"I loved this place, my favourite stop in L.A. so far. We drove up during the day first which was a mistake as the parking up top is pretty expensive. Park your car at the Vermont entrance for free and get the shuttle for 50 cents to the top. During the day get a good view of the Hollywood sign and panoramic views of the city. Sadly the pollution is pretty awful but the sheer size of the city is impressive.The FREE museum is pretty awesome. Lots of cool geeky stuff that would have kept us entertained for longer if we hadn't been silly and driven up and needed to get back to our car before it cost us a fortune. You want at least 2 hours really and that's without doing any walking in the hills.At night it gets even better. We missed sunset which I'm sure would be awesome but the city lights were spectacular. You can see much further than during the smoggy day. The museum opens until 10pm but you want to get there well before 9pm so you can get in to see and look through the 12"" telescope! We saw Sirius which was lucky as there was a bit of cloud around. All in all a sunset visit is probably the best time to go, and go you must if visiting L.A!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath
50,"Informative, romantic, FREE","You wanted to know about the universe, yet be interactive, and have your questions answered. This place has it all. Professors wandering about to talk if you like, in depth/ great exhibits to see what you weight on mars or how meteoroids can hit things. Also, lets talk about the city view. Its jaw dropping. You can see it all from the hollywood sign, to down town. Please plan if you do go at night, some extra time to see things and get there before parking fills up. In the day, the trails are great to run up and down the hillside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349hannaj
40,Hollywood sign!!!,"This is the spot we go to for viewing the Hollywood sign, great view of the city. ample parking and clean restrooms. Great place to take selfies and walk the observatory grounds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WIWIandBRAD
50,Lost into space!,"The views over the city are stunning, we were there at the sunset and night so we could see the Hollywood sign clearly, but if you want to see that from a perfect angle, that's the place! The observatory is free and full of interesting and sometimes interactive displays of astronomic science. We had a chance to see the show on the planetarium regarding the universe and it costs a few bucks. I would definitely recommend this because the graphic is impressive and most of all the guy diving the speech LIVE is an awesome speaker and we just loved it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MemiMemole
40,What a beautiful view!,"We couldn't find any parking this time around, but the view of the city and the Hollywood sign are really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaylal252
50,This place is Amazing,You can't visit Los Angeles and not go to the Observatory. My son and I came here while vacationing in the area. The views of the city are absolutely breathtaking. It was everything I expected it to be and more. Plus you can see the Hollywood sign and the interior of the observatory has all kinds of cool stuff to see and do. We came during the day but next time we go back I definitely want to see it at nighttime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tedlong29
50,Amazing,"We came here sadly on the one day that the observatory was closed, but the views were still outstanding. You can see so far out it's like you can see the whole state (haha you definitely can't but it almost feels that way). Very cool place to visit if you enjoy views of city & mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552arir
40,Good Place to visit once - Trails worth it,"This is a nice huge observatory building, lots new to learn and absorb. Guides are good. Hollywood sign to look for. Very crowded and parking is very hard to find specially on weekends, so be prepared to walk a mile or 2 to find one. picturesque views after rare rains this year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dekhanerasika
50,Great for a science nerd,Even when I lived in L.A. I would frequently go to the observatory. The planetarium shows are always amazing. There is no admission charge but if you want to see a show in the planetarium there is a nominal fee. Make sure you go at night so that you can look out at the city of Los Angeles. This is a must for any trip to L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sekesq7
50,"Surprisingly good, a real gem","Maybe two weeks before reaching the LA, me and my friend traveling the Southwest spent a day in the Nasa Space Center in Houston. As that was a huge disappointment, we weren't expecting anything from any popular science museum. Still, after arriving to the LA during a pouring rain, we (rather reluctantly, actually more interested to see the city from the hills) went to see the Griffith Observatory.The traffic jam and queuing to get there is just ridiculous (especially with the flashing signs telling you that ""Access to the Griffith Observatory is closed through the street X, use the street Y"" while you have no idea whether you're driving on X, Y or maybe Z and no instructions given of how to reach the street that you're supposed to use...), but that's the LA. The parking is free and people are relaxed and nice (that's also the LA, fortunately, and a friendly surprise after spending too long on the Bay Area where things like ""relaxed"" and ""nice"" are never connected to the traffic), so everything went well after all.The amount of information they offer is huge. Once you think you have already seen it all you'll find out that there's still one more floor/exhibition/movie/viewing platform. Most of it is for free, so don't expect to be the only one around (still the rush was nothing compared to the Nasa Houston!) and often you have to be a polite human being and let the kids to the front row since the observatory attracts people in all ages and the small ones usually can't see from behind everyone else's backs.The best part was when they showed how their HUGE Tesla coil works. I can tell you that was probably one of the coolest things I've ever seen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iinen
50,Great place to visit in LA,"Really need effort to reach the place because we had to walk uphill from the parking place. But it was really worthy. The building was just beautiful and great surroundings. And it's free!If you're interested in astronomy then it would be a great place to visit.I love the view at sunset - twilight time, so better to come late afternoon and leave after sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertNoers
50,Brilliant- & free!,"We walked up the hill (there's free parking at the bottom!) & took a detour half way up to another path which took us down the side of a closed down bird sanctuary & onto the hill opposing the observatory. What a view! We then walked up the road to the observatory itself. It's free entry & there are loads of interactive exhibits giving information about time, space, seasons & much more. The view is incredible, both over LA & towards the hills & Hollywood sign. Perfect for photos. I'd highly recommend this attraction, it's a perfect way to spend a couple of hours, especially on a sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahe832
40,Worth the Hike,"After following hundreds of cars through the entrance up the winding roads and successfully finding parking our second time around, it was definitely worth it all to be able to tour the observatory, see the stunning views and take a picture with the Hollywood sign in the background. Wear your walking shoes and comfortable clothing so that you can go off the beaten path and really experience all that the grounds have to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusB962
40,We will go back,"When we first arrived we were directed to keep driving back down the mountain to park. We ended up circling back around and trying again. The 2nd time we were able to park right next to the observatory. I think we arrived right as all of the sunset observers were leaving (around 7pm). The line for the historic telescope, on the roof, was around an hour wait. We just took advantage of the free, free-standing telescopes on the grounds around the building. We were able to learn a little about Orion's nebulae. The view of LA was really cool. We will definitely go back to experience the roof top telescope and the planetarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511katiem
50,Must Do,"this is a must see if you Visit LA. there are canyons you can jog on, parks to hang out in. The views are amazin if the smog does not hinder you view. The night view is even more amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandZ4157KE
30,A classic,The architecture is the best thing. Planetarium show and exhibits were good but nothing special. Very crowded and parking hard to fine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BinkySez
40,Beautiful,"We went at night and it has stunning views of the city, the Hollywood sign and the sky.The only thing that bothered me was Parking! You will have to park along side the hills and hike up to the observatory. So be mindful of your attire and what time. We parked when there was some sun and stayed till dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessamtz910
50,Beautiful place to look over the world as far as you can see,"This place is amazing, it has trails and beautiful landscape. The scenery is outstanding with views that are visible to a far distance beyond the cities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221daniely
50,Good place with Good view!!,"I did not know that this is the place where they shoot ""La La Land"" until i saw the movie. At first we were looking for the Hollywood sign and we drive randomly up there base on Google map direction. It ended up as a place with good view and nice huge observatory building! The view from the hill is great as you can see the whole LA. If you have time, you can explore inside the observatory(there is a night time activity where you can use the telescope to see star). a good place for family and couple!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BunLay
50,Breathtaking view of the urban dystopia,"All of Los Angeles in one picture, city that seems to have no end. There is no other view like this in whole world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnvarS_13
50,Great place for a date or family trip!,"I went with my partner, and another couple on a Monday night. We really enjoyed the exhibits, and seeing the stars through the telescopes. There was a huge line for the main telescope on the roof, but we were told there were 3 telescopes on the front lawn that had just as good of a view, and basically no line. They were right; we got to see Sirius, Saturn and O'Ryan. Great visit! Admission was free as well, and free parking! Very interesting, hands on exhibits. Good for all ages; everyone can learn something!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901jenna
50,You must visit at sunset,"We hadn't intended our visit but after fighting our way through traffic all afternoon, we ended up here just before dusk.The views of the Hollywood sign from here are good so after a few pictures we wandered inside and ended up buying tickets for the Planetarium. This was very interesting having gone into it having no idea what it was!The view of the city after dark from the back of the Observatory is also worth sticking around for if you arrive before sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxvikxx
40,Beautiful views,The views of LA and the Hollywood sign were awesome! It's a really nice place to walk around. Didn't go inside the observatory though. But the outside is a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaylovesthebeach
50,Must see,"We heard about the Griffiths Observatory from our Uber driver! What a gem!We highly recommend a day here. It's at the top of a hill with a tremendous view of LA.If you like to hike, it's an hour and a half to the Hollywood sign and same back.We took in a planetarium show we all loved.We wish we had more time to see all the wonderful items they had on display.Watching the sunset was wonderful from this vantage point.If you drive yourself be prepared for a long uphill walk to the Observatory.The Uber driver took us up the hill right to the entrance. We were also able to catch a lift back down easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspire586025
50,Go at sunset,Beautiful view of the city at sunset. This was recommended by our Uber driver and glad we did. Traffic will be quite thick at this time of the day. Popular spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retsekud
50,Love it!,"Great place to come with family and kids!kids can run and have fun outside,inside the observatory is nice!love to come here and wait for the sundown,it's beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beckita-j
50,Great for photos!! A must for visitors!!,"Great views across LA and of the Hollywood sign. Not a lot of parking and it can be hot, hot, hot. But well worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loridog94
30,Los Angeles,Sadly we weren't able to park at the observatory on either day that we drove up there due to the vast number of cars visiting. The views from the area on the way up were breathtaking and gutted that we couldn't stop at the observatory to explore further. Would love to go back and really explore it again in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missylawrence
50,Great Experience and It's Free!,"We parked and walked up and back, which is quite a hike, but easy access parking is at a real minimum. The views of the city are spectacular. The buildings are beautiful and the exhibits are excellent. We spent a couple of hours but you really could spend all day if you're interested in astronomy. Definitely something every visitor to Los Angeles should experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonannie22
40,A must see in L.A,"You can't miss this wonderful place. It has amazing views, specially the sunset view, inside the observatory there are some great interesting things, but I really enjoyed more the outside view an the park itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Killdavo
50,our of this world !,"called in here january 2016 after the Namm show in Anaheim..from australia , not sure of public transport so we hired a car..Stunning views of LA and the Hollywood sign in the distance ..parking maybe a problem on busy days ..noticed lots of cars on the approach..welll run gift shop and snacks ..on the day we visited the Hari Krishnas had a free book store operating in the car park..worth the drive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drumsontherange
50,A must do in LA,"Beutiful views of LA, plus the inside of the Observatory has very interesting content. Try to see one of the three 30-min shows inside the Planetarium.We took a taxi on the way up and hiked on the way down. Suggest not to bring your own car as it is incredibly busy compared to the parking space available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiddenDragon
40,A must,"It can be a pain to get up to it and get parking (we Ubered), but it's a milestone in LA. If you've seen La La Land or Rebel without a Cause, you'll recognize it immediately. Beautiful views, hiking trails, and good dining inside. Too bad there was little time to explore the exhibits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyzz
50,Beautiful views and interesting exhibits,"I've been to the Observatory probably ten different times, both to hike around the area and to show friends the views. This particular trip, we brought some friends up on a Saturday evening. If you don't mind a walk, I'd definitely recommend parking near the greek theatre and walking to the Observatory. The parking lot at the top gets full quickly, which leads to a very slow drive as people parallel park on the street and stop traffic. When the sky is clear, you can see quite far from the rear of the building. Inside, there are a variety of exhibits about space, planets, and stars. You could spend a day here, or just stop in quickly. It gets crowded on the weekends, but it's probably my favorite tourist attraction in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beccam796
30,California road trip,We tried to do this as a last minute decision which didn't work. If you are planning on diing this get there early like 3 or 4. We were told to get there by 6 and then stay after sunset to use the telescopes. This did not work out as about 500 other people had the sane idea. There is only a one lane in and one lane out and parking in the side of the road. If we stayed we would have had to walk 15 to 20 minutes up the moutain to the observatory. So go early!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianemB1463NC
50,Great views of the city & Hollywood sign,"I totally recommend going up there when visiting LA, great views of LA and surroundings, and perfect for a photo with the Hollywood sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquel_lopez_vallejo
50,Always in awe with the stars....,"If you want to get a good view of a Sunset over LA, this is the spot to be. I got there at 1:00 in afternoon, enjoyed all the observatory exhibitions as well as mini-hikes around the grounds. Waited for the Sunset, and was not disappointed with the magnificent view and evening colors. The stargazing exhibition/shows are so amazing. It gives you the feeling that you are up there in the Universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wandermuses
40,Lovely,We were lucky to have a day where we could see a good distance. The Hollywood sign is visible from up there. Parking is an issue on the weekends. Just keep driving around; something will open up. My son wasn't interested in the museum so we didn't stay long but it is really pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAMBelden
50,amazing views,"First time I visited and I'm amazed by the stunning views of LA but also by the contents inside the actual observatory.I can't wait to visit again but next time I would like to see the sunset and be there after it as well.The only problem was the parking but other than that, everything is enjoyable and it is definitely a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilly3851
40,Stunning Views,"I've always loved the LA sights seen from Hollywood films like Heat, Collateral etc. and coming from Asia there's no better place to catch that than the Griffith Observatory. The views here are simply brilliant and a must if you visit LA for the first time.However, the site can get very crowded. The car park was full and there were cars lined up all along the road leading up. We visited around 4-5pm and perhaps the twilight hours get the busiest.The food options are also not the best so I wouldn't recommend coming here hungry. But take in the views and enjoy the scenery!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndearman10
40,Really Nice to Visit With Views of LA and the Hollywood Sign,"This is a great place to visit if you want to see views of LA and the Hollywood sign. It offers clean restrooms, viewing scopes, and a place to grab a bite to eat. We love to explore the planetarium aspects the most! I heard they offer star gazing parties at night which sound ideal for those wanting to look through the main telescopes. It is free admission and free parking, but it can be tricky to find a place if you visit on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnYourMarkTravel
10,"Long winding Road, and No Parking","We took a drive up the windy road on a late Sunday afternoon, hoping to walk around the Observatory, view the city. After nudging along in bumper to bumper traffic for 30 minutes, we reached the top, only to be denied a parking place. There were hundreds of empty slots in an otherwise full lot at the top, but the guards were not allowing us to park. Instead, they directed us back down the hill on the opposite side, declaring that we must park at The Greek and hike back up the mountain! Forget it! We drove on. One hour of my life, never to get back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizardHntr
50,attraction review,Get there early as parking near the Griffith is limited. Otherwise will have to park on the drive and walk up the hill. The observatory shows are excellent and the views outside great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evansj862
50,Amazing views of Los Angeles by night,"We visited the observatory as part of a Hollywood by night tour and it was definitely one of the highlights of the whole experience. We were given a good amount of time to look around and see the city from many different angles. It was really great for photos so make sure to bring your camera. We didn't go inside the observatory itself, just on the roof observation deck and the surrounding area which provided picturesque city views. I would just note there are steps so that could be an issue for some. I would definitely recommend a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarD92
50,Must Visit on a Afternoon in LA,First off big tip take the shuttle bus from Hollywood/vine Station to and from the Park as this drops you right at the front door and you don't have to deal with the parking situation.Then once you get there it is such an amazing view of LA and an amazing building that you get to explore for free!And its a bigger bonus if your interested in astrology to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adroso360
50,Such a great view,"With views over LA and even the Hollywood Sign, the Griffith Observatory is a great sight to see in Los Angeles. You can watch a great sunset and learn some things there, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDPM1
50,Well Worth the Effort!,"The Griffith Observatory is a must-stop for anyone visiting the L.A. area. Other reviewers have noted the parking issue - yes, you might have to park along the roadside and walk up, but how large of a parking lot would people expect to find on top of a mountain!?! I should note that meters have been installed, and that might alleviate some of the problem. Others complained about the view from the top - again, it's L.A., famous for its smog/fog, but the evening sunsets can be quite lovely. One staffer noted that they have been seeing larger crowds than normal, although she didn't know why - expect lots of people, but we had no problem with lines for tickets or bathrooms. Aside from all of that, the observatory has some fantastic new permanent parts, including the Leonard Nimoy Theatre and the photography of one small section of space. Even if you are not thrilled by space exploration, you will find the exhibits well-maintained and thought-provoking - and don't miss the activation of the Tesla Coil!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyA56003

50,Nice views of the city at sunset!,"It was a bit crowded but once you find a good place to watch the sunset, it is pretty! The traffic getting to the park is heavy, so plan to go early and look for a parking space on the way up. There will be a short walk and there are restrooms. If you only go for the sunset scenery, know that there are telescopes also to see more. If you can spend more time here, the trail is good exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Faryz1
40,Fun time wasting before hotel check in,"I had been wanting to come here since I was a child. My sister and I had a few hours to spare before we could check into our hotel so I decided to bring her here. Was fun to wander, and the cafe was better then expected. We also saw the show which was worth the money spent. Was fun to play tourist and walk around taking pictures. Also the hike up was very relaxing as well, but there is parking at the top too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sar-Eiram

Once we got to the top there were a lot of people however it was big enough to move around. There is a patch of grass where you could picnic if you wanted too. The nighttime view is amazing! Also it's all free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtravel06

50,Great place to do many things,"Lovely place to spend an evening, it has many science exhibits inside the building, and there is a telescope on top which is free to the public, if I remember correctly, they operate it from 7pm to 9pm or so, make sure to arrive at the telescope before 7pm, the line can get very long. There was a haze the day I went, so they directed the telescope at the moon, it was my first time with a telescope so I don't have a reference, but the views of the moon were very nice, it was clearer and more detailed than I thought it would be. There is also a nice place to buy food and drinks in the observatory, and you can get nice panoramic views of LA from any place around the the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minalouisfr

40,Monumental building; fabulous views; try to park car before the road becomes one-way,Very busy on a Tuesday afternoon; try to park on the access road before it turns the last corner and becomes one way (beyond that point your vehicle is trapped in a very slow-moving chain heading up and around). The place is definitely worth visiting. Take time to wander around the outside and rooftop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccvvbb

30,Fantastic views,In the Griffith Park.The views are fantastic all around.We got there very early – unplanned – before 10 am on Thursday. Ran into the mayor of LA’s news conference on shuttle service: parking will be paid to subsidize the free shuttle. Someone somehow has to pay -:).It opens at noon. Crowds build up as time nears. Inside isn’t much … we snaked on its terrace over looking the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354irenee

50,"Wonderful views, a must-visit on a trip to LA","The views from Griffith are amazing, you can see almost the entire city from the top. Great hiking trails and the museum inside is very cool.The only bummer is the parking, and the fact that you have to pay extra to go to see the movie inside the observatory. The parking isn't really the fault of the observatory, they only have so much space after all.We looked around the observatory and took some great shots of LA before hiking around to Tiffany's corner. Very cool day indeed. I would say don't bother with a buggy if you're hiking, whereas most of the trail is okay, there is a bridge that gets very muddy after a small amount of rain. Also, look out for rattlesnakes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr939

We had to reach the top and then turn around and go back down the mountain... park and then climb about half a mile. I was pretty cranky by the time we got to the summit. Every available space was being used to observe the sunset. I don't like crowds, but the views were so spectacular I forgot about all of the throngs. The museum and gift shop were also quite entertaining. Great place to take pictures. Nice interactive exhibits, including a demo Tesla coil and seismograph to see how high you could jump!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edmundp2015
40,Great views of the Hollywood Sign!,"Originally my mom and I went up here so that I could show her the Hollywood sign. Much to our surprise, we spent a least two hours here enjoying all of the exhibits at the observatory! Some of them were not functioning, which was a bit disappointing, but overall it was very educational for many folks and pretty fun! The Tesla coil was a big surprise and highlight for me! Just wish this place did more intense and in depth star gazing at night (they offer a few nights where folks bring telescopes, but I want to see though the big ones!). Definitely a neat spot to check out if in LA. Just bring your patience when it comes to parking in the lot. There is a little cafe, but you could always bring your own food along (we had leftovers from Doomie's) and make a little picnic on the massive front lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzlebit13
40,A Must!,"If you really want to see Los Angeles, this is the place. You can also gaze into space and take a lesson on Astronomy. Depending on what time you want to visit, this can can be pleasant. During peak hours traffic is bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roldanski
50,Spring break 2017,"We got to see the observatory and here about how it came to be on our Hikes and Bikes tour through Griffith Park. It's a pretty strenuous hike, so you have to be able to walk uphill on rocky ground and keep your balance. Our tour guide Taylor was the bomb and very knowledgeable. The observatory is really nice and so worth seeing..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qquimay
50,Wonderful experience,"This venue was a great place to go. The shows are exciting to see, the view overlooking the valley and city is beautiful.Went with our grandchildren's class for a school outing and then took out of town guests there as well.A wonderful experience to see when you come to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop
50,Visit to see observatory,The views of Los Angeles up here are amazing. Unfortunately the actual observatory was closed when we arrived as didn't open until 12 noon !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosGrass
50,La La Land Filmed Here but we just watched cool movies in the dark,LOVE LOVE LOVE The Griffith Observatory! Must SEE! It's FREE! It's a COOL Uber Drive up the hill and you have an EXCELLENT view of the Hollywood sign up here. You will get to see some cool LA houses on your trip up the hill. Many hiking trails to cover and the observatory is beyond cool with the numerous 'science planetarium' type exhibits. Pay to see the 'shows' ...well worth the few bucks it costs. A woman (must be a wanna be actress) 'loved her' she comes into the dark dome carrying a glowing orb and her voice is as theatrical as you can get...think 'Boris Karloff w/ Vincent Price' Edward Scissorhands would most definitely live in this place. Besides....#RyanGosling & #EmmaStone danced here. This is a TRUE LA Treasure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814reneec
50,Small but scenic and nice,"The observatory itself is small but if you're instead space it's cool to see. The views of LA are awesome, and the art deco building itself is cool to see. If you're a movie buff it's fun to recognize all of the films that were filmed up there. If you can easily get there, I'd recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233mariak
50,Beautiful Views & Great Information,I encourage everyone to go. Beautiful views of the city. Interesting facts to review inside the observatory. Surprised by some of the bad reviews. We went around 2:00 pm and parking was tight-remember it is all free! Your able to find a spot yet have to wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcdish
40,"Amazing, wonderful views and lots of interesting things.","Went one morning during my trip to LA, besides from traffic, it was wonderful. I saw one of the planetarium shows and was very impressed, it was extremely cool and well done. Walked around for a bit afterwards looking at the exhibits. Lots of interesting information, I especially liked the scales where you could see how much you would weigh on the different planets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/97linneam
50,Went to see the planetarium,I didn't release it was such a big park before getting to the observatory! Wish I planned Day out better to spend there and have lunch in the park. The Griffith itself was full of people but also full of information and the set up of 3 telescopes outside to view the new formation of a star and the full moon! The staff were extremely helpful with questions and informative in the science behind it all!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hriggs76
50,Perfect view,"I'd recommend going to the observatory at night because there area staff members with telescopes so that you can see some planets and the moon and the view of the city and the whole Los Angeles Basin is incredible. Of course it is still an incredible view during the day and you can clearly see everything from the channel islands in the distance to downtown Los Angeles, but at night the city lights look incredible and give you a feel of a living city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophera759
50,A night with the Stars,"From the exhibits to the observatory to the shows, all were excelaant and fun as well as being educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikefP1405FZ
50,to walk or drive is the question!,This is an absolute must if you are visiting Los Angeles.and for the fitter ones among you - I suggest hiking up and making an afternoon /day of it. THE most amazing scenery from here! hands down!great museum too - but not too big to get bored with repetition!then... great cafe also - perfect if you hiked up - bring your camera and telescopic add ons!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaunx10
50,Must do,"This is really an excellent experience. It's best to go at night when you see the lights of the city. We actually went once during the night and once during the day and both were very different experiences. The view is amazing and the planetarium is pretty cool.If you go during the day, you can also hike over to the Hollywood sign from the observatory. It's about 4 miles one way with some elevation changes. (There are shorter hikes to get to the sign if you start out on Beechwood Drive by the Sunset Ranch.)The only downside of the Observatory is parking is extremely limited. If you don't get a spot in their main parking lot, be prepared to hike (often few miles up hill) to the observatory. If you don't want to walk, either count on your good luck or get there about 1/2 hour before the observatory opens. Your best bet may just be to take Uber and have them drop you off and pick up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acb8694
50,A quick trip,My nephew and i went ro vegas in feb. We decided to make a quick trip to vegas. If u want to see all of la go to the observatory great views and close view of the hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mookdiggler
30,Used to be Awesome,"We used to come here all of the time to just relax and walk around the grounds and maybe get lunch. It has gotten so overly popular in the last few years that you can't even park anywhere near the entrance, or even within a reasonable walking distance. What is going on here lately?!?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6to82008
50,Watch the stars true LA stars!,I have enjoyed this spot since I was a child but seeing it through a set of older eyes gives it a different sort of opportunity. If you go up right before sunset you can capture one of the truest scenic spots in Los Angeles. I say get there and take your time looking up into the sky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
40,Interesting place,"I have been in LA many times but this was my first one in this place. I felt my knowledge of this city incomplete without going here. I was surprised for how many people were nearby. Go on a sunny afternoon and you will enjoy the landscape. It is very difficult to find parking, I left the car a mile away. The view of the ""Hollywood Sign"" is good but it is far away and difficult to capture on pictures of you do not have a good camera. The observatory itself is a museum with nice facts about planets, stars, and their behavior. There is a good view of the city, but that they there was some fog on it (smog?)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/536MarcoC
50,A birds eye view of LA,"This is always a place we bring our family or friends who come to visit LA because of its fantastic history. A Rebel Without a Cause was filmed here and not much has changed since then. At night you can see through the giant telescope, which we were fortunate to see Saturn, at a previous visit. Always something interesting going on. The walk outside around the building and the many stops along the way give you a perspective of LA you can't get anywhere else. To visit you will be grateful you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/premierlsg
50,AMAZING!!!@!,If you are visiting Southern California even if you're not in Hollywood visiting Griffith Observatory is a must. It is such a beautiful place perfect view of the Hollywood sign the observatory is amazing. I highly recommend that you visit Griffith Park if you are traveling to Los Angeles or you live in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jean1005
50,"Great, but . . . TRAFFIC!","I love Griffith Observatory, but so does everyone else. If you go, be prepared for major traffic on balmy Summer nights. The view is great, and the observatory is really beautiful. Getting up to the observatory can be a hassle. If you just want a view, try The Hollywood Bowl Overlook, on Mulholland Drive. Definitely not as touristy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJHappyTraveler
40,crowded but beautiful,"Even though we drove up on a Tuesday morning, it was crowded and parking was nuts, so I can;t imagine what it is like on the weekend! But the view from the observatory is gorgeous! Excellent view of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA. The observatory itself is a beautiful building and its free to walk through the museum inside which is nice. I recommend going during the week to avoid some of the crowds, but definitely worth a visit when you visit LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K225MGsarahp
40,Great vantage point,"If you want a great place to take pictures of the Hollywood Sign without having to walk up to the sign, this is the place. You also have a great view of the city day or night... The view is spectacular! Entrance to the observatory museum is free and at night you can also visit the telescope and take a pick at whatever planet the telescope is pointed at that night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/828annmarieg
40,Beautiful structure with great city views at night,"Very crowded. Hard to find parking. Fabulous views of the city at night. Observatory itself is a tremendous structure to see lit at night. Inside, the exhibits were terrific. Would have liked to have come back during the day to see the sun exhibits and Hollywood sign better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254ericah
50,Amazing view of the city,"For who likes astronomy and science is the right place. Furthermore, you can appreciate the fantastic view of the entire city of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matheuscosta90
50,A must see - at a pocket-friendly price!,"Lot's of cool space stuff, of course. Views are amazing. All this at $0 admission (some of the films and planetarium shows are an additional charge) - is why it is mobbed most weekends. Plan on parking down near the Greek Theater and hoof it. Slight incline and some-not-so-well defined sections where you share the road with the (slow-moving) traffic but not bad at all. Maybe it was because I was a kid but I remember thinking the planetarium show was better back in the day. And no more ""Laserium"" for those that remember those shows....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanyp2015
50,Sunset,"The best sunset view of the city of Los AngelesYou can park your car at the bottom ,hike ,and go inside the observatory.when you finish ,stay there for the sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tourhollywood
50,Must See,"The observatory has everything - great views, hiking trails, interesting astrological information and part of La La Land was filmed there. Go see it for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredb780
50,"Nice place to visit and learn, and it is free!","This is an iconic building on the hills above Hollywood. A very nice place to visit and marvel at the wonders of astrology. You can take a self guided tour, but can also buy inexpensive tickets to indoor shows in the planetarium. There are many telescopes there you can use. Also, around the planetarium, there is several good hiking trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltrivia
40,Absolutely fantastic place for everyone,We went there in summer parking was very difficult to find. But after that when we went inside it was very nice. Lot of information for Young kids. My son (7) talked to a staff member about planets and she was very kind and patient to answer all his questions.You can see absolutely every part of LA views are pretty amazing and as a bonus you can also see HOLLYWOOD SIGN (from a distance though). So in all a very good place to visit.Tip: Try to go early in the morning. Parking gets crazy and might have to walk a long distance later in day. Take water with you will definitely need it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rs243
50,The BEST view of the City of Stars~,"My favorite place in LA! The observatory will teach you about science- but the view will teach you about beauty. From Tesla's coil to holding a meteor, I was blown away with the magic of the elements you could experience here. You can find out your weight on the planets- I'm 13lbs on the Moon! And you can get a clear perspective of how the planets orbit the Sun and what that Sun is made of. The Observatory is not just a place to learn, but a place to really grasp what it means to live on this planet- We are an element at the table of cosmic love.~",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polishedblack
40,Great Views of Earth and Space!,"I was not prepared for the extraordinary views of Los Angeles that can be seen from the Griffith Observatory. Really spectacular! If this is your first visit to L.A, you must visit here, if only just for the views of the Hollywood sign, and the entire city. The observatory is a historic building, and quite nostalgic. I bought a ticket to one of the films in the planetarium theatre, ""Centered in the Universe"" which was fascinating, and well presented by a very appealing live host. The exhibits were educational and suitable for all ages. I even had a small snack in the cafeteria which had a gorgeous view! In all, a very happy and well-worth visit. I'm glad my city houses this wonderful place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Posiblonde
50,Classic Los Angeles attraction,I used to go here as a little kid and the renovations they have done are really amazing! The observatory is still awesome and the view is one of a kind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcD9053XX
50,Excellent,"We visited the Griffith Observatory on 3/7, which happened to be the day that the parking lot was closed for construction. Thanks to their web site, it announced the parking situation in advance and recommended parking at the Greek Theatre. At the time when we arrived, the whole parking situation was very well organized. We had no problem to get a space at the Greek Theatre. It took us about 20 minutes to hike uphill, which was not bad at all when it was in the 70s temperature. And the view is TOTALLY worth it! Crystal blue sky, beautiful architecture, Hollywood sign far away... We just loved it! I wish we had more time but we did watch the introductory movie. It was very informative. Overall we loved the visit! Will come back again if we get a chance in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewMomTexas
50,Cool Place,"Went up on a Thursday night and the place was packed!! Parking is an issue there. Once you get in though, very cool place! So much to see and the views of Los Angeles are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmcpht
50,Vacation,Awesome place to visit. The views are stellar. You do not want to miss visiting this observatory. While it is quite busy there is plenty of space to occupy yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lysleandlisa
50,Science with kids,On a Sunday we did not find a parking lot. Once in the observatory it was great. My daughter and granddaughter wanted to stay longer than three hours. Most amazing for me was the Tesla coil on work. I have heard so much of the genius of Tesla and got a picture how the idea of electricity over the air had to fail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691felixv
30,great architecture and views,"great learning experience and shows. However, the parking is terrible and very crowded especially on weekends. There is no admission charge so you get what you pay for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonB585

50,Great way to spend a day,What a wonderful facility to have set in beautiful park with great trails with talks ( at a small cost) though out the day and amazing planetarium and breath taking views over LA and of the Hollywood sign well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cooldays72
50,wonderful visit,came here on a afternoonlittle hard to get toget here early. parking is a messbut clean museum and very insightful on this historyalso there is a cafe with maybe be view of LA!crowded with people from all walks of life,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ttmac21
40,Great view,Totally worth the time to get up there and enjoy the view. Wish I had norr time so I vould walk up to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joakima531
50,Busy but good,Really busy on a nice Sunday evening. Took a while to drive up with an Uber. Once there though the views were stunning and well worth the drive. Great views over the whole of LA- perfect photo spot. The observatory itself is packed full of fascinating facts about space and very interactive. Even better is the fact it's free.The queue to see through the telescope was long and as they close it at 9.30pm prompt we were lucky last to get in after a 40 minute queue. If your not by the line ropes by 9pm give up as you won't get in! They did however have telescopes out on the lawn for people to still get a chance to see the constellations.All in all a great family place to go during the day or in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854DP
30,Great place poorly managed,"This is an architectural gem managed by people who don't care much about you. Right off the bat, get ready to be screamed at by the parking attendants. There's tons of cars trying to drive up the hill and it is never clear what their criteria is to let you drive up to the upper parking lot or block you and force you to park and walk a good 45' up the hill to the Observatory.The observatory is almost worth the trouble; a beautiful building with 360 views of Los Angeles. The Hollywood sign is really close. You can walk into the building or up on the roof and get into the telescope domes. The telescopes are only operating at night for obvious reasons but they let you peek into the domes during the day too. If you bring kids to the roof, be careful with the railings since most of them are low parapet walls with people sitting on them taking selfies even though there's a 20' drop on the other side. There's no personnel/ security on this level.The inside of the main building is kind of nice. There's a perpetual motion pendulum explaining the rotation of the earth and that may be the coolest, simplest exhibit that they have. The central largest dome is the most unique room/experience but it can also be your worst disappointment. You'll pay $7 to get in and that's reasonable since everything else is free. If you haven't been to one of these before, the whole movie/graphics are projected on the interior of the dome and it is pretty impressive. The show/movie is educational but the lady narrating it gets in the way. She teeters between histrionic and melodramatic and it would be better if she would just lay out the facts like a normal lecturer. The graphics are more or less pleasant depending on where you sit. Get ready for a stiff neck if you're on the first 5 rows. Those seats shouldn't even be there. You're too close to the front wall and most of the projections occur either right on top of you or behind you. The projector, sitting in the middle of the room will actually block you if you're next to it like I was. The most upsetting part is that they reserve a good 20 great seats for disabled folks (not a single one of which was taken) and while some people just grab them, others like my group are denied relocation from your cr_ppy spot and the whole place feels like the whole crew can use some training in both house protocols and basic manners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Conchazo
40,It's amazing - if you can get there,"Plan ahead - that's the best advice I can give you. We visited on a Sunday and the traffic was horrible. Once you get inside its worth the time to visit, but get there early, see the observatory and get down the hill to the park. It's insane on a weekend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercurysqueen
30,It was OK,There are some decent exhibits and view overlooking overrated LA. You can take pictures of Hollywood sign. Not worth the trip in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773careyc
40,"Excellent city views, terrible parking!","The good: cool views, awesome planetarium, inexpensive, educational exhibitsThe bad: parking! What a nightmare - took us 1.5 hours to park. Do yourself a favor and park at the bottom as soon as you arrive! There needs to be a bit better signage around the park. We didn't realize we should park down at the bottom until they directed us down once we arrived at the top! And the top is like fighting for parking spaces fast and furious styles. So, bring comfy shoes to trek to the top.All said, definitely a must while here. Pay the extra for the planetarium!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edy02
40,Amazing views just breathtaking,Get there about 40 min before sun down and then you get pictures of both day and night. The planetarium show is actually really good only $7 and they do a very good job.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452jamid
50,Great views and cool science,It was free! Can't say that about many things. The exhibits are intriguing and the crowd was not overwhelming. Definitely worth the time. Great walking trails all around there. Good place to take kids and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebsDoodle
50,"Great views, no parking","As with most things in LA, Griffith Observatory has a great view, but a terrible parking situation. Most of the time, I'll just park alongside the road and walk up the rest of the way if there's no spots available. There's some interesting stuff inside the building as well. It's like a small science museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morganvp
50,Very interesting,"A must visit when in LA. If not for the science then just for the views on a clear day or evening. All the information you ever wanted about space, the research and technology behind what humans know so far. Great for kids too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DutchNZLAUS
50,"Views, food and education",We brought our cousin here - she's a photographer. We couldn't pull her away from shots of the observatory and the views .. good thing she uses digital. We spent so much time on the grounds and view that we didn't have time to go inside. A shame. There are so many wonderful things to see and do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elysekomer
50,Great tour,We liked the observatory very munch. One of the best things to fo in LA.But there should be a bus-shutle not only om weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/02annelise
50,Best views over Los Angeles,The Griffith Observatory offers the views over the city of Los Angeles. And it's free. A must place to visit when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrosenbergh
50,Beautiful place at any season and time of the day!,"View from the top is beautiful at any time of the day! You can enjoy your best picture with Hoolywood sign, not speaking of one with great sunset and sunrise above Los Angeles. Museum inside the building worth a couple hours if you like the space exploration. Green park around the observatory is a great place to explore, but it was raining when we were there , therefore walking steep and slippery roads were impossible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyubat2017
50,Breathtaking views,What a great place! The views across LA are just breathtaking and you can see so much. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieHeath12

40,Must Visit Site,"This is a must visit site in Los Angeles.The views are exceptional and the museum is really worth the extra time.Facilities are also very good, well located and cleanI would take a taxi to the top, unless you get there really early parking can be a problem",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdcs4
40,Good sight,Great views of LA at night and you get to see the moon up and close the line for the big telescope was very slow but good sight at the end,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bridgetrus
50,Suitable for All,"The observatory is located in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California. Here's a few reasons to go there;1. It's a TOURIST ATTRACTION so come on, check it off your list! (There were quite a significant amount of locals too when I went)2. LEARN ABOUT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND - There are plenty of interactive and visual exhibits ranging from solar eclipses, how the moon affects tides, planets, stars, galaxies, how and why the planets rotate, different gravitational pulls in each planet, etc. Thanks to the balance of information and visuals, it is suitable for all ages.3. Plenty of good spots for insta-worthy PICTURES. The height at which the observatory is located gives a good view of LA and the Hollywood sign (find other spots for a closer shot of the Hollywood sign though, it's rather tiny from the observatory grounds). Attached to this review will be some of the cool shots I got (in my opinion at least haha)TIPS:• Know when to go. Griffith Observatory's opening hours are not fixed and some days they may be closed so be sure to check their website out before going. Also, try to avoid busy hours and go on off-peak periods, that way you could enjoy everything without too much of the crowd.• Plan your trip there. There's two ways you could go, either drive/be driven there, or walk up. If you're a hiker/trekker, be sure to check out the routes at Griffith Park as well so you could kill two birds in one stone.• Parking during peak periods is INSANE so be sure to bring your most positive attitude and longest patience.• Bring some snacks and your own water. We all know this; every thing is more expensive in tourist spots - need I say more?• Depending on which SEASON you plan to visit, be sure to be dressed appropriately and bring an umbrella if you need to.• Be sure to explore all parts of the observatory; from the rooftops to the basements or you'd be missing out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michah_V
50,A must on your list of things to see,Great location to see the beautiful views. Unfortunately we went here on a tour and did not have much time to stay. Need at least a couple of hours to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946zoem
50,Beautiful place!,Excellent hike with magnificent scenic views of Los Angeles. I did not realize there was an actual museum inside. It would be nice to come back and visit at night to see the views from the telescope. I highly recommend this hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loquitur14
50,Brilliant!,I queued to see the moon through the giant telescope. We also watched the presentation at the planetarium. It's also great location to appreciate the cityscape and take pictures. You see lots of photographers waiting for the fog to clear to take beautiful pictures of LA! I love this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAROTZAMM
50,This place rocks,What excellent views of the city and the Hollywood sign! Also inside are educational displays that are great for the kids. The outdoor cafe has great views but it is probably better to have a snack at than a full meal. There is also a gift shop on the property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnV541
50,Fun free place,"I was here on a Sunday afternoon - very crowded, but still fun to walk around. Views are amazing. Parking was a little difficult. They have a shuttle, but it was not running this day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbn46
50,Something out of the ordinary,"It was very busy but was something not many tourists seemed to be there, mostly local children which was really nice.

50,Exceptional views of the city,"What an amazing place to see. We won't at night and although we had a long walk probably a mile anyway due to the number of people there, the views were outstanding. Overlooking the city of Los Angeles at night was great. We took photo after photo and still one of my favorite places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyh480
50,Worth visiting,"Among all the places in LA this is one of the most interesting. The view is fantastic! There is a telescope outside and they let you look in it, and it's super cool. But the most exciting thing in the observatory is the Mendeleev table - you can see the actual elements in the boxes. I've never seen anything like this in my life! I wish I they showed it to us during chemistry lessons at school.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinamJ6485QW

40,Best thing in LA.,Its a long walk up. The parking is a story for its own.But when you arrive its worth it. The skyline of LA is amazing. In the other direction you can see the Hollywood sign.There are a small museeum inside the observatory.Do it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelRM86
50,If your a La La Land fan its a good visit and the views at sunset are amazing on a clear day,Love place and free biggest problem is limited parking at top but we found a space after about 20minutes its a lovely drive up and the views even though it wasn't that clear are great nice view of Hollywood sign and great place to take kids or a date romatic wish we could of done planetarium but didn't want to wait in line,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tansboys123
40,Fantastic views,It's worth coming here just for the fantastic views and the photo opportunities. It's a nice walk but just be aware that there are no food/drink outlets and it can get hot. There was also a massive queue for the toilets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobbyAK
40,Nice view over the city.,Parking can be tough and it looks like they will start charging for street parking. Fantastic views of the city and Hollywood sign. Didn't get to go inside-doesn't open until noon on Saturdays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valzebub
40,Good stop off on a tour of LA,This is probably not everyone's cup of tea but it is a science nerd's paradise. Lots of stuff to see and interact with all for free. There are also spectacular views of LA and the best shot of the Hollywood sign without being close up. Worth an hour or so of your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simonkj
50,Everyone must visit the Griffith Observatory!,"This is a must do when visiting Los Angeles! Beautiful building, beautiful grounds, great view, and such an inspiring place for learning about astronomy, science. Plus it's used in the classic LA film, Rebel Without a Cause with James, Dean, Natalie Wood, Dennis Hopper - what more could you want from a place to see in LA?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tuvalutraveler
50,Great Hiking Destination,We Hiked up here and it was well worth it. Starts at Los Feliz Blvd and take any of the trails heading up. Bring water. Events are Free and posted on the website regularly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsBad305
40,"1st time, but won't be our last!",Knowledge is key. We enjoyed the exhibits. Very crowded and it seems that parking fees are about to go in effect shortly. The drive up to the Observatory is a little treacherous.But it was worth it. I look forward to perhaps hiking on some of the trails below.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amy5f
30,Just Okay-Getty is better,"Great place to visit but for better views & more to do, visit the Getty Center or hike the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schar108
50,great view of LA and the Hollywood sign,loved being here and learning about the stars and science things. the food was good in the restaurant and we got to sit looking over at the Hollywood sign. even got to see Leonard Nimoy on film of course but was still excellent and very enjoyable. I would recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jemimapuddleduck_10
50,Extremely Impressive,"Visited twice, once by day to spend time exploring the Observatory and returned late afternoon on another occasion to watch the sunset and admire the view of the city after dark. Both well-worth doing. On both occasions we had to park in the ""additional"" parking area which entailed quite a walk up to the Observatory. Parking everywhere is free at present, though we noticed meters were being installed and cost looked like being $4 p.h.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lavinia4248
50,Must visit when in LA!,I would put the Griffith on the must visit list when in LA - the sweeping views across the city are unrivaled and make a visit just before sunset to see the city lights come alive so worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9157DKsimonc
40,"Interesting, Educational","nice location, good exhibit and content.nice souvenir shop.however,best to visit during weekdays to avoid traffic, and crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/have_faith_BDM
50,loved it,an amazing building and what a view! We visited with our kids aged 2 and 4. They had a great time there was space for them to run and the bigger one loved all the stairs to climb and astronomy stuff inside. we went at sunset and it was a beautiful time to see a bit of LA in day and at night as well as that pretty pink LA sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pet87a
50,The View,I have visited many spots in Los Angelas but this one is special. The view of the city from the Griffith is worth the trip. I was able to see one of the films they have available and it was pretty special. The theater is able to sit over 100 people easily and a new movie is shown every hour. The admission to the movie is reasonable and to go inside the Griffith is free. I went on a day when the moon was the closest to the planet in a long time and it was packed. I recommend going during the weekday if possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmittGonzalez12
50,Must-visit! Great views.,"When visiting my brother who lives in LA, I requested the hike up to the observatory. It is a nice probably 15 minute hike-not too terrible but a little steep. The view was incredible-you could see the whole city below you and the Hollywood sign. Great for photos. Beware depending on when you get there it can be quite busy with other tourists. Doesn't hurt that we saw cute dogs, talked with nice people, and even saw an actress from one of my favorite Netflix shows. Can't wait to come back again soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373baileym
50,Sunset Destination,"Came up on a Friday afternoon to catch the sunset along with many others! Lucked out with a parking space on the road leading up, and ""hiked"" up to the observatory. Although crowded, the atmosphere is friendly and festive and we heard many languages spoken. Immediately went in to purchase tickets for the planetarium show later, then back outside to explore the grounds and viewing areas. The sunset was beautiful and we really enjoyed the show at the planetarium. It's a beautiful theater with very comfy seats and we learned the current theories about the universe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrownGirl2
40,Nice,"It was nice for the views, be warned you should drive there. It's difficult to get Uber's if your relying on wifi. Great hike surrounding the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/202alixb
50,I wish I had my time to explore,You have to come before it gets dark. I wanted to take pics of the Hollywood sign but the lights were out & it was too dark to see it. I did enjoy the Leonard Nimoy event space & watched the video. And the room with all the planets was amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellemK8361AI
50,Soectacular. view!,"Best view of LA and Hollywood sign, and great photo opps. We didn't go to any shows, but the Observatory was beautiful to walk around in. Take Uber for an economical way to get there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurel154943
50,Go at Night!,Be stunned at the view of Los Angeles at night by going to the Observatory and walking around the outside path next to the building. Photos don't do it justice. You have to be there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddD3505IR
40,What a view from there !!,"We went there in evening , amazing view of LA , trail leading there was nice supported by good weather. must visit for family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NitinG75
50,Amazing view,"We were looking forward to visit Griffith Observatory. We were both in the daytime and in the evening - I would really recommend to visit both in the day and in the evening.It was not easy to find a good parking spot, especially in the evening. We would definitely come back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSuny
50,Exploring LA,REALLY AWESOME. If you're in LA you have to visit atleast once. Their gift shop is pretty neat. The shows are also pretty cool and affordable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soulangel244
50,Business with pleasure!,"I joined my daughter on a business trip, we had the opportunity to venture out and see the sites of LA and surrounding areas.Seeing the Observatory and famous Hollywood Sign was on our list.Parking is a bit crazy but it is worth the trip for the amazing view we went during the day so we did not have the opportunity to look at the city at night through the giant telescope!I highly recommend,if you have young children you can picnic or if you are the adventurous type you can hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/778ginal
40,Great overlook to Los Angeles,"We went up to Griffith Park on a Saturday, in honor of the movie Lala land, and it was a tourist mecca. Tons and tons of people were there – tourist locals, people walking their dog, people running. Parking was the problem – the parking lot at the top of the observatory was full so we had to park about a half a mile down the hill and walk up. It took us a long time driving to wind up the hill with all the traffic. The view is stunning and there are exhibits about astronomy in the observatory. There's also a very large telescope that the public can look at free of charge from seven to 9:30 PM in the winter and in the summer observation starts at dusk. The parking is free, the observatory is free, and the view of the Hollywood sign is fabulous. A great way to get a Birdseye view of Hollywood . They do have reasonably priced laser light shows all through the day. We did not do this but it is an activity you can do there. If you can go here not on the weekend it would be better. Also on the Hollywood side there is a lower lot that is often available if you want to walk up the large hill in a wide dirt trail to the observatory. The path incline is somewhat steep at times but the nature filled trail is great. Be cautious of heat in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbiLyn1
50,Great view of Hollywood Sign & cool observatory!,"We only came here so we could view the Hollywood Sign but it was a very beautiful building containing a lot of neat things surrounded by beautiful scenery. We had to park quite a bit away (I think a little over a mile) and we walked all uphill to get there. If we had had more time, we would have hung out and explored more of the observatory but we just didn't have time. The little bit we saw was outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redhead_roaming
50,"Beautiful views, free museum","Great historical and planetary displays. The building is a beautiful piece of history itself. Plenty of movies available with information about the observatory itself, etc. Northern Lights movie sounded great but is only available for two nighttime shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniewoolsey
50,Fabulous,Even if you are not into planetary science then you should go for the view alone. Not much parking at the top but people do move. (I went on a Friday.) People park on the windy road up but they have a bit of a steep climb to the top.I saw two shows in the Planetarium. They were excellent and only $7 each. The Observatory is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaH155
50,A Los Angeles Treasure,"Start with the amazing views of Downtown LA, Hollywood and the surrounding hills. Is there a better view in LA? Maybe not. Then go inside the Observatory and learn more about the stars and planets than you ever thought possible. Great for kids and adults. The shows cost a bit, but the experience both upstairs and and down below are worth the visit. When you're done, maybe hike to the Hollywood sign nearby. An all around wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FriedomTrail
50,L.A. L.A. Land,This is THE place to see Los Angeles from. A real view of L.A. L.A. Land. Join the crowds who arrive before sunset to watch and applaud it when it comes. Only in America would Nature get her deserved round of applause. If you're feeling a touch cynical...don't be. Just join in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/incredigull
40,Interesting by VERY Busy,"The place was packed practically shoulder to shoulder and parking was tough. We had to walk about 1/3 mile from our car up the hill to the observatory. However, the views are stunning and the science museum was interesting. Also great view of the HOLLYWOOD sign and much of LA. I would recommend this place, for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
50,"Wonderful views, and great observatory","This is such an iconic building, and there are fascinating exhibits, and a planetarium. It also sits on the edge of the Hollywood Hills and you can have a wonderful view in 180 degrees of the entire LA basin, from mountains to ocean. Come early to avoid crowds. There is also a 45 minute hike (stay on the path!) from here that goes up to Mount Hollywood -- very hot in summer months!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonymousDragon
40,"Great venue, great view, terrible traffic","We loved this venue, it's packed with interesting exhibits that can really engage a family. It's also provided free! The views over LA and towards the Hollywood sign are superb. The traffic situation is chaos, there was little/no management of the traffic flow even though there were people dotted around who should have been doing that job. Consequently it took us almost an hour to park our car. It would benefit from a managed 1 way loop in order to keep traffic moving while making sure spaces are immediately filled without causing log jam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoLiveYoung
50,star gazing,"Went to Griffith observatory on a Wednesday night. When arrived at around 8:00 p.m. we had to park on the side of the road about a quarter mile from the observatory. There were a lot of people there. Many things to see the first was a pendulum when you enter the building that shows the rotation of the earth divided into forty two sections. It seems the farther you are from the North or South poles the longer the rotation is.Then to the right there are exhibits showing different patterns of rotation with various planets including how the earth rotates around the sun with a shadow that moves with the rotation.There is a movie with a commentator explaining what you are seeing for $7.00 it was worth it.Down stairs there is a room with meteorites and models to scale of the planets. Under each planet there is a weight scale so you can see how much you would weigh on that planet, I like Pluto ( It was built before Pluto lost planet status) There is also a picture of space that is 150'W x 30'H with a very interesting story about Albert Einstein behind it.You can also go around the the outside of the building in the back and see a great view of the L.A. metro area. When we were there they had two telescopes pointed at different stars, not the big telescope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnjoe22
50,"what a great place, go as the sun is going down, what a great views,","you can take trail walks, see other planets, learn about our solar system, just enjoy the atmosphere. You don't want to miss this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weissarnold61
50,Memories of Sal Mineo and Childhood,Took our 8 year grand daughter. A blast from my past to visit. Great view of the Hollywood sign. Exhibits were fascinating. Gift shop was clean and varied. Robert was so kind to our child. He made a huge impression on her. Great to open the mind to the wonders of Astronomy. We need to support the sciences.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bijou554
40,Observatory in LA? Who would have guessed.,"Great park grounds surrounding this observatory lend itself to doing a picnic while taking advantage of the opportunity to learn about the stars. Small as observatories go, and more historical than useful probably today but this is a worth while visit if going to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloften028
50,Another kind of stargazing (actual STARS),"The Griffith is a world class facility. The views from outside of the city (L.A.) and the Hollywood sign are breathtaking. The grounds are beautiful too, as well as the drive up to the observatory. Inside, the observatory is very cool. The presentations in the planetarium are top notch and mesmerizing. The displays are all very educational and entertaining. As if astronomy was not cool enough, this place takes it to another level. This is a must see for all ages in the in the L.A. area! Myself, my wife and my teenage son all love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesterPSU99
40,A landmark with great history,"Having seen the Griffith Observatory in so many films, we just had to go after watching James Dean and Natalie Wood in 'Rebel Without A Cause' (for the umpteenth time).What a great day spent touring the grounds, seeing the show, eyc!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RollMeAway
50,What a treasure to have access to in Los Angeles - And admission is FREE,"I had not been to the Griffith Observatory in many years and I finally had the opportunity to take a friend from Tanzania, Africa there last night. My husband and I also took our grandkids. The parking was a bit of a challenge, but after that...all I can say is ""AWESOME"".I was truly amazed, delighted and SO VERY PROUD that we have such a wonderful learning center in the Los Angeles area. We only had about 3 hours to spend and the time flew by way too quickly. Even though we could have spent the entire 3 hours going through the observatory itself and the many exhibits, we purchased tickets to see two of the special 30 minute shows in a room with a dome ceiling. The seats lay back a bit and projections on the domed ceiling show planets and tell the history of man and his relationship and learning's about the solar system. It was so awesome and I learned so much...much of what I had forgotten from my school days. Both shows were excellent and the cost was reasonable!In the time we spent wandering, we were able to see a room on the bottom floor that shows the planets and the various sizes of each. It is hard to even try and explain in words how wonderful that room is and the many interesting facts and viewing opportunities. Loved it.I end this review with the words...""What are you waiting for!!! GO!!!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trailbiter
50,Overwhelming and so Worth It,"This is our second visit to the city of angeles.So we had time to dive into the less obviouse attarctions. This one is well worth the time and effort.a 20 minutes Uber ride from Hollywood and Vine put you at the top of the city the views (we came at 9pm) are amazing, and the scientific exhibit is engaging and easily draws you in. Take a guided tour to get even more engaged.Just remember - bad reception (at least with our phones) and they close at 10pm - so leave a few minutes early to avoid the traffic, and book your Uber in advance, or take a taxi from the stand (if any available)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsafS82
50,hike up and walk thru this great place,hiked up to the top of the griffiths park and then visited the observatory. its open late and it has lots of great free exhibits and food too. they have night time viewing also .didnt see the light show of the sky as is in LA LA Land as didnt have time but next time will. You can drive up also if you dont want to hike up there. busy but not too busy. small fee to see the light show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel
50,Stars and hikes,"I love the Griffith Observatory for everything from stargazing, special events surrounding our solar system, and for nearby local hiking. It's not fun to visit when it's crowded but if there's ever a meteor shower or a spectacular Full moon, this is the place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissD819
50,Awesome views,"Even if you do not have time to actually spend in the Observatory, make time for the short drive up the mountain if nothing more than for the view. It is well worth the time. Great views of the hills, downtown, the Hollywood sign and so on. You can get some great photos from up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Euroboyz
50,Incredible View,"It is a great place to go with the family. the view is incredible and you can do a little walking over the place. there is a little museum, very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicentejosel2017
40,Stunning!,Arrived at around 4 and got to see the stunning sunset view from the site! It's free entry but you need to pay extra if you want to join some sessions like Planetarium. This is a worth visiting attraction for every first-time visitor!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkiraC56
50,Make time to visit - A must see,"Great views of Los Angeles from the observatory and you can see and walk to the Hollywood sign. Plenty of walks around Griffith Park as well. The Planetarium is great value for money (USD$7.50) and the show was excellent. Plenty of exhibits to see in the observatory. Come during a week day, as weekends are very busy. At present it is free parking, but very hard to find a space. Best way to get there is by Uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodman100
50,Interesting and informative,"A must-see place if you're a resident or a visitor and even more entertaining since the remodel. To me, the highlite was being able take a close-up look at Saturn's rings",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
50,Must visit if you are in LA,"Beautiful view of the city, Hollywood sign. Better take a city tour to visit this place. The one we took had his office right in front of Dolby Theatre where Oscar Ceremony was just held.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam_Mohsin

40,touring Los Angeles is not complete without a visit,"Every time friends or family visit from out of town and want to do the Los Angeles tour, this is a MUST on the list. You can spend a day or a few hours. If your into outdoors, than definitely some great hiking trails to get the heart rate going ending with a fabulous view of LA and the Hollywood sign as a treat. Go at Night and enjoy the city lights... Your guests will thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/504birens
50,Wow! Just wow!,"This started out as a cute thing for our son and DIL to do with us after having seen La La Land the night before. We were not prepared for how breathtaking the presentation of the sky show would be. Nor that the views from the roof would take your breath away. Nor that the sunset from that same roof would be as special as it was. There is something about the excitement people in a large group feel over a daily occurrence that is just so infective. Highly recommend this for families, dates. Anyone. There was a group of young teens all with matching tiaras celebrating a birthday while we were there it is that special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaitaliaupstateNY
40,Breathtaking views of Hollywood,This was a last minute decision and we just were driving around and decided to visit. Wonderfully clean environment. There are some hiking paths. Places to have your lunch eg. a picnic. Great place to bring children as well. We visited on a beautiful sunny day but a visit at night would be fabulous to look at the planets as they have a huge telescope . Peaceful and interesting views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdngeese
50,Gotta go if only for the view,The view from the observatory is great and there is a lot of hiking throughout. You can see the entire city of Los Angeles all the way down to the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buzzaldren
40,"Bucket List item, Check.","So this is one of those things that you read about and say, ok, if I am ever in LA... So check. Really easy transport from Vermont/Sunset Metro station. Wonderful views of the city and Hollywood sign, beautiful sunset. Just a pity there were so many tourists, lol!!! Did not get a chance to see any of the shows, but had a wonderful meal at the cafe at the end of the universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bajan246
50,Interesting exhibits – Spectacular views!,"Perched atop Mt. Hollywood in Griffith Park, the Griffith Observatory is an iconic landmark as well as an interesting observatory offering spectacular views overlooking Los Angeles (also a great view of the Hollywood sign if you have an interest in that), and contains exhibits such as the Hall of the Sky and Hall of the Eye, a Foucault pendulum, a theater & other assorted exhibits. Make sure that you go after dark for the telescopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
40,Awesome hike and spectacular views of LA,Park at the playground in Griffith park and hike up to the top for unbelievable views all the way to the pacific. Probably two miles round trip; wear shoes you can get dirty as it is a natural trail and not paved. Lots of photo opportunities from views to the architecture of the observatory itself. Take $99.00 and buy yourself a sweet NASA set of Orange coveralls (unless this reminds you of prison wear then you may want to skip it),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisfromRoanokeVA

30,Nice views!,"Great views, nice hike to the observatory, however there are long queues of cars to get up the hill and therefore parking is at least a 30 minute hike away from the observatory. Really nice when you're at the top though. There are also people proving free views their telescopes for educational purposes and you can see the Moon and a few planets very clearly. It's also a good view of the city as a whole and you get to see the Hollywood sign from a nice angle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Preeya_N
50,Beautiful Views,"The views from the observatory grounds are phenomenal. Inside the observatory are many interesting exhibits which are suitable for all ages. Parking is limited and since the observatory is at the top of Griffith Park, plan in a hike uphill .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanb514
40,"Excellent view point, see the hollywood sign",The view point which shows you the entire city to the ocean. Visit the promenade at back of the observatory. The best location to spot the Hollywood sign.Free parking but difficult to get a spot immediately. Prepare to park and talk a little uphill walk. Not strenuously but enjoyable experience. Better off on a sunny day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanAsh
50,Beautiful views,A must if you go to the City of Angels . Even on a cold rainy night the views were spectacular and the observatory is a great place for the beginner star gazer as well as the well seasoned astronomer. Be prepared to walk a distance up semi steep hills. Leave your stilettos at home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YOropeza53
50,Starting point of visiting LA,"Nestled in the Hollywood hills this is a great place for all the family, and all for free, from parking to the tour and views.First, drive up all to the top. There's a big parking, often full but you'll find a space soon as many people come and go.The views of LA are best, and from here you can see how big it is.The tour is very interesting and lot to learn about but prepare for some queuing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1714D
50,An Interesting Experience,"It's a challenge to get here, but this just one of LA's attractions that is worth a visit. The exhibit's, lectures (live story-teller, comfy seats in a large domed room) are quite amazing. Quite breathtaking views over LA and a fabulous view of the Hollywood sign! Note that there is a shuttle bus between the observatory and Sunset Blvd. Try parking near the shuttle route because the roads and car parks at the Observatory are jammed packed. Shuttle takes about 10 minutes. Check the LADOT Transit website for 'Observatory Shuttle' for further info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyPF

40,Great views,"We parked at the base and walked up on a busy day. There is a good lookout location on the way up for photos. It was a 15 min walk. Steep, but not unbearable. I'm a 47 out of shape mom of three and I made it with no problems. Very crowded on the Thursday night when we went. They had the inside closed when we got there due to being over occupied. After about 20 min of taking photos outside, we were able to get inside. Lots of attractions to see inside. We did not give it enough time. You can easily spend a couple hours inside looking at exhibits. Bathrooms on every floor. Can't wait to go back and see more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/croppingfool

40,Great Views,"The line to get up to Griffith Observatory was CRAZY long. It was Grammy Sunday and a beautiful day, so I can see why people were out. We were on our A Day in LA Tour and it took a really long time to get to the top, but once we were there, the views were incredible. Great view of the Hollywood sign. It was fun to see downtown LA from the top. We explored a bit, but everything I wanted to see with the telescopes, doesn't open until dark. It's an interesting place. I'd definitely like to go back in the evening sometime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEE1225
50,Fantastic place to take anyone,"The entire observatory was very interesting. So much to learn about space. This is a unique hands-on environment. Parking is tight $ you'll want to grab a spot as soon as you can to avoid circling pointlessly. It is a bit of a trek from parking, but well worth the walk. Highly recommend visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathie1010
50,Amazing view,"The Griffith observatory is a tiny museum that shows a little bit of the astrology basic concepts.It's a beautiful building, shown in some films. It has an amazing view and people like to go up there to see the sun set.It's a relax, romantic and also family place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriscillaMeritello
50,Great visit,We visited Presidents weekend and the traffic was high. Well worth the wait. Views are stunning and inside observatory is informative,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J2321AUheatherw
50,Panorama of LA,"A view of LA you won't forget. We just went for the views, and then hiked up the mountain for better views. Even on a cloudy day this is a fun, worthwhile outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryh372
50,Very pretty and prominently shown in La La Land,"Nice spot, good views, some folks bring portable telescopes that you can use. Was able to look through one and see Mars even though it was daylight. Can be windy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ps92
40,"If expecting an Uber pick up after your visit, beware they might not be allowed up!","First, the frustrating, upsetting experience. As a visiter from Canada on Sunday, January 29th, I was very disappointed with Griffith Observatory’s handling of public transit. We were ready to leave at 7:30 pm but it took almost 2 hours to actually leave. Although staff assured me Uber was allowed through to pick-up people, staff on the road below kept refusing them through. Even after staff and a park ranger radio’d telling them to do so. Three Uber calls and almost 2 hours later we were finally able to leave. By bus. With no idea where it was taking us. The driver kindly dropped us off outside a restaurant so we could call for an Uber from there. I can certainly understand closing the parking lot when it’s full, but Taxi’s and Uber’s picking up passengers should be allowed through like the buses.We arrived (by Uber) at the trail end of sunset. Crazy long line to get in! Very packed inside. Breathtaking views however. Worth the wait up the hill. I read about the telescope available at 7 PM and made sure we were on the roof early to line up. The line was long and snaking around the roof by 7. We got to see the Orion Nebula. Pretty cool but honestly I was more interested in the view outside.I wanted to come back again for daytime views as well as walking on trails, but it just never worked out. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so busy in the daytime, or even an evening when the telescope is not available to the public.Don’t count on the cafetria to have food. Their menu sounds good and as we were coming straight from the Staples Center, we planned to tasty sounding sandwichs there. Everything was gone. Only hot dogs were left.Rated very good only for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib981
50,Amazing views of LA and educational museum!,"The Griffith Observatory is a steep drive to the top but so worth it. There are scenic views of LA and a free, education museum. There is the chance to look at the sun through a telescope! I really enjoyed reading all about the planets and wish we had been able to stay for the evening star gazing event. I will return next time I'm in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnrunion
50,wonderful views,Was quite a walk up the hill. park in the car park on the way up as the queue is massive. We went just before dark so we could see the city lit up as well. Really was worth the wait in the car and the steep walk.You can see for miles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ju159
50,"Nice stop, but avoid crowds","Great views, a nice museum featuring astronomy, great architecture, and oh yeah, its all free. Plus there are hundreds of hikes in the park nearby. Exhibits are old school, but good and informative if you are interested in science or astronomy. Good views of LA and the Hollywood sign. The problem is the crowds. Lots of people on weekends. Limited parking means potentially a steep 1/2 mile hike to the observatory, which is not too bad, but some might want to check out the shuttle. There is a planetarium show for a fee. Its worth a visit, I have lived here almost 15 years and this is my first time to visit. Will come next time visitors are in town, on a weekday or maybe the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hitcher84
40,Educational and fun family time,This was a very popular attraction the day we went so we had to hike up the mountain from the golf course to reach the Griffith center. We enjoyed the exercise and the spectacular panoramic views of LA. The center itself was educational and made our kids budding astronomers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benhassan
30,Go for the hikes!,"The observatory was crowded. Exhibits we were well done but rather basic, stuff that an elementary or middle school kid might learn. The views of the city and surrounding area are stunning. We hiked to the top of Mt Hollywood, and to the top of Mt Lee (behind and above the HOLLYWOOD sign). If you are in moderate shape, spend tthe time and explore their well groomed trails. We could see mountains that are literally 100 miles away. Im sure the view of the city at night from the observatory would be excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haroldl29
50,Best view in town,"We hiked up to the Hollywood sign from the Hollyridge trail and then over and back to the Observatory. A great and not too strenuous hike with awesome views all around of the canyons and the LA City skyline. It was a Sunday afternoon and a bit crowded, so we didn't get to see the obesrvatory itself, but can't beat the view all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captkess59
50,Griffith Visit,"I visited here for the first time last week! It was really cool to see the skyline of L. A. at night time. However, the place was absolutely packed. We did get to see one of the dome shows which was pretty neat and a fair price too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393katrinas
50,I didn't want to leave,"We went up there to catch the sunset but missed it because of traffic. Haha! LA traffic! BUT, it was still an awesome visit. The view was breathtaking pretty much in all directions. Next time I'm in LA I'll make sure I'm at Griffith in time for the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f0bi0
50,Stunning! I love it!,"Griffith Observatory is absolutely one of my favorite spots in LA. It's romantic, it offers stunning views of the city especially at sunset and late evening. It can be really crowded to reach the observatory on top of the hill, so be sure to arrive on time not to miss the dusk. Go and take a look inside the observatory: it's free and fun! And check the Telescope, the subject in view changes every week I guess.It's a truly magical place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francyfre
50,Awesome views of LA,"We went on a Sunday night and the place was jam packed. Parking was a nightmare. We ended up parking a little down the hill and walking up. Once there, the views are spectacular. The Hollywood sign would be great to see if you went during the day. We would have liked to take in what the planetarium had to offer, but it was so busy, it wasn't worth fighting the crowds. If we go again, we'd try a weekday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ipassgas
50,Best view of the city.,You need to get there early for parking at the top because it goes fast. Otherwise you walk up to the top. The view is fantastic as you can see four sides of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BitterBob
50,"Beautiful views, great museum","Hiked up from Griffith Park, the walk was steep but scenic. The grounds of the Observatory are well maintained. The exhibits were very interesting and educational (without being boring). Lots of visual exhibits and I could have spent more time wandering around. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egd07
40,Park at lot towards bottom and hike up,"This was our first visit to Griffith Park. We wanted to see the observatory and the views from the top. It was an overcast cold weekend but it was still very, very busy in the afternoon. We attempted to get parking but the observatory lot was full and there was nothing available on the road. However, we stopped in the lot well below the observatory and asked someone if we could walk up. I’m so glad we did. Many people were walking up. The path can get a little steep but it’s less than a mile to the top. Well worth the effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianew166
30,Great Saturday night with kids,"The show Centered in the Universe was a big hit with viewers under 10 as well as the adults. Comfortable seats, quick snack at the cafe and lots of educational activities. Student discount available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879maryannm
20,Might be a nice view,"But parking sucks. Huge pain in the parking lot! Not impressed with the attitude of some drivers as well sitting there, blocking traffic to wait until people leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/158jlw
50,All free,"You can take some good pictures here. They have good places to take pictures outside, plus they have a mini-museum inside. We were here for at least an hour walking around, and we didn't even do the walking trail, which would have added more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckandrews713
50,Stunning views,Probably the most interesting thing about the Observatory is the incredible panoramic view of Los Angeles. The only drawback is the parking challenge - there isn't enough for the visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb7091954
40,Great way to see the Los Angeles area,The drive up has a lot of twists and turns. I still found it enjoyable though I get car sick. There is limited parking at the top I wouldn't want to arrive on a weekend. If I had more time in the area I would definitely do some hiking. It would be a great workout all up hill! The observatory was closed until noon the day I visited. This was a disappointment but nevertheless I enjoyed the views around the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelslynne
50,"Fabulous view and wonderful planetarium,","A must see in Los Angeles. The architecture and view is extraordinary. Check out the amazing show in the planetarium with the reclining seats.. The site was featured in the 1950s classic ""Rebel Without a Cause"" with James Dean, so check out that film before you go....there is a bust of Dean on the grounds. Wonderful exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MesBeauxVoyages
50,Nice view of the Hollywood sign!,"The Griffith Observatory is one of the staples of the area, and overall I had a wonderful experience. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6272PKmatthewd
40,Wonderful outing near city,"My travel companion wanted to see the Hollywood sign and have a better view out over LA, so we drove up the steep, winding road above Hollywood to the Griffith Observatory. It was a sunny Saturday, so the road and parking were extremely crowded. The views and hiking trails are wonderful. The facility with its decks and view points is wonderful. It was so crowded that we did not get to see a show, but the exhibits very worthwhile. We loved the hiking trails, and both city views and the much closer view of the Hollywood sign higher up and a little to the west. Next time I would want another sunny, clear day, see a show and go on a week day when it would be much less crowded and parking would be more available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulAK2011
50,One of the Best LA Running Areas,"As a tourist stop, Griffith is as expected. Busses, lots of tourists snapping pics, etc. The Observatory and area around it offer some of the best views of the city and Hollywood sign if you're looking for that.The entire Griffith Park area around the Observatory is a fantastic running area within the city limits. Running up to Mt. Hollywood and all the various trails around it also offer great views with some awesome running. You'll encounter the volume of tourists mainly around the Observatory. Once you hit the trails, it's very easy to get a good run in without having to deal with the crowds that are trying to find a parking spot near the Observatory. Park further down the hill or even at the Greek Theatre and start your uphill climbs there.Late afternoon, evening and even night runs on the trails are well worth dealing with the crowds around the Observatory. You may even see a few coyotes during the evening/night runs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChadS303
50,Very interesting,"Was not expecting to enjoy as much as I did.Thought it was mostly about the views, but all the exibits made me enjoy the visit very much. Will come back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eiji0088
50,Wonderful views!,"We went at about 11:00 am and the lot was full, we had to talk our way past the traffic control. It was very interesting, and the views were exceptional. Unfortunately, very crowded and parking is inadequate. If you go,go early, and tell traffic control you have a handicapped elderly person in your car--they will let you through. I agree, watch Rebel Without a Cause and La La Land before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632JeanC
50,Great hiking,The shows and the free displays are very educational and the view of Los Angeles is awesome! It's a great place to get pics of the Hollywood Sign. Take time to read about the expansion below the observatory. It's quite impressive! People who go there are very friendly and social so enjoy it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zooksplace
40,Great Views,"My partner and I went here to view download LA at night. We went on a Sunday night so it was pretty crowded but we fought for a parking spot, lucked out, and saw a really pretty view of download LA. We started driving up the mountain around 8pm, parked at 9pm, walked up, saw the view, and left by 10pm. It really was beautiful! Worth the drive and the crowd. It's probably better to go there during a week day :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/decljust
50,The most under-rated atraction in Los Angeles,"This place is fantastic. The views, landscape and history of this place are amazing. With daytime views and night time stellar exhibits, what more can you ask for. Its also settled next to the famous Hollywood sign up high in the hills. Because of the altitude the weather tends to be cooler but it still gets hot in the summer. I think its a must see for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellO6742OP
50,Spectacular Views,"Great views of the LA area beneath you, and the famous Hollywood sign behind you. Inside, very informative exhibits on various astronomy topics, should be great learning for school children. There is a large telescope you can look at, and at certain times is open for visitors. Same with the large planetarium for learning about the night sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1024BFdons
50,natural oasis in city of concrete,It's a beautiful natural scenic place which offers a lot in terms of nature. Greenery with lots of trees and the clear Hollywood sign showing at the far end looks really beautiful. One can enjoy cool breeze and do some hiking here..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lipip2018

50,Stunning Views and Beautiful Afternoon,We had a photo shoot at this great location which was one of the first times attending the observatory. I believe this is one of the BEST places to visit while in Los Angeles. There is a historic and old hollywood feel to the attraction and impeccable views. A MUST see in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerikd
50,Beautiful day for a walk,"My wife and I took an Uber to sunset ranch. We hiked from there to the Hollywood sign and then on over to the observatory. It's about 3 miles, but what a beautiful way to spend a morning. The observatory was really busy for a Tuesday, but had no issues getting through the crowd. As long as you give yourself plenty of time I would recommend doing the walk over through Griffith Park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mallard9
50,Excellent observatory,"This is simply one of the most iconic and best places to visit if you are in the Los Angeles area. Many movies have been shot here over the years… everything from Rebel Without a Cause to The Terminator to Yes Man. The Observatory itself is superb… Fascinating exhibits, many interactive exhibits, great shows, and of course the superb telescope. A wonderful experience is nigh on guaranteed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
50,Skip the traffic -hike to the top and LYFT down!,"The worst thing about it is the long line of traffic getting there. It's a shame not to hike up the beautiful trails. Once you're there, call a LYFT, and they'll meet you. Really, this is the best way to do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X53QSsimonm
50,"Watch ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and then Visit!","I've lived in LA for 20 years but had never visited. I had a friend visiting from France and we watched ""Rebel"" and then went to Griffith and it was doubly cool because not only is Griffith really great on its own but we were able to point out the places where ""Rebel"" was filmed. PLUS Griffith has great views. We saw one of the films in the planetarium (very reasonable price and definitely worth it). Very nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianamercer

40,great view,The observatory is very scenic and has a great elevated view of the city. It however was a total zoo when I visited and was crammed with people and kids. This did not completely ruin the experience but if I were to ever go back I'd want to go when there were fewer people there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriandN1379ZP

They have a 5th grade field trip that is free and has a full 3 hour guided tour through all the displays, a live show on science, and a planetarium show that is always a highlight. It is a great place to go and hang out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesQ9892TJ
50,Griffith Observatory at night,What a fantastic way to spend an evening. They had telescopes out on the front grass. Lines to look through them but so worth it. The view of Los Angeles and the hike up the road to get there was a nice change from the hustle and bustle below.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorip554

50,"Must Visit, great views and a delight for anyone interested in astronomy.","The Griffith Observatory is a must visit for anyone visiting LA. The observatory by itself is a majestic structure and offers great views of LA and also the iconic Hollywood sign. There is a certain sense of tranquility and calm here, which cannot be experienced in the otherwise chaotic LA and Hollywod.The observatory also offers a lot of information about astronomy and will be a great place for kids to learn and arouse their interest in the subject.There is also a small café available next to the observatory and ample parking too is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shibinbalan
50,Worth checking out,"Although, parking is sometimes a battle, the Griffith Observatory is well worth the trip. You'll probably have to walk a ways to get there, but the view of LA is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruiserinc
50,View of Heaven,"Whether you are looking in the sky or the views of the City of Angels, this is a must visit for locals and visitors. Unless you decide to do the Plantarium (which I highly recommend), the experience is absolutely free. I love the new parts too. Seeing the sun inrelative size to each of the planets is eye opening and a little spirtual. And keep your eyes open for all the sky viewing tools. Not all of them are as obvious as the solar and lunar scopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandCRTravelers
40,Straight out of the movies!!! Must see while in LA,"First of all, we originally tried to come to Griffith's Park/Observatory on a Sunday, but after seeing the super long line of cars trying to get in, we turned back and returned a few days later during the week.This was a great decision as although there were people there, their weren't many. The museum is small, but the exhibits are very good. You must stop by the planetarium show as it is informative and has some great effects. You will remember this place from countless movies and around the Observatory you will have amazing views of LA and of the Hollywood sign.Before leaving, be sure to take one of the many trails surrounding the Observatory to enjoy even great views. I found the best trails to be behind the Observatory, where you take about a 1.5 mile hike up a mountain, at the top, you will get 360 degree view of LA and the surrounding suburbs...breathtaking!!! So when in LA, you have to stop by this amazing location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swaggger007
50,Amazing place to start a scenic hilly run or hike,"Views and planetarium show are fantastic. I brought some hiking/running clothes too, because there all kinds of (hilly) scenic trails. I spent a whole afternoon there. I rode the subway to get as close as I could, which left me with a two-and-a-half mile walk to get there the hard way (which I wanted). But it wasn't as tough of a climb as I thought it would be. Once you get into the park by the Greek Theater, it's not much further.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shancoun

All my friends who live here are all going back to see what new and revisiting their old favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyColvin
40,Griffith Observatory visit.,"I liked the drive up the hill to the Observatory. A nice winding road with beautiful trees and some pretty views. It looked like there was some spots to pull over and hike on some trails, but I didn't have time for that. Once you get near the Observatory the road becomes clogged with parked cars everywhere. If you continue up the hill there is parking on site, but many people park on the road.You can walk around outside or check out some basic displays inside for free, but the show was $7 for an adult. Well worth it. I enjoyed the roughly 30 minute presentation quite a bit.Back outside after the show I walked around the promenade deck and took in some spectacular views of LA.Gift shop was open and had some cool items.The Griffith Observatory is definitely worth checking out if you're in the Hollywood area. You can do the whole thing in 2-3 hours no problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176dougg

50,"Beautiful, especially at sunset","Of course you want to peer through the telescopes at night, but you might want to arrive at sunset to see a great view of the city as well as the Hollywood sign. The museum is definitely worth a look. The planetarium shows are visually attractive but not particularly scientifically stimulating. You will recognize the observatory from many movies, most recently LA LA Land. It really is a classic setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13wendyv
40,One of the most spectacular views of LA on a clear day.,"While I may have just luckily picked one of the clearest day to visit the Observatory, this was shortly after the rains has stopped. The view is spectacular and awe inspiring. At that moment I wondered what it was like for the first settlers who probably then discovers the islands offshore.The second part is staying until dark and visiting the Planetarium and exhibits in the observatory. However, even though the city lights do not make this optimal for star gazing, the view of the city at night do hold its own value and spectacular view as well. We did the ""Light of the Valkyries"", which we found fascinating and enlightening as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinc44
50,Griffith Observatory,"This is a great place to visit. It is fun to visit the observatory, itself, and the view of Los Angeles. I have been there many times, and whenever I have guests, and visitors, I take them there, and they love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khosrows740
40,A nice way to spend the afternoon.,The wife and I decided to take a drive up to the Griffith Park Observatory. Being Southern California natives the drive was not too bad. Neither of us had been to the observatory in decades. We explored the whole observatory and we were impressed with the planetarium show. Very cool experience!!! We saw one of the giant telescopes which was special because we both have never seen one of them before. We had a nice lunch in the cafeteria overlooking the Los Angeles basin. This trip was a day well spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingjohn1230
30,some interesting exhibits,some interesting exhibits but not the planetarium in SF.you're able to get through pretty quickly. I don't know how interested children are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ritak460
50,The secret is behind the parking lot,"Not only is the Griffith Observatory fascinating because of exhibits, the planetarium and the building itself. Also, if you go to the far end of the parking lot, and you'll find the beginning of a trail that will go up to the top of Mount Hollywood. Be ready for a long gentle hike, and for unprecedented views, and a charming people to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR-LosAngeles
50,"Go now, learn something","Took my 5 year old to visit recently. Took metrolink to Union station, metro to the park,and a free shuttle to the Observatory. This is a jewel, something to be really proud of. Well run, educational and fun for kids and adults. Cafe is not bad. Definitely should be on the list for everyone, visitor or resident.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgershenson
50,A must!,"I came here because you can see the Hollywood sign from here, but ended up surprised by the beautiful views and the interesting things that are inside! We went on a Sunday at 11 am, there was a long line to get into the parking, but it didn't tale too long to find a spot. The admission and parking are free. I don't think I'd go back a second time, but I believe it's a must in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariagovea18
50,"Great stop, horrible parking","The observatory is the perfect place to stretch both your physical and mental muscles. This area is easily the best place in LA to get in a 6 mile hike and learn about astronomical concepts such a s CMEs, The Main Sequence, and so much more. Downside, Griffith is insanely busy. Parking was impossible at times. I'm not certain what could be done different. If you are up for a good hike, you certainly do not need to park at the top. Even visiting at sunrise and sunset creates traffic problems, as these are peak telescope times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461nickr
10,Shocked by the reviews here.,"Yes it's free. Yes it's beautiful. But, there are so many people... How could this possibly be enjoyed by anyone?There comes a time when things are so good that a fee should be charged just to thin out the mob. Parking required driving up the hill in a long line before being detoured down the other side. Determined the 45 min. walk back up would be too much. Got parking.. After an hour long adventure.Then... Had to deal with the mob inside. Line ups for the bathroom; line ups for the tickets to get into the line up for the planetarium show (which gets performance points but loses on substance points) to get sent outside and stand in a long narrow line up to just get around the building. Seriously?!? Cursed by its own success? I won't be back. Not am enjoyable experience.Start charging some money already.. I would have gladly paid parking and admission for some infrastructure to not have to waste my time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/481shaund
50,Family vacation,Absolutely beautiful place. Got there in the evening and had a quick tour inside.A must if you love star gazing or are a La La Land fan (we were there just few days before the movie opened without knowing it was going to be featured),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jlazocue
50,It worths a visit! Awesome!,"We mostly wanted to visit it for its views over LA, as we had seen it on ""La La Land"" the movie. But we fell in love with the building and everything exposed there. It is free! And very interesting. One of our favorite things in LA.**Beware!too crowded during sunset time and weekends. By night you will NOT see the Hollywood letters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripitit

50,Well worth the visit,We went thinking we would be there for an hour and stayed the whole day there is so much to see including some amazing planetarium shows which are a must but check times first as they book out. It was too cloudy to use the large telescope but they set up a smaller one on the lawn which was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K29EKjessicak
50,It made a geek out of me - loved it,This was part of a tour - i likely wouldn't have picked it out myself but i really loved it! I'd say a must do visit while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanKerr
30,Go early - limited parking!,"The observatory itself was a bit disappointment - but the view from the grounds was good. I recommend to go early, because parking is really limited and if you come late you need to walk long way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
40,"Nice Place, Fantastic Views at night","Great drive to get there, really easy to find. We went there at night to take photos, the views are amazing. You can really capture all of the LA skyline. Definitely a must for budding photographers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkSanj7
50,Great place to spend an hour or a day!,"We started to hike up but it was much more intense then we expected so we grabbed an uber - finding out later that there is a bus that goes to the top for only $0.50! There was a star party going on so the Uber could only get part of the way up before traffic cops made the car turn around, so we still ended up hiking up the last bit. The hiking trails look really good, but there is a serious incline to climb so beware if you are not in great shape. The observatory itself is a beautiful building with some great exhibits & an amazing mural painted inside. We did not get a chance to see any of the shows but they looked interesting. Be sure to stick around & see the Tesla coil turned on - so cool! There are so many beautiful views from the top of the observatory. I will definitely go back when I have more time to look & play & watch some of the shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shellco
50,Awesome,Really great place. So much interesting information. I had one child who had enough after 30minutes and one that could have stayed for 2 hours and read everything. Lots of great space and science information. Really nice building. Great views. Also a really cute cafe half way down the windy road which has delicious pumpkin spice latte at Christmas time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleS310
30,So much to see...now if it only worked,"Griffith Observatory offers a magnificent view of the megatropolis-suburb that is LA, and a cute view of the Hollywood sign.There is a lot of interesting exhibits inside including a Tesla Coil, sadly pressing the buttons on these exhibits will more than half the time amount to nothing, as they have either been switched off or are broken. Worth the visit for the view but it is a shame about the things you could touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LikeBear
50,Really great place,"I had one full day in LA on a recent trip and decided to venture up to the Griffith Observatory. The whole experience was great - first I hiked up to get a better view of the Hollywood sign, then spent a couple of hours looking around the observatory which was lots of fun. After watching the sun set over glittering LA, I watched a show at the observatory Planetarium and wish I'd had more time to see the other shows as well. Would highly recommend this attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliew776

50,On the top of LA,"It is one of the must-visit places in L.A. The view over the city is inredible and also great spot to see Hollywood sign. We reach it by bus to Los felices village and then walking maybe 40min. Bad luck, the observatory was closed this day, but anyway we enjoyed the view and is totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsvetle
50,Stunning Views,Not much here but an amazing view of the Hollywood Sign! When we went it was pretty empty so we didn't have to stay long and got great pictures from the get go! A bit hard to get to but worth it in the end!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farzizzz

50,What a view!,"The view from the Griffith observatory is absolutely magnificent. You can see for miles and it looks as though Los Angeles never ends! From Downtown to the Hollywood sign, to see planes circling, landing and taking off, take your time to see it all. The night view is even more amazing. There is, however, limited parking and the park closes at 10pm. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jelette
40,Great multiple views,"We visited this observatory around 10am on weekend. The observatory parking was already full and we had to walk a mile to reach oberservatory. It's observatory is a good learning experience about how seasons, day night , eclipse etc happen. There is a tesla coil session also around 11.20am. There is a planitorium inside observatory to enjoy universe. One can get great views from observatory roof and also from the park outside observatory. One can get to see LA high buildings and layout, Hollywood sign and snow cladded mountains. It's a great place to do trekking. We enjoyed it there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij

50,Epic views of LA...,"Over the course of 2 days, we travelled to the Griffith Observatory twice, once in the evening and once during the day. The drive up through the hills is absolutely incredible. Parking is availabe on the hills or if you're lucky enough reach the summit in your vehicle. Either way, the views of LA once at the G.O is breath taking...during the day you can see for miles...LA seems to stretch forever. During the evening when the lights of LA brighten the night sky, LA appears even more beauitful. Very peaceful. Either time of day, this place is incredible. Most defo wortha visit & its free. I apologise there isnt much info regarding whats inside the G.O but just take the timeoyt and go for the views. You won be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HVTamber
40,Good spot to be a student and a tourist,"Visited on a Thursday afternoon with 13 teenage students and 3 adults. A good spot to be both a student and a tourist. Favorites included the planetarium show, looking through telescope at the moon, and the city views. We thought it was a good value to eat at the cafe' and watch as the city lit up. The food was OK, but the view is wonderful. Parking was busy, but",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MHT76
50,Nice views,Got there right before sunset. So was able to see city by day and night. However the telescope doesn't open until 7.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zevh
50,A Must See!,"Really amazing place and you don't need to be a science nerd to enjoy it. Wonderful explanations off of astronomy, tides, eclipses, telescopes, etc. Not suitable for very small kids (less than 7) but for everyone else it's wonderful. The views over LA are also spectacular. I had been to LA many times before but never to here. It's referenced in the Hangover and apparently every kid in LA goes here on a school trip at some stage.Parking near the top is a bit in-American (not enough car spaces) so if you're fit and healthy, park near the Greek theatre and plan for a hike. (Can't do this with small kids as it would be too far and to be honest, unless you're quite fit, people over 50 might struggle.) Parking wasn't as bad as I had feared and I only had a half mile walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomnU92MQ
50,A must visit LA landmark,"Griffith Observatory is a well known domed white building located in Griffith park and to me was in the first place known as the location of a famous James Dean classic Rebel without a Cause (and a Paula Abdul 90s video😉) who it pays a respect to with a bust placed on the right, by the fence offering the amazing views of the city below and the Hollywood sign in the distance.It is a must visit location for breath-taking views of Los Angeles, interesting exibition of Tesla coil, Foucault pendulum and presentations on the history and development of astronomy. Our kids (11 and 8) were really interested and didn't want to leave until they explored every nook of its hands-on exibits. The access to telescopes is free but we missed the sun/star gazing opportunity because we visited on a very cloudy/rainy day...Also, if you have time and the weather permits, take a strall around the trails and even have a picnic in Griffith park.The admission and the parking are free (a welcome change to most other museums...)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18milicak
50,Great place,"We went up to see the view and ended up doing a long hike. The views were spectacular. It was a clear, sunshine filled day. The place was packed with cars. We took uber and had no trouble. There was plenty of families and dogs enjoying the trails. There is a food court at the observatory and bathrooms. They have a planetarium and lots to see and do. I highly recommend for hiking, seeing the hollywood sign, star gazing and seeing the lights of the city at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690kime
40,A must see in LA,"We went here with family, It's a beautiful place to have a picnic and watch the stars. They have shows that run at different times, it's just amazing to watch! I fell asleep every now and then because it's so relaxing, they have the ceiling of the planetarium like the color of the skies and dim it later in the show and the voice of the narrator ia very well modulated.The entire place is awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msmanila

50,Sweeping views and unique experience,"I love this place. I cannot get enough of the gorgeous views and planetarium! The gift shop has Iots cool stuff for the science geeks and great stuff for the kids. It's pricey but the money helps keep the observatory functioning. The cafeteria has decent food but a small selection. I found it interesting that the food is all locally sourced from area farms. Lunch for 5 was $50 and included a wrap, mac n cheese, pasta, 2 chicken/vegetables/salad meals, and a coconut chicken sandwich with drinks for all of us.Tip: To avoid the long ticket line and crowded museum area use the ticket kiosk. There is an elevator to the right of the main entrance (before going inside). Take it down to the lowest floor. Right outside the gift shop and cafeteria, there is a ticket kiosk where you can purchase your planetarium tickets ($7 adults). No lines, no fuss. After you get your ticket, step outside on the balcony for sweeping views of the city and Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2manyjules

50,While I was in LA spontaneously,Heard about this place from a former admirer of mine. Decided to visit one day. It's an awesome place for those who are barely starting to learn about constellations or even those who are experts. Beautiful scenic views and trails. I've visited this place about 4 times in one year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280biancah
50,Amazing views,This is well worth a trip. The car park is free and the shuttle is only a couple of dollars per person up to the Observatory. The views here of LA are amazing and also the Hollywood Sign. We visited at Sunset on a very chilly November evening and it was so worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebrob1234

Make this a part of your travels to socal.It is worth the selfie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8495JLmichaelg
50,Fantastic for the Whole Family!,"First let me say that I have very fond memories of this place as a kid. We used to come here for field trips in elementary school and it was always a wonderful outing. They would make a whole day of it, we'd bring our weird little paper sack lunches, and first go to the Observatory and take their tour (which only lasted 30 minutes) then spend about another 30 minutes walking around the Observatory grounds. After that our teachers would pile us all back into the long yellow buses and head over to nearby Griffith Park proper so we could eat our lunches and play in the park for a couple of hours.These days, they've done extensive improvements and renovations. Sure, the huge pendulum is still in the main entry way when you arrive to the Observatory but they've added many programs. They have several good educational showings in their auditorium where you can listen to either music and watch the constellations above your head (on the ceiling) transform or hear a lecture about the stars and planets.They have been doing so much renovating there that I know they have all new hours and may have changed their rates as well. It would be wise to check their website to find out what's new and if they take walk ins now. There was some talk of appointments but that would be tough in my opinion.Great for the whole family or even as a Friday night date night. If you take the kids, plan on a picnic lunch at Griffith Park as well. You can take the kids over near the mini train or even the pony ride. Fun for everyone and very affordable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
50,Very Educational,"Visited on a Tuesday night in late January. Parking lot was full and people were parking along the street. It was a very clear, cold evening and the views were incredible. There were so many interesting exhibits to see! Don't miss the short documentary about how the observatory was recently remodeled - it's shown in the Leonard Nimoy Theater on the bottom level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D7819HEkellyb

It's wonderful at Sunset and even more wonderful after dark as the city lights up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3056KAalicec
50,Lovely view of LA from one its landmarks.,"The ride up to Griffith Park is beautiful just to see the elegant stately homes of old LA. Once at the site, it's flat and easily walkable with the exception of the trails which would require good shoes and some steeper terrain. Once inside, the planetarium is good and different entertainment. Good for the entire family and couples can view the romantic skyline in various locations. Good for a picnic. Interesting back-story if you can find it, about Mr. Griffith himself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,Los Angeles Icon,"Enjoyed first visit to the observatory since it's five year renovation. Wonderful exhibits, some interactive. Fabulous day light view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Wonderful star show with live narrator. Free to enter museum section. Minimal cost for theater experience. Be prepared for traffic in the park on weekends and long walks uphill from roadside parking. Limited parking available at the observatory. Buses do pull up to the front. Will probably use next trip. Nice gift shop. Food and restrooms available. Outside wait for the show. Suggest good walking shoes, sun block, sunglasses, visor or hat and water bottle. Don't forget your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJR55

50,Parking is a fright but this classic landmark is worth the effort to get there,"You really can't visit this place without thinking of ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where James Dean and Corey Allen had the chicken knife fight or when a smitten Sal Mineo got shot by the police. Damn, I didn't know there's a bust of James Dean on one of the balconies. And now ""La La Land"" has brought new life to the observatory by celebrating ""Rebel"" and elevating Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling to an airborne pas de deux among the stars in the planetarium. That probably sparked my recent visit, my very first time at this legendary spot opened in 1935. Sitting on the southern slope of Mount Hollywood, it's a classic Art Deco landmark.Renovated about a decade ago to it former glory, it offers views toward the city skyline and the environs are unbeatable, and of course, there's the ideal view of the Hollywood sign for your Instagram account. Enter the main building, and you see above you in the rotunda the Hugo Ballin murals that celebrate celestial mythology, as well as the Foucault Pendulum measuring the earth's rotation in a gentle swinging motion. Interactive exhibits flank the rotunda taking me back to my astronomy classes back at Berkeley.We decided to take in the ""Water Is Life"" show in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium which allowed us a more earthbound experience than Emma and Ryan had, but still it was an enjoyable treat as a docent provided live narration. Totally worthwhile for a $7 ticket. Parking is a fright, and don't delude yourself into thinking you'll get a space in the small lot. We parked on a side road down the winding hillside road, and it took us about 15 minutes to walk up. The place was crowded but surprisingly not unbearable except for the gaggle of girls who kept singing the songs from ""La La Land"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed_Uyeshima

The Observatory was great with lots of information. The wifi was not great and kept dropping out.

40,Good for the price,The observatory itself is free. They have the dome open for shows which cost $8/adult. This was a very interesting show. It seemed to very at the different times of day that you come. Purchase tickets ahead of time and make sure you get a seat prior to the show. They close the door promptly at show time. The show lasts about 30 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14emilyr
40,Nice afternoon,Been coming to LA for a few years and this had sat on my to do list and finally got round to it - wished I'd done on it on my first visit!Didn't get to go in as they were filming (which was interesting in itself and very LA) but highly recommend as so much good to see:Great views (on a clear day - suggest checking)Hollywood signGreat trails if you're a hiker or runner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianr428
40,Sunset + observatory exploration,"Great views of the city, Hollywood sign and nice visit of the observatory (+ show on the planetarium)!We decided to see the sunset from the Griffith observatory, but we missed by a few minutes due to traffic (already knew traffic was no great, but should have accounted for more time than 40 min from the Chinese Theater region we were)Still, the changing coloring of the sky and seeing the shining lights from the city was totally worth it!Good spot to see the Hollywood sign although from one lateral side ( ir won't look like what you see in the movies - I would recommend driving up the Beachwood Canyon Drive for better, traditional sights of the sign)Since we visited in winter, it got pretty windy and chilly with night fall, our daughters ( 8 and 12 years old) endured it pretty we. However, plan head because this might make your ""outside time"" of the observatory a bit shorter.Inside the observatory, the exhibits are ok, and we decided to attend one of planetarium presentations ( ""Centered in the Universe"" - a journey of cosmic exploration and discovery).It was very good, even if our kids don't speak perfect English, they were able to follow.2 recommendations:1) sit in the back - since your sits recline you must have a good sight of all the planetarium ceiling;2) beware if you are too tired ... we had actually a parent of young children falling asleep during the presentation ( the sits are pretty comfortable) and his kids actually had to wake him up after snoring one time ( must say it somewhat funny and after a long day it might have also happened to me....)We had great fun, very cool pictures and added a bit of additional knowledge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolasw199
50,So Beautiful !!,"Put this place on you list and check it off. The views,the building,the park,the exhibits...definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uesnna
50,Amazing Views,"I visited the Griffith Observatory for the views and it did not disappoint. They are breathtaking! What I didn't know was how fantastic the exhibits inside would be, and, sadly, did not plan a long enough visit to explore them. Entrance to the main Observatory is FREE and they have a very nice cafe, so be sure to plan a decent amount of time when you visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimT884
50,Great view,So we didn't know what to expect coming to the observatory but it was a gem. Great views of LA and you can see the Hollywood sign too.Must take the drive up but make sure your not driving as the views up is just as wonderful once up top,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhm4317

40,Good views,Good views of LA and surrounding areas. A decent view of the Hollywood sign but it is still quite a distance away from it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
40,Spectacular!,I went there at night and during the holidays thus explains the crowd. There was a shuttle bus that offers a ride up and back down (the parking lot) for a dollar? I forgot how much it was.The observatory itself was nice. It's a good place to check out astronomy information.The view outside was spectacular!! as most look outs I guess... The view of LA at night made my visit in LA bearable...You can also see the Hollywood sign :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172myram

50,Seen LA LA LAND?,"This spot is the quintessential movie shoot location. Whether it's LA LA LAND, Back to the Future a myriad of TV shows this is the LA spot. Its located in a great park. Has easy access from multiple entrances. The view looking south is amazing. You can see most of LA from here, often all the way to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mexic0maniac
50,Informative science visit with great views of LA and Hollywood sign,"Great views, the Hollywood sign seems quite far though, so the sign ended up small in the photo. Reached the observatory at 11am on a Tuesday, parking (free) was a bit difficult although a few cars have started to leave. Science tour inside the observatory is very enjoyable for our group of adults, teen, and child.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rae_holidays
50,Best view,"There is an amazing view from this place free of charge. The inside was slightly boring to me because I am not into astronomy and it looked too advanced for kids to enjoy, however, it is worth the trip for the view alone. Everything there was well maintained and clean. I think it's a must when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lpetti3000
50,A very special place!,"A visit here is truly an amazing experience, the wonderful architecture, informative interactive displays, beautiful city views and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snobuz78
50,A nice place to check out the Hollywood sign and astronomy info,"I wish we'd had time to stick around for the planetarium show or to see this venue at night. As it was, it was a great place to wander around, view the Hollywood sign and enjoy an amazing view over the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BB_Mke
40,What a view of L.A!!!,Spent a lovely couple of hours at the Griffith observatory. The views of Los Angeles are breathtaking and you get a closer look at the Hollywood sign. Inside the observatory there wasn't much to do so didn't spend too long inside but just looking at all the bright lights of los angeles from up there was enough for me. Spectacular!!! A must do when your visiting and with free entry and free shuttle service you cant really go wrong.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjenks77
50,Closest point u get to the Hollywood sign,"One in life time experience, is a must go in u into science an have teens that appreciate as wellRestrooms needs more cleaning",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHurtado
50,A great view of the city of Angels,We were fortunate enough to attend the Griffith Park where you can view the Hollywood sign and take in the sights of the city.For those of you who love Neil Diamond on the drive up to Griffith Park on the left had side is where he made one of his debut concerts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmK8599SY
40,A little bit of La La Land!,"Fascinating and informative displays with plenty of opportunities for interaction. Our session in the planetarium was the family-oriented one and was pitched perfectly for that audience. You can climb up to see the telescope and get superb views at the same time. 360 degree views by walking around the outside of the building. The cafe has a pretty good range of hot and cold food at reasonable prices. We went as it opened at midday; by the time we left, the place was very busy indeed with car parking near to the Observatory at a premium. We went there by Uber and would recommend that as an alternative to trying to find a parking space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127rogers
40,La La Land,"We decided to park down below for the fear of not getting a parking spot. That turned out to be both a positive and a negative. It was a negative because there were plenty more spots up near the observatory. I would suggest driving all the way up to get a feel for the parking conditions. Still, it turned out to be a plus as the hike up to the observatory was very worth it and pleasant for a cool day.This is the place where parts of ""La La Land"" was filmed. It is nice to get that perspective. The views of the Hollywood sign and the city were magnificent. The exhibits inside were informative. Overall, it was a nice day for a hike, tour an iconic place and enjoy the views of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
40,The sunsets and views are among the best in LA. Take an uber as there is no parking and tons of people. Great hiking!,Sunsets and views are the best. Go on a clear day to get the best views. My only issue is you can't get a good wifi signal which is necessary to get an uber. Please improve wifi and restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margie1634
30,Hiking or tourism?,"The main grounds of the Griffith Observatory is overrun by tourists with small children, baby strollers and bicycles picnicking everywhere. But it's a great place to get some good pictures of the Hollywood sign (if you're bringing a serious zoom or binoculars). BRING YOUR OWN WATER! The shop located inside the observatory is very expensive and a total chaos of people skipping lines.If you're looking for a place to hike I suggest some of the tougher routes as they are less overrun with tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefan-doering
40,Memorable visit to Griffith Observatory in LA USA,"On second Sunday of January 2017, were very near to Griffith Observatory and tried to visit the Observatory.However due to huge number of visitors and full parking areas, we could not make it to top of the hill where Observatory is situated.However on Monday morning we again went there and it was less crowded.We parked our car about 300yards from the Observatory and then climbed up on foot upto the gate of the Observatory.It was a very pleasant Walk upto the gate of the Observatory.On reaching at the gate , we were told that the Observatory is closed on Monday.It was a bit of disappointment for us.However we went around the beautiful surroundings and experience greenery all around and had the magnificent view of the city of Los Angeles and Hollywood Sign.Some people went on tracking the near by Hollywood Sign.It was a memorable visit to Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scg11219

40,"Free, magnificent, and open til 10 pm","We took uber there from our airbnb and it was about 7pm when we got there. It was a bit crowded with people and the whole place was well-organized. Just avoid the bad weather;cold, rainy, cloudy..... It was windy, cloudy, rainy in turn when we were there, so we didn't enjoy much, but I can imagine that it would have been a great opportunity to experience all they have with the stars/telescope, if the weather permitted. Just be careful, though, uber-users out there. It must have been with my sim card that I had bought from my country, but when we wanted to come back to our airbnb, we tried to call uber but to no avail, because I didn't get the signal. My phone was not receiving any signal up there, so we had to walk down a little but still no signal. Here's what we did. Fortunately(?) there was an incident that somebody got a broken window to the car(looked like somebody broke the car window with a rock or something), so the park rangers and the police were there. We asked for help to get down to the main road(there's no street line along the downhill) and one park ranger drove us down to the main street, where I got the signal back on my phone and got the uber to go back. Just remember this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_M3324NF

40,Excellent thing to do especially on a rainy day,"It was an extremely rainy (and apparently rare) day in LA so we headed indoors.

40,Great views - bring hiking shoes,"We came here during our girls' trip to LA because we found out that we could see the Hollywood sign from the Griffith Observatory. Admission is free. There is parking but it was full (the additional parking was full too). Like everyone else, we had to park to the side of the road down the hill and walk - hike - up to the observatory. Definitely bring comfortable shoes as it's a bit of a trek. Once you get up to the Observatory, you'll have a great view of the Hollywood sign and LA. Plenty of photo ops and tourists as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Br00klyngrl
40,"The ""Hollywood"" sign isn't lit at night j/s",I read on here that this was an excellent place to go to get a good view of the Hollywood sign which it was. The only thing was that no one told us it wasn't lit up a night. :-( Went on a Saturday night around 10pm. It was pretty packed. We had to walk a long ways uphill to get to the observatory. I didn't expect it to be as crowded as it was. There was a great view of LA a night and it was pretty but we really wanted to get pics of the sign...but that didn't happen. LOL. There were people out with big telescopes where you could look at different planets but the lines were too long to wait. Same thing to go in the room to look using the big telescope. The lines were even worse for that. I'd go back but in the daytime and probably on a weekday or research a less busy time to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSteelRobinson
50,Gorgeous views,"We made it just as the sun was setting - the most busy time but absolutely soul stirring! We used the telescope (though we queued for 30 mins for it) but the absolute highlight was the show - the Valkyries for less than $20. Loved being in the planetarium, great informative show, and I've since learnt it's where some scenes from La La Land were filmed, which somehow makes it even more romantic! Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/942emiliac

50,"Best Views, Go at Night","If you can, go at night vs. going during the day. That way you can actually use the telescopes out on the front lawn and see the cool star clusters and planets. You could easily come before sunset and see the exhibits plus watch a film in the planetarium. The planetarium is around $7 a showing which isn't bad since we didn't pay for parking or admission to the observatory. Also the views of LA at night are breathtaking and the Hollywood sign would be if it would've been lit up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cryptic_Tourist

It is little bit far to see LA downtown but still not a bad view. Went there December and it was so cold, couldn't last more than 20 minutes.So bundle up if you are going there in Winter time. It should be a lot nice during summer time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Never2ver
50,The best stargazing in LA,"As a Los Angeles resident, Griffith Observatory is our staple. On any given clear night we head over, often hiking up with flashlights to catch the city under the stars, learn about the planets circulating our solar system or take a deeper scientific gaze into our past or future. The campus housing the large telescope is situated high above Griffith Park. The view is breathtaking. It's a must see if visiting Los Angeles! Refer to their website which hosts monthly star parties or visit the site where La La Land was filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cin2266

Definitely a must do when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2720WQmarier
50,Seeing the real Stars in LA,"The Griffith Observatory is a treat to visit. The building, an icon in Los Angeles, is a gorgeous piece of architecture, hanging over the edge of the Hollywood Hills. Parking is difficult, the park is well used and parking is limited. People often have to park along the winding road which climbs through Griffith Park. Lots of great trails with epic views. Once you reach the top, the Observatory is accessible on several levels. The newer museum is actually under the existing building, making it inconspicuous, and an interesting interactive experience. Some great 3d models of the planets which really help grasp the differences in size and content. The old part of the observatory still houses the Planetarium and a giant telescopes. I recommend going up at the end of the afternoon. It is fun going into the Planetarium around sunset because when you exit, you exit out of the building facing South with a view of the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbjnla
40,Fun way to learn something new!,"The Observatory is up on a hill overlooking Los Angeles and a direct view of the Hollywood sign. On a clear day you can see the ocean. That is just the outside of the building. On the inside are films and planetarium shows, displays and photos to help you learn about our universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malia727
40,Griffith park,"Over the last two years I have been to Griffith park 4 times, and we always see something new, we like looking thru the telescopes at the planets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardwH5593UP
40,Definitely worth visiting,"This is a great location to get some peace and quiet from the city traffic in central LA, whilst at the same time getting amazing views of the city.If you're keen to see the Hollywood sign, this is the place to come. You can even get a great panoramic photo that includes the skyscrapers of downtown LA, the vast city with its grid roads, the hills and the Hollywood sign - all in one photo. I have been to LA many times and I don't know of a view like this.Parking is free.The observatory building is interesting and different to typical LA buildings, it feels quite historic.There are either very few shops or none at all (I didn't see any). So bring food and drink with you. It's a lovely place to picnic anyway. The last shops I saw before reaching the park were on Los Feliz and on Vermont. Come prepared.Hiking trails here are an adventure, steep, twisty, glimpses of outstanding views, peaceful. If it has rained in the last couple of days, the hiking trails will be muddy and in places a little slippery. So my advice is to only attempt the hiking trails if you're reasonably fit, healthy, wearing suitable footwear, bringing water and snacks and you're not in a rush.There are toilets here, but as it's a park, unsurprisingly the one I used needed some attention, hence only a 4 star rating.But overall it's a gem within LA that really shows off the city. It's definitely worth a visit, especially if you're a tourist, the photos you get here will be the ones you show your friends and family back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonDanDan

Not to be missed for visitors and locals alike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancybV3954TY
40,Enjoyable outing,"Griffith Observatory sits on high ground, giving a beautiful view of Los Angeles. You can also see the Hollywood sign from the observatory.It was an educational tour, which the children enjoyed.Parking was limited - many people parked at the base of the hill and either walked up or took a shuttle bus. We had young children and drove to the main parking lot and just waited till a car came vacated a parking space - a stroke of luck more than anything else.It was so crowded even in the afternoon on a n overcast day that we went that they closed the main entrance temporarily but allowed us to use an alternative entrance.The observatory needs about 2 - 3 hours to see its exhibits - we didn't wait to see any of the shows as it was so crowded.Overall, 4 stars.

10,Not Worth Battling through the traffic to get to top.,"Spent about one hour in bumper to bumper traffic to get to the top. The view was totally spoilt by seeing just buildings and the city as far as the eye could see.I thought being at the top of the mountain would be a break from crawling through the LA city streets but the view just was just a reminder we would have to do it all again.Maybe I was spoilt seeing the sites of Colorado Springs last year. Only good thing was, I was there on business, I would have been gutted if I had paid to holiday in LA.Only plus, weather was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray_Newland
50,Worth the drive and great for a walk in the hills,"Although it was a rare cloudy day in L.A., we still had an excellent view of the city for miles and took the opportunity to explore the trails leading away from the Observatory. It's a great place to take visitors, kids and adults alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MES767
50,A Great Place To Visit When In L.A,"A must stop if in the LA area! The views of the area are definitely worth the visit. Once you're done enjoying the view, the activities and galleries inside is the cherry on top! If you're not a fan of astronomy, you will be! You'll definitely be impressed with all the exhibits.The friendly staff had no problems answering questions and were kind to either guide us in the right direction and showed my girlfriend and I around a bit. They definitely made my experience more enjoyable.Me and my daughter walked the Hollywood Trail from the observatory. The information desk inside the observatory provided a map of the various trails short or long. We walked to the Hollywood sign. But beware of the heat and take plenty water as we found it very hot about 2pm should have started earlier but enjoyed the views and trails are well laid out. Glad we went would recommend a day out here well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneduffy
40,Great view of the city,Had a great view of the city from the Griffith observatory. Recommend parking below the hill and taking a 20 min walk up to avoid traffic and waiting for parking up at the observatory. The observatory also has some nice exhibits which are educational for kids and adults alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mengyangn
40,LA views,"You’d better get early otherwise you won’t find any parking space close to the entrance, only on the road and then, it’ll be a long walk up on the hill. Once you get there you’ll have magnificent views of LA landscape, including the Hollywood sign, although a little a bit far. Inside there’s the planetarium which is one of the best I’ve seen. For the explorers, there are lots of trails you can around the observatory. This is a great attraction where you can mix some education with nature, especially for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xHenriquex
50,Amazing views,Incredible views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. Parking is a little tricky so get there early unless you don't mind a hike up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expedition583851
50,Get there early to get a parking space,The parking is a bit dicey. Not a lot of spaces near the observatory but we got there an hour before it opened and got a space. When we left there were cars parked on both sides of the road leading up to the top. There are lots of great displays inside and wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign from the terrace. We saw the planetarium show which was the best we've seen. Down stairs in the Leonard Nemoy theatre they have a free film which explains how the observatory came to be and the amazing lengths they went through to not detract from the original building when they did renovations several years ago. If you have extra time there are lots of hiking trails in the area. I would consider this a must visit place when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardener19464
50,Awesome!,The views of the city are awesome! We like the trails that are around the observatory. Provides a fun learning opportunity for kids and adults. Breathtaking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholes802

30,A nice place to see LA from above,"It is one of ""a must visit"" spot in LA. Where we can see LA from above. There a lot of people come by to see the observatory. The place is neat, well maintained, still well organized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariestiani
50,On a clear day....,...you can see quite a distance! It's obviously a pretty popular attraction but once you find a parking spot the grounds of the observatory are pretty spread out so you don't feel crowded. Decent astronomy museum inside with some fun and interesting exhibits inside (they have a tesla coil!) And the views...spectacular! Iconic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlohaRomona
50,Griffith Observatory,"It is good place for any one like science and happy to know more about moon and planets, it's also a perfect place to take a lot of photos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mais403
50,A Must Visit Place,Here you can have a panoramic view for Los Angeles and enjoy the view from top. A lot of observations area for all sides of LA available. You can see Hollywood sign from there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdulmoez-Tahmaz
40,Part of Guided Tour,Only there briefly but it is a place I would like to return and visit again. We visited after hiking to the top of mount Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlacierCountryMT
50,One of the best places to visit in Los Angeles,This place gives visitors a very panoramic view of Los Angeles on a clear day. It is also very historical as several movies have been filmed here. Even now the current movie Lala land have depicted this place as magical. Magical indeed as it somehow makes you dream when you are out there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honeybunny96
50,Go for the views,"The drive up here is a great way to escape the city and get into nature. There are sweeping views from up here. If you like James Dean or La La Land, it's totally worth a visit. It's out of the way and you have to make tracks intentionally to get there, but you can see the Hollywood (Hollyweed?) sign from up there, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillbertnyc
40,Amazing view day or night,"My friend took us here, it was an amazing view, we were even able to see the Hollywood sign from there. A great view of LA from above. Lots of people even towards closing time. I would recommend going day or night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bouxiong
30,Great view - but didn't get to go into the observatory,"I went to the Griffith Observatory with my husband and a few friends in november 2016. The observatory itself was, unfortunately, closed but the view of LA was excellent.So if you just want to get a good look over LA, and don't mind a handful of people standing in your way, this is the place to go. But be aware that parking is terrible",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragnhildur418
50,Amazing views and so much more,this was so much more than I expected - beautiful view of the city but also so much to see & do inside. Worth the visit & I suggest a couple of hours :)You need to be patient with parking - its busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaC295
50,Awesome experience,"Visited the Observatory in the last week of December 2016. It is located at a great height from where one can have fascinating views of Los Angeles and Hollywood sign. People do hiking to reach the Griffith Observatory. A good place for photography. Observatory itself gives a lot of knowledge about the planets. Try to visit the place in the morning hours to avoid rush, particularly on week ends and holidays. A must visit attraction when in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshwaniC
40,Great views and nice park,"Drove up here while on business here in LA. Great views from observatory, and the Faraday Cage inside is pretty cool. The park is sprawling, seemed like a good hiking spot but I didn't partake. Watch out for bicyclists on the drive up they're everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloodOfHunger
50,Hollywood Must See!,"If in the area, you'll regret not going here for the view. The observatory is free and offers one of the best views of the city. There are additional optional attractions inside the observatory available for a fee. Depending on how busy the park is, you may have to park your car and walk a ways up a hill so keep that in mind. I have visited twice and will definetely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242ashleyb
50,Great views!,Great views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign! You won't be disappointed! We didn't get a lot of time to spend inside but it's free admission and looked very interesting. Would like to have the opportunity to go back and spend more time. There's also a snack bar downstairs with plenty of options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamesmom1
40,Really great but lots of people!,I love this place- especially when it's not a smoggy day and you can take in the amazing view. They did a great renovation on it a few years ago. There is history and beauty everywhere here. The only downfall is the crush of traffic/parking to get here. But...welcome to LA. That's just how it works here. But still - recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89dustinf
50,Well time spent under the stars...,"We recently had family visit from another country and my husband and I decided to take them to the observatory. I am so glad we did we had an amazing experience, we went when it was sun down and parked at the bottom and instead of taking the tram we decided to hike it up there. I won't lie it was cold, dark and the hike was steep but very fun. Don't forget to take your own flashlight if you decide to go at night. Once we got in there we purchased tickets to see the Samuel Oschin telescope but the lines were veryyy long and time was a bit of an essence for our visitors. However; we did get to admire the Albert Einstein statue and we got to see all of the artifacts that they have on display. I would need a while list to describe it... bottom line it's a pleasant experience to take your kids, teenagers, and grown ups as well. It's an experience full of knowledge and entertainment. The kool part is we got to see the Hollywood sign very close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catndago03
40,"Great views, beautiful building",Worth the trip even if you are not a science buff. The building is beautiful and the views of Los Angeles are great. A good place to get photos of the Hollywood sign. We went by Uber and this meant we could avoid the long walk up the hill. We saw the Water show in the Planetarium and it was good. The weather was a little grey and wet so I think this kept the crowds to a minimum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natclay
50,Fascinating,This is one of the best locations to look down on Hollywood. Good for a selfie with the Hollywood sign. And the observatory itself is fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PacoH_11
40,Great views of Los Angeles,"We were unable to park at the top by the observatory so we hiked up the hill for about 20 minutes. Great views of the canyon, Hollywood sign and downtown L.A. The observatory was interesting and enjoyed by our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sapoypato
50,You must go here.,"Love coming here when we visit LA. What a breathtaking view - day or night. Watch the Leonard Nimoy-narrated movie about the planetarium. It's a pretty fascinating look at how they renovated it. Jump in front of the seismograph to make it wiggle. It's really worth it if only for the view, but definitely go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GatorDocs

40,Gorgeous view,A bit of an uphill walk up to the observatory but totally worth it. Takes about 25 mins each way. Good to burn off some calories as well while you are at it.

50,"Spectacular Views, Beautiful Area of Los Angeles!","Griffith Park and Observatory are a lovely oasis in frenzied, fast-paced Los Angeles! I can't wait to come back and explore some of the hiking trails that we saw on the drive up to Griffith Observatory. The views of the Los Angeles vicinity, Hollywood and the Pacific Ocean were spectacular on the sun-filled day of our visit. We went up early on a weekday morning and hadn't checked the hours of operation for the observatory. We were mildly dissapointed that it did not open until noon. The amazing views and photo opportunities made-up for our dissapointment! We will definitely return to explore the observatory and to hike a few trails!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
40,Hard to get to!,"My family and I visited the observatory on Christmas Day during our West Coast trip. The main goal was to see the Hollywood sign and LA. While the views were amazing, it was quite a challenge to get there. The parking lot at the observatory was closed but there were no signs advising of that. So we snaked up to the top (which took forever) just to find ourselves going down again. We managed to find a parking spot at a lower level parking lot and hike up to the top. The views were amazing and at the end it was worth it. But I wish it was a little easier to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YouliaB
50,Superb,"it was a great trip , i liked it .i have enjoyed this time there .i recommend all my readers to go there during their visit to los Angelos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AhmedE269
40,Fascinating,"The first time I went the inside museum and upper deck were closed off. Recently visited again and they take the experienced far beyond a nice hike with a good view. In the museum have visual displays of principles ranging from chemistry to astronomy to physics. (Although less on physics) This includes a moderate scale Tesla coil, periodic table with actual elements for display (ones that are legal and non-radioactive) and a full size planetarium. Plus access (excluding planetarium tickets) is free.A must see for anyone interested in science or just looking for a more interactive museum experience. View of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA around golden hour... awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39garlandb
50,Visit in the morning. Hardly any traffic.,My family and I didn't have this on our list of things to do. But we were so happy that our friends had mentioned this to us because it was well worth the spectacular views. My children aged 5 & 6 enjoyed the observatory. We went in the morning and we didn't have to wait for a park. So my tip to families with young children. Go in before 11am as it gets really hectic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf
40,Amazing place,"It is a great place for many reasons :First of all ,it is located on the top of the hill so the view is great and great for hikingSecond of all,it is a great place to learn about universe for kids and also adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shervin1359
50,Great planetarium,"This is another attraction in LA that is free, that I also did not know was free until we got there. Great stuff (bad trip research planner :) ) This had some interesting exhibits and some great views. The highlight though was the planetarium show. This did carry a charge but it was superb. I am very glad we got to see the show!Pros1. Free to enter, inexpensive cost for planetarium.2. Family friendly and educationalCons1. Gets very busy and we had a very long walk from where we parked to where the center was. Not an issue for us, but could be for others",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferkW5524LZ
50,Beautiful at sunset,This place is amazing! We arrived just in time for the sunset and it did not disappoint! The views of LA and the Hollywood sign are incredible! We visited inside the observatory for a short time but definitely want to cone back for a longer visit and enjoy the museum inside!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnd826
50,The best view over downtown LA,"This is the place you get the famous view for. Downtown LA in front of you and the Hollywood sign behind, this is pretty cool and definitely a place you need to go while in Hollywood. If you plan to see the sunset resp. the view over downtown LA by night, you have to come very early. The first time we gave it a try, it was already dark when we drive up the hill and we couldn't make it to the top as there were to many cars! We were stuck in the traffic and decided to turn back after a while. So we went back a few days later, being there at around 5pm. It's a lovely place to spend time anyway and the Observatory is very interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lolo-to-be
30,See Hollywood Sign from here!,"Only weekends and holidays there is a shuttle from Sunset, else its a 45 minute walk from the main road and the metro bus stop. The road is uphill after passing Greek Theatre.Hollywood Sign and the whole of LA can be seen from this observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellersfootprint

It's a very popular place, but it's worth it, one of the highlights of our trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzyd18
50,New Years Day at the observatory!,"Been here a few times, but it was my SO's first time.It was heavily packed as it was New Year's Day, so the drive up was slow and parking was a bit of a headache.After a quick hike, we made it up and got to see the observatory and of course the ""Hollywood Sign"" which was at the time briefly changed to ""Hollyweed"" by some New Years prankster.That def attracted a ton of attention!Great place to spend half a day. It's a breathtaking view and seeing the iconic Hollywood sing is pretty awesome.-Be prepared to see lots and lots of tourists!-wear comfortable shoes cuz it's a hike!-Free admission-small cafeteria upstairs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amcdt925

50,Still in awe of the beauty!,"First of all, be prepared to park far away and do some major uphill walking! It is SO worth it, though. I was completely blown away at the views and beauty. We focused on just looking around at the views, but did briefly go inside and peek around. Very nice gift shop and nice exhibits. This is a definite bucket list item. The pictures I took don't begin to do this view justice. One must really experience it first hand to be able to appreciate the sheer beauty of this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boston2FL
30,Too busy,Tried to visit but shuttle bus was too infrequent to handle holiday crowdsVery disappointed will try again next visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikevfi

Inside the observarty you can also experience some of the sky events such as sun/moon eclipses, deep space objects etc. if you are interested in astronomy, you must visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seyisoglu34
50,Absolute must do!,"Ubered up to the top for a great view during sunset.Observatory is free and contains some real simple, clear, concise and informative displays. Well worth taking the time to read them.Views are outstanding and really shows how spread out and 'flat' the city is.Had little to no phone coverage and even with the free wifi had issues organising another uber- be aware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattybaig
50,Amazing Views,I come up here every time I find myself in LA. The views are spectacular with one side looking out over Hollywood and downtown LA. The other looking towards the Hollywood sign. Many great hiking trails all around the observatory. You can walk all around the building and even see some exhibits free of charge. The traffic getting up to the top can be bad at times but there is a remote parking area and shuttle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCA1312
50,Amazing,"You have to be patient and leave plenty of time to get up to the observatory, especially around sunset. Yes, it can get crowded because it is a very popular destination. They are currently working on a shuttle system that should launch this year at some point because traffic getting up to the observatory around sunset and later is very bad. Looking through the rooftop telescope at the moon at night is really neat. Once it becomes dark, people set up their own telescopes on the front lawn and you can form a line behind them and look at what their telescope is focused on. It is a really neat educational community type of feel. I also enjoyed the planetarium show (there are multiple to choose from). The main floor has science exhibits and there is a tesla coil that lights up every so often. The real attraction is the view of LA and the surrounding areas. If you are able to go on a clear day you can see for a very long way off. It is equally as beautiful during the day or at night. We go here multiple times throughout the year and it never gets old. There are also trail heads for hikes that start here... like the hike to the Hollywood sign. You just have to be patient and respectful and you will have a great time here. There are bathrooms inside and outside of the observatory. Until the shuttles are up and running this year, don't try to park at the top near the observatory, just grab a spot along the road on the winding street leading up to it. Uber's are able to drop people off at the top, but you'll be sitting in traffic the whole way up, so it might just be faster to walk up the last section if it is closer to sunset or if there is a big event that night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kef1545
40,Great views from the top!,"Was looking forward to coming here for our whole trip to LA. It was quite a site to visit. Parking was a little crazy but we found a spot close to the top. Great views of the Hollywood sign from here, so have your camera handy. The observatory itself is pretty amazing both inside and out. Great views of LA from outside and cool exhibits inside. Didn't go into the planetarium, which I wanted to, but maybe next time. I would love to come back here in the evening as I bet the views would be amazing at night. A must visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ironleague

50,Definitely a must do in LA . . .,"A visit to the Observatory at Griffith Park in LA is a must do. We visited on a nice clear sunny day and the view across the city is stunning, as is the chance to see the infamous Hollywood sign, plus some great photo opportunities.Please be aware that if you are driving up to the Observatory and while there is a car park at the top, it fills up quickly, so it may be worth parking roadside lower down the hill and trekking up to the top. We were lucky that as we got to the car park a space became available.As well as the stunning views and beautiful park, the observatory itself is fascinating and informative - and best of all FREE to visit and look round (you can pay for some extras if you wish). Nice little shop as well, with some lovely gifts!All in all a great morning out (or afternoon) but not a whole day out unless you wish to walk more of the park and picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigstuw

The first time I went I got there right before sunset and had to park so far down the road that I only made it towards the top where the observatory is before the sunset and never actually went inside.On my second visit we went around 2pm. We had to park on the road that leads up to it and walk up. Be prepared to squeeze into any parallel spot you see!A big selling point about this landmark-it's free! There is a great view of the Hollywood sign, gorgeous views overlooking L.A., and you can walk around inside the observatory. Loads of picture perfect opportunities here.They have public bathrooms and water fountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gagirl75

30,My visit to Griffith Observatory,"1. Pls check Google maps for the traffic around Griffith Park especially when you are visiting on a holiday time ( I went first and was re-routed to go out and then I reached in my second attempt)2. You have two choices to reach. If you are a good walker/trekker, you can park the car at the base and walk over to hill (its a good exercise)3. You can reach the top and park there.4. A good view of the city and a good Observatory explaining basics about our Universe and its patterns.5. The HollyWood sign at the Hill is yet another sight of view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SajHyde
50,Beautiful historic informative space,"There are many reasons to visit, along with the surrounding park for hiking! But the gem is inside the observatory. First when you get there, start at the ticket counter so you can see whatever is playing, as they tend to sell out! Then spend some time at the exhibits...they have so much information and explain so much about how our universe works! They have a nice snack bar too. Just know parking can be difficult and you may have a hike up the hill. Go and Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sojournarita

First, there are the views: of the Hollywood sign, L.A. all the way to the ocean, and the building itself with has been featured in many films from the 1950s Rebel without a Cause to the more recent Transformers! Inside is a wonderful science museum, a nice cafe, and planetarium and laser show/movie. Budget at least 3 hours to do it justice. Order tix to shows ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TruthtellerTraveler6
50,Amazing View,Great place to visit while in LA. Beautiful view and great atmosphere! A must see! I highly recommend you visit during sunset. Awesome scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leylanin2018
50,Simply Stunning,We walked from the bottom car park with the cafe and it's well worth doing this unless you really need to drive up to the car park. The views you get en route are stunning as well as the photo opportunities with the Hollywood sign. We were there on a hot ( but not too hot) day and it was busy but we still made it in to the Planetarium and got a table at the restaurant without any trouble. The telescopes and science exhibits are well set out and fascinating. The building is beautiful. Sunset from there is amazing so plan your visit for sundown. Don't try to push a pram up there unless you're feeling strong though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38helenf
30,Very interesting if astronomy is your thing but very crowded,We went there on a Saturday evening and the Observatory was extremely crowded - due in part to the fact it is free to enter. If you are into astronomy it is great but due to the crowds it was difficult to see everything. It is free to enter but if you want to see a show in the observatory (which I highly recommend) there is a small charge. There is also a free movie (again I highly recommend it) about the Observatory and the man behind it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetf2013
40,Popular even on a rainy day,Very crowded and popular even thought it was raining. Good shuttle system (didn't wait for more than 10 min) from the lower parking area to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanonymousDude
50,Visited courtesy of LA Tours,"Defintely worth a visit as the whole area is awesome especially with the photo opportunities to see the Hollywood Sign.The surrounding area is stunning but get there early as the traffic after 11am was horrendous and law enforcement close the roads if it gets too busy.It was warm for December 29th so the view was amazing, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trebor5417
50,Come here to hike to Hollywood sign,I came here New Years Day to visit and hike up the Hollywood sign. It was amazing! I thought i would be an early bird here but not at all. Parking was crazy. I got here around 10 am and luckily found parking but not in the lot of the observatory. Parked downhill where many others do. If you see any spot just take it!!! People are always coming and out though so just be patient and observant. The bathroom lines were not so bad in the morning but by afternoon it was crazy. So definitely come earlier to get parking and do your business before starting the hike. The hike starts near the parking lot. To the sign and back is 8 miles total!!!! I didn't realize this and didn't have anything but water on me but luckily had breakfast earlier. Anyway so it's about four miles one way to the top of the sign. Just follow the signs carefully and remember which way you go cuz on the way back it's easy to take up another trail. There are a bunch of diff trails that lead up to the sign. I guess my best advice is to stay to the right going there and keep to the left on the way back to the observatory. The signs are clearly marked though so just pass attention to them and follow them. Views were gorgeous. Worth the quad kicking trail. I was exhausted afterwards and the day after and I consider myself to be pretty active!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/girlwhotraveled
50,"Amazing views, great facilities",Visited on New Years day. Insanely busy but worth the effort of walking up the last bit. Awesome views of LA and interesting and informative observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nakatz
40,Beautiful setting and building. Worth a trip,Enjoyed going to the observatory. It's exhibits were standard planetarium fare. Wish we were able to go up to see the microscope observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gothamcitymom
40,Lit's of exploration,"Took my teen daughter and her friends during the early evening. They had a great time learning about the planets, stars, moons and more. The laser show was very interesting. Staying late at night to watch the stars is a must. Great Downtown views, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenavC4846PE
50,Fantastic views,Wonderful views and a busy place but worth the experience to see the Los Angeles buildings and a sign of Hollywood and the building from the inside to see the stars and space,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABUABBAS
50,We loved it so much...we went twice!,"I don't know how I didn't know about this place on previous visits to LA. My son is in to astronomy so this was a no brainer for us - we were both very excited about going. We went on our first day - we got there around 4:30 pm - drove all the way to the parking lot and got a spot as someone was leaving. A lot of people were just parking on the road and walking up, we at least wanted to give it a shot. We got some great photos of the Hollywood Sign. We walked around outside and checked out the views of different areas of Los Angeles. The lines on the patio where the sun sets at different times of the year are really interesting. We watched and it was very close. Inside the observatory there are neat exhibits including a tesla coil and at certain times they have demonstrations that show the electricity streaking through it. The huge pendulum when you walk in is really neat to watch, however I don't really understand completely what it represents. There are also halls downstairs that have exhibits - we spent a lot of time looking at both. We got in line for the telescope about 6:30 because we knew there would be a line- we were inside the dome that holds the telescope so we had a little place to sit and we were out of the cool air. We got to watch them position the telescope and get it ready for us to view. Once in there you can't take flash photos, there is a small ladder that you climb to look through the telescope through a view finder - you can't actually touch the telescope. We saw Saturn and it was incredible. We spend a little more time in the observatory - checked out the shop - got a beautiful Christmas ornament and as we were leaving there were 3 or 4 small telescopes set up on the lawn which we were able to look through. This was a great place to visit, we loved it - the views, the telescope, the exhibits were all outstanding.We spent our last day in CA in Los Angeles (we had gone to Anaheim and San Diego) so that night we talked hubby into going back to Griffith - which was neat because my son and I had been together - my husband had been with his cruise buddies (he was on a rock cruise part of the time we were there), but we hadn't been together - so it was great to get a family picture there with the Hollywood sign in the background. It was a Star Party night so there were telescopes set up all over the lawn. Once again we got in line early for the telescope - this time we saw the moon. Hubby enjoyed it despite himself and from the individual telescopes he was able to see Saturn. When he was there previously they only went to take photos and didn't take time to really experience the observatory. This will be at the top of my list from now on and will suggest it to anyone visiting the area. Did I mention it is a free attraction? It is free, however closed on Monday's. Drive up to the parking area, unless you just want to walk up - we got to park in the lot both visits, makes it easier when you leave. I will say you have to drive very carefully especially leaving because there are cars everywhere, people are walking in both directions. I was amazed at how far down cars were parked and it was not early and people were just heading up. Great way to end a great trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonya
50,Must See!,Give yourself at least 30 minutes to get through the line if wanting to see the telescope. The rest of the facility could easily take a couple hours. Its well worth the time! Parking and getting around the site can be a challenge if busy. The views can be spectacular! I only had a little over an hour to spend there and it was not nearly long enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/balloonr
50,Beautiful View of a Beautiful City,"The Griffith observatory provides people with a great view of the city of Los Angeles. Getting up to the observatory can be done by car, or for the fit people out there, a hike can be made to the top. I definitely recommend taking a look at the view as it doesn't take to much time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomt71
30,Nice for a short visit,Went here on December 31. It was a rainy day and parking was at a premium. The building was very crowded. The planetarium show was very nice and worth the ticket price. A lot of the displays required sunshine so they could not be used in the rain. You can go through everything in less than two hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg1502
50,Amazing View,"Amazing view of the Valley. We went at night and you can see Los Angeles for miles in every direction. They have 3 large telescopes on the lawn pointed at something interesting with a guide to explain what your looking at. Inside the observatory is a wealth of information about the history, composition and anything known about astrology. They even have a Tesla coil they fire off at diffrent times. There is also a planetarium but it was sold out at the time. We went on 12/29 and it was packed, but they had shuttles to and from the lower parking areas. You can walk up but it's steep. The cost for the observatory and parking are free. There is a restaurant, planetarium and gift shop so bring some cash if you'd like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayaker1photographer
50,Gorgeous Views,We toured the grounds with hoards of tourists after securing a coveted space in the parking lots. The views were absolutely amazing at night. The inside exhibits were so interesting. We also got $7 tickets to the planetarium show (30 minutes) and felt that was completely worth it. A true highlight of our week-long trip to Los Angeles. Don't miss this FREE attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommylowe
40,Always a great view of the wider LA area. Mountains to Ocean.,"This is a classic trip that is always wonderful. Don't get worried about the amount of people driving up the hill. There are always the same amount of people leaving, So even if it says car park full continue on and you will be amazed by the amount of free car parking open. Even with the hordes of people you will have a great view as there are many terrace levels. Great view of the Hollywood sign as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globewalker13
50,Excellant attraction for adults and kids,"Griffith is a great place to visit. Kids and adults will enjoy the whole thing. There are a lot of talks about the observatory during your visit. Also a beautiful view of the city around. Telescopes outside show amazing space views after dark. There is a cafeteria on site, as well as a gift shop. Several shows going on, and friendly, helpful staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lllly2015
50,"Beautiful views, especially at night","An easy drive from downtown LA but parking can be challenging. Expect to walk once you arrive. The views are gorgeous, especially at night. Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702dougt
50,Free entry & great views,"I feel as though a trip to Los Angeles is incomplete without a visit to the Observatory. The views from the top alone are worth the journey up.You can get a real good shot of the iconic Hollywood sign from up there and it's a cool place to chill.There is no charge for parking so you can spend as long as you wish.There is no entry fee to access the Observatory and learn a bit about our solar system. If you wish to enjoy the planetarium then there is a fee to do so. Do make time to climb up to the roof and enjoy the views of Los Angeles from up there. It gets super hot, so don't forget to bring water. The Observatory has a cafe so if you fancy a bite to eat then you will be well catered for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beadsbb
20,"Nice Observatory and Good Walking Area, But Not Accommodating to Those With Physical Limitations","I was from out of state visiting my brother and he took me with his two small children. The observatory is nice, the exhibits fine, although limited, but considering it was free I really cannot complain. There was something for both the young and not so young. The view of the surrounding area is beautiful. My major warning is that this place cannot really accommodate the large number of visitors it gets. We inched our car to the small parking lot outside the observatory (already full though we arrived shortly after opening) where my brother left his two small children (one in a stroller) and me (I needed a cane for assistance) while he drove back down to find an off the road parking spot about a 1/2 mile away (trail walk back). While there technically are elevators in the place, they are not easy to find or get to and the volunteers are not very helpful. Leaving was much worse. My brother left us at the designated drop off/pickup point, planning to be back in about 20 minutes. That stretched into over 60 minutes because the guards at the bottom would not let him come back up because there was no parking at the observatory. That did not stop them allowing people up in the morning and even when my brother mentioned that his two small children and his mobility-challenged sister were waiting at the top in the ""pick up"" area; they made him wait there for over 30 minutes. It was getting late and the temperature was starting to drop so needless to say we were not happy visitors and there was no way I could manage a toddler in a stroller, a 5 year old and a cane to walk down the trail. So if you go, make sure everyone is physically able to walk long distances as you have no idea how far you may need to walk once parked. For a government owned (city of LA) facility, I was appalled by the lack of regard to the Americans with Disabilities Act which I had to take into account when giving my rating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkLaurel
40,Nice view,The view is nice and you see allot of LA. I have not found much to see inside the building itself.I was very disappointed to find out the is no way to drive to Hollywood sign only walk..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Falconi66
50,"Newly renovated, great shows","Came with my 6 and 13 yo during the Winter break. Bring jackets along with you it would be cold when you walk back to the car and your car might be a mile away since it could be packed during holidays.Find out when the shows will be on sale, the first time you enter the door because it's hard to stand in a long line with nagging kids. Staffs were helpful.Lines to the bathrooms were always long, use the bathroom in the cafetaria downstairs. There were no line at all.The shows and exhibit were great, informative and entertaining. Hollywood sign can be seen from here. It's also a great spot to see the sunset and LA city skyline/light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akewan
50,Rainy day...,It was a rainy day so we couldn't see anything....But still a neat drive up and an interesting and informative observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816ne
50,Wonderful visit and fantastic views,We went on a cloudy day but the views were still amazing. My 13 and 15 year old really enjoyed the exhibits which was a pleasant surprise. It was very crowded on a Saturday but most people were outside. Parking can be a big chore if the observatory parking is full. I worked off my lunch hiking up but the views were great. Beautiful architecture...loved it. And it is free!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MemCer
40,Great view,"We deliberately visited on Monday when the observatory was closed so that we could get a decent parking space. The view is beautiful, and there were a surprising number of people there anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazkey
50,Beautiful park with lots of trails.,"Great place to visit for people of all ages. We went to the park, but did not enter the observatory. Parking was a nightmare, but it was Christmas week and people are off. There is no charge to park or to enter. We were exceptionally lucky as there had been rain prior, so everything was green. There were clear views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. I would recommend a stop here for everyone, even if you do not hike the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaeddie
50,An amazing view of the Hollywoood hills and beyond,"Admission is free and the view is priceless. Most definitely a must see, especially on a warm and sunny day. You can see for miles from this hilltop. Either walk up to the summit or drive like we did and you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nthnlites
50,Fun in town,"Very nice and very accommodating employees , love watching the stars thru different telescope and it's really nice to experience how this telescope works, some of them small some are huge for free. We really have fun. I love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarlonT
40,nice view,"nice to go walking will be best if they have better signs for the paths going up, and get more garbages and chairs during the paths, once up is just cool to see the view of LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bachues
50,A Great Panoramic view,"We visited the observatory around 8-9 pm, and the view was completely magical! It is a must visit place, you can see the entire city, and if lights make a difference, visit it in a clear night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466ahmedj
50,A place you would remember,"Observatory was not too above from your parking, so we hiked with my 5 year old son. However you can drive. Nice place to enjoy your time together. Although the observatory was closed the area itself was amazing, with spectacular view if LA, Hollywood sign, from above. If you want you can hike even more to enjoy more, after reaching the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdmushfiqula
40,Very cool place but plan accordingly!,"While on vacation in LA, we decided to go here in the afternoon. Got to the entry of the park about 4 o'clock, and the parking was crazy. First, they routed us up the wrong direction and then we had to turn around and enter from another entrance. It took awhile to get near The Observatory, and even when we did, parking was crazy. I don't know if there are better times to go, but earlier would certainly be better. Taking one point off because of the horrible parking situation. That being said, the place was really neat and had good information. We did not stay long enough to see a show in the planetarium although I would have liked to have done so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebs0303
50,Beautiful place to visit.,"Very nice and free place to visit. You get a wonderful view of the city, and you can see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snowyalberta
50,Great place for kids and adults,"We really enjoyed our visit, especially Let's Make a Comet show. It was not just about a comet, but more about a life in the Universe. Sarah and Jared did a great job. The movie theater is amazing. Exhibits are interesting, especially Foucault Pendulum. There is a great view from the roof. The parking lot at the top is small, we had to park far away on the road and then walk uphill. Not a big deal. Also it was pretty busy, probably because of school break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inna_lamesa
50,Great view of LA,"A must see when you're in LA. Best times to go are - sunset, or when its dark (when all the lights of the city are up). Good view of the city and the Hollywood sign. It's has a nice little museum about the planets. Good place to have a walk/hike/run. We took an uber to get there. It has no reception when you're up there. So, make use of the wifi if you choose to get an uber to get back to the city area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyn209
50,Great Experience.. Superb Views..,"Have been to this exhibit multiple times.. very educative for kids.. lot of good information... The views are spectacular.. Hollywood Sign, Downtown and a very good of Los Angeles overall.. This is also a very good hiking spot..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vriyers
40,Very busy,Very interesting place to visit however we went there in early December and people were parking over 1 mile away which left them with quite an uphill walk. We were lucky enough to get a parking bay at he top which saved us the walk. The views are very good and the observatory is excellent just be aware that you might have a long uphill walk to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveT8309
50,"Great view, Great exhibits, almost no parking.","There is a lot to do, many exhibits, look for the guides and ask them about the exhibits. they will be happy to answer.We also saw the movie in the planetarium which was fun.The lines to the telescope were very long so we skipped them.Almost no parking , you have to park on the way up.Pay attention, if you park in the opposite direction or if you are not straight you will get a ticket.It took us one hour up the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179eranr
50,The best see of LA,I went there some days ago and I have to say that it's one of the best Los Angeles attractions!You can reach it by car (I don't recommend) or by bus doing 10 minutes of queue.When we arrived there we saw a fantastic skyline of the city in on one side and from the other side you can see the famous Hollywood sign.It's also beautiful the museum and near it there is a little restaurant where you can eat a lot of things!Recommended for families,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgearmeni
40,Amazing view of the LA cityscape at night,"Was in LA for work, when one evening after the sessions, we all decided to head to the Griffith observatory. It was a quick short ride there. Loved the exhibits, wish I had had more time to spend and absorb everything. Was disappointed that I couldn't get to peer through the telescope - the queue was very long. But the view of LA from there was simply amazing. One should come here just for the view of the LA cityscape. I unfortunately have only a pic taken on a mobile phone to share. I plan to have a more planned visit the next time I am in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLazyPhotographer
50,Fabulous! A must-see.,"The observatory itself is amazing. However, what the teens liked the most was the visit indoors could be as quick as they liked-- the views and hikes around the observatory were what they keep talking about. You can views LA from different vantage points and get some cool views of the Hollywood sign. A must-do for any visit to LA. If you plan to hike, bring waters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabK7441TX
40,LA city can be seen from this nice place,It is a must see attraction. Make sure to bring with you the sports uniform and prepare to run or walk all the way to near Hollywood sign. the view from up is mesmerizing. you can walk downstairs in nature or climb upstairs. I did not go in the observatory but spent most of the time outside it. recommended location to take photos with Hollywood sign behind you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohamadm246
40,What a view!,"It's certainly worth the drive and battling past the traffic if you know someone local who can drive you; the view from the Griffith Observatory is fantastic, but the building itself is beautiful. A testament to art deco architecture, it captures the spirit of the time it was built in, standing alone on the edge of a hill overlooking L.A.A great spot for photos if it floats your boat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ianandtiff
50,The best views of L.A. at sunset!,"We parked in the lower parking lot and hiked up the trails to the observatory, which was fun for my entire family. The views of the City at sunset and at night are worth the hike. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5969WMjimmyb

30,We went for the views,"What a location! On a good day, it has fabulous views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA. The place was crawling with tourists at 10:00 AM, but it doesn't open until noon. That seemed strange. Gotta love the door. That made us chuckle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunmich2
50,Fantastic views,"This is such a great observatory hidden on the hills of LA. You can see the Hollywood sign from here and there's plenty to do in the observatory itself. Only issue is when we arrived on the Veteran's day holiday, the place was packed and we had to park about 1km downhill and walk up the path by the side of the cliff which was quite dangerous with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itishere
50,A sky full of diamonds,Come up on clear night bring a picnic and be prepared for the best of of L.A.

40,Fantastic views of LA from Observatory plus great walks,"They also do 30 minute films throughout the day, plus exhibitions of interest to all ages. Good for kids. Parking can be very difficult as its busy in the hols at xmas.

And its free entry here, so a bargain treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrgaryw
50,Great view of the city,I visited the observatory in December 2016 around Christmas time. It was very crowded despite that fact. The indoor area offers a lot of information and a live presentation about electricity which may be pretty good for children. The view from the top was my favorite part. There isn't enough parking lot space however as we had to hike quite a bit to the top for this adventure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kookie2293

40,Educational,"The Observatory boasts of different things one can learn about the planets. I thoroughly enjoyed finding out my weight had I been in another planet. Hahaha!Since it was a summer, the place was brimming with people and parking space was quite a challenge. We were lucky though to find a spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nsbyap
50,Breathtaking views,If there's anything you do while visiting Hollywood don't forget to go to the Griffith Observatory. I can't explain to you the beauty in words. You do need to go here at night to see for yourself. If you are driving be patient because parking stalls are hard to find. There are attendance up there that help but you'll likely have to park on the side of the road and walk up a bit. I will never forget this place for as long as I live. It's etched in my heart for life,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barendinas

40,Had a good whole day at the observatory,"We did book for one of the Planetarium show which was for about 20mins.

40,To catch a view,"I was born and raised in So Cal and have visited the observatory many, many times. It is for sure one of LA's treasures. One a clear day or night you can catch the perfect view of the LA basin. It's a magnificent view indeed. The only downside, parking can be an issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNSmith
40,Wow experience.,Awesome views and wonderful informative attractions. Would really recommend a visit. Grounds are well maintained and clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kobus43
50,Great view over Los Angeles!,"After entering the Griffith Park and climbing up the hills we reached the goal, the great view over the city and the Hollywood sign. Super location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaHopp52Mia
40,Amazing Telescope,"It is amazing how such basic concepts of planets and stars are made amazing through very interactive displays. In addition, the telescope showing the moon is a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilAudah
40,Sunset,"Went to see the sunset but got so much more, the view we incredible, the Observatory was amazing and well worth the look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savannahaustralia
50,A must see,"This place a must see and be, by far the best place to see to see the city from the best view. The trails are incredibly wonderful to go hiking and exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hectorsobe
50,Wonderful views,"Lovely views of the Hollywood sign, the city, hillside and sunset. Unfortunately we couldn't catch the night view. The science displays in the observatory were interesting but we didn't catch any show. The mobile coverage is not too good so you should arrange for transport. We traveled by Uber and managed to catch Uber back. We didn't consider public transport due to time constraints and although there were taxis arriving in the evening, it would have been expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vitieddie
40,Stunning Sunset,"This is where I took my favorite LA photos! It has the best sunset view. Also, you can see the whole city and Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunprasomsri
50,For the love of Science,"My trip here was over a year ago... i just chose July 2016 but my actual visit was July 2015. It was very educational. It is a good place to be with children. You will learn a lot about space, earth, stones , stars and other planets. It is best to visit here late afternoon towards evening so you can watch through the microscope, which I wasn't able to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaquinne
50,Beautiful view of the city lights!!!,"We decide to take a little trip up to Griffith Observatory at night. The place was packed and we had to park about a 1/2 mile away! The walk was worth it though as we saw some fantastic views of the city lights and enjoyed a great family time! We thought about the observatory, but there was a long line!!! Bring a flashlight along if you plan on going at night like we did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
50,Great Views and Hikes,I would head up there early to avoid the crowds...probably around 9 or 9:30 that helped us with parking b/c anytime after 10am the crowds start coming and parking becomes a pain. Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign. There are several hiking paths and lookout points so you can get several different views and most should have no problem with the hiking trails. There are some trails that tail off and are more steep. They also have decent public restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieB1026
50,Best view...,... up high and onto the city. Everything can be seen and much more is within the museum/exhibition. It is a must go for pictures of the city and the Hollywood sign (the latter doesn't work great at sunset though). Everything is free so the parking lot seems to be full always.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamklee
30,What a view from the Observatory if the clouds were not in the way,"Well worth the time to come explore the Griffith Observatory and a good view of the Hollywood sign.You can spend a few hours exploring the Observatory and all it has to offer. Parking can be tricky if it is a nice weekend day so plan according. If you are into hiking, there are many trails that lead from/to the Observatory and all around Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavisS_13
50,Stunning view of LA and Hollywood sign,"A nice observatory for the astronomy enthusiast as well as those who want a panoramic view of LA and the famous Hollywood sign. We watched a show in the planetarium which was entertaining and informative. There are plenty of other exhibits around the observatory which are interesting for all ages. Parking is limited and if you arrive late, you may have to park along the slope, far from the observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824deveshd
50,Great views!,It was a great way to see the Hollywood sign! There were lovely views of Las Angeles and would be wonderful at sunset!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiarnaeg
50,Superb and unparalleled experience !!,I took almost hundreds of pictures of downtown LA and signature HOLLYWOOD board from the hill top. The free wifi provide by Toyota helped for the navigation and sharing pictures with family members.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EHApu
50,Lovely views,"Great place, great views to the Hollywood sign, there are also some lovely hikes. Nice relaxing morning. The observatory itself has lots of information for science/astronomy enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElenaPablo
50,Stunning view over LA,"The view you get to experience over LA and the Hollywood sign is just stunning. Go shortly before sunset, it's the best in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sebscha87
50,Really fun place for space lovers,"I love going here, for the view and for the chance to see planets with my own eyes through telescopes. Make sure to check the times of the shows they have their before because if you are even a minute late they won't let you in. Also, don't get there right before closing because you won't get a chance to look through the large telescopes or see any of the cool shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LianaE_13
40,Beautiful View,Although we didn't get in here we walked around for a beautiful view of the City. It is really nice. You can go on amazing hikes from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871Pieter
40,Best time is night time,Hard to find parking... public restroom is always busy...make sure bring warm clothing...los Angeles night is cold...but worth it see nice view of los Angeles...and Hollywood sign.....to see Hollywood sign go before 3:45pm....to see sunset 5pm...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samlS8387KP
40,No children under 5 in the planetsrium,"If you go at night, like we did, hoping to see some beautiful sites, beware that children under five cannot go into the planetarium. They can go the first show of the day, though. We had the misfortune of going on a rainy, foggy night. I would r dickens going in the day, even for those without children, as there are sun tools that are obviously unusable at night. The bottom levels were interesting and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reingding13
50,Awesome views,"This is a must see when in LASPECTACULAR VIEWS.I haven't been into the observatory but just to see the view, is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golflover26
50,So fun! Good hiking!,Great view of the Hollywood sign! Go at sunset to get the BEST view of the city. Plenty of parking and great hiking! It was very safe there and they even had bathrooms that weren't to bad. This is something you must do while in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teginm
20,An Observatory observation,"We had heard a lot about the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.The top two things about the observatory.1. The building itself is an amazing structure. If you can appreciate architecture you will delight in spending a fair a mount of time being attentive to the detail and beauty on the design.2. If you can arrange your visit closer to the evening, the sunset and eventual city views at night are absolutely amazing.Other than that the exhibits are rather simplistic and require a lot of reading, which is fine but not particularly enjoyable for kids.The planetarium is okay, nice visuals but the narrative is a little ""one with the universe"" ""spacey"" for me.One thing to take into consideration is parking. With the parking lot at capacity cars were parked way down the road leading up to the observatory and it's an uphill trek. We continued on up and managed to find a parking space in the main lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicroCleanse
50,Lovely surprise,"Great location overlooking Hollywood.Terrific place to just wander around and explore,lots to see and do.Kept the kids and ourselves amused for a few hours with fascinating displays of the universe and space history,and it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR841
30,Smog killed the view,Was eager to visit the observatory but most admit the smog in LA killed the view. I was able to view the Hollywood sign but couldn't see downtown due to the smog . Would recommend but check smog levels before visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/papason100
50,Brilliant views of Hollywood sign,"We were lucky and had a clear day which gave us great views of the Hollywood sign, the observatory was fascinating too, would recommend a visit here by everyone as long as the weather is clear",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lis_Fee
50,A must see,Definitely a must. Wished we had more time and stayed till 7pm when the telescope is opened to the public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VooVoo26
50,Worth a visit,"We drove here after visiting Universal studios, which is a short drive away. We parked down the hill on a side street and walked up during the sunset, with amazing views. Then we spent a couple of hours walking around the observatory and viewing the sky through the telescopes. Beautiful building and grounds with faultless view of city and Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaB_107
50,"One of my favorite - great views, great vibe","The observatory is hands down one of my favorite LA spots. Go there for: the VIEW!, star parties (twinkly lights in sky, not Hollywood), the hiking, the special events, the Planet...arium, the super moon. But be advised to either use the free shuttles or get there early - parking is difficult at this popular place. Star parties are cool - enthusiasts bring telescopes for anyone to look through - get your Mars on baby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moveloveshare
50,Must See Views,You will get some of the best views of LA from here. Also great closeup views of the Hollywood sign. If you are interested at all about outer space the observatory is a great experience. There is a lot to be learned and would be great for kids. There are a few short hikes that start at the observatory and lead to even greater views. I would highly recommend hiking if you have an extra hour or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3817QUdaniels
40,Easy Access & Great View Of The Hollywood Sign,"This is indeed the best place to view the Hollywood sign. You can simply drive up here and avoid the hike, even though I highly recommend the walk. The entire area shouldn't take you more than an hour to walk around. There are plenty of washrooms outside the actual observatory.I recommend coming here early in the morning as it's very peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gesogeso
50,Really glad I came; a must-see,"The observatory has a wonderful small museum, a planetarium, and spectacular views. There is also a small cafeteria. It is hard to find parking -be warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1685YOelizabethb
50,Night view,We arrived at 9.30pm but people still around. Kids spotted the tunnel from a Nancy Drew movie.Great view of the city lights. Beautiful building that you cannot help looking at. Would like to go back and see it in the daytime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrabO4037VK
40,Beautiful views,"We visited on an extremely busy Saturday night which unfortunately really did impact on our enjoyment of the observatory. It took a very long time just to get up to the observatory and then due to the number of people there, we just couldn't enjoy the observatory as much as we had hoped, with the shows booked out and extensive wait times to use the telescopes. However, the views are spectacular and the exhibits are very interesting. We would love to visit again on a quieter evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelfromOz
50,Great view,"We visited the observatory late in the morning and we were really fascinated. The location is ideal, there is a free entrance, and the experience is both educational and fun. If you arrive late at night you also have the opportunity to use the telescope situated within the observatory. Totally recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilGrec0
50,Amazing,"Something for everyone at Griffith. The observatory, great views, great hiking for all levels. Check the schedule when you are in town to see if they are having a amateur astronomers night, when a dozen or more people set up their telescopes on the lawn (and share the view) and they open up the observatory's telescope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestCoastRestless
50,Wow!,"Such a nice scenery and view! Takes your breath away on the spot!The inside tour is so eye opening and interesting, you also have a guide explaining and telling you the story while the stars and planets are showing on a sky-like screen above you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarahAH
50,A breath of fresh air from the hustle & bustle of Los Angeles,This place is pure peace and quiet. I lived in Los Angeles for two years a few years ago and we would drive up to the Observatory at random times to picnic and look at the lights of the city in the evening before they close.It is very popular with not only tourists but the locals as well. So parking often times can be aggravating to say the least. To get in and walk the grounds is completely free. There are some things that do cost money I believe. The snack shop and gift shop is a must see as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5836ZJbrianm
50,Loved it All,I first went to the park as a sixth grader and was amazed. I later went to the laserium show many times over the years I still go as I am such a big astronomy buff. It's a great adventure for young and old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2345YBlynnc
50,Great Views & Good Conversation,"We went for a total of two hours. Incredible views of the city, gorgeous at sunset. Looking at all of the pieces inside sparked a lot of good conversation and there were quite a few fun interactive pieces. Free entry and free parking if you can find a spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLSoulliere
50,Brilliant at day and at night,"Very busy at night so be prepared to walk a bit, and can be quite cool. View of city lights was spectacular as was the star / universe movie thing. Day was awesome especially the 40 minute hike down the front of the mountain to the front entrance (you can also drive if you don't want to hike). Good view of Hollywood sign during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HockeyMan2048
50,Great!,We came here to explore and go on the hike to the Hollywood sign. Amazing views if your a tourist wanting a better look at the sign! Expect quite a hike to get close to the sign though but well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolekizia
10,No parking,We drove about an hour and a half in traffic only to get there and find that there was no parking available. Our only option was to park halfway down the mountain and spend about an hour walking uphill to the observatory. Very unfortunate that such a cool place is so hard to get to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennyb82
10,Boring nothing is change since 1940,All tourists. It's kind of crowded and the space exhibit is nothing to write home about. You can't look out of the telescopeBorE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerrickM576
40,Cool place,"Cool place to see, had great views and some great walking tracks to get closer to the hollywood sign!Tip: dash bus can drop off and pick up from observatory for 50c but only on weekends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/553callumc
50,Most stunning views of LA,"Officially my favourite place in the world. We arrived just in time for a spellbinding sunset in the distance, I highly recommend this time of day to get the best daylight and night time views.If hiking, the walk is very steep and took us approx an hour from Franklin Avenue. There are toilets halfway through the journey and a cafe too. There is parking at the bottom of the hill however not sure if this is restricted.We didn't go in the Observatory itself but the planetarium was open and we had just missed the last show. It was worth it got the sunset. WiFi was also available to post those amazing photos to social media in real time!It wasn't too busy but expect it is busier during the day. The Hollywood sign is visible and is probably the closest you can get to it legally.The views of Downtown are unforgettable. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexxcx
50,Do it at Sunset!!,"This property is all about the views. The inside observatory has some small exhibits which are really nice and a very cool theater option. Geeks and nerds will enjoy ;). However this property has the most amazing views all around it. This includes downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign, and the surrounding hills. There is plenty of space for kids to run around. I visited and time this for a sunset visit and it was truly amazing. I happened to visit in December and it was quite chilly in the evening so plan for temperature changes at this elevation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherhZ6474VL
50,What a beautiful place,This park is a must go to .Free parking lovely walks and beautiful views. The Observatory is a beautiful building and is free. Also you get a good view of the Hollywood sign and LA. Best time was to watch the sun set amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaR27
40,Good view,"This place is more than a kilometer above sea level, hence a good view of downtown LA. The Hollywood sign is clearly visible from this place. If you want to get a parking slot easily, just pull over immediately the moment you spot one on the roadside and just walk several meters uphill. Finding a parking slot near the observatory is not easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanRocqueRaltique
50,One of the best views for the sunset in LA,"Our local friend took us to see the Hollywood sign from there, however the sunset and the view of LA was much more impressive in the end. Please excuse the bad picture quality as it was taken with a mobile phone.Just make sure you get there early enough, parking was super scarce.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/customboard
50,Great View - Worth the line!,"It took a while to get up there, insane traffic, but it was so worth it! Gorgeous view, a beautiful museum inside and out. We could see LA and Hollywood sign from up there and enjoyed an amazing sunset! A must see when coming to Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissinha_canada
50,Griffith ovservatory,Went at night time much easier to get a car park than during the day and also it was wonderful looking over LA in the evening The cafe was closed at the time for an upgrade so couldn't get food or a drink as it was quite cold standing out doors at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/438michele
50,Great place,"Griffith observatory is amazing. There are incredible trails to hike, and you can spend hours touring through the observatory. Sitting out on the patio at the cafe you have a spectacular view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLWil18
50,This place is historic and magical at same time! Vistas are fantastic!,"We visited for the views of city and iconic building filmed in so movies. Love all options you have here, tour the building, take pictures of balcony of the city, hike around, have lunch or just chill. Such a gem in middle of large city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
40,Wonderful views overlooking LA,"We were on a tight schedule so didn't get to explore the inside of the observatory as much as we would have liked, however the visit was worth it just for the wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellisec2016
40,Avoid Sundays and Holidays,"If you happen to visit on a Sunday , be warned that you will have to park your car at a considerable distance from the observatory and walk down. It is free attraction probably more interesting if you have kids in your group. Would have been better to visit in the night to view the sky through their big public telescope. Also on Sundays it would be very difficult to catch the shows you want in the PlanetariumSince this is also on top of a hill, you do get a good view of Hollywood sign and of LA. But if it is only views that matter, Getty Center would be a better choice.Miss it if you do not have children in your group or if you are not too much interested in astronomy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UNNIMAYA
50,More than just an observatory,Many hiking trails around it. Awesome views of Los Angeles. Even the free areas of the Observatory are very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
50,It's free but worth more.,"I didn't plan on a visit to the Observatory, but was pleasantly surprised when I did. For anyone with even a mild interest in astronomy and the stars, it provides a wealth of information as well as staff keen to impart their knowledge. It's also an excellent vantage point for views across the city to the ocean and selfie spot for the Hollywood Sign. If your into hiking, a vast network of trails are accessible via the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyH247
50,Great Scenery and Astronomy knowledge provided,"No entrance fee required. Also, you can touch rocks that's from Mars and Moon in the Observatory. Also, You could take pictures Hollywood sign here. Great scenery is easily accessed here and worth spending whole evening here.Definitely a must go spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaculoVirus
50,One of my all time favorite places to visit,"I love the observatory! Once a month, they have the amateur planetary groups out there with their telescopes and you can look through them and see various planets and stars. Also, they have short interesting movies about our solar system or planet that is fun to go to. Get there after dark but before closing to see the planets through the huge telescopes on the roof - it's quite exciting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaLosAngeles
50,Amazing,It is a really impresive place!!! You can watch all LA landscape when the hollywood sign is in your behind. There is a space museum on downstairs. A rock which came from the Moon is shown and lots of information about the galaxy. But it was hard to find a park place for car on September!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tolgak754
50,"Amazing Building, Incredible Views, and it's FREE","My sister and I decided to head to Griffith Observatory because we'd heard it had a great view of the Hollywood sign. (And this seemed better than driving around in bad traffic searching for a good vantage point / disrespectfully hiking through yards.) We got so much more than we bargained for - a beautiful drive through Griffith Park as you head up the road to the Observatory, a chance to see a Tesla coil spark to life, a physical representation of the entire periodic table, a fascinating film about the history of the building itself, and a bust of James Dean in tribute to the scene from Rebel Without A Cause that takes place here. All this, and views so spectacular, you have to see them to believe them. We arrived about an hour before sunset so as to see the Hollywood sign and take pictures. (The sign isn't lit up at night.) We went through the observatory and looked at all the exhibits, and then went back out on the rooftop terraces in time to watch the sun sink into the water and the lights of the city start to come up. This place is a gem. Be prepared for the drive back down through Griffith Park to be a little more edge of your seat after dark (especially as people seem to stop and take pictures along the road, which is maybe not the best idea), but it is one hundred percent worth it to have this experience. The observatory also has a small cafe and a great gift shop full of space related items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schroederjt
50,Wish I had more time,"Great view over LA and the Hollywood sign.We only stayed for a short while, really wish had more time to plan to walk one of the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzanab20
50,Great to see the observatory in person,"Great views, very informative. Didn't realise the hills behind were used in the opening credits of MASH!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rudy24
40,Awesome LA Views,"Well worth the trip up the hill for the awesome views from the ocean to the mountains. The Observatory is a beautiful and iconic structure. Exhibits and Planetarium are a bit tired, but still very educational for budding astronomers. Parking can be difficult. Be careful - they like to ticket if you don't follow the rules.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55tomc
50,Must see!,If you can go when its open even better! It will be crowded if its during the holidays but it still is one of the best sites in Los Angeles! One a clear day which is most days great views!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22triciat
40,A must go stop if you are in Los Angeles,"The observatory is one of those nice locations in Los Angeles you don't want to miss. I brought here some friends from Europe, they loved it. The view is incredible (unfortunately also that one of the smog!)I strongly suggested it to everyone stopping by in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxBartoli
40,Worthy,Good spot to visit in LA. Have to hiking to get closer to hollywood sign. Boost your astronomy knowledge by the way! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjiny2016
50,Innovative!!!,"A very interesting and informative observatory from where it is easy to understand the universe and astronomy. From its height the spectacular and Holly Wood sign can be seen.The various diagrams showing the movement of seasons, day and night, the longitudes and latitudes really help the children to understand the planets and universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnjanaB_12

50,I Love this place,"This is one of my favorites places in LA, Very educational, very beautiful views including the hollywood sign ( one of the best places to take a good photo). I really recommend spent the whole afternoon there. Enjoy the museum and the planetarium first and Go outside to watch the sunset. I really like the cafeteria area to do that. After the sunset check out the rooftop to see the Moon or Saturn using the giant telescope. While you wait enjoy the amazing view of the lights of the city, including downtown !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanab65
50,very educational and interesting at same time. Worth exploring for sure!,Took family there for a day trip and spent about 4 hours. Very informative for adults but engaging for kids too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelyCharlotte
40,Wish we had longer,"We all loved the observatory. Free entry and only $7 for the planetarium. The views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA were amazing.The only things that stopped us giving it a five stars was that they only have 4 disabled car parking spaces and we had to wait over an hour for a place.The cafe is run by Wolfgang PUK and was very expensive. We purchased 2 prepacked sandwiches, 3 soft drinks, 2 packs of crisps and a cookie and it was $58.The only other issue was having one small lift that was used constantly by non disabled people making it very hard for those in wheelchairs and with prams.The staff were absolutely fantastic with us and went out of their way to get us in to the planetarium. 5 stars for the staff and the observatory itself",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karos1

50,Walk if you are a fan of hiking,"It is located at top of a mountain and you can get perfect clicks with ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign at the top of the mountain. The planetarium at the top of the mountain has got information about galaxies, asteroids etc..There are few shows in the theater which last for 20-30 min very attractive. 7USD per show.Take the red line to the subway station ""Sunset"" There you can get a shuttle to the top of the planetarium just USD 0.50. Make sure you have the change or TAP card with you. In-fact I walked to the top which was a hectic journey. Burned some calories. Must visit place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadeeraM
50,Stunning View,"This stunning place is only a few miles from Hollywood and is a must see! Views of the ocean, city and Hollywood Sign make for a spectacular visit.

The building is neoclassic architecture with exhibition about astronomy, at the first glance when you pass the gate , it's the vault of pendulum which is the amazing tool for telling time and there is exhibition about out earth and solar system on the basement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jajavalB
50,Holiday,This give you an amazing view over Los Angeles and you can see Hollywood sign as well. Free parking as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773markusp
40,Friday Evening Visit,We visited on Friday evening after Thanksgiving. It was extremely crowded. We parked in the shuttle lot and it was about 1/2 hour wait for a shuttle.We waited in line for viewing through the telescope.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/910KarenS910
50,Awesome Views and a Nice Museum,"The views from the observatory were awesome! The science museum had informative and fun exhibits. On top of that the admission is free. As other reviewers have pointed out - it is crowded. However, don't let that stop you from going because the lines (if any) move quickly and it's a must see if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamhiker
50,Beautiful!!!,Excellent remodel and re do. All is very well kept and clean. Beautiful views of LA and Hollywood Hills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/67lorit

40,So worth the trip at night,"My husband really wanted to come here at night, and I'm so glad that we did. There were 3 telescopes set up out front where you could glimpse different stars & planets (we saw Uranus & Vega that night) and the guides were very informative. Also amazing views of the city lights from above. Worth a visit, despite having to park far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllisonD931
50,Go on a clear day,The view is better than any sky scraper. You can see a hundred miles on a clear day. Snow on the distant peaks. A windy day might be less desirable as you are exposed to the sky. The observatory was closed on Monday...we should have checked ahead. I don't know of any transportation other than paid tours. Take an Uber or taxi ride for a few dollars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123nathans
50,Greatest view of California!,The actual place to go into was closed but the view at the top of the observatory is absolutely breathtaking! This was my first time visiting California and it wouldn't haven't been complete without making this stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Praskievicz
50,"Great view, crowded at sunset","Experiencing the sunset and the LA city lights from the Griffith Observatory was breathtaking. Parking was a pain though. Also, it's a no-fly zone for drones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sitie
50,Part of my visit,"My friend who visited America last year recommended it, I went first time for a night time shuttle ride with my hostel group, but wanted the daytime experience. Went there this morning, perfect weather and the views are incredible. I'm a huge fan of James Dean/Rebel Without a Cause, so it was awesome to see a place that was part of movie history, and Yes Man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickb9902
50,Beautiful Views,"Really enjoyed my visit to the Griffith Observatory. It offers nice views of LA and the Hollywood Sign. If you've got a few hours to spare, you can even hike to the sign from here if you wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsmyname
40,Such a nice view!,"Went there by surprise, not attending to go there... It has a great spirit and nice exhibitions besides the main purpose, as an observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WildtracksS
20,Very crowded - free admission,We went to view at sunset and it was jammed with other tourists doing the same. Would avoid at such peak times in the future. The outside of this 30's art deco building is the highlight of our visit there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB_Htown
50,Great views from outside and exiting displays and demonstration inside.,There is a lovely park surrounding the observatory and the views from the top deck are stunning. If you visit the inside you will be treated to several great experiences of watching the heavens. I recommend visiting this local gem and enjoy the wonderful world of astrology.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmetcalf54
50,One of the Best Places to Visit in LA- and it's FREE!,"The Observatory is always an awesome place to visit for 2 or 3 hours. You have a great view of the city and of the Hollywood sign. There are also many paths for hiking (if you're very adventurous, you can try to hike from here to the Hollywood sign!).The observatory itself is interactive, which is great for kids. There are also shows in their planetarium which are amazing! They're 30 minutes long and around $5 or so. There are lots of telescopes to peek through too. There's a cafeteria and bathrooms (indoors and outdoors). Make sure you wear good shoes because you will most likely have to park down the mountain a little bit, which will be anywhere from a 5-15 minute uphill walk. If you leave at night, be sure to have a light because there are no streetlights when you're walking down the mountain. I highly recommend the observatory-- it's just something you can't miss when visiting LA.Bonus fun fact-- the knife fight scene in 'Rebel Without a Cause' was filmed at the observatory, and there's a statue dedicated to James Dean outside to the left of the entrance (though the statue is a bit creepy looking...).I don't if anyone actually reads the reviews I write, so if this was helpful at all please give me a thumbs up. Thanks! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/861christinah
50,What a view!,"Treat yourself to a nice view and some informative science exhibits at the Griffith Observatory. My Fiancé and I went at night after a light rain, and wow at the view. The rain cleared the air and you could see for miles. A great stop, for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/654jonathanw
50,View of the Angels,"We visited the Observatory on Thanksgiving Thursday. While we were not able to enter, we were able to walk around the facility and were treated to amazing views of the City of Angels. Our only complaint (and this had nothing to do with the Observatory itself) was that the Hollywood sign was not lit :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graymail
50,Go for Sunset! Must see! Wonderful view over SF,"Go for Sunset, best view over SF, Hollywood sign visible as well. Parking at the top is a bit difficult, road side parking and walking is advised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7838DHpatricks
50,Worth to go there,"Parking lot by Griffith Observatory practically does not exist, because it is extremely small comparing to number of cisitors coming there daily. So be prepared to park your car along the street and walk up the hill. It will be probably the walk in the sun, so take a bottled water with you. But once you reach the top, the view is magnificent. Even if the layer of smog covers half of LA City, it is worth to see. Beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HateAllLogins
40,Incredible views of the city,"We only stopped here briefly on our trip on an evening, but the views over LA were incredible! I'd recommend coming at night to see the city lit up.Might be worth checking if the observatory is open if you'd like to go inside, as the day we visited, it was closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OopsGoose
50,Amazing View and Great Place to Spend Time,"This was my first go-to destination when I was in LA. Barring the long traffic queues, the place is located near the hollywood sign, which is clearly visible from here. The place welcomes you with a small telescope from which you can view planets. This is followed by an amazing museum, a show, and a giant telescope. It was unfortunate that the night was cloudy but the top view of Los Angeles at night made our day. A must visit while you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vipul20044
50,Angel's View,The outside balcony of Griffith Observatory offers the absolute best view of the entire Los Angeles basin. It is spectacular and can give you a sense of the layout of LA. Take a city map with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569claudef
50,Breathtaking!,"THE PLACE to appreciate L.A. in all its extension, with breathtaking views of the downtown skyline and the Hollywood sign; home for a rather impressive exposition about astronomy, geology and space sciences.It's also an Art-Deco architectural masterpiece. Decorated with frescoes and beautiful marble floors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roballn
50,Best view best value,"My second favorite attraction after Getty Museum , the view is astonishing, you can see the infinite LA and the Hollywood sign. Observatory is very interesting there is a Tesla experiment inside together with the story of astronomy. Suggested",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabioborsoi
50,Great Views!,I highly recommend coming here twice for both daytime and night time views and taking pictures. Great exhibits and I purchased two Space Pens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350vishalp
40,Amazing views,"Amazing views from the top of the observatory. On your way up tou do get a great view too of the city. It was a shame the actual observatory and gift shop was closed. You can get some epic photogrpahs of the city and of the Hillywood sign, also free wifi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NasimaA22
50,Beautiful scenery overlooking LA,For people that have never been here it is a must see! Breathtaking views of LA at a beautiful park. Great hiking in the vicinity of the Hollywood sign as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theohiopeifers
50,Fun with the stars,"What a beautiful sight it is at night!!!Last time I came up to the observatory was at night time. The sky is beautiful. Perfect destination for a date!We watched one of the films they were featuring. It was about 30 mins long or so? Very informative, and great experience. It was a small theater, and the showing was on the ceiling, made you feel like you we're looking at the sky.You can drive up or even hike your way up with a friend.Parking can get a but hectic sometimes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349jacquelines
50,Gorgeous view!,"The drive and/or walk to up Griffith Observatory is beautiful. Spectacular views day or night, but especially at night. There is a fabulous display of a collection of costume jewelry that has been used to make a mural like nothing you've ever seen before. The architecture of the observatory is interesting and there are several things to experience there, in addition to the scenic view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonstone1006
30,Great spot to watch the sunset,"The views are great, the exhibits seem to be nicely done too. They have a couple of different shows that sounded interesting at a cost, but general admission to the grounds and exhibits is Free.I highly recommend avoiding this place on a Saturday late afternoon/ eve as it was packed. There were lots of people making it hard to enjoy the exhibits and the various viewing decks. Parking was an absolute nightmare. They do however offer a shuttle that I wish I knew about in advance, that may have helped with the obnoxious traffic jam heading up to the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendya01
50,Great spot for date night,"My wife and I came here to check out the stars. It was a Saturday night and there were telescopes set outside for the public to view. It was awesome to see the moon, and other planets through the telescope. The observatory itself was great as well. We did not line up for the telescope on the top of the building however... the line stretched down the stairs. Also as a tip, do not be lazy. We drove up mid way and just pulled into a parking spot and walked up to the top. It took about 10 minutes to walk. You will be stuck in traffic for a while if you think you'll find parking on the top on a Saturday night. Also, this is supposedly one of the best spots to view the Hollywood sign, however as it was night time, we couldn't see it that well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kthxbb
40,Great Views of the City,"Well worth the walk up the access road if you can't park at the top. Views of LA are really good plus the view over to Hollywood is there, complete with the sign!The observatory is a free entry with lots to see and read.Was very busy on my Saturday visit but not crowded.You could always park further down the hill and make use if the trails that cross this whole area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jony644
50,Awesome views of the city,"Came to LA for a business trip and visited the Observatory with a small work group. The views of LA are outstanding! Several telescopes (2 for sure, maybe 3?) that I would have loved to see but lines were too long, and my group didnt want to wait.Would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarRaptor
50,A very interesting place with amazing views of LA,We had such an amazing time here. We visited just before sunset and it was stunning. The sky was moody with rain clouds and we even witnessed a rainbow. You get a great view of the Hollywood sign from here too. Definitely a great place to visit in LA. You don't get great signal up there to call a taxi/uber but they offer a shuttle service which takes you into West Hollywood. We got the shuttle to the last stop and caught an uber back to our hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IGetAround78
50,Beautiful place,"Has a beautiful view of LA and is a different program to do.I wasn't expecting nothing of this place, and I really enjoyed my time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nahr2014
50,Spectacular Views,"A definite must see if you have never been to Los Angeles. The Griffin Observatory offers spectacular views of the city, the sky, the moon and the stars (both in the sky and sauntering down Hollywood Boulevard). Family friendly. It's a great way to see some of what Los Angeles has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matth733
50,Best views at sunset,"Brilliant, must go at sunset! Parking free, but it's very busy so make sure you leave lots of time to park and not miss the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahhJ8096TW
50,Amazing but overcrowded,"Definitely worth visiting yet very crowdy place. We went there on Sunday and it took us a lot of time to reach the destination & find parking spot. If you're unlucky you may have to climb a lot from your car. Remember that if it's cloudy, some attractions don't work (they need light).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaGPL
40,Amazing views,Visited in Veterans Day and the traffic was awful. Had to walk quite a long way to get to the observatory. The views are simply breathtaking. The trails looked like a lot of fun. The museum had a lot of interesting artifacts and information including a giant meteor. I will definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivsmom
40,Went for a sunset/moonrise and was treated with a great view!,"Drove up on the night of the super moon and parking was at a premium! Beautiful views and very interesting site. Also stopped by one morning when it was less busy and enjoyed it even more. I can understand why this is a popular spot with the programs offered, the views and of course the night sky watching. Oh yeah, there is the Hollywood sign to be seen also. I would put it on the must do list in the L.A. area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015
50,Stunning views,"We only stopped here on bus tour to take photos, was lovely absolutely stunning views .i would probably go back and spend some more time there without your as you could easily spend good few hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizzybobs75
50,Amazing,"I've been wanting to come here for ages but haven't had time on previous trips to LA. Most of the Observatory is free and the views over LA are incredible. I'd recommend bringing your own food and drink though as the wrap and small root beer I had there were almost $12 and the wrap wasn't that nice! Really worth taking the time to visit, I wish I'd had more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welshanna1
50,amazing,I loved it. I visited the planetarium and it was really educational and fun. they also had a discount for students which was a great deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/398yasmini
50,great views of los angeles,"This is a must do on your list. You do not need a tour guide with this. It is a short drive up the mountain and you will be able to see the Hollywood sign, city of los angeles and as far as the ocean. I highly recommend to visit this place and it is free.You will have to park along the side of the road before the observatory and walk a little but worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckS780
50,Breathtaking,"Got to see it at sunset with amazing views from the hilltop. Planetarium shows were wonderful, as was getting to look at the moon through one of the telescopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattthebruinsfan
50,Amazing views,Although the observatory was free you did have to pay to visit the planetarium. It was well worth it though. The lady who did the commentary made it really interesting for old and young alike. Her enthusiasm was catching and everyone seemed happy. Outside the observatory you have a good view of the Hollywood sign and the whole of Los Angeles. We were worried before we went about parking but had no problem at all in September on a Wednesday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hotelfiends
50,Stunning... so much better than we expected,I really wish that we would have arrived earlier! We arrived at the end of sunset so it was already dark. The views of the city were absolutely amazing. We had the pleasure of walking in eight as the Tesla was being used... entertaining and informative. We only had time for a quick walk through. We wanted to look through the big scope but the line was too busy and it was pretty late. I suggest at least 2 hours to view everything. Tip - do not take a cab down. Figure out how to get an Uber. If you do take a cab... ask them to drop you off at the bottom of the hill. This was the most expensive ride I had my who trip and we didn't go very far at all!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarileesTravels
50,"Random visit to watch ""Full Moon""","If you have never been to Griffith Park Observatory, you need to visit at least once. A truly amazing way to explore the treasures in our galaxies, and enjoy our own place in it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5156HBdavida

50,Superb views,Other than the useless signage which is common to all American parks it was well worth the trip.Fantastic vistas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmH3803EM
50,Great experience.,I was looking for a view that an 80s/90s TV series ended each episode with. My cousin identified it as the Griffith. Great view. We went to a planetarium show. The woman doing the live narration should get an award for her presentation!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YearRounder04609
50,Amazing location,This is an awesum place to visit. The views across LA were amazing. Looked great once darkness fell too. Inside the observatory was lovelyninside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodwormenterprise
40,great view,I have been here in the past but every time I go back parking seems to get harder to find!! The view is great and you can see all of LA. I have not been there at night time for over 10 years so can't say how it looks but day time is great just make sure to don't take a big car as parking to super hard to find and might take 30-45 mins to find one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSFLY
40,"Awesome views, especially the sunset","My wife, son (11) and I landed up at the observatory around 4:30pm on a Wednesday in November. Couldn't find a parking spot at the top, so we simply headed back down and found a spot on the access road (no issue - we could use the extra exercise). Once at the top, we watched the sunset from the top of the observatory and then toured the science displays inside. It was a cool place to see when you have a couple of hours to kill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127davism
50,A really worth while place to visit,"This is a great location for both general sight -seeing (you can see the 'Hollywood' sign in the hills, or walk one of the trials) and actually learning about star gazing.Try to get to go to one of the shows inside the observatory, well worth the cost",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanteandDougie

50,Griffith = Great views!,"I think this is one of the best places to see Los Angeles from! The Hollywood sign is close enough that you can take photos of it without hiking out to see it. I visited just before sunset and caught the last of the light on the horizon. The city lights look amazing from the Observatory! Bringing a camera/phone with you is a must!The exhibitions are interesting and informative, and there is a telescope on the roof which allows for some star gazing (there will definitely be a queue though!).The only thing I would say is that parking is very limited and it took a while to find a parking spot on the road leading up to the GO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItTastesLikeFeet
40,Best vantage point to see LA,"Best vantage point to see this expansive city. Free entrance. If the line is too long at the telescope, skip it. You won't miss anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmmedel

30,Great view,"Great view of the Hollywood sign and LA, interesting exhibits inside.Parking seemed a little limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meryll83
50,Loved the view,The Griffith is a great place to take pictures of the Hollywood sign and of the city. The view is amazing. The parking isn't so great you can either hope there's parking on the top or park on the side of the road on the way up to the Griffith observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzie200
50,"Enjoyable visit, but plan ahead.","We visited the observatory on a Wednesday in September and had an enjoyable time. As a disabled driver, I was directed to a space near the building and only a short distance away. I was particularly impressed with the planetarium and the small entry fee. The ground were impressive and of course we photographed the holywood sign. it was getting busy when we left but was still manageable. I would not visit here at the weekend or fixed holiday days however and can appreciate how difficult parking would be on these days. Personally, we enjoyed the visit and were treated well and with respect by the staff. Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weemango
50,Amazing free attraction on a Sunday,"We took an Uber up from Sunday brunch at WeHo. $15 ride up to the entrance area.Very impressed with the observatory. We didn't pay for the shows, but managed to spend over an hour learning all about planets, meteors and stars. Also perfect place to take photos of the Hollywood sign.To get back down, we took the 50 cents public shuttle bus to Vermont/Sunset metro station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellobayo
40,Stunning views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"Did this trip twice as first time was at night and didn't get to see the Hollywood sign in the dark - silly me, thought it was lit up! Stunning views of LA which feature in so many movies though and well worth the night trip.Did it again the following day during daylight and whilst we got to see the sign the views of LA are nowhere near as good as at night.You choose....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickM79
50,Amazing place!!!,"Wonderful place and viewpoint.Most magnificent photos and views of Los Angeles! Very hard traffic in the evening! 1 hour is not enough to get there by car. Better to come before sunset in 2 hours.And of course in the night LA brights like thousands of squares. 🏙You may have a picnic on the grass watch stars.But be aware, this area is not smoking!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1st-Tourist
50,"A ""Must Do"" in LA and I never thought I'd say that !","I had heard a few good things about the Griffith Observatory and thought that as we had a few days spare in LA why not give it a go..........id never been to one. Well do yourself a favour and take the time to visit. The views on there own are spectacular. I've seen a few reviewers commenting on the parking problem but I suggest you do as we did. Drive up the hill to the very top, passed all the cars parked on the verge and look for a place at the top. On arrival there were many families coming and going and within seconds we had a choice of several places which saved us a hike in the heat of the day.I would recommend. Getting there before opening though as one of my highlights was the planetarium show ( I forgot what is was called ) which runs throughout the day but you must queue and buy a ticket for it. It's a must do and was really well done. I liked the lie back seats which were lovely and comfortable and don't sit at the front.......for one ence you should get a seat further back to appreciate the show better. The rest of our time was spent enjoying the other educational planetary exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123steved123
30,Great view,Not a lot to do. At the time we were there the observatory wasn't open. You can just walk around it and the view over LA is very good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSVP2020
50,Grand city View,"Probably number one attraction for family to see when in Los Angles for its majestic city view and displays. Parking is very limited and Side Street get full on both side for almost a mile. Very informative for kids of all ages. Lovely Planetarium shows. View through Telescope is available for special nights, check listing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91Ray
40,Fun learning center with gorgeous views,"It was delightful to see so many families there with their children eager to learn about the planets, our solar system and all things associated. BUT it was very crowded. This may be due to free general admission, it's summer, it was a Friday afternoon or all three. (There is a special fee for some shows).I accessed via hiking up from Griffith Park.Wonderful views up and down.I didn't stay long because it was quite crowded but would absolutely go again and try to do so during a time that it would likely be less busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve
50,For a view and a photo showing hollywood sign,"As a long time Angeleno, I have visited this site many times. Sometimes as the start or end point of a hike, or bringing out-of-town visitors to see the view and get a photo with the hollywood sign, or taking my kids to the planetarium when they were small. The planetarium show is cool for adults too, if you haven't seen one of those before and there's a sweet little museum. I recall that, when I was new to LA, seeing the sprawling urban grid from the observatory was part of my developing understanding of the layout and energy of the city. I still love it up there. It's best, of course, on a clear day. But while the LA marine layer haze (it's not smog, unless its brown) obscures some far away things, it brings other, nearer things into focus. The night view of the city is also a beautiful carpet of jewels. So if you are an LA visitor, I think that it's worth including on your itinerary. And for those of us who live in LA, it's on the list of reasons to love LA so good to get up there from time to time. Avoid weekend afternoon traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSK2765
50,"Education, Views, Hiking, Film History, all in 1 location","This iconic L.A. setting should not be missed by any visitor to the area.

50,Perhaps one of the best views of LA,"This is one of the must visit places if coming to LA, even if only for a couple of days.From here you can see just how enormous LA is, the Hollywood sign, beautiful ocean sunset and so much more. They have a great observatory as well with lots of interesting hands-on features, scientific displays and real-time moon and star sighting.The cafe is available as well but i wouldn't count on it for fancy food. It offers basics at somewhat hefty markups.Plenty of trails lead to and from the Griffith observatory so the entire area is abundant in hiking trails.You may want to consider arriving early before rush hours for sunset watching to avoid having to park ways from the observatory center.This is one place where you want to bring a high quality camera and zoom lens.A perfect follow up activity is to drop by Yamashiro restaurant for a great dinner and yet another round of stunning views of LA lights at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/encogaca
50,We loved this,"We travelled as a group of 20 years olds exploring the city and we loved it! Stunning views of the whole city and good view of the Hollywood sign!

50,"The planetarium show is in my ""must"" list for LA",Everyone who lives in LA or visits should enjoy the planetarium show. It's literally my favorite thing to do in LA. Plan ahead and be prepared to walk from parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAINLA
50,Hollywood sign,Good place for views of the Hollywood sign but a fascinating place in its own right. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaa29
50,Great View,This place has fantastic views over LA and the hills. The only thing is the parking. The marshals are unfriendly and if you park down the hill be prepared for a long walk. However well worth a visit. Just get there earlyish to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayneSamantha
50,Awesome view LA and Hollywood sign,"We didn't have much time to see LA, so this was the perfect spot to see the Hollywood sign and a view of the downtown area. We went on a Sunday night, and there were a lot of people but parking is free. Give yourself plenty of time since the traffic up to the observatory can be pretty bad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chauminhp
40,Great views,"Great place, but you need a lot of time to explore. Most people in there had called in to cool down from the hike up the hill. There are great views of Los Angeles, and a distant view of the Hollywood sign. At the front of the observatory we saw at least a dozen humming birds at close quarters in the flowers – that was an amazing sight.There are public toilets outside the observatory – although the queuing system seems non existent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiciaW
50,Beautiful Attraction,"We had a wonderful experience. We went at sunset and it was beautiful. Anytime would be a great, but you can really watch the sun go down and disappear. The colors are great. The only bad thing is parking and the ""rangers"" or whoever they are to help you park are not friendly. It looks like there is only stuff outside to look around, but there is a lot inside too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsmommy24
50,Beautiful night at the observatory,Wonderful night to view the moon through the telescope and the city lights of Los Angeles from above. Several interesting exhibits inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdolly2
50,Fabulous Architecture and Views,"The building has been preserved and carefully expanded with all it's original, extraordinary detail. Inside there are interesting and interactive displays, and a planetarium (unfortunately we missed the show). Outside and around the building are viewing areas where you can get sweeping views in all directions of LA. You can drive up (parking can be difficult), or you can hike up from Griffith Park. Great for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/INSFCA
50,Amazing views,Amazing views from this hilltop location. Information from the observatory very interesting. Should have gone at night. Heard great things about nighttime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR817
50,From Top to Bottom a Pleasure.,"A must see if one is in the vicinity,just the view of the surroundings is an experience in itself. No general admission charge although there are some upgrades for certain activities. Lots to see and interact with all over the observatory, even a demonstration of the Tesla coils complete with electric arcs. Doors open at 12:00 noon. Good spot to get photos of the Hollywood sign also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grubbyrat
50,Stunning view,We visited the Griffith observatory as a family to enjoy a picnic whist watching the sunset...this is a perfect location to observe a stunning sunset..a piece of advise though would be not to visit on Monday because unfortunately for us this is the only day of the week that the observatory is closed. This place is certainly well worth a visit though with plenty to do for families and very educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5916JAsusanm
50,One of the best views of the Hollywood sign,"Beautiful spot up in the hills above LA. Really cool drive up to the Observatory too, great panoramic view of the city below and really close to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/followherstomachkiwi
40,Nice visit for kids,"Very nice visit to study history and physics with Kids, with experiments and explanations. Also, a perfect top view of LA city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lftprado
50,Kind of a hidden gem,"Up a very tall cliff sits the Griffith Observatory, watching over the Hollywood Sign and LA skyline. It's a MUST see while in the LA area, blew my mind away. There are amazing views as well and very interesting facts and exhibits about space inside. Parking and going in are FREE so thats always nice! Don't be surprised when you have to hike up the hill since there will probably not be parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlin8899
50,"Fascinating experience, for adults and kids","We've been there at night, with my 3 kids. ages 12, 8 and 3.All of them were excited to see the moon through a giant telescope, and seeing all the science stuff down there.. very recommended. we'll sure going to be there few times more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/379erant
40,nice layout,"What a wonderful thing to do for free. The observatory had plenty to see and learn about. There was a show that we would have done if we knew about it before we got there,It was Under $10 I think. Quite a few people standing in line for it so I assume it was a good show. The views from the area are fantastic. Amble parking with handicap access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carribbeanmic
40,Nice Place,It was a nice drive and located in an elevated area..We needed to wait in the Q for about 45 minutes to get in. We liked the observatory and historical value of this place. Recommend visitors to LA to include this in their itinerary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srmanjunath
50,Nice view of the Hollywood sign,U can see the hollywood sign up the observatory. Parking was difficult and be prepared to walk a bit after parking at the foot of the hill. Great view from the hill too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annie0608
50,Great views of the LA skyline,Best place to visit if you are wanting to see a amazing view of the LA skyline!!! I got some really cool photos from up here.It is best to go in the morning as during midday it gets a little busy. There are 2 free exhibits to see while you are there so take you time and have a good look around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarethL901
50,Always excellent,Been coming here for years and it always offers something different each time we visit. Always check their website to see what's special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogiacomo
50,Amazing Views and great place for hiking,"As a Southern California resident! what can i say! incredible views of downtown LA, the Valleys and mountains. great place to come and learn a bit of our solar system and possible catch a show or two. or if you are looking for a place to exercise and get a bit of cardio! great hiking trails from easy to some rough. either or Definitely a must place to check out as a tourist or resident!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sam2066
30,OBSERVATORY - VERY INTERESTING-- THE PARKING- FORGET IT!!!,"I've always found the parking here almost impossible or rather challenging. It does depend on what day of the week, the time and the season of course. You could always park further down the hill but it's an uphill walk.Nice views of Los Angeles city and around. Telescopes to use. At night can sometimes see the most amazing sites of the stars. The Observatory you can spend quite some time there; with shows, hands on things etc etc. Great place.It's in the middle of Griffith Park so even if you don't find The Observatory area so great, you always can go to the park instead. It's ginormous, great walks to be done (some uphill!), picnic areas, a Theatre.There are a few restrooms around the park area but they aren't so pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546
40,Awesome Evening Visit,"I Loved this place.What I liked :The view are fabulous all over. Hollywood Sign , LA panoramic view.Its a great hangout to take kids as well - Good Outdoor fun with lot of telescopes there showcasing different sightings (we saw moon , Saturn and Venus when we were there)Very good Science Exhibit inside the Observatory.Planetarium show was awesome. For 5-7$ , the show was affordable and very good. Kids would love it and Adults too.What I did not like :Parking is a mess there. Forget to get a reasonable spot if you are there on a weekend evening.Roads leading to Observatory confusing (lot of times some roads are closed and they have an alternate route).No nice restaurant/Fast Food options close to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chasedreamz
50,Amazing!,"I would recommend doing this during the day and at night! We also stood in line to look out the telescope (and the smaller ones outside) and it was amazing!It's all free and finding parking wasn't bad (we did have to walk a bit from where we parked, but not a big deal!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaytravel82
40,Great view. Interesting historically. Difficult parking,"Griffith Park Observatory is one of those places in L.A. that you have to see. You get a great view of the city, the hills, and the Hollywood sign from there. The sunsets are amazing. Inside the observatory itself is a very creative ""milky way"" made of vintage brooches that decorate the hallways. There are very interesting exhibits that harken back to Tesla and other greats, as well as basics about the solar system. It's a science nerds dream spot, but it's also a wonderful place for enjoying vintage architecture as the building is quite cool in and of itself. Be sure to hit the downstairs floor, which many miss. You'll get great photo ops here (on a clear day), but be prepared for parking to be a pain. Car pool if possible. Many people are up there hiking and running, in addition to observatory visitors, so parking is very limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJD50
50,Amazing views/parking nightmare,"The Griffith Observatory is a great place to visit during the day or at night. If you're going at night, parking is quite tricky so leave yourself enough time to deal with it. People will park halfway down the mountain leading up to the observatory. The observatory itself is pretty neat inside and has a lot of information to check out. Also, check their website before you go, sometimes they pull out a telescope onto the lawn and you can check out stars or planets if they're close enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsayzdz
50,"Great view, informative staff and an incredible view","The most outstanding aspect of this place is that Griffith wanted to ensure it remained free for everyone all the time. They have stayed true to this (with the exception of special exhibits etc) with fascinating exhibits surrounding the universe and solar systems and staff who love to share their knowledge.You can see the telescope at any time of day and if you're willing to line up for hours of an evening, you can even look through it way into outer space.The walk around the observatory is truly incredible, looking down over all of LA.An LA must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaTheNomad
40,wanted to visit after all the movies and tv shows using as backdrop,well worth the hunt for a parking place to take in the views of Hollywood sign. the views of downtown LA were spectacular also. the displays with the observatory were also worth the visit. glad we made the effort to visit and would recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to do so,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tndawoods
50,Such a nice place,Wonderful views of L.A. and a great place to picnic with the family. If you are feeling adventurous then take the trail going up the hill for an even more dramatic view of the city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjpp827

50,"Even if you don't go in, the panoramic views are worth the trip",Wind your way to the Griffith either by driving or hiking up the winding paths. When you get to the top you'll find magnificent panoramic views of LA. Must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tokyorav
50,A beatiful night,"If you like anything that has to do with the stars and planets this a must place to visit. If that doesn't fancy your like you can look at the beautiful scenery during the day and night. Also if you enjoy movies a lot a films where filmed here. Especially coming through the tunnel to get here, if you enjoy (Back to the future films) you'll understand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288miguelb
50,Incredible views,Lots of people on a Sunday afternoon but well worth the time to get to the top. Really enjoyed the views near sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swimmom7

40,Quiet place with fabulous view,"We arrived 5min before sunset and it was fabulous. Awesome views, nice people, entertaining shows worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyjane2015
50,"Quality family time, Los Angeles' educational FREE entertainment","An excellent way to spend a few hours and enjoy gorgeous views and learning exhibits. The parking is always insanely loaded and the walk is very long and quite an uphill trek. My husband just had foot surgery so the long walk wasnt going to happen. If you dont get a spot at the top ( you wont the lot is really small) Be sure to park all the way at the bottom and catch the .50c tram bus, you will NEED CASH .50c per rider for each ride up and down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle_Haley
30,Visit carefully!,"Griffith Observatory is an iconic scientific institution, and commands a glorious nighttime view of the city below. This concludes the good news. The bad news is that on a summer evening, you will share the experience with thousands of your closest friends, and on a night when there's a concert at the Greek Theater, it will take you an hour to get to the Griffith's parking, you will walk a mile from where you're parked, and it will take you another half hour plus to drive out. All in all, not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darthwill
50,Excellent Views and Exhibits,We visited during the week so there were quite a bit of school groups which made it somewhat crowded. We parked on the hill on the way up and there was plenty of parking. The views from the top were excellent of the city skyline along with the Hollywood sign. The exhibits inside were also very interesting. A must visit in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmacwi
50,Excellent,"The Griffith Observatory is a great visit, not only for the Observatory itself but for the Griffith Park that it sits in. The most spectacular thing is perhaps not the Observatory itself but the view you get of LA if you climb onto the Observatory roof.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enzuigiri
50,Regular visit,"Great place to get goood views of the L.A Downtown and the Hollywood sign. Also for universe enthusiasts, you can go into the observatory and learn more about the universe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44yusufn

50,Amazing views,"We headed up since we had time before our evening plans and I'm so glad we did. Since it was Saturday it was quite busy, but we lucked out with a parking spot at the top. The views are stunning, you can see the Hollywood sign, the mountains, the city and the ocean without turning your head.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fergll
40,Consistently Great Place to Visit,I always make the hike up through Griffith Park to visit Griffith Observatory whenever I visit LA. It's about 7miles up & 7 miles down through the trail I take. The views are incredible and it's a hike that most could do if you go at a pace that's comfortable to you (not too steep). The Observatory itself is fascinating and all the exhibits worth a look - from the scaled representation of the planets in our Galaxy out on the grounds to the huge pendulum. The shows at the Planetarium always enjoyable and even if they cover facts you've learned before you find yourself absorbed. I've seen lots of families enjoying themselves here. It has never failed to be great way to spend an afternoon in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancescaLW217
50,Wonderful view,It's worth it evem just to see Los Angeles from above. Very interesting inside. See Saturn was great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/z0rnitsaa
50,Recommended,"I went to Griffith Observatory on the last night of a recent trip. Its high on a hill/mountain so it's difficult to get to if you don't have a car and even if you do have a car, parking can be difficult because it's a popular destination. Most people park on the road leading up and walk some of the way.Despite that, it's an experience you should definitely do. Admission is free. The observatory contains a number of exhibits and educational resources and you can get excellent views over the wider Los Angeles area. Members of the public can look through the telescope but there's generally a queue for this. There are lots of interesting things to see.At night, take a jacket or coat because the temperature is quite a lot cooler than it normally is.Griffith Observatory was used as a filming location in a number of films and you'll see why when you get there. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonewayfarer
50,Excellent view of the city!,Upon arrival you will see the great view of LA and also the famous Hollywood sign. The observatory itself was architecturally beautiful and also had alot of different exhibits which were quite informative. Some hands on exhibits also available making the experience quite interactive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phychem
50,Spectacular View and Facility,The building itself is stunning! We hiked up and the views were spectacular! We enjoyed the exhibits and also went to one of the shows in the planetarium. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jano545
50,"Great views, a must see!",We stopped here on a tour of LA. Don't forget to go up to the roof and see the telescope! Great photo opportunities here and an amazing view of LA and the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennalynnwarner
40,Fascinating,"This is a must for anyone interested in astronomy. Perched in the LA Hills, you can have a walk around overlooking LA, learn some exciting astronomy information, have a bite to eat (though not sure how good the food is). Be sure to see the sun dial... it is pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1eloise
50,Very busy on weekends but still well worth it,"Great views would be the number one reason for most people to come up here. However, there's a lot more to explore and you may try to understand the concept behind the huge pendulum that swings inside the building, proving that the earth is rotating.You can see pretty much everything from up here. Hollywood sign, Downtown LA, Santa Monica, you name it. You don't want to miss it.If you get here during the weekend, you'll have to fight your way up the hill with hundreds of other cars. There's plenty of parking at the bottom and you can catch a shuttle bus from there. Saves you the pain of finding a parking spot further up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefans03
50,A great day out!,"Variety of things that you could do. We went up to the griffith observatory. What a view! Would recommend, really enjoyed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sa53mee

50,Great Activity,"What a wonderful place to visit. A variety of both interesting and educational exhibits. Wonderful outdoor views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. A very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Best thing, admission and parking are free. The shows cost a few dollars each, but are well worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artieg419
50,Visiting,Great view of Hollywood sign. That's honestly why we initially went. We ended up touring the observatory and sat through the planetarium movie. Great time and very interesting. Free parking! Free entrance to observatory. Great place for families!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissar317
40,Very interesting,This is a good place to visit- we did this as part of another tour do we didn't have as much time there as we would have liked.The views from here are absolutely amazing and urs a great spot to catch sight of the large Hollywood sign.The observatory is set out very well and has really interesting information. We very much enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478phild
40,Also a great spot to see Sunset,The place is very popular and so they block the car's from going all the way. Expect to park your car a little far and walk a little but definitely worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaj978
50,The best view of Los Angeles,"Amazing if you want to see LA from a hill and take pictures near ""Hollywood"" sign. We haven't checked out the observatory, so cannot say anything about that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aikosha87
50,An Eye Opener,"Both my wife and I had a great time her. Unplanned we went on a whim. Got an Uber, although you can walk, you need to be fit to do that. When we got there we were amazed by the views, as you can imagine we took photograph on photograph. Best we are informed was to be there at sundown.Inside was incredible, so much information, certainly an eye opener as to where we are in the scheme of things. The planetarium is a must as ids the short story/ film narrated by Leonard Nimmoy on it's History.The one downer is no signal on Mobiles if you want to call a cab for your trip back down to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirjoker
40,Panoramic views,Perfect place to see all LA a check the yellow contamination layer over the city. The inside of the building is actually quite interesting. Parking is very difficult though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kinop2015
50,Perfect view over Los Angeles,"We were lucky to get a parking space in the parking lot. Stolled around the observatory, and although there were large crowds, we found peace and quiet at the south side, overlooking LA. Best view of the city of angels. The exhibit inside is well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BredeL_11

50,Los Angeles From Atop,"The observatory is a really great place to go explore with its new underground museum showcasing the stars and planet in our solar system, also a awesome statue of Albert Einstein. and if your into hiking just right in front of it you have trails that lead you towards the Hollywood sign, i suggest bringing comfortable clothes and plenty of water, its a very nice place to city the city from up high. 1,135 ft to be exact.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jersonf494
50,Quick family stop,"We were a group of 8 and even though it was a busy day, driving and parking was flawless. The Observatory was busy but well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifewithYolie
50,Beautiful Views,"We went there on our last day in Los Angeles (a Sunday) and there was a big crowd but, because everyone is moving about, there was no issues at all. The view was absolutely breathtaking. You see all of downtown LA as well as the Hollywood sign (though it's not lit at night). In addition, there were 3 telescopes there for viewing stars that were light years away.We did arrive there about 40 minutes prior to closing so there was that foot traffic getting down and it's about a 20 minute drive (with all the other cars leaving) for an Uber to get all the way up.Overall, this is a must do while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardog301
50,Last minute visit,"Really lovely place, lots to see and the best views over the city. A must see place that everyone needs to go at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegas-Queen666

50,Very interesting,Good veiw of the Hollywood sign with veiws of West Los Angeles Part of a tour taken from the Magic Castle Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpound
50,Look out in the hills,A great place to visit with all the family. Exciting and interesting exhibits. Fantastic views over Los Angeles and the surrounding cities. Good view of the Hollywood sign. The planetarium shows are especially good. Food is quite expensive so it would be wise to eat before visiting. Parking can be difficult at busy times and there is a very steep climb up to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firework05
40,Brilliant 360 degree views,"Parking was free so a big bonus! Lovely views and trails if you wished to walk. However, we went on a Monday when the observatory itself was closed so In spite of the many visitors there were no refreshment facilities to be found anywhere, this is a great shame as this would help make money to support the area if they had a cafe outside of the Observatory. Worth a visit but if you go on other days be prepared to have to park at the bottom of the hill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daisydoo1994
50,party under the stars!,"We spent 4 hours at the Griffith Observatory from 6 to 10pm and had a blast. First we watched the sunset, I recommend you to check the time of the sunset the day you go to arrive a little earlier and watch it from the upper terrasse facing the ocean.Then we waited 20min on the line of the telescope to watch the stars. But i wanted to look at the planets. Guess what? The 2 telescopes on the main lanes were looking at Saturne and Mars. We had a blast!!! We had brought a picnic and ate it on the grass, but there is a nice restaurant with a magic view. Can't wait to go back to look at the moon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aurelieb864
50,What a view!!!,"We went at night and the view from here was spectacular! So much information , you easily could spend a few hours reading and learning. Love the telescopes that you get to look out from , just dont touch them! It takes them awhile to get it in the right spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197sunshinecass
50,My favorite hike,"I have been hiking up to the observatory since I was little. You can drive there, and parking is free, but its a better experience if you park at the bottom near Los Feliz, and hike up to the observatory. Its not too strenuous and the weather in Los Angeles is always good hiking weather. Once you're at the observatory you can grab a refreshment and hang out for as long as you'd like. From there, you can head back down or continue the other half of the hike for one of the best views in the city. Just make sure you head back down before the sun sets. The observatory is super art deco and a classic LA attraction. If you're visiting, whether you hike or drive, definitely make It a priority.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KnarikBrewster
50,Must do when in LA,One of the first nights in LA visited the observatory and was astounded by the panoramic views of the big city in lights.Inside a visitor centre full of facts and information into astronomy. Learnt a few things while there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eemperatriza
50,LA view,"Visited early before the observatory opened, however the location is stunning and well worth the trip up. Great hikes around the area, views of the Hollywood sign and the sprawling LA landscape.Definately worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonh425
50,Very nice!,"We went around 8 pm on a Wednesday night, and it was very crowded. Such a good attraction though! The exhibits were well-done and educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktmtqt
50,It's a mítico place,I love this place. It's amazing the view to Los Angeles. You can see all Hollywood letters and the observatory inside it's powerful. It's awesome. To repeat forever and ever!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I673JImonicam
50,Amazing Views,"We visited the Griffith Observatory on a Sunday and caught the LADOT shuttle bus which only cost $1 for a return journey. Luckily for us the bus stop was on the corner of Sunset and Vermont which was just round the corner from our hotel. The journey took a while because the road up is narrow and there's a lot of traffic but it's well worth the wait as the views, as soon as you step from the bus, are great! There's a nice cafe and gift shop if you want to pick up a few souvenirs. You can climb to the top of the observatory and the views down into the valley are awesome when you're up there. We went early evening and returned before it was fully dark, my only regret is I didn't wait a little longer to see LA lit up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb1996
50,Sensational views from every location,"My first bit of advice is to ""get here early in the day"" it gets more & more crowded as the afternoon rolls on. The drive up was pretty easy without too much traffic, getting a parking spot was challenging but not impossible we parked slightly down the hill. We only had a short hike up to the observatory but i imagine it could be a bigger challenge if you have to park further down. Once up the top the views are incredible, you can get really awesome shots of the Hollywood sign & really the whole of LA. It was a very clear morning when we were there so i was able to get awesome shots. The observatory is quite interesting & still operational with lots to see. You can climb the stairs to the top of the building to get even better views & options for pictures. Its quite a large structure & it was easy to walk around & they have lifts.Heading to LA you wont want to miss taking a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortez48
40,"If we could get there, I think it would be amazing!!","We drove up Sat. about 6pm. WOW... according to reviews maybe we should have left before 2pm :( It looks like a fascinating building with amazing views, but there were too many cars and no parking. We didn't bother to go into the lot because the flashing sign said it was already full and all the side parking was full too (on the road going up and down). On our way down we saw views from inside of our car and it looked AMAZING and the observatory looked like an AMAZING lit up building. I wished there was better parking for those of us with just a little time in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelledQ236SW
50,Excellent,A must visit for anyone. We had to walk up to the top as the taxi driver didn't know where to go. The guides were very good and well worth the walk to see the moon close up. Excellent place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsHolmes
40,A lovely place to visit and to see the Hollywood sign,"Lovely place to visit, plenty of information and interesting. FREE entry or $7 if you want to see the show in the Planetarium- we did and enjoyed it. Busy to park. We parked up on the side of the road on the way up to the observatory. best place to view if Hollywood sign and brilliant to visit just before sunset so you also get to see the views of LA before and after sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonS918
40,Amazing views and interesting inside,"Cool inside information, but what took my breath away were the views from here!Worth it just for the views alone, and the walk around the area, the observatory is an added bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961lanis
50,great view of LA & hollywood sign.,"First, it's free! and feel like it's not in LA cause it's in the middle of a mountain.But when you go up there, you get to see pretty much everything around.The view was awesome, also Hollywood sign is quite close too.I didn't want to walk all the way up so me & my friends took uber, it was about $15 from the middle of Hollywood (including tips)The view totally makes you wanna drink, it was a shame that they don't serve any alcohol :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving321334
50,Cracking views,"Definitely worth a visit, our two young boys found it very interesting. Even though you are a long way away, there are great views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmsbimble
50,Soo much to see...for free,"This observatory has the absolute best location & views - for free - a tourist could ask for.We arrived before sunset - found roadside parking - and walked up to the observatory where we were treated with amazing sunset views of LA & an amazingly educational (yet architecturally beautifil) building. The location offers 360° views of LA & the observatory offers soo many displays & programs to see, many hours or repeat trips are required -We loved this locale & it was the #1 highlight of our trip to LA -",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/537hollyb
50,Galaxy at your Feet,"The ride up to the observatory is a manicured duel carriageway with meticulous mansions all the way up. The observatory has a fantastic galactic mural on the floor tiles, great views, interesting little commemorative statues and relatively clean abolitions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5832GJbarbaraa
40,"Star gazing, nerdy talks","Another mostly free gem in Los Angeles. We came here because we've been lately getting interested in events like the recent lunar eclipse.It's just a nice atmosphere to hang out - up in the hollywood hills, you can see the Hollywood sign from the park. The exhibits inside are kid friendly and quite interesting. We attended a free talk (information available on the website) with a panel of nerdy people from the Jet Propulsion Lab and Caltech, who talk about all the latest ""space"" news going on and speculate on whether getting to Mars is a reality or not (they said it's a reality). They showed clips of the latest non-landing of a SpaceX rocket. As it was the first time I heard about the Elon Musk venture, SpaceX, which is in the LA area, I thought that was pretty exciting.We got to go inside the observatory and see a show, it was a bit underwhelming. The seats are big and cushy, and it was easy to fall asleep in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fzachary
50,Rad little observatory.,Fun visit and space movie. Was able to get some great shots of my friend with the Hollywood sign in the background too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26MatthewF
50,Out of this world!,"I absolutely love the Griffith Observatory! It's such an amazing building and it offers so many amazing things - interactive displays, panoramic views of LA and a planetarium. It was a treck to get up the hill on foot - something not fun in the heat but manageable - but it was totally worth it. We went late afternoon so managed to see the city in daylight;, sunset and night time from there. The $7 we paid for the planetarium show were the best $7 I ever spent! You get transported off of Earth with a live commentator taking you on the journey - it's so beautifully done it's like you're viewing a shakespeare performance or something equally theatrical and beautiful. It is one of the best places to see in LA!Note however it is not a pedestrian friendly area if you don't walk back down through the park - we left when it was dark so walked on the main road as we were told it was safer and that there would be a path - there is no pavement. If you're walking up and planning to walk down, make sure you leave whilst it's light as I wouldn't trust walking through the park at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danic344
50,Great location,Very interesting for children and adults. Great surrounding views.Not to be missed if you are in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAhols2014
30,We tried our best,"Arrived a Griffith Park at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. We found that is too late a start to visit the Observatory. The cars parked on both sides of the road made it a long, slow drive to the top. We looked for open spots and found none. Once reaching the parking lot it had many cars waiting for folks to leave and just one huge traffic jam. Many drivers getting frustrated so we just headed back out of the Park. Lesson learned is to get there as early as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allegany
40,Gorgeous view over LA,"We took an afternoon hike up to the observatory. It offered an excellent view and nice hike up there. The building itself is really neat. Exhibits are educational and staff is plentiful and knowledgeable about subject matter if you had questions. Only bad part is that we couldn't go into the planetarium with a small child. Would have really liked to see that show. Still, a great attraction with wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karlitotheswede
50,Stunning views!,Wow Wow Wow. You don't get a panoramic view of LA like this from anywhere else! Excellent experience. And it's FREE! And enjoy the canyon drive up the hill! Excellent view of the Hollywood sign as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/568debbieh
40,Worth a visit,Unfortunately we went on the same day as visiting the Science Museum so the kids weren't really interested in spending a lot of time in the observatory but what we saw was really interesting.Good views of the city below but there are many better places to view the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/i_buckley
50,One of a kind!,"Spent half of the day up there hiking the surrounding area, taking pictures, exploring exhibits, watching short films at the planetarium, and learning about the universe. Amazing views. When back in the evening and caught an amazing view of Jupiter through a high powered microscope along with spectacular night lights of Los Angeles! Best of all, it was free or minimal cost at the least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWonderlust
50,Sunset,"We parked the car like a mile away from the observatory and walked uphill. The main purpose was to enjoy the sunset and we haven't been disappointed! A magical view, definitely you cannot miss it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/42fannyz
40,Geral location to view the city's skyline,This location had amazing hiking trails and a beautiful view of the city. The parking is a little bit of a mess but once you find parking you will be sure to enjoy this location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833tanaa
40,Lovely for an evening out,"Lovely views over central LA. The shows are worth while going to see, although they are very cheesy. The main telescope is open for a quick look (with a 20 minute line when I was there mid week), although there was nothing particularly interesting to see when I was there. Telescopes on the lawn were focused on Saturn, the moon and other objects. Worth arriving just before sunset to see it in the light and dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adpsimpson
40,Griffith Observatory - review,"We did a quick stop with the boys and got to check out the Griffith Observatory, place is pretty cool for both kids and adults. I'm and an engineer and learning on how olden times did things was pretty cool. From learning how ancient Indians learned how to read the time of day, to seeing how microscopes are created and used.The views of Los Angeles were great and could get clear pictures of the Hollywood sign. Good spot for the family to hike and spend a Sunday afternoon.Cons: parking is a mess and will take you a good 20 minutes to find a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josealvarez22
50,Enjoy wonderful views across LA and learn more about the solar system,"Griffith Observatory is a great place inside and out. Outside there are wonderful views across LA to the sea, and across to the world famous Hollywood Sign. There are landscaped grounds surrounding the observatory which itself is a beautiful building.From here you can take a number of hiking trails up and down the hills.The observatory itself has some wonderful exhibitions on the sun, moon and seasons. Small interactive demonstrations explain the seasons, tides, eclipses and more. The main lobby has a beautiful ceiling mural depicting signs of the zodiac.Entrance is free but the planetarium shows are extra.We watched the 'Water is Life' show which was truly magical. As the lights dimmed our host (who had the most wonderful voice) explained the importance of water, taking us under the sea with huge whales swimming over our heads, before blasting off into space. We looked at water from meteorites and more about the stars in the night sky. it was only half an hour but a wonderful programme.There are other programmes in the planetarium and Horizon theatres that we didn't attend.Travel TipsIt can get hot up here with little shade in the middle of the day. There are a few water fountains inside and water can be bought in the 'cafe at the end of the Universe' but there is nothing outside. Make sure you have water when you are visiting.The mobile signal can be intermittent but you can get free wifi sponsored by Toyota. You need to watch a 30 second YouTube video before accessing but it means you will have access.If you are not driving, there is a regular shuttle bus to and from the Observatory which will connect you to public transport. Uber will get you up there and, with free wifi, you can order an Uber back down the hill.George Harrison fans look out for the special tree and dedication to the artist, just at the edge of the main car park.The James Dean statue is in memory of the observatory park featuring in pivotal scenes of 'Rebel Without a Cause.' Many other movie scenes have been shot here including The Rocketeer, Terminator, Transformers and Charlie's Angels, as well as the music video for 'Rush Rush' by Paula Abdul, itself a homage to Rebel without a Cause. The road tunnel between the Greek Theatre at the bottom of the hill, and the observatory was the entrance to Toon Town in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineTravelandSong

30,Interesting,"The museum is very interesting. My 5 year old was amazed by all the information and pictures posted inside. We loved the view from up there, you can take beautiful pictures from the terrace. The only thing that we didn't like was the lack of sufficient parking space. We weren't prepared to walk that much to get there and it was a very hot day. Also, they have a restroom area and the bathrooms where awful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aricaballero
50,Great view!,One of the best view to see the entire Los Angeles for free! Except if you are taking the tour or calculating car expenses!Great place to view the Hollywood sign too! Not a place to miss definitely!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholaso804
50,Amazing sunset and night view,We came around 6 pm to watch the sunset. Sun goes down very fast but the view was stunning. The Observatory close at Mon but still worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee656141
50,What a view!,"This wonderful landmark building is free to visit and worth it. A must for any tourist for it's wonderful panoramic views of downtown LA to the ocean, as well as of the iconic Hollywood sign. For the best experience, park below in Griffith Park and hike up one of the popular trails to the observatory and beyond, including the Hollywood Sign.

50,"Beautiful L.A. view, awesome learning experience, free","LOVE the Griffith Observatory! One of my favorite things in LA. I think entrance to the Observatory/museum is free, and you can buy to watch the various presentations.My friend is slightly obsessed with astronomy, so she had a lot of fun geeking out in the planetarium. I, on the other hand, was there for the beautiful views of both the city of L.A. and the Hollywood sign.**Don't get there too late, because they start closing down parking around sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydnih2017

40,Amazing Views,"The views alone make this worth a visit, panoramic views of the mountains, LA and on a clear day the Pacific can be seen. The observatory is very interesting and I found that the humming birds in the grounds very fascinating. The planetarium presentation for $7 at 10.45 am was the water show. We found this a little simplistic but this is the one presentation that children can attend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinker8ell2015
40,Best At Night!,"The best way to see the views of Los Angeles is to go at dusk so you can see the sunset and then the city lights at night. The view extends from downtown Los Angeles to the east, Hollywood in front of you, and Century City and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The view during the day is not particularly pretty (but worth seeing) but is DAZZELING at night! ALSO there are exhibits indoors - be sure to see a display of the planets on the bottom floor. Inside is a theater with usually three different movies projected on the ceiling about astronomy / space (each costs about $7). There is a parking lot but usually you will need to park along the long, winding mountain road leading to the Observatory. Wear comfortable shoes! There is also a nice little café with fantastic views of the mountain that separates Los Angeles from the San Fernando Valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weRtheWorld2016
50,Amazing at sundown,We walked up the hill as parking was full. Well worth the 20 mins it took us. The most amazing views of LA and the Hollywood hills. Arrive just as sun sets and the views are awesome. Watching LA light up in front of you is a must do.Free and a highlight of any vacation. Stunning building but more stunning view. Worth getting up onto the top deck as view is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyw496
50,Better To Come at Night,"We went here during the day while on a tour and it was very nice. We walked around inside and saw the telescope as well as views of LA. However, Im sure this is the place to come at night for all the views. I would recommend coming off season, otherwise parking is a nightmare and it's a long trek to get to the top. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the line of cars wasn't terrible, but there was still a lineup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marield1990
50,Must see!,"At the top of Griffiths Park is the observatory. It offers stunning views of the city, we stayed until sunset which was a fantastic view from up there.The observatory offers an education view of the solar system. Great if you like the stars and space.Parking is the one downside. It is an absolute nightmare purely because of the number of people trying to get there and the small size of the car park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjfinch
50,Great view,We went to the Observatory one Wednesday evening. The upper car park was already full when we arrived so we needed to park further down at the side of the road which meant a nice hike up to the Observatory. The queue for the enormous telescope was long and we had the feeling it was not showing a lot in comparison. But the night view of LA was well worth it on the other hand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitah551
50,Griffith at night,Had been before in the day when first visited LA 2 years ago . Thought it maybe less busy on a Tuesday evening in October - mistaken .Crawled into the centre had to park on the dark hillside and make out way up - managed not to trip up as there is no pavement / sidewalkGreat views etc - had a look at Saturn via a telescope in the front of the observatory. To big a queue for us to use the big telescope - no doubt would have been spectacular .Despite the crowds it was worth going,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjoanneh

50,Amazing!!!,"Okay, so I didn't know what to expect as I walked up the hill to the Griffith Observatory but when I got there I was wowed! Even before you step foot inside the views of the Observatory, the Hollywood Sign, Los Angeles are breathtaking. The Observatory is a beautiful building with very many interesting exhibits, I would highly recommend paying a few dollars, to watch the shows, entrance into the Observatory is free, which was certainly surprise in this day and age where we charge for everything ;)Wait until early evening to go and watch the sunset and then wait in line to look through the telescope, very much worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonB390

I spent approximately three hours walking around the observatory and looking at the wonderful exhibits inside.I also had the chance to see one of the planetarium shows. I'm not a science person, but I thought the exhibits were really interesting. The planetarium show was really fun. And the views were great also! It's hard to gbelive that there isn't an entry fee to get into this place. I highly recommend going to the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieS732
50,Great experience observing the night sky,It is great to look at the Albireo at the constellation of Cygnus during fall season using the Zeiss 12 inch refracting telescope at night. But remember this telescope close door at 9:30 PM on top of the roof. Be there early or else one can miss the opportunity. The observatory also has a spectacular view of the night time Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhishaol

50,"Great views, tons of historical/educational information","We hoped to have time during a recent visit to LA to make it to Griffith Park/Observatory (admittedly more for the proximity to the Hollywood sign and the views than anything else). We were there on a Tuesday during the middle of the day, and it was amazingly busy. We went all the way to the top parking lot out of sense of crazy optimism, but there were no spaces. Fortunately, the person in our group driving is an amazing parallel parker, so we squeezed into a little space on the side of the road not too far from the top of the hill. The views were incredible and we got some amazing pictures. But once we went inside, we were all wishing we had more time to spend. The exhibits were extremely fascinating and informative. Would love to return on another trip to spend more time. Definitely worth the drive up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelrvo

50,Worth the hike,"Griffith Park Observatory is a terrific place to learn about science and space. They have a wide variety of exhibits as well as the telescopes, theaters and wonderful balconies where you can view the surrounding hills and cities. This is a major attraction, we were there at 3 pm on a Tuesday afternoon and we had to park along side the road about half mile away--downhill, so see if you can find less busy times for your visit if you do not like to walk. Everyone mentions the fantastic views, there is plenty to see on your hike up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grip652

50,Bring Visitors to the L.A. Area Here,"Being lifelong Californians, we take places like the Griffith Observatory for granted. We had not visited in decades and were very pleased with the renovations. We enjoyed seeing the building itself, the exhibits, the shows at the Planetarium and the FABULOUS views of both the Hollywood sign and downtown Los Angeles all the way to the Pacific Ocean. There are also hiking trails in the area.

It really is amazing just being able to enjoy the view without being attached to your cell phone in this day and age. Truly a great place to visit. Make sure to visit when there isn't an event hosted or else you will be in traffic longer than actually being in the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_MichaelScottReview

40,A good place to go on no school days.,"If you're local to LA, this is a great place to take your kids when they're off school. Visiting the observatory and the public park below can take the whole day. There are also easy hiking areas with scenic views. Plan ahead for observatory show times and pack food for a picnic, it may be a day the kids will remember because they spent their time with you!If you are a tourist with kids, the LA Zoo, Travel Town, and Gene Autry Museum are on one side of the hill near the 5 freeway and the foothills of touristy Hollywood are on the side of the hill under the observatory. This observatory is featured in many movies bringing up the cool factor of this historic landmark. Almost every area in the observatory is a great picture taking spot. The only downside is that it gets very crowded and parking is limited. Plan on hiking a bit if you cannot find a place to park near the observatory but hey, you're on vacation so take it as an opportunity to enjoy the scenery and get some exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamescL2481PM

50,Never forget this sunset,"We went there on a weekday, which probably was a good choice. There was quite a queue of cars to get up there but it was well worth the effort. If you can, male sure to see the sunset. A view I will never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/offroader70
50,Best View of LA!,"Went here on a Saturday night and the traffic to the top was terrible. Parking on the top was blocked off, but with a wave and a thumbs up to the traffic attendant who was doing a wave with his flares; the gate was opened to the top just for us. We found a spot and got a picture of the Hollywood sign just before dusk. Many hiking trails to hike on. Great views of LA after dark. You can really tell how huge it is. There are 4 individual restrooms outside, but on the 2nd floor of the planetarium there are more without the lines. Make sure you check the times for the Tesla coil exhibit and don't miss. It is turned on once an hour. There are many other great exhibits to see about the sun and solar system in the observatory. Great place to spend several hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rottman
50,Lovely place,"Don't stray away from this place as the hills have coyote,snakes and spiders. Try y o do this with a tour you can book at any hotel very hard to get to",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayugo
40,GREAT VIEWS OVER LA,"What a great place to oversee LA and the hills. We were lucky enough to have a clear day, but unfortunately the observatory was closed on the Monday we visited, as it is closed on Mondays.It was still worth the effort just to overlook LA and walk one of the many trails around the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normane362
50,Amazing view over the greater LA area.,"Good in the afternnoon, great at night, amazing at sunrise and sunset. Best view over the whoe LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian0251

50,The place Angelenos love,"It's hard to say just how great Griffith Observatory is. As a native Angeleno, I can tell you that we love this place. From the tourists I've taken there (many many times), I can tell you on their behalf that it never disappoints. First, there's the view - one of the best vantage points of LA. And if you can, come here at night. Stroll through the outdoor colonnade squeezed between the beautiful 1930s streamline facade and the cliff below. It's stunning, romantic, wonderful and more. Then, there's the amazing planetarium. The shows are wonderful because they're all conducted by live storytellers. It's like going back in time to a campfire and you're listening to some wise person tell you tales about time, about history, about the cosmos. The museum exhibits are crazy fun - learn how much you weigh on Jupiter - or see a real Tesla coil in action. And finally, the pendulum that demonstrates before your eyes that the Earth really is rotating. Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aronaki
50,Great Lookout Point!,Great place to quickly visit for a scenic overview of LA - for those short on time!The Observatory itself is a neat building also. Can see the Hollywood sign in the distance. Lots of walking trails all below the Observatory from what we could see. Were glad we went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trumpedup

It's an added bonus that you are able to see this observatory too!Very cool place to visit if you are doing the hike. Even my little kids enjoyed it. They are 8. The persona who was narrating it had a wonderful voice and presence. Excellent time well spent!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crawthetraveler

50,Rebel without a cause... Tesla... and more!,"This is one of the most interesting places to visit in Los Angeles. As a movie set, it's memorable and historic. But it will also open conceptual windows into a new understanding and appreciation of science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BirdPhoenix
40,Great place to visit.,Plan on staying several hours to get the most from your visit. Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjones801
50,Great free thing to do in Los Angeles,"The Griffith Observatory has a long Hollywood tradition and is the #1 spot to take out of town guests who want to see the Hollywood sign up close. After being closed for major renovations for several years, the Observatory is back and has something for every age group to enjoy. From new planetarium shows to amazing exhibits, to breathtaking views this is one of the best FREE things to do in L.A. Miles of hiking trails throughout the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198jenniferv
50,"""See the Stars!","This is a wonderful venue for the whole family. Lots of hands on equipment to understand what is going on in our Universe. The theater has wonderful programs that are age appropriate but you have to look on the Internet to find out times.The biggest problem is parking, so going during the week and in the morning is the best time to get a parking place and you can spend at least 3 hours at the observatory. There is a very nice Cafeteria with food for reasonable prices so you don't have to go somewhere else to have lunch. On a nice day you can see a view of almost all of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIB1128
40,Great view,"We had a amazing sunset at the observatory. We saw the Hollywood sign and the city of LA. After sunset you can see planets with the special microscopes they had there for people to see. You'll enjoy it, is totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rfig02

50,A Must See Stop for Movie Lovers,"The Observatory is a must see stop for film lovers. Indeed, if a film is set in Los Angles it seems to be a requirement that at least one scene be set at the Observatory, Bronson Cave, or the tunnels on the road leading to the Observatory.The list of films is long and no doubt you have seen at least one of them. Terminator, Rocketeer, Rebel Without A Cause, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Back To The Future, Julius Caesar, and numerous TV shows including the 1960's Batman series, to name but a few.Even if you do not go inside the actual Observatory, here is plenty to see and admire, including the Art Deco design of the buildings and the breath taking vistas The observation decks afford an excellent view of the famous Hollywood sign and on a clear day the Los Angeles cityscape is quite amazing.Inside, the Observatory houses a number of fascinating exhibits about astronomy and the night sky above LA, as well as a history of Griffith Park. Additionally, the recently remodeled Snack Bar offers a variety of treats.One can easily make a quick stop for an hour or spend the day and still find more to discover. This is a very popular spot and parking can be a challenge -- so bring your walking shows and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Narukami47
50,Have to visit,This place is amazing and definitely worth seeing. A little out of the way but a shared Uber makes it cheaper to visit. Th place is free. Wifi is available. I would recommend going near sunset time so you see both day and night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paddy10014
50,Great views,This place is a classic. So many movies have been filmed here. The views are amazing. This is a perfect place to get views and so some filming of your own. The other thing you can do here is hiking. Lots of trails from the area. Lots of wild life. They also have free exhibits and a movie that you do need to pay for. A total fantastic place for a family or an athlete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrostElement
50,Memory,This place is AMAZING. Used to visit quite often when living in the Los Feliz area just for the view. Went to see the show in the laserium and it was AWESOME!!!! a MUST SEE! (This was four years ago so I do not know what they are showing now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kckicks
30,Great views,"Quite difficult to park our car in April, however after a short walk to the top the views were amazing! Well worth visiting if you are in LA. We went during the day time and took a picnic which we ate on a picnic bench outside overlooking the Hollywood sign, which was fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870edds
50,Must See,This is a must see in LA! I would recommend going during the week if you can but even on weekends there is plenty of parking! One of the best views of LA! The planetarium itself is definitely worth checking out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hllywd1982
50,Griffith Observatory visit,"Fascinating interactive exhibits. Beautiful grounds, views & ambience. Educational but also fun for every age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGirl2014
50,My favorite place in La!!!,"You can't go to Los Angeles and not visit Griffith. I've hiked it up the mountain and driven there too. Parking is very limited so you will have to park along the mountain and walk to the Observatory. You will not be disappointed at the views! I was recently there for sunset. Amazing! You can go inside the Observatory as well and look at the amazing planets and learn a lot about the earth.It can be a bit scary if you drive up the long way which has many curves but once there, you forget about it. Stop by the gift shop for some color changing cups!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sblade77
50,Understated Beauty--Parking can be a challenge.,"The architecture in this gorgeous observatory that dates from the art-deco era was renovated in 2006 to repair the ravages of time and restore it to it's original beauty. However, they excavated under the building while creating a platform to prevent any seismic damage to create a lower level that has a world-class planetarium and exhibits! The breathtaking options to see our planet, our galaxy, multiple galaxies and the universe make it a ""Top Ten"" place to see in LA! It also is a place where you can take a picture of/with the ""Hollywood"" sign. You could easily spend 4-6 hours here with 3 different shows, huge numbers of exhibits and things that can be incredibly entertaining for even grade-school and older children. We almost missed this b/c of parking; DON'T miss it if you have any interest in science at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmnurse2016
50,Best view to the city,I love that place it has an amazing panoramic view to the city from the Pacific Ocean to East Los Angeles. Also a good spot to see the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matyaszaborszky
50,Go right before sunset,"I went to the observatory at night and it was a gorgeous view, I was impressed with how much I could see, it seemed like the world never ended! I can imagine going right before sunset would give you much more perspective and then staying with a blanket and bottle of wine to watch the sunset would be icing on the cake!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elissa121
40,Gleaming Twilight,"Headed to the Observatory to arrive prior to sundown as recommended in several guidebooks. Did not anticipate the amount of heavy traffic nor the Greek Festival congestion on the way. While there is a rather large parking lot next to the Observatory, it was over capacity at this time of day (and on a Friday). Parking was available along the road, however the walk was long and, of course uphill to get to the final destination. Only took advantage of the display spaces and rooftop viewing while waiting for a chance to look through the telescope. Heavy crowds and long wait, but well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JcH1232013
30,Crowded,"I think we made the mistake of going on a Sunday afternoon; it was very very crowded and it was basically bumper to bumper going up. Once you're lucky and find a parking spot, there are a million people around you wherever you walk. The view is fine but not stunning. I don't think it was worth my time but glad I went there once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Najebo
50,Amazing views of the city!,"Go for the architecture alone! It is beautifully and simply designed on the outside. Inside, there is a plethora of information, a great show in the planetarium. Fun date night for curious learners, great place for kids, so much to see and experience. If you have not been go...AND...the views of the city when you step outside at night are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBrackett
50,No better place to watch sunsets in Los Angeles,"For fans of James Dean, and the movie Rebel without a cause, this is a quintessential stop on a visit to Hollywood. The views of LA, and on a clear day the ocean, is breadth taking.Try to get there for a show or two before sunset and stay to see the night lights of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andyw47

40,Griffith observatory,The observatory is a relaxing place to take little ones. The grounds are well maintained and kids have space to run around outside. It does get crowded on the weekends though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkgirl
50,"LA's Art Deco treasure, restored and expanded","Situated on a mountainside with a spectacular view over the LA basin, the Griffith Observatory is a must-visit for its architecture, its setting, and its very user-friendly introduction to astronomy. Some quaint decades-old exhibits mix with more contemporary ones as well as a touching Leonard Nimoy video to make for a very satisfying visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highway_song
50,Great museum,"I really enjoyed the museum and exhibits on the lower level. This is a ""MUST SEE"" for amateur astronomers. Plan on spending 2 to 3 hours reading about the details of each eshibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blayne
50,Passing of Relativity,"I loved this place! My sister lives in Hollywoodland so I went for hikes almost daily during my two weeks visit there and stopped in here every time I could. It's small, but fun, free, and educational. I loved the galaxy made of earrings and the planet scales. I loved the atmosphere and the view. Day or night, a great place to just chill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyv958

50,Great place to see if you have time,"This is a great place to see if you have time, which unfortunately we didn't as we were part of a tour. You would probably need several hours to appreciate it all. Would love to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernbank
50,Excellent Observatory,An amazing observatory with a good view over Hollywood city. the observatory is a little bit crowded but deserve the waiting as it has a lot of educational materials,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IbizaLoveYou
50,Star Gazing,"Decided on a whim to take a trip to the Griffith Observatory and planetarium, as recommended by family members. We were there on a Friday night and I don't know if because of that it was very crowded there was also an event at the Greek theater which in very close proximity so traffic was heavier and parking was difficult.Having said that it was a very pleasant experience of the weather was beautiful the sky was clear we could see for miles the exhibits inside where very informative many of them were hands-on definitely a recommendation for families with children but suggest going earlier in the day seemed like it was more couples although there were families, singles, tour groups but a mixed variety.We arrived late for the planetarium show but it seemed that it was very well attended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franco6872
50,Great pictures,"I was surprised by how easy it was to get here, and parking wasn't too bad either. Its only about a 5 minute drive from the nearest highway, and parking on the street might make for a 5 or 10 minute walk up the hill, but no big deal. ( I went at about 3 in the afternoon.)Basically as you are walking up you get some great views, and then they get even better when you get up there to the parking lot...good views of the Hollywood sign and the surrounding area, although at a distance. Then up at the observatory itself 2 more minutes walk you get nice views of LA and the entire area. Then inside the observatory is a bunch of historical stuff like a small museum and a few interactive things good for kids, some pictures and stuff to read etc., and the most interesting part, a giant magnetic time keeping thing that comes down from the ceiling in the center of the building. (It sways with gravity or something in the center and every 7 seconds knocks down a peg to keep time.) That was pretty interesting + mixed with the great views and pictures made it pretty worth it (and free) to visit quickly and easily. (No idea how busy it might get on a weekend though.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3ebfan511
50,awesome place to hike,the observatory is located on the top . its an awesome place to hike if you can reach early in morning . the metro bus can leave you half the way then its about 20-30 mins walk to reach on top there is this boys scott trail which is 15 mins shortcut route to reach the observatory its through the forest ..the route is mountainous. but people going up for hiking can choose this one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748priyas
50,nice spot for entire view of Los angeles,"It's a place suitable for all kinds of people, children, couple, family, solo. I always go with my friends, hiking in the morning, talking and having lunch on the patio, enjoying the view at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coffeeisayorkie
40,Interesting,"it is more interesting than the hollywood sign. take the tour and learn about physics, astronomy and chemistry",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eduardo284
50,One of the best views of the city,"Besides the Getty Center, the Observatory offers one of the best views of the entire LA basin on a clear day. Even more spectacular after sunset. Avoid weekends when the locals go up there for hiking and picnics - both roads leading up may be clogged and parking is pure chaos. Alternatively, take an Uber or the Dash bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefanthiel
50,Visits to Griffith Observatory!,"I have visited Griffith Observatory several times, It is wonderful experience each time. A visit to Griffith Observatory is valuable for all ages. It is educational and the Observatory programs and exhibit are great. Visit it during the day or at night, it is amazing experience. No entry fee. Exhibits, and guided tours are free. Admission fee to the Planetarium shows is reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMIRM706
40,Worth the trip up,If you want a beautiful view take the drive up to see this beautiful observatory. There are many trails to climb for the physically fit and even some hiking trails for some that are not. But the treat is at the top. Wow what a view. Check times for the observatory.There is also a shuttle down below you can take if you are afraid to drive up..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjr832
30,Interesting,We visited here expecting to be able to get a good photo of the Hollywood sign.There were lots of interesting things inside and they had telescopes to view the moon and different planets outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kikadez
40,Interesting!,"A place for Earth Science fanatics or to those who are simply curious about why Griffith is popular destination in Los Angeles. You won't be disappointed. Aside from its free admission to this spectacular planetarium, the panoramic view of Hollywood and the LA in general is quite breath taking! Don't miss to visit the lower ground/basement. There are quite a few interesting activities you can do such as well, looking at how much you weigh presumably if you're in different planets ( from Mars to Jupiter that is). Spend about 3 to 4 hours there. There is a cafe where you could stay and hang out and chillax whilst enjoying your hot or cold beverages, yes they also serve meals and light snacks. There is also a shop where you could buy souvenirs, just be ready to spend your dollars! I highly recommend for anyone planning to visit this place to go after lunch time, or you could have a simple picnic on the grass too while waiting for the sunset and of course, the evening panoramic view. Highly recommended for all ages! Of course only if you are into Science :) Very informative and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catia40s
40,Great place,"I have been coming to this place since I was a kid. Since the remodeling a few years ago, the place has gotten even better. It is a great experience to be in this building and the grounds are beautiful. I hope this place stays open for many generations to see. It is good for a casual outing on evenings or early afternoons. Parking is difficult on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msmxtoo
40,Beautiful View,"Fantastic views of LA and of course the famed Hollywood sign. Sunset is the time it's most beautiful but it looks like everyone had the same info, because as the sun was starting to set it got ridiculously crowded. And the traffic got crazy. So be warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paloma_Rao
50,Spectacular sunset,"We made a last minute decision to head up to the Observatory to see a show at the Planetarium. Amazing views of the sunset from the cafe. Cafeteria food was average but you don't visit the planetarium for the food! The displays are fantastic - especially enjoyed the Foucault's Pendulum after having read about them. The show in the planetarium was great and well worth the wait. LOVED the 'pop-up' presentation in the observatory that explained the large image that took up a whole wall. Brilliant stuff. I just wish my brain was big enough to remember it all! Highly recommended.If you are taking your own car - leave heaps of time, parking is nuts. You are better to Uber up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzieH851
50,Really beautiful and educational,"This was my first time at an observatory, and it didn't disappoint. The building looks great and has great views of the city. The telescopes are amazing, but you do have to wait in line a couple minutes for your turn. And best of all, its free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jay_dog98
50,Great views of LA and interesting observatory,Beautiful views over LA- go up for sunset but bogey there early as there will be queues otherwise. Observatory worth a visit in itself with good exhibits - and it's free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTadvice

40,Go early in the morning,"I think this is a great, interesting place to visit. Unless you get there early though, you'll have to park on the road leading up to the observatory and walk quite a distance. It's a beautiful walk though. There's a good view of the Hollywood sign from the observatory. Also, later in the day it gets packed with bus tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cantbelieveit_8
40,Fun half day,"Went with family on weekend. Some crowds but bearable. My younger daughter (8) got bored, but older ones found it fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luihana
50,Griffith Observatory,"LOVE coming to the observatory. I feel like a kid each time I come. There are planetarium shows for minimal fees. Often there are staff with telescopes out front showing alignments, planets, sun or showing other displays in the atmosphere that may be happening at that time. There may be a short wait like 30-45 mins but it's totally worth it. There is quite a crowd on weekends so be prepared for parking chaos. Not too bad if you're patient & don't mind walking.The evening brings amazing city views & you can still roam the exterior. My favorite thing to do is take a hike at Griffith park before or after the observatory, depending on the crowd at the time. There is little to no shade so bring a hat & sun screen! Plus! There's an ice cream guy at the very bottom (if you make it down) so have cash handy!! You can even see the Hollywood sign & hike up as close as legally possible lol! It's not an easy hike so be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabygg9

50,Great weekend afternoon visit,"To avoid traffic and the headache of parking on a weekend afternoon, I took the DASH shuttle from the Vermont/Sunset station. It took about 20 minutes to get from the station to the observatory and less time to get back to the station. At the observatory, it was busy, but not too crowded, except around the Tesla coil when they were demonstrating it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chocolate_dreamer

50,Brilliant visit,"We went up on the Saturday evening to see the sunset. This was a mistake. It was jammed full. Jammed. We ended up parking about a mile away and walking back.

The views can't be beat, especially on a sunny day! There was so much to see and do and very interesting exhibits. Checked out the live planetarium show and it was one of the best I've ever seen! If you come to LA do yourself a favor and come see this magnificent place, I promise you won't be disappointed! Parking was free and easy and admission all around the observatory was free. Ticket for the planetarium was $7 which to me is incredibly reasonable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanNScotland

40,Sunset Visit,"Lovely place, a must see while in LA. Only downside was it was extremely busy so had to park up and walk up to it as not enough spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maggie1406
50,Great Place...,"Get there early, enjoy the views of L.A and then spend a few dollars and watch a couple of the shows, the experience is wonderful with great quality graphics and lovely voiceover. It's a special place and everyone visiting L.A should take time to visit and enjoy this place...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnoWirral
50,Nice,"Nice place with indoor exhibition and great view. Hollywood sign is not so ""huge"" and visible from there though, you must take a little hiking tour if you want to take a better picture (or to stand right underneath it).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753paulap
50,"Excelent museum, be there for the sunset!!!","These place is great! The planetarium is amazing, the museum and its staff is excellent, plus its free! Definitely try to be there for the sunset, there is always a ggod crowd on the rooftops and the balconies enjoying the views. Its worth it, you see the beaches, downtown, the valley, the airport, etc.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnW885
50,Wonderful and inspiring!,The people working there are so engaging and the shows are fabulous!! It is also beautiful hiking area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineanneberger
40,Two in one,"I love sightseeing that you can drive to, park closely to, doesn't take too long and in this case ticks two boxes. Here, that is that you can also 'do' the Hollywood sign, it's in full view from the observatory gardens.We visited on a Monday so the museum is closed but we enjoyed a walk around the grounds, the size of LA is staggering and well worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fulltimeholidayer
50,That view!,"The view of LA at night is simply amazing, one of the best things I have seen in my travels. Definitely worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alland956
30,"Incredible views, great photo opportunity, though crazy back-up and limited parking on the weekends","While visiting Los Angeles, we visited the Griffith Observatory after the hike to the Hollywood sign. The views of the city were definitely incredible. You could also see the Hollywood sign from this location however there are closer vantage points. The main disappointment was the limited parking and the long lines of cars for parking on the weekend we visited. I would recommend stopping at this sight early in the day, sometime before 11am. It seemed that everyone was fighting for parking spots and parking along the road. The windy road which takes you to the Observatory provided some great views, though there were limited stops along the way. The Observatory offered some great programs and once we were parked the property is a must-visit because of the views and picturesque sight. The building reminded me of Santorini with the white painted architecture set against the clear blue sky of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swood73
50,Fantastic,Caught an Uber taxi from Chinese Theatre in LA up to the Observatory only cost $8!Fantastic view from the top.. Superb information inside with lots of interesting boards to read. We did not do the Planetarium. There is no signal up at the Observatory but you can sign up for free Wifi so we were able to call for another uber to come pick us up this took about 10/15min wait but one did come.Well worth the trip a must see .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stitch02
40,Great for families,We kind of ended up here by mistake but it turned out to be a good mistake. We typed in Hollywood Sign into Google Maps and this is where it took us.Just on sunset our timing could not have been better. Traffic at the top was jam packed so get there early or you could have a long uphill trek.Perfect place to watch the sun set and then after that line up to look through the telescope we got to see Saturn and her rings.The kids really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonycX625IZ
50,Amazing views and amazing amount of Science,"This was an amazing place. The views, plus all the science exhibits. The James Dean Statue and seeing the Hollywood sign ties the whole thing together. Parking is a bit of crap shoot. We luckily ended up parking at the Observatory but people were parking back down the hill and walking up to it. You can't beat the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmQ4568BB
50,great view and exhibition,"pro: What a cool place. We came her only for the view over the city which is stunning by day... but even better after dark. But what's really cool it's the great and free science exhibition in the building!con: Parking was horrible. We had to park way down the road, probably b/c there was a concert nearby and everybody used the free parking up here?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesU9027JB
50,Long walk up but worth it.,"We may have gone on a particularly busy day but we couldn't access the official car park, instead parking down the hill, about 15 - 20 mins away. Long walk up, but not too bad going down.Stunning views of the Hollywood sign and a very interesting museum. The highlight for us was the optional (additional cost) planetarium show. It was $22 for four of us, so excellent value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balks36

30,Good place to spend an hour or less,"We went for the nice views of Los Angeles (it was a fairly clear day). Good place to walk around, see the Hollywood sign and downtown, then head out and go do other things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/551jena
30,Great spot to have a photo of the Hollywood Sign,We just went here because it's a great spot to have your photo taken with the Holkywood sign at the background. Was not able to enter the observatory as it was closed during our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spooncar9
50,Great spot to spend an afternoon,This is a wonderful place to get away from the downtown areas .the view from the top is amazing across LA .The exhibits are interesting and not too technical . Go and see the movies as they are excellent. The parking is a bit of an issue though as it is always very busy so be prepared to park a bit away and walk up the hillThe cafe is nothing special but adequateSomething there for all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billt1958
50,"A must see, add to your LA tour experience!","Spent the day at the Griffith Observatory on a whim, and we were sure glad that we did! It was amazing, and the view is spectacular! We attended the star gazing show inside and visited the cafe for refreshments but FYI, you can bring your own lunch, as the cafe is only snacks. Well worth the experience. Many photo opportunities and people watching, it draws in a large crowd of visitors from all over the world! A lot of walking, wear good walking shoes and bring your water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elsers1923
50,Great views,"The observatory is a great place to see the Hollywood sign and to see an aerial view of Los Angeles,it is also very educational.Rebel Without a Cause the movie starring James Dean was filmed here and the beautiful surronding park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotta263
50,More than just a great view of LA,They have considerably upgraded the observatory since my last visit here. We spent a lot longer time here than we initially thought. I would aim to go around 4ish so you have time to look at everything grab a coffee/snack then watch the sunset and then the telescopes open at 7pm for viewing the planets etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evil_twin2
50,Excellent Place to Escape,I would highly recommend a visit and you will leave wanting to know more about the universe. OR you might just enjoy the best views in LA. Don't get discouraged about finding parking place. Go to top of hill to parking lot and wait until someone pulls out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel246429
50,Views of Los Angeles,"Griffith Park is one of the best parts of Los Angeles. The Observatory is just a bonus because of the museum, shops, and views of the city. The skyline looks beautiful both day and night and it is actually a good place to hike and exercise. I have seen galas, private events, and photo shoots here because of the awesome views. It is very scenic and I would recommend this place to any tourist and Angeleno.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javieraM9241VA

50,"1 hour to 1 day, you decide","You can skim through here in an hour with a great experience. Or you can spend an entire day enjoying every offering. Things to do: the grounds and observation decks, telescope, planetarium shows (3 different shows), dining, theater, pendulum, exhibits/museum, and shop. Weekdays may be better; it was crowded on Sunday and parking was a long uphill hike away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,Griffith Observatory,Such a great view all different directions. We done as part of Insider Tours - LA in a day which was terrific. Didn't think we would spend much time here but we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieR2404
40,Short trip,Really good free attraction. We were trying to get to the bi Hollywood sign and ended up here by mistake but turned out to be a good mistake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankC2509
50,Amazing Hollywood sign & LA views!,Visited this on a Sunday. Very crowded but still totally worth the time and effort.We took the shuttle which only costs 50c per person (only operates on weekends and departs from the Vermont metro station) which took us right to the observatory. Amazing Hollywood sign and LA views. No entrence fee. Must do in LA we reckon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyaucknz
40,Nice place,Nice location and fascinating with most of it free. Cafe is good too. Weather was hotter than a barbecue in Jack the Rippers back garden so was a relief to be inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6216USsimonp
40,Great presentations and views of L.A.,"Great photo ops of the city at this place. We attended one of the shows about water and stars, etc. The woman who narrated the show was so soft spoken we almost fell asleep! It was so relaxing!There was a person dressed up as cookie monster. Sometime during our wait he was 86'd for harassing people lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieH1973
50,Great view!,Such a great place to visit but also very crowded on weekends. Expect delays as it takes time to drive up there and find a parking space. Also nice for a walk during the day. This was one of our highlights during LA visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41sladjanaa
20,no need to go,"If you love hiking, then probably you should go other than that there is not much to see from observatory. Holywood sign is rarely visible and the Los Angeles city is not the one what fascinates you with a beatiful view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d_kanan
50,Excellent place,"The place has nice views on the city and stunning view of the Hollywood sign. The observatory is nice and full of information, please be ready to spent at least 2-3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alkarpe
20,Parking is frustrating,Parking is a pain - this could be improved. Otherwise it's a nice venue with a good view. The staff are friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nrivy
10,Impossible to get to,"I bet I would love the views, the observatory, etc but I can never get here. Twice now I have tried to get to the observatory and drove up the mountain in traffic for 30 min and drove back down the other side after finding no parking. There are two narrow roads that go up and converge and create traffic and the parking on the side of the road is dangerous and inefficient and requires a long walk uphill.. if there is even an open spot. The system of parking and transportation here needs to be completely revamped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBoettch
50,Fantastic view,"We didn't go inside the observatory, we just walked the grounds and took pictures of the city and hollywood sign. Supposedly one of the best viewing spots for the sign but it was pretty far away. We were here today and it was foggy and overcast, could have been a whole lot better if it was a clear day.The Chinese and Japanese tourist are very ride, one lady pushed my wife to the side so she could get a clear shot of the sign. I've encountered these tourists many times in my travels and can't stand how rude they are",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WIWIandBRAD
50,Amazing changes since I last visited!,"The big picture is awesome. Be sure to catch the film in the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon theater that covers the extensive renovation. Great exhibits, fascinating science, fun shop, snack cafeteria with outdoor seating, fabulous views of LA...Plan to spend half a day at least!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoMillionMiles86
30,We could have skipped it,"Not a great place for the Hollywood sign photo op, the sign was too far. Interesting stuff inside. Parking was a challenge. Skyline view was ok. Well, it's a free attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peggah
50,Vaca,"Awesome location. Great viewing area, plenty of things to see. The planetarium was Great as well, would definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139hassant

50,Must visit in LA,"Great views across LA - a must do at sunset on a clear day to get some great photos. Park anywhere you can get a spot, tons of spots close and walk up the hill. Personally I think even though there are tons of tourists here it's very romantic. Enjoy !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321beccyc
40,God view,"This is a good LA attraction and a great view over LA and the famous Hollywood sign. Parking can be a problem, but if you are a walker there are good walks to be had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterandFrankieA
50,Super views on a clear day,"Staying in Hollywood it was a short drive to visit the Griffith Observatory. If you go early in the morning you have a good chance that you can park near the observatory. When this parking is full there are enough parking spaces along the roads to the observatory, but the walk is rather steep and therefor not easy for everyone. Once above and on a clear day this venue is ideal to overview LA and surroundings. From the backside you can see the Hollywood sign. Overlooking the city and the walking trails you can shoot beautifull pictures of the city and surroundings. No admittance fees at all, all visits are free of charge. A perfect way to view the city from above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmielMel
50,Saturn and mercury,Made the trek up Hillside with a 7 and 3 yr old. Not sure I'd recommend walking (was pretty steep in the dark with cars coming and no sidewalk for most of the hike). I would surely recommend making the trip by vehicle or shuttle (weekends only?) Even the 3 year was able to make out the planets he was viewing thru several available scopes on the evening we visited. The Hollywood sign is off in the distance but not very visible in the evening. Highly recommended the nightly view of the valleys down below is worth it alone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clampet79
50,Iconic View,"L.A. has few more iconic landmarks, or more breathtaking views. I take first-time visitors here every time. To this I must add the even-more-amazing view from the Getty off the 405. Between them, they show visitors the setting of the city from hills to the sea. Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paigeturner2
50,I wish i had spent more time,"this place is amazing. no charge at all. bring plenty of water, running shoes or sport shoes, there are signs of rattle snakes i however didn't see any i only saw lizards. inside the Griffith observatory there's a nice gift shop a little bit expensive though and a place to eat as well. I am more of an outdoor person and enjoyed more the hiking path. Next time i am in LA i'll be back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariovU1536HV
50,Beautiful Views!,Lovely place to see the sun set and the lights go on. All for free!! Experienced my first look of Mars in real time....neat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isybeat
40,Great spot for Night Shots of the City,"Went here to take pictures of downtown LA and so did the rest of the visiting population. Parking is in the lot and up and down the mountain. That was a little scary. If you park too far down, you will walk Up and Up and Up. It's worth it. The views were spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTracyS
50,WOW !,"You have to visit this if you are in L.A. The views are stunning, the observatory is fascinating.Be warned that parking is very limited, we were lucky enough to get a space in the car park, but if you don't you will have to park on the road or in the lower car park and walk u the hill.Walking up the hill looks tough if its hot so I would recommend taking some water with you. There is a cafe at the top.This also has to be the best views there are of the Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alex965
40,Overlooking in LA,"This place is amazing, especially if you are interested in astronomy. You can also see 'Hollywood 'sign in Griffith! This place is overlooking the downtown Los Angeles! Thereis no entrance fee or parking fee to visit. Just prepare for a very long walk cause parking can be challenging a in a hilly area . My most favorite thing to do here is to watch the moon closer in a high powered telescope. Also their presentation in a 3D dome about the Galaxy , etc.... Which I think is awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynD707
40,Hollywood,Lovely place to visit. Nice views of the LA as well as the 'Hollywood' sign. Really interesting inside also. Worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charcole9
40,Too little time here,As we were on a tour we only had 20 minutes here which really only allowed us to get pictures of the Hollywood sign. (this is the closest LEGAL place to get pictures of it). could have spent hours going through the actual observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLE0904
30,Nice experience,The place is easily accessible and have great view. You can see the Hollywood sign as well that you see in the movies.The tickets for the show are very much affordable and give you pretty much good knowledge about planets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393mohits

You can have a great view of hollywood signage from this place too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lion_chd
50,Best views in LA,Really crowded but it was a weekend too! And a very busy day...many schools were there and they were running and hiking. It was a wonderful place to spend an afternoon. I will definitely return on my next trip to LA. The views are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/punnina65

50,Amazing view of the stars and the city of LA,The drive up to the observatory was very fun. You are winding up the mountain side and feel like you are going to the top. The parking was really crazy. We parked way down the road and it was getting dark. Bring a flash light to walk along the road. There are cars parked on both sides of the road and part of the time you are walking along a steep cliff. There are shows available and a small museum. You can wait in line to look through various smaller telescopes and for the largest telescope. We didn't stand in line for that one but I'm sure it's really awesome. We saw Saturn through one of the smaller ones out on the lawn. This is a really great adventure for a family. There are bathroom facilities on the property with had washing sinks outside which helps the line go faster but means you have to touch the doors to get outside before you wash your hands. Prepare to stand in line for the shows and telescopes but it will be worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShellyM350
50,Photos,"Great views, great building. A must see on a clear day. Go in the evening and the building will have more color for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markdX8860EH
30,Nice views but otherwise I could have passed.,"We went and saw the film on the galaxy, it was well done and educational but nothing spectacular. The rest of the observatory I felt the same. The views were nice but we already walked to the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleDawn
40,Put on your list of things to do,"a great place to view the Hollywood sign as well get a good education on the stars and planets, it was extremely busy and crowded on the day of our visit but still well worth the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90diannek
40,It was nice to see!,It was definitely a must see attraction and you get a great view. I think the main fun is that it was also the set of a movie :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathern105

50,Incredible,Free and amazing. I think this was one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. The view was nice. The exhibits were great. The presenter by the periodic table was the best.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31chastityd
50,Come prepared for lots of pictures,"We hiked for a good hour and a half, the views were stunning. Bring a good pair of sneakers, sunscreen and a lot of water! It's worth the hike up those mountains, the views are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5738HUsharons
50,Worth the Trip,Very Nice Place. Fantastic Views of LA. Would of loved to do it in the night. The Observatory itself is incredible. lots to see. we went early 10am and it was hard to park. the further down the hill the harder the walk. but worth it. I noticed people with dogs. They all looked hot and tired. Leave your Pups at home................,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561JeffM561
50,A wonderful experience,We really enjoyed our trip to Griffith observatory. A great place to experience the vastness of the universe. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912maziyars
50,Spectacular,The observatory was a welcome surprise from others I have visited. It was more like a museum than an observatory. There were many interactive exhibits. It was very crowded that day and it was free if you stayed on the first three floors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momma225
50,Best views of LA skyline,"Had a great time up at the observatory, we went twice in one day first time was part of a tour group during the day and got some great photos and brilliant views of the skyline and the Hollywood Sign.The second was hours later once it was dark and we saw LA lit up like a christmas tree and it was lovely, very romantic if you can find a quiet spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PCBatman

40,Good day if you are with school age kids,"Been here with family - being located on top of hill, it offers excellent views over LA (no you dont see Hollywood sign clearly)It was super busy during my trip and could see loads of students around - no wonder as it had excellent resources, shows, real meteor rocks, informative sessions etc to keep kids and interested adults busy.My 8 yr DD thoroughly enjoyed it but cant be said same about my 2 yr old !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RK-Kaul
40,Gorgeous views just take your own transport......,"This is definitely a must-visit site when in LA. The views from up here are amazing! We went at Sunset with a picnic which I highly recommend doing. The exhibits inside are so interesting too and we enjoyed learning about astronomy and time - we did not pay to go into the main observatory but there are loads of free exhibits too. The only issue we had was that we were using Uber and 2 Uber drivers refused to come up the hill due to traffic (its quite far off the main street), we got stranded there for a while as there are no other transport options - I recommend driving in your own car if you decide to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ab2710
40,Amazing view of LA,The parking situation can be tricky at times but you will always find a parking spot. The view is great as you can see LA from Santa Monica to Dowtown. It is a great place to take a photo with the Hollywood sign as a background.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COMTECIERGE
50,Fantastic View Of The City Of Angels,"I love coming up here. The view is amazing, and it feels so peaceful. The observatory has so much information about astronomy. There are lots of fun exhibits to learn from. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
50,beautiful,We did the hike to the Griffith and I must say it was amazing. City views and the Hollywood sign in the back ground make for great photo ops. You can drive to the top and parking is okay. We decided to do the hiking trail this time as we drove up last time.Either way you will get great views of Downtown LA and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWaters41
50,What a treat!,"This was a great find! We headed up here to walk to the Hollywood sign, and went to the observatory first to look at the views of LA - well worth it by the way - but ended up going inside and spending a couple of hours there. Really fascinating. If you're interested in space, NASA etc it's fantastic.Definitely worth a look - and free!! Plenty of parking etc. and we had lunch there too.if you do want to walk the Hollywood sign from here you can see it from a distance, and if you walk for about an hour it's closer, with fabulous views all round. Take plenty of water though. There's lots a great routes to walk from the observatory of varying distances.,However, if you want to get up close to the sign without a hefty walk you're better off driving closer and walking from there - lots of websites have info on this. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynsnpaul_10
40,Must visit! Great Views,"If the weather is clear, and you don't mind walking up & down hills, this is a great outing and understandably popular. On a Tuesday afternoon, we could park our car for free about 5 minutes walk from the Observatory. There is a drop-off area at the Observatory itself if some of you can't manage the walk.This was our third brief visit to LA and our first trip to the Observatory. It was fun to pick out where we'd been, and get a sense of how big the city really is.The astronomy exhibits also look pretty neat, but we weren't in the head space for it.Be sure to check out the Camera Obscura",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8nTO

50,Amazing view,Stopped of here on a day tour. Very busy when we stopped off however very informative trip. Also a great way to see the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenmZ7529IR
50,Extraordinary Place,"Yes its a scene out of ""Transformers"" and the kids may notice that. I had no idea, my grandkids told me. This historic observatory offers a chance to take in so much informatin about our solar system & more at one's own pace. Pay Attention to everything, starting with the marks in the sidewalks approaching the observatory, indicating the orbits of various planets, to scale, in our solar system. TESLA exhibit, scale models inside of planet sizes, and of course the films.... Go see it all and enjoy. PLUS spectacular Los Angleles views including close up to the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenna77
50,Fantastic... and free!,"A really interesting and informative way to spend a couple of hours, and entry is free! Planetarium shows do cost $7 per adult, but it's money well spent!We went in the evening, after dark, and the views across LA are really spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2749RAjimh
30,A bit of a walk on a weekend,"During the week you park next to where you take your pictures but at the angle it offers, your images will just say ""HOLLYWOOO"" as the ""D"" is obscured from that angle. It's really distant too. I thought it would be closer. Also we visited on a Sunday and the car park was filled up so we had to park half a mile away as directed by staff so if you're visiting then go early or in the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dannyboybear
50,The Big Bang theory explained,"Went here during the week, thinking we'd miss the crowds, we were wrong. Although the parking lot was full and people were parking on the street leading up to the observatory. ( quite long and very steep walk) Everything in the observatory is free other than the planetarium show, That was a simple low price, The entire place is handicapped accessible and the staff is wonderful. Different shows in the planetarium as well as the exhibits change so look up on line to see what's there. There is a very nice cafeteria on the premises overlooking the property. Every new moon there observatory offers shy gazing along with loaner telescopes and individuals that will assist your star gazing. A must while you're here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx
50,Return to observatory,"Excellent place to visit, spectacular views of LA. Inside the observatory there are a lot of cool stuff to look at. The planetarium is well worth a visit. Also from the observatory you can walk along different trails and get some amazing views of the observatory and the surrounding area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KHR62
50,Incredible Views,A great first stop as you tour LA; you can see the city spread out before you from the Observatory's perch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c1lm2
40,Well worth a visit,"You could spend a whole day exploring the park, or maybe go before sunset for the views which are excellent. We went to one of the planetarium shows - Centered in the Universe which was a bit disappointing especially the awful voiceover by one of the staff.There's parking on the road - go up past The Greek theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR-Greenwich
50,The Man in the Moon!,"Brilliant experience, especially being under the dome of the observatory when it was rotated for a view of the moon, which rose whilst we were waiting!The views of LA are fantastic - love looking back over our photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrispyBing
50,Fantastic views of LA!,"Griffith Observatory is a must visit. It's not only a beautiful place and building, but also provides you an almost 270 degrees view on LA. Its not so far from Hollywood Boulevard/Sign and a more attractive place to visit imo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennM352
50,Hollywood View From High,Great view from up here overlooking LA and Hollywood sign good place for photographs. The observatory has so much to offer for families to help understand the planets in our universe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrackingJohn
50,Beautiful at night,"Breathtaking at night. We went on a Sat. Night at 7:30pm. The traffic was a nightmare because of the Greek theatre. If you can avoid it on a Sat. Night in the summer, do it. I was in town for business and brought my daughter with me. She really wanted to go and since we live on the east coast, we suffered throughly the 45 mins of traffic in our uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perkinator
50,Extremely well done,"It's my grandsons favorite place to take out of town company. He is 11 and lives in the LA area. It's extremely well done and interesting for all ages. But get there early early because parking can be a nightmare. If you are interested in space, the planets, comets, the elements, and science then you will love the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gigiandjerry
50,A unique place !!!!!,"I was with my wife visiting from Las Vegas, Nevada on a Saturday and it was a unique experience. Arrival was a bit slow that night was a full moon and the observatory was full of visitors. Arriving one finds with an experience of seeing some of the most beautiful areas of Los Angeles. super organized, well kept surroundings. staff trained in service. one of the places that can not happen when you are in LA and have enough to be enjoyed and watch the sunset time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/848reyr
40,"Great view, limited opening hours","We went here on a recommendation and were blown away by the great views of LA and the Hollywood sign, but the observatory itself doesn't open until late in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoonerBal007
50,Sit Back and Gaze at the STARS!,"THIS IS A MUST DO when in LA no matter what sort of a day it isThe drive up to the observatory is spectacular - taking you past beautiful homes, and park landParking can be a little tricky once you're at the observatory - so choose a good time AND BE PATIENTIf you don't want to spend money on going to the planetarium - the observatory itself is a great free excursion - plenty of interactive displays, object and astronomical artefacts to seeThe art Deco architecture is perfectly balanced and set against views of LA and the ocean, are far beyond - Stunning to beholdThe jewel in the crown is a visit to a planetarium showWe even located James Dean's parking lot -We sat back and were given what could be described as an emotional tour of the heavens - FANTASTICA GREAT AFTERNOON",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Q4W
50,Great views,"This place is great for views over the city and for picture opportunities, I'm not into the 'space/Stars' stuff but it was good to look around and it's Free, you can see the Hollywood sign but it's fairly far away to see a good view of the sign go to ' Lake Hollywood Park ' it's a green area under the sign and great for pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kev977
50,Absolutely Incredible,"I was very keen to go, my wife and 18 year old son less so, but what a day.......This is quite simply one of the most impressive attractions I have been to anywhere. The building is beautiful, the views invite superlatives, the exhibits are excellent and the staff all helpful and informative. The icing on the cake is the planetarium which in terms of content was mind blowing, and had to be the bargain of the century at $7 a head !!! Parking can be a problem even mid afternoon weekday and if like us you try to go around 1800 when there is a show at the nearby Greek Theatre then forget it. Otherwise, keep trying.... This is a must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IaninPerthshire
50,Great Views,"It was a stop on our ""A Day in LA"" tour and was a great place to see all of LA and the Hollywood sign. The Tesla Coil exhibition was neat, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiamF9811CJ
40,Would Be Better At Night,The Griffith Observatory is pretty cool. There are shows that you can book in advance but I assume they'd be best at night if you are wanting to see anything worthwhile. The information within the observatory is well worth a read if you are interested in Astronomy and science.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8656MPsamuelm
50,"As a local, this is my #1 recommendation for anyone visiting Los Angeles.","As a local, this is my #1 recommendation for anyone visiting Los Angeles. It's free and it includes exercise to walk off al the extra weight you've been eating. Located in Los Feliz which is a trendy, small, lovely community, many locals come here to go for a hike. You can either do a hike or visit the observatory - or BOTH!If visiting the Observatory, pray for available parking and then go all the way to the top. If you can't find anything, you can park along the road. If you will be hiking, I'd recommend parking towards the bottom of the hill. There's plenty of parking there.Afterwards, plan to have lunch or dinner at any of the trendy restaurants in the area. All are delicious so pick one that suits your taste buds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caliiitrav
50,Great Views and Trails,We went early in the morning and there was plenty of parking. We liked that there were plenty of bathrooms there. Loved the hiking trails and the views. Just beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NY3032
50,"The TOP TEN PLACES ""You have to Go To"" When in Los Angeles.","Wether you are simply visiting Los Angeles, or you are a resident. I claim the Griffith Observatory to be one of the Top Ten ""Places you Have To Go To"" when here.It is mesmerising. Alongside, you leave feeling extremely mindful and in touch with your surrounding alongside the galaxy that surrounds you and your surroundings.I learnt many facts and theories when visiting. A lot of history. I saw a view like no other.I recommend this place to ALL. Especially to Photographers, Videographers, and Spiritual beings that have been in touch with that side of themselves or are beginning to touch base with it.The staff are really cool, and will always teach you something you didn't know (so you can go to bed happy knowing you learnt something new today.)Great areas for picnics, general relaxing, and reading your book.Parking may sometimes be a mission, other times not so much - it truly depends when you are visiting. Otherwise, if you park further down and walk up, it is a whole other joyous experience in itself. I recommend it!Night time, and Sunset is fantastic at the Griffith Observatory! You just never know what you'll see and the wide array of colors displayed to you.I truly hope that this review aids you in your want to visit this place, and that your experience will be as good as the one I had, if not, better!Any questions you may have, I hope to answer them to the best of my abilities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieVance
40,Be prepared for large crowds,The Griffith Observatory is by far the best viewing location for the Hollywood sign and the beautiful Hollywood hills. If your feeling adventurous and have time you can also venture on a bush walk from around these parts. Do be prepared for large crowds and a bit of a walk or wait for a car park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripinator146
50,A fantastic way to spend an evening,This place was so stunning at night my daughters and I visited it a few times. Helpful and friendly staff made our visits most enjoyable and the views are spectacular! Would highly recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jo-MollyBennett
50,Will go back any time I'm in L.A.,"So sad we didn't make it back for an evening visit to take advantage of the amazing telescope, but our day visit was fantastic. We arrived before they opened, but that wasn't a problem because there's much to explore on the grounds. Statues of famous scientists (Archimedes, Copernicus, Kepler, etc...) and James Dean (what a great combo). Also great hiking trails, a great view of the Hollywood sign, and the best panoramic view of the area. Once it opened (at noon, I think), we spent a couple of hours at the displays. If you don't have much time, it would still be good to zip through, but there's much to linger on, if you can. The gift shop has some unique items and very nice employees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliathegr82
50,Great observatory with fantastic views of Los Angeles,Griffith has excellent views of Los Angeles. The observatory itself was pretty crowded and parking is definitely a chore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonl32
50,Very cool,Admittedly stumbled upon this on my quest for the HOLLYWOOD sign. Really interesting facts and a beautiful place to go with the trails and fantastic views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatG_13
30,Great once you get in.,"Went on a Friday night, spent over an hour in bumper to bumper traffic just inside the parking area. Long walk back up after we had to park at the bottom of a dark road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpX2351PX
40,Amazing knowledge and brilliant views,"Located on a hill, Griffith is an awesome place to view the skyline of LA, the hollywood sign and more importantly view the planets through telescope. When we visited, the telescopes were pointed towards Saturn so we got to see that. Along with it there is Tesla coil and that gets demonstrated at different times. There are also 3 different shows ehich you can see in the dome theatre for $7 per person and those are amazing. Only problem with this place is parking. Cars are mostly parked along the road down the hill as the parking lot here is always full. Anywhere between 0.5-1 mile hike would be necessary in that case. But other than that it is a brilliant place and an amazing experience to learn and see amazing views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/167tarar
50,Must See and Free,"Thanks Los Angeles and donors for the Griffith Observatory. This is a wonderful site to visit. If you decide to visit, please be prepared to spend at least 3-4 + hours to see it all. Take advantage of the educational opportunities as well as the remarkable views. Know that there isn't ample parking but if you don't mind a short walk you WILL find a place. There are two presentations once inside: the Leonard Nemoy theatre presentation is no charge; there is a fee to attend the show in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium ($7 adults, $3 children, $5 seniors and students). There is no charge for entry or parking.There is a cafe inside. There are elevators.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,Impressive by day.,"A trip up the winding roads to the top of the Griffiths Observatory was well warranted for its highly impressive view of the city, not to mention the detailed and historic value that it offers inside. Only wish I had more time to spend there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8399QYmarting
50,Beyond Excellence,"If you are in LA, you HAVE to visit the observatory. And the best thing about it is that it is free! Just imagine having access to so much awesomeness, free of charge! There are tons of exhibits and lots to learn. Even if you are not interested in the galaxy I am pretty sure, something here will definitely interest you.Parking is free, but there is less space in the main area. If you aren't lucky, you might have to park on the street (parallel parking) but still there is enough space if you look for it. The shows are awesome. They are the only paid-for events. The narrators are class apart and the auditorium is impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyamGopani
50,A must visit for everyone in (or visiting) LA,The Griffith is a spectacular facility and property that is great in both the day and for evening tours. A MUST SEE for anyone visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailor279
50,My (LA local) Fav place Los Angeles,I have been here almost 10 times and still never gets tired of this place. The lawn with green grass is perfect place for a small dinner picnic under the stars during summers or for a Lunch picnic under the sun during winters.Watching stars from the volunteer's telescope or look at the moon.I love the view from the top and sometimes the hike.Oh and Best part you can spot celebrity sometime running or walking pets :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMATIYANI

50,The real star of Los Angeles,Planetarium visit was brilliant. Personal narration which was superb and really knowledgable. A gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB2714
50,Must see!,"Disclaimer: I am a sucker for old Hollywood glam and movies.This lived up to every expectation I had. The views are crazy picturesque and beautiful. You just want to stand there and take it all in.The Observatory itself has some great interactive exhibits and plenty of people who are friendly and eager to answer any questions.As a tourist depending on Google maps app- Word to the wise- there seems to be two driving paths to take. One way you pass the Greek theater, the other way is all windy steep hills. I had the experience of taking both drives, one at night and the other in the daytime. Do yourself a favor and take both ways for the experience, but if you're crunched for time take the Greek Theater route. The windy roads can be a but unnerving.Overall an absolute must see experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleR7
40,Beautiful 360 degree view,"Great view from top. Try to be there on a full moon day. I saw venus, saturn and moon. They also explained with great zeal. You have to ignore the parking hazards for this.Definitely visit again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pritammukherjee
50,Very interesting place to visit. Great views,"Always check it is open, as the first time we visited it was closed. It is very popular with school children, especially during the week.

50,"Plan you're day, everyone else has the same idea!!","Many a film has the sprawling view of LA from here.. the Day or Night view..so just be aware there's probably a couple of thousand other tourists, thinking this'll be a great place to visit !! It's the parking and approach to the Observatory, that's the real issue. it gets clogged up pretty quickly.. In essence try and avoid Weekends and try to see what's on at the Observatory and Greek and avoid those nights..But do go as it's beautiful and a great view..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzydisney

50,Hollywood tours,"First time LA for my friends-so we went for a tour to Griffith Observatory. As we drove through the hills- we saw Hollywood stars homes ( Ed Asner, J Lo, ). We did note how the California drought had affected the area-but- it was a beautiful ride with awesome views of the city, mountains and the Hollywood sign. Many people were hiking the trails or just enjoying the cool breeze. The Observatory is open to the public. Awesome place full of info.

50,Must do!,"In my opinion this is an attraction you must see when you're in Los Angeles! I went and night and saw some beautiful views of the LA skyline. I wish I had time during my visit to go during the day time too. The place is free and has a lot of interesting exhibits, including telescopes set up to view the moon and other cosmic bodies (Jupiter when we were there).

50,Fantastic view!!,"The view from the observatory is amazing - you can see the city, the mountains, and of course the iconic Hollywood sign.

30,Brief taste but was perhaps enough,"Worth a visit for just the stunning backdrop in the form of Griffith Park & a photo opportunity for/with the world famous Hollywood hillside sign.

The observatory is free to visit and only $7 for the shows in the planetarium theatre.The observatory is family friendly and the exhibits are aimed at an adult audience (it's nice that they didn't dumb things down).I'd highly recommend not driving and take the shuttle to the observatory, it's only 50 cents per passenger each way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/needs2escape

The observatory is small, but perfectly formed; a great place to take your young kids to engage them in the wonders of the planets.Car parking is tight, there are about 12 dedicated motorbike bays as well.Good views of the Hollywood sign (though it might not come out too clear on the iPhone camera!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phils312

50,Go On A Clear Day,"Go early, stay for a picnic, snap photos of the Hollywood sign and see SoCal in all it's busyness and yet be above it. We like to go with each new display is introduced. The planet display is great. We always buy a science item at the gift store. The show is inspiring. Sometimes you have to park a bit up or down hill so wear walking shoes. The night opportunity to see through the telescope will wow anyone. Enjoy the slow pace of reading the descriptions and letting the kids take it all in - no time restrictions. We take photos outside with the Hollywood sign in the background as the kids grow each year. It's a must see for tourists since getting a shot of the Hollywood sign from the freeway is iffy at best and dangerous at least!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanlN183UD
50,Best view in LA,"This is one of my favourite places to go, the climb (drive) up the hills are an excellent start to your visit. When you arrive it's so peaceful at the top, even if it's busy there is still an air of space, literally. You don't have to pay to get into the museum but the observatory has a entrance fee, it is worth it though. It's still worth a visit as the views are tremendous, closed on Mondays so it's extra quiet for anyone going just for the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408francese
50,Excellent,Best planetarium. I likes every part of it. I watched all the three shows and explored every section of the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purushottamjha

50,Stargazer Galore,"Well I was worried about this one, especially with younger children (11 & 9). However, my boys loved it!!! We spent the afternoon here until dark so we could see through the big telescope. Well worth it. We took in two shows which was just superb. This place has so much to offer and is quite larger than meets the eye. Put this one on your list. Go later in the afternoon so you can see the big telescope",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guinnessc

50,Awesome place to visit,"Great fun visiting here, and totally free apart from the planetarium show. Very informative and interesting even if you don't have a great interest in astronomy. Easy to understand displays and models make it an educational visit as well as great views from the drive up and the observatory itself. The free show in the Leonard Nimoy theatre downstairs was easy to miss but worth seeing as it gives you a history of the observatory as well as how it was built. Can also see the Hollywood sign from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgjenner
50,Out of this world ( literally ),"This is the best city view, If you want to see the sun set get to the park / observatory early as it gets crazy busy, a lot of people left just after sun set freeing up the parking. The views of LA are exceptionally good and this is a must do in LA. The observatory lets you view with the telescope for free and we look at Saturn, it was unreal (out of this world) Just outside they had other free viewings with a smaller telescope of the moon. Go early see the sun set and look around at night, don't miss the out of space viewing. Do not miss this on your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WesUK-USA

50,The best place to Get Above it All in Los Angeles,"Being down in Los Angeles can get wearisome with all the traffic and congestion, but up at the Observatory you really feel a peace being above it all. There is no charge to visit, unless you go to the Planetarium show or special events, but even then the admission is really reasonable. Everybody loves the view of the Hollywood sign from here, and everyone comes away with photos they love, so I recommend it for family, couples, firends, or solo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
50,Amaising building with magnificent view!,The Griffith observatory was one of the highlights of my trip to LA. A magnificent building and museum area inside as well as showcasing marvelous views of both LA and the Hollywood Sign in the distance!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathanh723
50,Love this place!,"My daughters treaded me to a visit here while I was visiting them in LA. We had a great time touring the observatory and absolutely loved the show we saw in their theatre. Can't wait to go back & visit again. When visiting LA, you don't want to miss a visit to this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4CaliGals
50,Impressive,A beautiful place located in a very nice park. Very educational for children and grownups as well full of fascinating things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristian_Paul_Banu
50,Visions of The Stars,This place is a must see. Beautiful grounds and outstanding views!! My family and I went to the observatory and we blown away by how magical it was. We also hiked the grounds around it and saw a coyote. This place would be great for romance too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammyk471
50,Best views of LA,"Considering the great views afforded by this location, it didn't take us long to find it from our base in Hollywood. Free of charge too. Really worthwhile for snaps of the world famous Hollywood sign. Helpful and knowledgeable people that were just itching to tell you a story about Pluto or the rings around Saturn. This ranks highly amongst all the activities we undertook during our two week vacation. I'd recommend you pay a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38SteveG
50,"If you have time, this is a must see!","Things this good usually charge entrance fee but here its FREE. Without doubt one of LA's iconic and must see locations. The views over LA are amazing, crystal clear days obviously the best. The observatory itself is extremely interesting and will appeal to all ages incl children. Also if you like hiking the trails through the park have magnificent views, reasonable fitness required, good walking shoes and plenty of water. Fantastic 360 panorama from top and good photo opportunity of the famous 'Hollywood' sign. Weekends obviously very popular with locals and tourists, weekdays would be quieter. This should be one of your MUST SEE visits to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterpZ9093OC
50,"Astronomy, Movies and Views",It's a bit of a drive up and parking not great when busy. We headed towards the observatory mid morning and were lucky to find a parking space although it was a good 20 minute walk from the Observatory. After a pleasant uphill stroll you are rewarded with the sight of the Griffith Observatory and great views over the various parts of Greater Los Angeles and Downtown. You also have the Hollywood sign in the background. There's the monument to James Dean for his movie Rebel Without a Cause too. Inside the Observatory there are exhibits and you can pay extra for the planetarium. Gift shop and cafe nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanTeddyBear
30,Griffith Observatory: Great Views On A Sunny Day,"I went to the observatory on a day that kept trying to rain. The clouds were low so the visibility was low. Go on a sunny day. There were also hundreds of school children so it was very crowded. The drive up the mountain is interesting and for a short excursion, it would be fine. Don't plan to spend much time there unless you are an astronomer or scientist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okladytexas
40,Fun hiking,"It's a great place to observe the scenery of Los Angeles. it's a great place to enjoy nature as well as science, they have a great museum inside the observatory as well as lots of hiking trails all around..They have parks where you can enjoy with the family..a very fun place to go..!! I enjoy my self a lot everyone I visit this place, lots to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676jcg
50,Great place!,"I loved this observatory. It had great views of LA and was open and lovely. I loved the exhibits inside. I felt they were a nice overview of astronomy, sun and the moon. I think this would be a great place for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatieMac22222
50,Top 10 attraction for Los Angeles,"The parking is free but erratic. Sometimes you can park very close, other times you must park about 1/4-1/2 a mile away and walk uphill (but the walk after is downhill and gorgeous so no complaints). The view is breathtaking. The other patrons come from all over the world and you will hear many languages other than English. The exhibits are wonderful as well as educational. It never gets so crowded it's uncomfortable so you will get to see everything you desire. The one warning - all the shows sell out and quick. So if you want to see a show at 7, 830 or 10 then get a ticket online in advance or get a ticket at LEAST an hour and half before. If you don't arrive to the theater before the show starts you will not be let in. No exceptions. Clearly some shows are more popular than others with the laser light Pink Floyd show the most popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markbE7956FS
50,Lovely,Perfect place to take visiting friends and relatives. Beautiful scenery and a great show inside. Wonderful hiking options afterward.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miller2theresa
40,Amazing views of Los Angeles ' heat revisited.,"We visited on a Sunday , which most of Los Angeles did also , Greek theatre had a gig on, so grid lock up the hill....Should charge , to improve amenities rest rooms horrible , cafe horrible , parking a nightmare ....if you are not fit you should not go,Needs to charge a small cover And reinvest the revenue in parking and amenities ...A must see though as simple as that",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjh777
50,Do not miss the Laser Show.,The Laser Show on the Ceilling of the Observatory is world class.Many People outside with there Own Powerful Telescopeswill let you look at the stars and planets on there equipment.great spot to view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitchieH_12
40,Fun for any age,"Great activity for anybody at any time & any season! Nice view of DTLA on a clear day, historic place with plenty of interesting things to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinaLACA
40,Visit at night,"At night, this place has one of the best views of the city of Los Angeles, very charming. Plus, there is the museum, and nearby is the greek theatre. It is a must-see if you are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuhammadJ203
50,Griffith Observatory,Walk through the park to reach the summit. Try to go late afternoon to experience the amazing sunsets.The Observatory provides information about its history and astronomy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3442HDbarbaras
50,Always Fun,"A good place to hang out and/or attend miscellaneous events, with great views of LA and the Hollywood sign. Some nice little hikes end up here. The downside is finding parking (hence, sometimes it's easiest to take a short hike from below.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2365ZVdavidw
50,More than just stars!!,"As a Los Angeleno living in Los Feliz, this is an excellent place to walk/hike up to. Griffith Observatory is a very classy Art Deco building that wears its age well. It is beautiful and iconic.Inside the building you will find a collection of astronomical interest that should take an hour or less. From the outside you have a beautiful view of downtown L.A. along with a view of the Hollywood sign and then some.Very much worth a visit whether walking up or driving. There is a shuttle service on the weekends that you can catch from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Station. Driving up can be a hassle of traffic but very much worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EarthTravelersFour
50,Starry Night and Griffith Observatory bucket list UNFULFILLED,"Let's begin with - IF you want to get in to see the telescope- make sure you know The Greek Theater's schedule. We went on our only night I. Hollywood and last night in California. The line of traffic to get to the top was over an hour.While trying to find parking and then getting up the stairs - took more time - I was in line with my 2 daughters with 15 minutes left before the 9:30 close for the telescope.We weren't allowed in- NO EXCEPTIONS!!We were behind a Mexican woman who originally was only 1 person but as she got closer to the front- she allowed 6 other people or so in with her. This put us back further and denied access inside. Totally unfair. I even told the people in front it wasn't. Doesn't matter.So - doubt I'll ever be able to see it again.The view alone from the observatory of downtown LA at night is incredible and forever imprinted in my heart. Hollywood sign is to the side and probably during the day, a great place to view it.I've studied astronomy in HS and college, not just a tourist. It was a complete disappointment that I wasn't allowed in, despite being in line before close.They need to put a ribbon or cut off tape behind the people that are in line on time to be fair.Truly, was a complete disappointment for me not to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellabunny007
30,Nice views,"We went there in Sunday afternoon , month of September.A long queue of cars on the way . The traffic was moving slowly . It seems not but parking is easy to find .In the late afternoons, weather up there is chilly.No admission fee. In one of the domes is a 12 inch telescope that opens at 7 pm. For the public. The moon is on view .Nothing very special to see . The views of LA by night are impressive .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209melinab
40,Excellent hike and free admission,The park has various hiking trails that are popular during the weekends to get the blood flowing. The museum is free and the views are breathtaking on a clear day and at night. It's a fun location to go with the family or on a date if your significant other is into outdoor activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polek2014
50,Worth a visit!!,"We recently visited after living in the area off and on for the past 15+ years and were pleasantly surprised! Parking can be a hassle on busy weekends, but it's free and so is the museum! Great views of the iconic Hollywood Sign and downtown Los Angeles as well as everything Griffith park has to offer. The cafe was decent too! The planetarium does have a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kidhauler
10,Big Disappointment,"We went to Griffith on Aug along with my girls, once we approched the place traffic start piling up and once reach the top of the hill marshales ask us to go down again since the place was full and there are no place to park the car and when we ask were should park the car they simply say : you have 3 miles down the hill in the carve side of the roadWe did not expect this at all and we had to skip the visitIn such well known place orgonizer must make a sulotion using the wide area below the hill for car parking and arrange for a shuttle bus to the site",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aboaziz
50,Summer Day Outing,I took out of town guests to the observatory and they loved the place. It offered unobstructed view of Los Angeles and it was a clear day and one could see to the Pacific Ocean. The place was well maintained although packed with people and parking was a problem. I had to park all the way down and hiked up to the observatory. The hassle was soon forgotten with the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireesp
50,Worth,The public star party night was fantastic! Over a dozen amateur astonomers set up telescopes on the lawn to complement the permanent 80-year old Zeiss telescope. Beautiful views of the city in all directions. Strongly advise taking the Dash shuttle from the Vermont & Sunset Blvd Metro station - 50 cents each way or 35 cents if you have a tap transit card. (Shuttle service on weekends only.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katieh321
50,A good way to spend a day,"It is really educational and interesting for children and adults. The observatory is 90 years old but is well kept up and looks like the the day it opened. Some aspects of it feel like you are in an old black and white Boris Karloff movie, a good thing. If you go on a clear day you can see downtown and Catalina. Afterwards go to historic Musso and Frank's Grill and you will have experienced some of the best of old Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412carole
50,Extremely educational,"Came here because my child had a homework assignment to do. We've been here before, and it's amazing that I discovered something that I didn't see before.So many exhibits to look at. It gets really crowded, so at times, you can't spend as much time reading something as you would like. It's free, so defintely a good reason to come back. Parking can be dificult. If you are REALLY lucky, you can park at the upper lot which is a shorter walk to the observatory. If you aren't that lucky, there is street parking which is free along the drive up to the observatory. Even better, take the shuttle bus! It will drop you off even closer to the observatory!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293joyceg
50,Stunning views of LA and the Hollywood sign!,Visited in the late afternoon. Walked around the observatory and learned quite a bit about astronomy. The garden and nearby trails offered sweeping views of LA and nearby areas. Certainly the best place to photograph the iconic Hollywood sign. Well worth the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l_pelangi
50,Best view of LA.,"If you arrive earlier in the morning you can park right up at the observatory. Later in the day you have to park at the Greek theater and take a shuttle up, which is no big deal, really. You can get a great view of the Hollywood sign and of the downtown skyline. You can also your the observatory for free. There is a small fee to see the planetarium show but I haven't done that for years. We have taken guests of all ages up there and have just shown them the skyline to touring the observatory and all have been delighted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visited49
50,Seeing the Stars!!!!!,"My experience at the Griffith Observatory was phenomenal and very fun, You don't have to be an astronomer to visit this place because you will learn amazing thing here especially the virtual Samuel Oschin Planetarium show it has been upgraded to the new technology making it more interest and fun to experience how the galaxy is all about. Plus tons of things to see and experience, Like the public telescope. Highly recommend this to any one who want to enjoy themselves and learn some astrology..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/checo454
50,Love The Obsevatory - A Favorite of Native Angelenos,"I loved this as a child, as a teen and as an adult. The views, the surroundings, the feeling by just being at the Observatory are spectacular. The renovations made several years ago, were needed and they kept the feel of a beautiful bygone era. The architechture is SPECTACULAR. The displays are interesting, the shows informative. , It feels like old Hollywood. Bring a pic nic, buy lunch in the cafe, come and enjoy Los Angeles and maybe you will understand why the native Angelenos love LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretapar
50,A fun place to be...meet nice people and learn about our solar system...,"This is an absolutely interesting and exhilarating place to be...usually we (my dtr.) hike the trail which leads to the observatory. It normally takes about 45 minutes to hike; but of course you can take the street-route and park either along side of the street or within the parking lot of the observatory...and of course parking is free. Once on the grounds, you will enter a world of endless possibilities. By all means, take your time. There really is no need to be in a hurry. You can enter into the actually observatory and again, there is no charge for entering. The telescope is unbelievable and the views will cause you to believe in something (Someone) greater than yourself. Once you've finished viewing the galaxy, feel free to go to the newly opened restaurant on the premises. There's outdoor seating and the view is priceless. I'd really suggest that you take your time. Take your shoes off even and walk in the grass. Have fun and enjoy the scenery. You will be so glad you did...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TbSott
40,Incredible view at night,"Went there around 7 and stayed until 9. Amazing view of Los Angeles!! There is a little ""space/science"" museum, which is just super cute and actually very interesting. There's even a little café if you need snacks and drinks! Only downside, there is a LOT of traffic, so trying to get in and out is a mess. We used a Uber to get in, but whenever we tried getting one to leave, it was impossible. Honestly, gather 50¢ per person and use the nevette. It leaves you near a metro station, from where you can either use the subway or call a uber. 100 times easier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wordsofsass
40,Walk to see the Hollywood sign,Great spot to have a walk and take advantage of great views of LA and the famous Hollywood sign. The observatory is a lovely building too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835raewynb
50,Great Experience!!,"I had an opportunity to visit Griffith Observatory over Labor Day Weekend. I'm local to this area, but I don't make it up to Griffith as often as I would like. It's a great piece of LA history with a stunning view (on clear nights), a great observatory science museum, and some fascinating planetarium shows. It's a wonderful place for families, a romantic spot for couples, and a ""must see"" for anyone who loves astronomy, architecture, LA history, and a great view.The only drawback is that the drive up the hill can get a bit congested, and parking availability at the top is limited. There are shuttles available on select weekend days from the Metro Redline station at Vermont/Sunset or from the Greek Theatre. You can also park at the Greek Theatre and enjoy a nice little hike up the hill to the observatory.Well worth the visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534crystalt
50,Griffith observatory,My kids and grandkids love going to the observatory. The views outside are incredible. The exhibits are very educational and awe inspiring. There's always something new/different to learn regardless of how many times you have visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Motle
50,Beautiful,A heck of a view of Los Angeles and a great closer picture of the Hollywood sign. Parking is free we just parked next to the road as there was some film shoot at the observatory that day but it had just finished so we walked up to the observatory and admired the views. Had a picnic and left. Worth the visit if you've hired or own a car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakhello147
10,No regard for pedestrian safety,"Visited here 9/12/2016 well tried to. We drove up towards the Observatory which was closed, but knowing this we were just going to walk one of the trails. Firstly the parking on the road was ridiculous cars everywhere, so we drove back through the tunnel and parked in one of the parking lots. We decided to walk up towards the Observatory but the only access was to walk through a dark tunnel with two way traffic, It was so dangerous and I cant believe with all the health and safety regulations in this day and age, that the stewards were telling people to walk through this tunnel with no footpath. I refused to do it as cars were speeding through. People were walking with dogs and youngsters. Whoever decided on this arrangement should be ashamed of themselves. We then decided to leave. Will never visit there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jul2111
50,Learn something while you're at it.,Besides the spectacular views of LA this place has a history and puts everything into perspective. Just amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187bravo
20,Was crowded and couln't find parking,This place was highly disorganized. Spent more than one hour finding a parking spot. Finally after one hour gave up the idea and went back home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/304tuans
50,Fun and free,"Great place to check out. Free to get in and there is a great view of the Hollywood sign, and amazing hiking right from the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seizetheday954
50,Best place ever,Go on a night when there is some astrnomical event. You can view the sky with their awesome telescopes! The view is perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christir944
50,Beautiful views of LA,"We drove up as we had 20 minute or so to spare driving back from Los Felix. Wow were we pleased we did. The views were glorious! We stopped on the way up and down to take photos, saw plenty of walkers out, there are a lot of cars near the observatory but there were spaces to park if you were patient. We didn't go into the observatory but I will visit next time. Highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillM232
40,Wonderful views of a great city,We battled to find parking at this popular LA spot so be prepared!The views are fantastic from the top and the vibe is very relaxed and informative. If it is busy be prepared for queues at the restrooms!The viewing areas are amazing and the exhibitions that are free are very informative and explain some aspects of astronomy as well as California's rich contribution to this field of study.Colonel Griffith made it the observatory possible after making his money mining silver in Mexico - another reason for Americans to be thankful to their southern neighbor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoddyPayne
50,Great view of LA,"I have had high expectations before I go there last night, yet the breathtaking view exceeded my expectations.. This place is a must visit, and the night view is just amazing, surely if you have a pro camera its a must take then. I went around 9 pm on a Sunday, the place was very crowded, the parking lot was full, but well it was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466ahmedj
30,Nice observation point,"During high season of tourists in LA(July) sometimes traffic that goes to Griffith observatory can be really heavy. We went there with Uber and took as almost 45 to climb to the top due to high traffic.Nothing really special going there, but nice point to take few photos with LA and Hollywood sign as background",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VelSim
50,Amazing!!,Walked through Griffith Park to get to the observatory which was great. The observatory is worth the walk. Its informative and interactive. A great experience all round and would definitely suggest any one go and visit. We are a young couple and people of all ages would enjoy this trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionat862
50,Griffith,"A genuine hidden gem in Los Angeles. Great way to spend an evening in a relaxed atmosphere. Museum is awesome, staff is friendly and helpful, show prices are really a bargain. Perfect place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treman119
40,Great view,"I went on a Sunday morning, and on my way up the mountain, I turned around because I saw a very long line of cars waiting to get into the parking lot. I returned around 4pm the same day and got right up. The view is worth it! Especially if you take the stairs on the front sides up to the roof for a great view. The plantarium show was first class. Good Pokemon up there too :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorDerm1
50,One of my favourite places!,"Even if you visit when the observatory isn't open to the public, it's worth it for the views! On our second visit up there we went really early in the morning so the observatory was closed but the peace and quiet up there is perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulublu11
40,Interesting experience and educational,"This was worth doingBe prepared did it to be busy. There is parking near the top but it can get full.The view of LA at night is great and much better than during the day. The view of the stars is great and you can look through a powerful telescope at distant galaxies with guidance from a clever person who is happy to help!At this time of year it can get a bit chilly so be sure to take some warm clothing.Go inside the observatory as there is a lot of educational stuff about the development of the telescope, how we tell time and so on which is very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757MartinG757
50,Great Place,Excellent. Not disappointed at all. Great place for small kids and families. Great views of LA. 2 hours is more than sufficient for this visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7875EP
50,Fave place on the Hollywood Hills,Every time I come to LA this visit is my top one.The observatory is a great place to hang out and relax solo /w friends.The sunset is also great to watch from here.stunning view of the cut,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCtravels14
50,A favorite spot,"I love this place. It's interesting and they usually have the big scope pointed somewhere and you can take a look through the eyepiece. As you walk around the outside telescope room, there are a lot of scopes you can look through.But that's not the best part. Go at night. See that Los Angeles is a city of the night. All around you'll see the city at its most beautiful. A river of lights will be flowing. It's traffic but somehow watching from above it's magic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishholtz
50,This is one of the greatest public places in all of Los Angeles,The exhibits and information here are just incredible. Not to mention the great outdoor spaces and views. This is something every child and adult should visit. the evening star parties here are definitely something fun for the entire family too. Not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickr847
40,Amazing view over LA,"The view down over LA was fantastic, and it was cool to look over at the Hollywood sign as well. Nice nature to walk around in on a sunny day. Did not go inside the Observatory, but there are some smaller stuff to look at outside as well. Nice restrooms available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyLittlePineapple
50,A sight to see when lit up,This beautiful place is a stunning sight to see when lit up in the night. We parked our car and had an interesting trek uphill that was lovely. Try to catch the sunset from this place if possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TirelessHP
50,great views - absolutely free!,We were there around sunset on a Friday night. It was hard to find parking as the spot is popular among locals and tourists. Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign. After sunset volunteers from the observatory pointed out stars with telescopes. The museum is also worth a 60-90 min stay as it is very informative for folks of all ages. And the best - it is absolutely free!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy212121
50,"Great views, especially of the Hollywood Sign","Had friends here visiting from Germany and they wanted to see the popular spots in Los Angeles. One request they had was a view of the Hollywood sign and after reading a view blogs, decided we would go to the Observatory for the view of the sign. Great view! Was also great views of the city below. Since we were there and admission was free, we decided to go into the Observatory, glad we did. Very interesting information about our solar system, the sun, moon, stars, etc. Parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciaf168
40,Great views,"Should say great views but shame about the smog. Great visitor attraction with free parking, although very congested. Free wifi also. Wanted to visit as it has the best view of the Hollywood sign and also the scene from so many movies, with Terminator the obvious one. Good visit and would have liked to have spent longer and visited the observatory itself but on a busy trip choices are essential",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/james27vaughan
50,A must!,A must whilst visiting LA! A great view of downtown as well as the famous 'Hollywood' sign up in the mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhymes0102
50,Incredible,"Griffith is one of the most amazing sites in LA. Having lived in So. Cal for more than 10 years, I love exploring new locations especially in LA. From horseback riding near the Hollywood sign to Rodeo Drive to the stars to the Ivy, there is so much to do. Griffith O tops them all with the best view in LA and the most interesting museum since the Getty Villa. Luke loved it and goes back to school with a much deeper understanding of astronomy. Yet, he didn't even recognize it was educational. Thank you Griffith!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonysine
50,Love it!,Love going to Griffith..awesome views for pictures any time of day! So make sure to bring a camera 😉,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aracely130
40,Watched the planets,Most nights free use of powerful telescopes let you get a closer look at the planets in our solar system weather permitting.Great spot to get that picture of the Hollywood sign in the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/902mikess
40,Great Views,"The observatory is closed on Mondays, we learned that the hard way. We went again on Wednesday before we left LA. There's two different ways to get up to the observatory but either way you'll get up there. On our way up people parked very far down on the side of the road leading up to the observatory. I'd say, if you can, go to the parking lot at the very top, we were able to find parking space (people come & go all the time). The observatory has spectacular views, however it's just like any big city, very polluted. It was hard to get a really nice photo. The Hollywood sign is just across the observatory. The observatory itself was so packed, we only went to a small part of it and then came out right after that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saewhat9009
50,Beautiful Views,Amazing views of LA from the observatory and equally fascinating inside the museum. Its great that this place is free but it also gets very busy in the car park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliceH612
50,Griffiths Observatory,Well worth a visit. Scenery amazing. Parking limited at the top so park on road and walk up. Observatory interesting for all ages. A good day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/james1691
50,Excellent View,"The Griffith Observatory was one of the stops on a bus tour of LA, so I can't comment much on parking. Excellent view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. It's also a great place to go inside and take a break from the heat during the summer. Inside, you can add a little science education to your vacation. Cool place for families. And it's my favorite price: Free!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159christianp
50,Great View Of Hollywood Sign,"There are great views of Hollywood sign and los angeles. The observatory is free and very informative. We travelled via metro and free shuttle, which was very easy to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happycamper186361
40,For a fantastic view of LA,"If not for the observatory, atleast go there for a fantastic view of LA. Most of the attractions inside the observatory are free so if you are going with grown up kids they will for sure enjoy it. One can easily spend around 2 hours here. We especially enjoyed the outdoors and the scenic view of LA from the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FBKalra
50,Family with Adult child,The view is amazing. Everyone visiting LA. Has to go! The one thing you have to see in LA. I went in August 2014 and my daughter and husband went in August 2016. They loved it.At times it can be a challenge to find a parking spot. Take time to do a hike when you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S-Badventures
40,Nice!!,The observatory is in a large park and is free to visit. It gives a great view of the area and a nice view of the hollywood sign although you are still pretty far away. It is a short drive from Hollywood and worth going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lecterit
40,Great views in the day or night,Great views in the day or night over Los Angeles. The roads leading away from the Observatory spiral through the hills and give some good vantage points of the Hollywood sign. Parking can be a bit of an issue (limited) through peak times of the day and closer to around 7-8pm. Toilets and food are also available. A must do on any LA trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt-Rogaloff
50,Seeing the sights from the observatory,Took my friends from out of country to see the sights and they saw the Hollywood sign and you could hear my friends squal of excitement when she turned and saw it. Thumbs up,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizziwizzi90
50,Free Amazing place to go,This place is free. The car park at the top was full however there are always cars leaving the car park so you should be able to get a space. The place was very clean and interesting things for all the family.The cafe however was overpriced for what was there and the food looked a little dried up. Gift shop was expensive for the gifts. Spent about three hours there. Very good experience and amazing views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Niall030598
50,The french couple,What a nice view on LA ..its amazing to see that view ...its was next to our hotel go for it guys its breath taking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prescillat3
40,Great View,"Great view of Los Angeles in a clear day/night. The only downside is the parking, very limited space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aida68
30,Busy long weekend,"We came here on a tour, the Sunday before Labor Day weekend. I highly recommend NOT coming on this day in the future. It was sooo busy you could hardly walk through the observatory. And driving up there, even on a little tour bus where you pass most of the cars, was a nightmare.You can see the Hollywood sign from here and great views of the city, but the sign is teeny tiny especially if you want to be in the picture with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0wi3
50,Spectacular views,Great place to visit if your looking for some stunning views of Los Angeles and also a good spot to view the Hollywood sign without having to take a hike.A must visit place if you visit LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tr-velwanderlust
40,Interesting place and great views,Travelled here as had read that it was a good place to see the Hollywood sign and views of the city and it did not disappoint. Accessible by public transport with a free shuttle on weekends from outside the Vermont/Sunset metro station.Great views of city but also interesting exhibits inside the observatory with helpful staff to answer any questions or provide more information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TBatch95
40,Stunning views,"Well worth a trip - cool sculptures, views are incredible of both all of Los Angeles & a good opportunity for that all important selfie with the Hollywood sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolesaurus
50,Utterly Fantastic at sunset. Allow much more time than you think!,"I knew this was a must do, but what I didn't know was just how much time I wanted to spend taking in every nuance of one of the best sunset views on earth.And then there's the inside of the observatory itself, with fascinating science displays that teach/remind everyone of us about this amazing planet/galaxy we live in.I would suggest 4 hours minimum to do it properly, arrive at least an hour before sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrgasmicCry
30,Even better at night!,"The observatory grounds are beautiful, as are the views of LA, Hollywood Sign, etc. It's very easy to walk in and around the observatory, and the staff is VERY friendly, knowledgeable, and does a great job of bringing the exhibits to life. The Planetarium is comfortable and there isn't a bad seat in the house.Free is awesome. Parking isn't particularly difficult for a big city attraction. There are a few interesting displays in the observatory, although they are relatively dated and there isn't a lot to see. The cafe seating is nice for a family picnic, although there aren't many food choices and it's relatively expensive.We took a hike and came back at night, and the observatory was going off. Lots of people, energy, and lines to use the telescope. Looks like a great evening spot to take a date or hang out with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corpdoc
50,Amazing view of LA!,"We went there on a Sunday afternoon! It took us about 30 minutes by taxi to get up and then we decided to walk another 15 minutes due to an incredible amount of traffic! It looked like everybody wanted to go there on that day!As soon as we reached the observatory I understood why! Such an amazing view! It's definitely a must-see! When the sun went down and all the lights went on, breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999MariaP
40,"Beautiful Architecture and Vistas, Aging Shows","We spent an afternoon at the observatory. The building itself is beautiful as is the view of the city from it's balcony.We saw a planetarium show, it was dated. Like most museums of its kind the planetarium is trying to find its place in the new digital age.That being said still worth the visit! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Entrance to the facility was free (planetarium show was $7). Parking is free. By the time we got there the lot was full, but parking on the side of the road is allowed as long as you park with the flow of traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herd_of_6
40,Difficult drive up a mountain,"With cars parked on both sides of the road, it became difficult to navigate up the winding road to the observatory. However, the view was great. You could take good pictures of the Hollywood sign and see the skyline well. Inside, the observatory had several exhibits that were worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpgrandpa
50,Views Galore,The beautifully restored observatory is a great place to spend part of your day. The views of Los Angeles alone are worth it. Whether you go during the day to enjoy the exhibits or at night to see the incredible light show that is Los Angeles at night. Take a picnic if you go up there on a warm day. Take a jacket if you go at night it can get quite cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894erict
50,Great views mixed with great science!,I love visiting the iconic Griffith observatory. Often a stunning view of LA - especially at sunset. Can be big crowds in the summer which not a problem at the observatory except for parking. Also has a great telescope that is usually set for a glimpse of something in the night sky after sunset that you can queue up for. Great laser light and star shows in the planetarium - check their schedule on the website.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alaskaberrys
50,Muy bueno,"Nice place!!!! You can get good pictures , good view,free wi fi, nice view Of the city. Little smoke!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sportygirl64
50,A great place to spend a few hours.....,I had not been to Griffeth Obs since a school trip in the mid 1960's. On my current So Cal visit we went. I was happy to see much of the place the same as it has been for many years. All the 'new' is hidden downstairs in a new area. A great place to visit for all the displays old and new but also just to walk on the walkway around the outside of the building and looking over the LA basin. Well worth the visit....even with difficult parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveVWV
40,A must see when visiting Los Angeles,Anyone that watches television or movies has seen the Griffith Observatory but to really appreciate it you must visit in person. The views of Hollywood and the greater Los Angeles area are amazing but the exhibits inside are themselves worth the trip. It does get crowded and parking sometimes can be a challenge but no visit to LA would be complete without a trip to this landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG831
50,Don't sleep on Griffith,"If you're considering for a second of missing this gem... think again. This tourist Mecca has the best views of Los Angeles (that are only magnified when seen at night) the admission is free. There are great picnic spots Everywhere, it's a hop and a skip from the Hollywood sign. Oh and for couples there are more than a few nooks and crannies to steal a kiss or two here and there. It's fun & educational for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madaven818
40,Worth the long hike!,Was very busy when we went so had to walk up but worth it. View was stunning and closest we got to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyhutch10
50,A must-see,"Phenomenal views of LA and the Hollywood sign! Grounds indoor displays as well as telescope. There is a planetarium, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sundogcomm
50,Incredible views,This was a must for me. I am a massive James Dean fan so I just wanted to go there to see where part of Rebel without a cause was filmed. Loved the James Dean monument. However not everyone is a James dean fan but it's worth going there for the most incredible views. It's free to park and visit and it's a little steep of a walk but well worth it for what you get at the top,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92russellw
50,Great views,From there you can enjoy great views on all L.A. Free parking and free access. Exhibits are not free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733dominiqueh
50,Take a Couple Hours & Do This!,"I only got to spend about 20 minutes or so at the Observatory. I was on a guided hike through the Hollywood Hills and this was a quick stop. It is beautiful though! Our hike guide showed us a few of his favorites exhibits (we held the meteorite, weighed ourselves on the moon & other planets, saw the Tesla coil and the seismograph, and got to take a few pictures of the Hollywood sign from here. I wish I had had more time to explore. This is definitely on my list of things to do next time I make it to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathergrim
30,"Good for a walk, views and view of Hollywood Sign",Hunt for parking followed by a long walk up a hill. Next climb stairs to a lookout - on a hot day I recommend a wide brimmed hat and a uv umbrella for shade! Very pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cranburyneighbor
40,Great view of L.A!,"Totally worth the drive up. Very crowded though, but definitely gorgeous views all around. Scenic! The observatory itself would've been nice to visit but it was just too crowded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawachica
50,A must see,Excellent attraction. Must see both day and night. The night time experience during summer allows guests to use the telescopes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987cliffordb
50,S P E C T A C U L A R !!!!!,"This place is amazing! it has everything, historic building, check, stunning 360 degree views, check, nature, check,science heaven, check, fun for the whole family, check. My kids were mesmerized by every thing that this place offers, we entered the planetarium to see one show, they had so much fun! the interacrtive display are user friendly and the whole place inspires new generations to have a close look at astronomy and science. The only thing that's a little tricky is the parking, you have to arrive really early to avoid a long up hill walk to the observatory,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962juancp
40,"Come early, stay late.","My mom and I came mid-afternoon and were able to secure a parking spot at the Observatory. We spent the afternoon hiking the trails and came back down around sunset. Griffith Observatory at sunset is a must. Great views. We were able to look through several telescopes at the Observatory- we saw Mars, Venus, and Saturn! And you have the added bonus of seeing the city come alive with lights as the day turns to night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139kelseym
50,A Must Visit,"Was in California on a road trip and when doing research, this place got great reviews. It was as the reviews indicated, an awesome place to visit! The views were unbelievable and everything inside was really informational! We even got to hold a meteorite! Very awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2905VKjenb
50,Fabulous,Don't miss this. The views are spectacular. Bring some quarters so you can use the telescopes. Plenty of trails to hike. GO early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StoreOwnerTeacher
50,Amazijg views at night,It's a steep climb from Vegas through Griffith park but once you are at top it's totally worth it. Definitely head to the telescope on the roof and check out the beautiful universe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7975SIjamest
40,Worth the walk up the hill,We had seen this spot in numerous movies so we thought we would check it out. Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Parking was way down the road/hill for us because of our arrive time late on Sunday morning. 15 to 20 minutes walk was worth the view. Good thing was the walk back to our car was down the hill!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyp490
50,A Place where I'm lost in Time,"This Observatory was up in a mountain and was very inconvenient to travel to and from it.However, my family and I were so immersed in the exhibits that we lost track of time. We watched the ""Water is Life"" show and my toddler was loved it. This was one of those places that were able to make my toddler all ""high"" and excited throughout the day. He's excited and asking tonnes of questions about everything he saw. We had the opportunity to view Saturn using the telescope and we were still very impressed by it. However, if you do have a 3 yo or younger... or toddler who's all high and excited, you might want to give the telescope a miss. My toddler was all ""high"" that he touched the highly precious telescope and the Astronomers went all tense and frown. So for the seek of fellows still in the queue, toddlers might need to give it a miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliseTan
50,Worth the traffic and the walk up the moutain,Definitely got to visit this place. No need to pay unless you want to watch the show. Kids loved it. Totally worth the hassle to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mchai99
50,Worth it for the view,"The obersvatory in itself is interesting, but only if you have a lot of time. If you don´t have a lot of LA days, it´s only worth up there for the view of the city, don´t go in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alejod124
50,Nice park for a morning run or hike with a goal at the top!,"Griffith park is a nice oasis in the middle of LA to walk, hike, run around the miles of dirt trails that carry you up to the top. There are many ways to make it up, but all wind up at the top where there is a beautiful observatory with views of the Hollywood sign, the Hollywood hills, and the city of LA. A great way to see the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jmdidday
40,Fabulous views; allow time for traffic issues,"We were visiting from out of town recently and tried to get to the Observatory on the evening of a meteor shower, but we turned back in an Uber halfway into the Park as there was also an event at the Greek Theater and traffic was horrendous. Had we known of the access issues, we would have come 4-5 hours earlier. We did go back early the next day by Uber and were glad that we did not try to park there as you have to park along the winding road going up to the Observatory. There is some parking at the top, but it is very limited. There are great photo opportunities at the Observatory and several movie options are offered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debj631
40,Parking is an absolute nightmare,"We had to park miles away on the side of the road and hike up to the observatory. There are no parking attendants or any indicators at all of where to park so it's a total free-for-all. Otherwise the observatory has some great views of the city, and the planetarium show is pretty good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanman85
50,What a view,"This place is pretty prominent land mark in the hills of Griffith park. I like to park at the entrance of the park, and hike my way up to the observatory. This day was clear, not too hot, and mid week, so there were not too many hikers on the trail. At the observatory, the parking was packed. You can walk on the observatory, and see LosAngeles from a different point of view. Inside, there are exhibits some interactive, and some displayed hands off. Lots and lots of information about our planet, and all the other stuff that is out there. For the curious this is a diamond mine of information. Entrance fee is worth it, watch the video presentation as well to learn more about our planet, and what is around us. Great time, be flexible to stay there most of the day, this is not an hour long tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8741NDdavids
50,Beautiful view of mountains and LA,This is a special spot on the top of a hill in Griffith Park where you can look one direction to see the natural beauty of the California hillsides and in the other see the huge expanse of the city of Los Angeles with downtown in the background. It gets crowded but it's worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socali123
50,Excellent views of L.A. and Hollywood,"In addition to learning more about earth, planets, sun and universe with displays, attended excellent planetarium show for $7 per person. Outside grounds were nice, with great views of surrounding hills and city below!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8548OJlisac
40,Parking nightmare,"It seemed to us as if we showed up at the worst possible time for our visit to Griffith Observatory...right at sunset on a Thursday evening. We'd wanted to see the old telescope, as well as night views of LA. Our timing resulted in driving around for maybe 30 minutes just trying to find parking within a reasonable walk of the observatory. Police were not allowing cars to drive to the observatory's parking lot and instead directed them back down one of the 2 routes leading up the hill. After circling back, we were fortunate to find a spot alongside the road about 1/2 mile away. While the rough terrain was walkable on our way in, it was extremely dark (no street lights, obviously) getting back to the car. Do bring a flashlight if you go after dark.Much of the time we spent at the facility was in line outdoors to look through the 1930s 200-power telescope at Saturn. We also wandered around the exhibits inside the building (where there's a great Tesla coil) and enjoyed the night views of LA.Because we didn't have much time, we didn't go to the planetarium ($7 extra per person). The next time we visit the area, we will go much earlier in the day. And we will bring a flashlight just in case we have to walk to our car after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanAndJim
50,Great views of th Hollywood sign,We really just went here to get a good view of the Hollywood sign but once inside it was interesting to learn all about space. There is a little cafe inside that isn't that badly priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbro757
50,Best touristic point in LA,"The observatory is the best tourist point in LA! By public transportation is not very easy, because the busses leave you in the bottom of the hill and the shutles from the bottom to the top work just 91st the weekends. However it's a very nice walking to the top. The walk takes about 20 minutes and it's inside the Griffiths park. The view on the top is just perfect! You can see the whole city and also the Hollywood sign. And the best, it's a free attraction. They charge just if you want to use the telescope or attend one of their shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PalomaLS
50,Spectacular views of course!,A must see! Unfortunately we picked a hazy day so the views were limited. Still worth the trip. Drive all the way up for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah3302
50,"Stars, our planet and views of LA","Parking always seems to be a challenge when visiting the Observatory, so be patient and be prepared to walk uphill if the lot is closed. The slight announce with actually getting there will quickly dissipate when you see the stunning views of the Hollywood sign, the LA basin and Downtown LA (the cluster of buildings off to the left). Once inside, there is so much to see and explore as it relates to Earth, the moon, the sun and the stars. I highly recommend seeing the Planetarium show! It's $7 for adults and $5 for students.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicasV28NM
50,Amazing Location,"Amazing location to visit, stunning views of LA but busy as we went on Labour Day weekend. Had a fascinating hour at the place, and had to go get flights, shame as we probably could have enjoyed a full day at the observatory and park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leebB285KS
40,Good experience,"We weren't expecting to queue on the road up.We arrived around 8.00pm and by then it was officially 'rammed' we did manage to park in the Observatory car park (and it's free!)Good views of the city, unfortunately it was dark by the time we arrived. Not a bad way to fill an evening. Get there early (if that's possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbG5420YX
50,The best view of the Hollywood Sign.,"A great sightseeing spot with plenty of photo opportunities everywhere you look. The Griffith Observatory is free to visit including inside as well with various informative panels on space and time. A great view of Downtown LA despite the usual ""LA smog"" including the Hollywood Sign as well. Recommended to visit in the afternoon to capture the amazing blood-orange sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IzzyIsmail
50,A Must stop if you are a tourist and even if you live there too!!!!,"Make sure you visit the Griffith Observatory at least ONCE at Sunset... BEST place to watch the sun go down in LA - best view of the City and also the famous sign.... Wonderful for families, joggers, bikers and people who appreciate beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpR4816AS
50,Great View of the Hollywood Sign.,"We mainly went to get a good picture of the Hollywood sign. We were fortunate to be able to park in the handicap parking. Looks like if not the parking can be pretty far. But I did go inside to take a peek, and I wish I would have allowed more time to check it out. Beautiful building and lots to do and see inside. Maybe next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cardshark98
50,Great views over Los Angeles and free!,"Was recommended to check this place out. It's right in the Hollywood hills in Griffith Park. Got an Uber there. Note: there's no data on mobile networks so if you want an Uber back, then log into the park WiFi. At top you see great panoramic views over Los Angeles. Then there is the Observatory itself. Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blingkrosby
50,"Beautiful building, fun museum and amazing views!","The Griffith Park Observatory is a can't miss if you are in LA. The building itself is so gorgeous! The observatory/museum (which was recently renovated) is fun, even for kids, and the views are fantastic from every corner. And, best of all - it's free (except the movie theatre, which is nice to see at least once). Parking can be a monster challenge, though. I've found that coming later in the day is best. Enjoy what Griffith Park has to offer early on then come up to the Observatory later in the day. Really - it IS worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oolcayatcay
50,Photo Opportunity,Amazing sightseeing spot! Great photo opportunity as well as interesting Planetarium expo. Advisable to go at night to watch the show if u are interested in the solar system but rather in the day if you want the view experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmyroberts100
50,Stunning,What a beautiful place. We were able to see the sun during the day and the moon during the night. Also Mars. Great place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renias2016
30,Once in a lifetime,"I said, once in a lifetime. If you come to Los Angeles it is something to see. You have the Hollywood sign, maybe can see the few deer still wondering the hills. It's a nice vista point. Parking is nightmarish. It's overcrowded. I spent an hour touring the grounds and building. I would recommend going if you've never been. Myself, probably would not return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727shelleyk
40,Great views,"Other than great views, I don't know what else is here. But that reason alone is more than enough to come here.Be prepared to hike up as parking in the parking lot is almost impossible so you will have to park on the side of the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipinny
50,"Even on a busy day, it's still enjoyable","Stopped by on a beautiful Sunday morning - along with everyone that had the same idea. So the traffic up to the observatory was pretty jammed up, and the narrow ""walking"" path was filled with people. I am surprised I didn't see anyone tumble down the hill. But once you make it up on the Observatory grounds, you do get to take in some nice views of the city - smog notwithstanding.The fact that it cost us nothing to do all this was a bonus. Many other places around the world would have hit you for a few bucks just for the privilege to be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmgE55
50,Out of this World... Literally!,"We went here 4 years ago and just had to go again. It's FREE to go in! Staff so knowledgeable and helpful! The Planetarium has shows daily which are absolutely incredible and are fascinating as you listen to the narrator guide you through space, galaxies and the history of time itself. If you have ever looked up and wondered what is out there and you are in Los Angeles it really is a MUST DO. Staff so helpful in answering questions and the views of L.A. are amazing. The icing on the cake... to look through the telescope! Saturn's rings! Out of this world! If I lived there I would visit every weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pam54558
50,Beautiful,"With 360 degrees of breathtaking views, this is a must-see for travelers. You not only have views of LA, but also the mountains and the Hollywood sign! There are great trails right around the corner as well. The observatory is really cool and definitely something to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/east0ne
50,Fantastic views; renovated observatory,"Drove up to the observatory, there is free parking at the top but if it's crowded would look for a space on the way down. Fantastic views all around, including the Hollywood sign. Exhibits inside are educational, there's a piece of moon rock and Mars that you can touch on the lower level. The telescope on the roof is open in the evening only but you can look at it during the day. Definitely worth a visit. Note that the observatory is closed on Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swansfromBoston

40,Crazy busy Friday night,We went after dark on a Friday and it was packed! Had to wait in traffic forever then park a mile away down the windy mountain road. But it was a cool place w great views and free. Maybe pick a different time to go. But it is gorgeous lit up at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442ginap
50,Must see destination for locals and tourists,"The Griffith Observatory appeals to science and non-science lovers of all ages. Anyone interested in learning more about our solar system or anyone wanting an amazing view of Los Angeles (and to see where they filmed one of the famous scenes in 'Rebel without a Cause"", should definitely head to Griffith and don't miss the Planetarium movie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silverlinings42
50,Amazing Views,"You can't get a better view of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. The observatory is on a hill and it has views for a million bucks day or night. I went during the day and during the night. Night I loved, day time view of L.A. made me wonder how do people live with the smog. Seriously during the day L.A. was covered in smog. But it is a great location for views in L.A. and to get some knowledge of the stars if you are interested. There are interesting things and articles to read inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349anniea
50,Wow. Mind blowing,Yes it's another must. Be prepared for a small walk as parking is at a premium. But what a view. Amazing. Another must when I'm LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolyn-Grant-NZ
40,Great Views,Went at sunset to see the Hollywood sign and there was no parking. Parked at the end of the driveway and walked up steep driveway. Sights were amazing and worth the walk. Sunset overlooking sign and LA was breath taking! Very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db16
50,Awesome sight view of Los Angeles,"Quick hike, parking is terrible on the weekends, dogs are allowed just not in the building. I would suggest coming in the morning or evening to enjoy a beautiful sunrise or sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubenc526
40,Fun for Kids,"The observatory had some interactive items back before the refurbishing--few of which that worked--but now the place is brimming with them. There seem to be more every time we go.Don't miss all the new stuff downstairs; take the ramp back through time (you'll see what I mean when you're there) and keep an open mind. On the first sublevel is my favorite interactive attraction, where you get to slam giant meteors into Earth (or whatever planet you like; but let's face it, blowing up Earth is just more fun). Well, virtually at least.The one negative to avoid is the cafeteria, at all costs: horrible food for WAY too much. If you just go out of the park on Vermont, you'll see a number of much better restaurants in Los Feliz, then some lower-class (but in many cases equally good) places farther down in Virgil Village. El Gran Burrito on the corner of Vermont and Santa Monica has decent Mexican food overall, but the grilled chicken is very good--and the red salsa is the best I've ever had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRWagner
50,Great views - you can also see the hollywood sign,Really pretty place just peaceful.Make sure to take sun screen as it gets really hot.Also no reception on your phone and its a bit spotty so figure out how to get back or walk down a little further to get better reception.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topea_13
50,One of the best things to do in Hollywood.,"The best views of Los Angeles you can get. Parking can be tricky in the Summer, but if you're a little bit intrepid, here's a trick: pull on your walking shoes and drive to Trails Cafe in Fern Dell. Park the car. Have a beverage at Trails. Then hike up to the observatory on the observatory trail. It's a climb, but any reasonably fit person can do it in 45 minutes or less. You'll get views and nature on the way. When you arrive at the top, voila -- you're right there, at the observatory, with only about ten minutes' extra walking than if you'd parked on the approach road on a crowded day. The walk down will take half the time. You'll have gotten a nice workout, you'll have a sense of accomplishment. It's a nice way to see the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betteryeti
50,Good view,It has a very good view for the hollywood sign. The atmosphere is really nice. Great place for taking pictures. Also it is a good place for hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713amirb
40,A great place to visit,"We got an Uber taxi up to the observatory, which wasnt expensive. The views are spectacular and the Planetarium was the highlight - it was narrated live by a very good guide and it was beautiful. We then walked the short trail back down to civilization. The observatory is free to wander about but there is a nominal fee for the planetarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lcasey45
40,Nice night view!,"The place was packed when I visited and parking can be quite a hassle. I remember having to turn a few rounds before getting a lot by the side of the trees (the parking was already full when I arrived). But despite that, the exhibition was quite interesting! There also a few areas you can go and appreciate the very nice aerial city view. Oh yes! and there were also 2 stations outside the observatory where 2 huge telescopes were placed for the public to have a closer look at Pluto. That was definitely the highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalessandra122
50,Awesome place,This place is awesome. Can view all th city of Los Angeles from here.. Nice space to view something different and knowing somethings different too. Inside the place is awesome and nice..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grbraca85
50,Quintessential LA view!,"You feel on top of the world visiting this observatory. Amazing views of LA and the Hollywood sign. A must go place for any tourist. Parking very busy so be prepared for a fairly long uphill walk at peak times. We had to park on the roadside and walk back in hot sunshine, but this didn't spoil our enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CornishAdventurers
40,I saw Pluto,"One of the best sites in Los Angeles. For people who are interested in the Universe, this is a must.A most interesting item was a statue of James Dean. (for older people only). This was in memory of the movie 'Rebel without a Cause'.It was simply a memorable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drvischjager
50,Nice Exhibits/Crowded for Summer,"Arrived on a Saturday by 10:30am. The parking lot was already full. We were directed down another road to park. It was a 20 min hike uphill up to the observatory. The hike was not too difficult for our 5 year old.Once we got there, we got a nice view of the observatory and the Hollywood sign. The morning was hazy, but by noon the air cleared out for nice views.Inside the museum, the upper floor had nice exhibits about the sun and the moon. The planetarium show has a fee, and young ones can only go to the first showing. Watching the pendulum was neat, it knocks down a peg every 10 minutes.Downstairs was a nice exhibit about our solar system and the stars. They have a movie about the remodel of the Observatory. Gift shop and snack bar is available.If you want to avoid the parking hassle, visit in the off season, unless of course you enjoy hiking. There are trails going to other places around the observatory, which is another reason the destination is popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Amazing views,Views that go on for ever! See LA and beyond. The best place to see the Hollywood sign! Very wheelchair accessible which is wonderful. The building itself is just magnificent. The grounds and the bathrooms are very clean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jyotsnadietrich
10,Hike Up the Mountain?,"We tried to go here since we heard many good things about it. We tried going on a Saturday around 1 or 2 pm I think. We never actually made it there though. We drove up the mountain and there were cars parked ALL the way up along the road and people were getting out to hike up. We thought, there must be some type of parking near the top as people leave.....nope. The cops had the entrance blocked off to drive up to the part where the observatory is located and there weren't ANY signs anywhere indicating this fact. We ended up driving up the mountain and back down- mostly by accident because of the lack of signs. We also didn't want to hike due to an injury in the group. The observatory should really consider making a deal with The Greek theatre to use their parking and offering free shuttles up the mountain to the observatory. If the observatory crowd is this large every day it's a little unbelievable! Wished we had been able to see it, would consider going back if in town again but would need to find tips about when the crowds are the least dense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedPhD
50,Worth a stop,"Go for the views! You can park at the bottom and hike up or drive up and park closer to the top. Be prepared for a long walk up no matter what you do because parking can be tough and go early to avoid the crowds. There is an amazing view of the city, the Hollywood sign and the mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLHTraveler22
50,Lots of fun with the kids,"We did a day of hiking on the trails surrounding the observatory as well as doing a show in the planetarium here. This was the first time my kids had done anything like this and they loved it. It was a little crowded, but I thought it was a great addition to our trip--we always try to add some educational elements to our family vacations. I would recommend going on a cooler day if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom2Grlz
50,Saw it as part of our tour,This is a really nice place and FREE! Parking looks a bit difficult if you go on your own but we went during the day as part of a tour. Our tour guide advised if going at night NOT to go on a night when there is a concert at the Greek Theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meyerzone
30,Nice views!,"Very busy attraction, lots of people. Views are spectacular. Recommend parking as close to conservatory as possible. The park is also nice great for an impromptu picnic. Be prepared for long line of traffic to reach conservatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cushmeers
50,Amazing cityscape,If you're visiting on the weekend there is a shuttle bus that departs from Vermont and Sunset that only costs 50 cents. Once up you're greeted by this amazing observatory which houses a couple of free exhibitions on astrology aswell as the amazing views of the city of angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackmoore93
50,Worth the long line,The car line was really long and the lot was almost full and it took at least two hours to get up there but the long wait was worth the View,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/644calebp
50,Great views!,A great place to visit and it's free. The lineup to drive up was huge but worth it because the LA views are incredible. Great pics of the Hollywood sign if you go early enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJC1919
50,love this place,Nice place to go take a walk and Enjoy Los Angeles scenario.I went there on the holiday so there were too many people.so my suggestion would be go on the weekday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chanyanats
50,Amazing sunset and view of LA,"Sunsets are always beautiful, but this one was a bit different than the rest, here you have an amazing view that you can see the entire LA. Lots of tourists for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmellyyy
40,Definitely worth checking out,Griffith Observatory was part of the LA tour we did and have to say its worth checking out. Its free to. Very interesting. The view over LA is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seashelly9
50,Go!,"Want a great picture of the city of Los Angeles both day and night? Then Griffith Observatory is your place. The way up may be a problem depending on your fit status, is a long way up (and down). Be get free access to the telescope. We didn't get in but we took a picture of it. Tip: stay until night for best pictures of the city, believe me it worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegolaass
40,Classic Los Angeles Location,"If you're looking for a classic Los Angeles location to visit on a date or vacation, put Griffith Observatory on your list.Here you can really get a look at the city and surrounding area. My main interest in visiting is for the views. Other reasons people visit are education about the sky or walking on the nature paths. This is a Los Angeles treasure to view day or night and of course you can see the Hollywood sign from here.Be aware that parking can be very challenging. Though there is a parking lot at the top, it is often full and people park all along the winding road to the observatory and walk quite a ways to get there. Prepare for crowds but know that once you make a short visit to this iconic place you'll have really seen the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wethrivelife
50,Educational Fun!,"We took our 8 year old twin grandchildren to experience their first planetarium show but they enjoyed everything which included exhibits, hands on items, and a movie. The whole place is kid-friendly but their favorites were the planetarium, Gunther Depths of Space area, Tesla Coil, and the movie we saw which was - of all things for the kids to find fascinating - about the history of building the observatory. The views from the top levels of the planetarium are beautiful.The last thing we did before leaving for the day was to look through the huge Zeiss telescope at the surface of the moon. They were moonstruck! Perfect ending to our observatory visit.Entrance to the observatory is free and there is a small charge for the planetarium show. Parking on a busy day is pretty awful, however. We had to park on a side road way below the observatory that was crowded with impatient drivers and way too many cars trying to park in spaces barely big enough for their vehicles.Otherwise, the entire day spent at the observatory can be summed up in the words of our granddaughter when we returned her to Mom and Dad, ""We had such a really good-good day!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyLo
40,Impressive Views,"One of the best places to get a view of LA. The renovated areas are very cool. It's a very popular place, so try to go on a weekday, or get there early. There is free parking available, but it fills up fast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohmaria2014
50,the view was breath taking,I went at Night. very chilli. the view was amazing. got to see Mars and Venus. inside the building had some cool info. mY husband said the view would have been better at night? wonder if he is right,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94shirleyl
30,Good place to visit,"Nice view to see entire LA area. Nice place to hike, to learn a bit of stars and science. Staffs were nice, place was clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tnt972
50,For Spectacular LA and Hollywood Views,"The drive up to the observatory was very winding so if you hate heights, have someone else drive. There are some hair-pin turns involved. But once you get to the top, it's so worth it. Parking can be difficult at the lot on top, but people are allowed to park on either side lining the road. We gave up on the parking lot and found a spot heading back down the road. There are many observation points for great photos. Even ""selfies"" so be sure to bring your selfie stick! ha ha. We went in late afternoon. I imagine the views would also be spectacular at night, but we wanted to see the vistas by day light. You can see the Hollywood sign and great panoramic shots of the city. We did not go into the Observatory but did climb the steps to the upper observation decks. I would highly recommend stopping here for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
50,Wonderful views,Great views. Wonderful movie buff place. Great programs. Watch for evenings when amateur astronomers gather out front and share views thru their telescopes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfw
50,Real gem,"This was my favourite thing in LA, beautiful place, fantastic views. The planetarium show was amazing. Would really recommend this place. And it's free, except the show which was only a few dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpH4472TF
50,Friday night with teleacope is best,"Drove friday eve around 7pm. Towards the top it was no moving traffic so parked and hiked rest of the way. Hoghly recommend evening view with lights. On this particular friday, they had the telescopes out to see saturn, mars and few other stars. Very cool and informative folks. Very crowded so plan accordingly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZFoodieMSP
50,Star gazed,"The Griffith Observatory sits up on a hill in L.A. Like a little castle in the sky. Following winding, tree lined trails, you climb for about 15 minutes to reach the Mesa. There sits a masterpiece of modern technology and science. Lots of telescopes to view the heavens that influence the earth. Possibly looking from whence we came. Truly beautiful property that looks out over sprawling Los Angeles proper. Just an astounding view and experience. A must do in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488patrickB
50,Amazing views of L A,Go to Griffith park as the views of LA and the Hollywood sign are worth the visit alone. Go into the observatory and see all the information and talks to enhance you knowledge of the solar system,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeggyDoll
50,heavenly view!,Go at night to get the full affect- see the whole city from there...Amazing! Wear comfortable shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amber5465
40,Good views,"Traffic was horrible going up (middle of the day on a Wednesday), parking was a bear and there were loads of people. But the views going up and once there were very nice. The observatory itself is small but quite interesting. Nice break from the concrete jungle of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1027OCmeganc
50,Great afternoon out - week day only!!,Excellent. Really interesting and spectacular views. Great value but don't go at the weekend since its a nightmare to park!!. splendid views across LA and of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651KevinB651
50,Fantastic views,"Great for an afternoon visit. Wonderful views of the Hollywood sign and vista of LA. Observatory very interesting....guided are very knowledgeable, does mini lectures. All you need to know about space, the universe etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindarO3214KW
50,Beautiful for sunset!,We made it up here just in time for the sunset and it was busy at this time. It took us way longer than expected to drive there and the car park was full due to a concert that we didn't know about prior to travelling. We parked on the street and did a 10min walk uphill to the observatory. It's a must see!! Beautiful scenery and you get a sense for the vastness of LA. Bring a good camera!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nymou5
40,"Great views, but very crowded with almost impossible parking","On our first evening in LA my friend and I decided to head up to the observatory after dinner, hopefully to get some good views of the city and Hollywood sign before it got dark. Upon arriving we realised we had underestimated the popularity of the landmark, it was inundated with visitors and was very busy. Parking was a mission in itself, having to find a spot quite a distance from the observatory and hike our way up the hill in some heat. Luckily as it was near sun down the temperatures were more manageable. Upon arriving at the observatory it reminded me greatly of my time playing Grand Theft Auto V and you can see the influence LA had on the game. I took some nice pictures of the city and sign which were aided by the fantastic sunset. It's worth a visit for the views and landmarks, but be prepared for difficult parking and lots of people, however, if you're in LA then it's one of those must visit spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/digitalspirit
10,Don't waste your time if you want to see the Hollywood sign,We were deeply disappointed that this was pointed out to be the best viewing location of the Hollywood sign. Not easy to get to and once we were there it is a winding narrow road that was backed up beyond what the eye could see. Spent over an hour making it up the hill only to be turned around by security at the top because the parking lot was full. Overall we wasted 3 hours and never did see the sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thumper39
50,Hall of the Sky,"Catch the beautiful sunset in the evening and overlooking the city of Angels. You can get a good morning work out by going up in the Observatory and catch the amazing morning sunrise with fresh morning breeze on top of the city. Get ready your camera and get a good pictorial of the view. Get inside and enhance your scientific knowledge of the hall of the sky. Very educational trip and interesting to explore science.You will love it and knowledge is power. At night you will enjoy the heavenly stars up the sky and the beautiful lights of Los Angeles. There is a shuttle that takes you to your car if you don't want to walk and do walking exercise.Every time I have guest, I make sure that I can show to them the Observatory and everyone is amazed. It's a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cecilleq2014
40,Interesting,"Good for views of the city, as well as for the observatory itself. Be prepared to walk at busy times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FatWelshBloke
50,Take in the views,"Be prepared to walk up hills. It was very dry and a hike up the hill. We went about 11:30am on a Wednesday. There was no parking left available at the top. Maybe go early enough and you can get a parking spot at the top. The observatory and the views are free. There are museums inside the observatory but I believe they cost. We got some awesome pictures of the views and the Hollywood sign. Plenty of hiking trails throughout the park. There are bathrooms, water and snacks for sale right out side the observatory. I would suggest this to anyone looking for beautiful views for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanlL6306MA
50,Wonderful view,View from top was really good. That too in the night it was really awesome. Good to have a relaxed evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pranavikav
50,Tried to find the Hollywood sign but found this gem instead!!,We went here looking for the trail to walk to the Hollywood sign but we ended up making a wrong turn. This place was AWESOME and so much better. It was very crowded but definitely worth the parking headache. Great views of LA and the Ocean and some neat walking/hiking trails nearby. Come with water if you plan to hike. We weren't prepared but would definitely visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZCMomof3
40,"Cannot describe, you must be there yourself","What a wonderful trail. Went there 3 times in 2 years. Although it is quite a drive from Vegas, but it deserves the time. You can see LA from the top with nice weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashrafym
50,Wowzers,Felt like a kid in a candy store. Everything was amazing. I couldn't get enough of the view. The observatory itself was spectacular; I was literally skipping with joy. The Tesla Coil lightning show was also great. I went at night but I would love to go during the day to take better pictures of the view. I would literally work there if they'd let me. Didn't realize just how much of a nerd I was until I walked in and geeked out. Definitely would come back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615shael
50,relaxed day,the place is up on a hill so the view is amazing. you get to see the hollywood sign almost clearly. the observatory is scientific with lots of paintings and information. you may get bored if you're not interested in such topics but i found it highly amusing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fozb703
50,Beautiful view.,"You have to get there in good time, because it is very hard to get parking. You will probably not be able to park at the observatory, so bring your walking shoes. The walk is very beautiful, so it doesn't really matter. The view from the observatory is beautiful, and you get the 360 degrees view over the city, the mountains and the Hollywood sign. A lot of fun stuff inside the observatory for kids as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariiabak
40,Great views of LA even though we were too late for our show,"Traffic is horrendous in the early evening in LA and consequently we arrived at the Griffith Observatory 5 minutes too late to get a ticket for the 8.45pm showNevertheless, the nighttime views over LA made the journey worth it.No admission charge but there is a nominal charge for their shows - $2 to $7 per person. Parking there is free but it can get crowded and people park on the roads. Do allow sufficient time to get there if you visit so you don't miss your show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CableFamily
50,A wonderful educational destination,"I've been here before, but this time I took in the shows about the universe, planets, the ocean and the northern lights. This is a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the planets and how the evolution of space has created the universe. What a wonderful show and only for $7. for each feature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825debram
50,Romantic all day long!,"This place is so great, I just can't get enough and even though I have only gone 3 times I want to keep going. Let it be dawn, midday or sunset the view is just mesmerizing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebaddestnoona
40,Great view,"A must visit day or night. the view is awesome alway love to visit here when in town, but crowded on this last visit great summer night to be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotthL3715KH
50,Great place to visit!!,"My family and I visited LA for a few days and wanted to see Griffith Observatory and a show. Since we were travelling with young children, the “Water of Life” was our only show option. The other shows are for children 5 and above. We decided to join as Friends of the Observatory (FOTO) so that we can get guaranteed parking and discounts in the gift shop and café as well as reserve our tickets ahead of time. The ticket prices were also very reasonable. When we arrived at the observatory, after driving past many cars that had to park along the hill, we were let through the gate (since we were part of FOTO) and were permitted to park in the main parking lot just outside.The planetarium was clean, comfortable and cool. As members of FOTO, we were also allowed to be seated first. It was a joy to watch with an in-house narrator. Outside of the observatory there are many photo opportunities including yet another view of the Hollywood sign. After the show, we were ushered outside to a large patio with spectacular views of LA, but we promptly returned inside and went to the lower level. There were some really cool exhibits on space that our kids enjoyed. Afterwards, we went to the café and had hot dogs and sandwiches. The food was decent and satisfied us. Across from the café was a nice little gift shop.We were very happy we paid the fee to join as FOTO since the climb up the roads for normal parking would’ve been too much for our ‘older’ companions and young children. We recommend for anyone looking to spend some time at Griffith and for those that love planetariums, that they join with FOTO to get the little perks we described above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familythattravels30
20,Disappointed,"I wanted to bring my children to the observatory to see the Hollywood sign and to see the stars from the west coast since we are from new England so we made our way over to the observatory at 7 am. The first road we went to was ""supposed"" to bring us to the observatory. After sitting in the line for 30 minutes we get to a roadblock with a sign saying to use another road so we turn around and go to the other road where we wait another hour and a half to park 2 miles downhill from the observatory. So I walked up a steep hill with steep drops on each side with 3 children 8,9,12. By the time we got to the observatory we walked to find the Hollywood sign and had a hard time finding it because the lights illuminating it were off!!! We walked to see the LA skyline than a announcement saying the observatory was closing went over the speakers. 2 minutes later park Rangers were lighting up their spotlights on their trucks telling everyone to leave. So 4 hours wasted. Very dissatisfied. I would pay to park if it meant that I wouldn't have to wait 2 hours to park 2 miles away and not have time to see anything. Unless you get there at 5 pm don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil5383
40,Interesting both evening and daytime,"You can see the sun from an inside telescope or go on the roof and see whatever interesting is happening in the night sky. The museum has many interactive displays. Check the schedule ahead of time to watch one of the shows. A wonderful blend of the old displays with many, many new ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilief2014
50,Good place to see the Hollywood Sign and grab a drink,"Was a nice place to see all the views of LA as well as the famous Hollywood sign in the distance. A nice spot outside to grab a drink in the sun. The only downside is that, of course, it is super busy as you'd expect from such a tourist hot spot. So parking can be really quite tricky and you might have to walk a fair distance from the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JP26travelobsessed
40,Great for the views over LA,Well worth a visit. Parking can be very difficult and try to avoid the weekends. Make sure you bring plenty of water. Worth paying for the shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eileenl4

50,A Must for the Best Views of LA,We visited the Observatory at night and it was amazing. It is very busy so be patient. We actually drove right up to it and parked in the main lot while others parked way down the hil and had a long walk to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lloydg570
50,What a view.....,"We visited on a Monday when the Observatory is unfortunately closed! BUT........We visited at sunset........WOW!The view overlooking the iconic Hollywood sign was what we went for but the view of LA as it starts to go dark was amazing. We got loads of fantastic photos of the views.......it makes you realise just how vast the city is!The only downside was the amount of traffic at the top of the hill,the car park couldn't cope with the numbers. I ended up driving back down a bit to park then walked back. It might be easier to go a mid afternoon,view the Observatory then wait for sunset?........just not on a Monday😬",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pugliablue
50,Excellent,"I visited with my 12 year old son. This place was extraordinary. It well designed that captivates you through a talented blending of videos, artifacts, displays, and layout. It is a bit of a drive to get to but well, well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamLam3
50,A great day out,"A taxi driver told me about this place, so I thought I would check it out. It is a real gem. Fantastic views and a really interesting musuem. Worth going to listen to one of the talks that they run throughout the day too, very entertaining. And if you are there as the sun is setting, take a walk back into the city,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjj692012
50,LA Must Do,This is a must for all people visiting LA. it was super packed when we went but because the places is so big it didn't matter. Great views of the entire city and Hollywood sign. TIP: even when it says parking lot full - go check! There were sooo many available spots because people didn't just check!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColetteK683
50,Amazing Views~,Serene time here . I keep coming back for the views and the interesting information on planets always available in the outside gardens with Telescopes pointing to different prominent planets of the hour!I just wish the traffic would be better co-ordinated! They guided me to a lot and then gave me a parking ticket this past visit. When i confronted the office who was very nice to talk to i was told well we know there are no signs so fight it and you will get money back. Well hope that happens. But would advise people to be careful parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuhiMusafir

40,Amazing view,We visited on a Monday - unfortunately the observatory is closed! That said there is a viewing area for all and it was worth the steep climb. It gets very busy and we had to park a long way down the hill / wouldn't recommend for anyone who struggles walking. Go later at night too- it's a bit cooler.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/976carolinet
50,Superb view,Griffith Observatory offers an outstanding view of the city of LA. Visit around sunset and stay for a while to catch a glimpse of the star-filled sky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306bryanth
50,Good choice,"This is a must see attraction. If you want to take some good pictures you should visit this observatory. It is on a budget, the view is spectacular and you will take a lot of memories at this place. Some people want to take a special picture with the Hollywood panoramic sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanl774
50,Good field trip for Jr. High kids,"We took out 8th graders there when they study Physics/Earth Science and they had a scavenger hunt worksheet with them while touring the observatory. Most if them had fun and learned a lot there. Especially the planets exhibit is a hands-on kind of place for them to explore the gravity on different planets first hand. When I saw their expressions of surprise and excitement, I knew it was a good trip for them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raylingc
50,Birthday ...,My Kids had a Great time !!! They all took so many pics and selfies too !!! Nice weather and good crowd..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheleannd
50,Having fun with familie.,"The place is amazing, you have a nice view, the show is great an very creative and the employees are very nice.The price is affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681samiam
50,Great view,"On summer the hiking is really hot, there are not a lot of trees on the way up so its better in car but the view is amazing and there is interesting information at the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaTarrifa
40,Nice views!,"I should start by saying that we never went inside the observatory since we were visiting early in the morning and it didn’t open until 12 pm. We went around the observatory and enjoyed the excellent views of the canyon and Los Angeles. The observatory building looks very nice and creates a nice atmosphere there on the top of the hill. There were plenty of parking spaces available when we arrived around 8.30 am but when we left around 9.30 am it was already full and cars were chasing parking spaces. You can also park along the road down the hill but then you need to walk for 5 minutes uphill. This is a beautiful place to visit, offering an excellent view and good opportunities for nice photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joky80
50,One of the LA must's,"Great way to see the city, both the downtown area and the valley, with a superb sunset. Ooh yeah and don't forget the stars...literally;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hadasad
40,A Must-visit Stop in L.A.,"Whenever we have friends from out of town, we always make this place a stop among several attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcrasco
50,Great way to spend the afternoon,"My 3 year old grandson sums it up- this is the coolest place ever! Why do you say that?, says Grandma. Because I can use my imagination to see space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9798YCdianac
40,Cool Outing!,"Went there with a few friends the other day and was impressed with the view and beauty of the mountaintop. We parked half a mile down the road and it was quite nice to walk up the hill with hundreds of others, as if we were part of a cult. The road up to the observatory is quite breathtaking and the views at the top are even better.I must admit though that waiting in line at the top to walk in to the observatory is quite useless since the telescope only shows a speckle of a view of Mars, but it's definitely part of the experience and I did wait that whole 20 minutes in line...It's a little annoying to not have much reception at the top in order to snap nice pictures away or make a phone call, but there is wifi on the premises, but it didn't work :(All-around fun thing to do around noon when it's hot, or at night to watch the sun set, but make sure to bring warm clothes because it gets quite chilly at the top of the mountain.Architecture is very charming as well, would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanmC970CD
50,Family trip,It was great to visit because we get to learn more about the planets and you get to see the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82jaspreetk
40,Prize after the hike,The Griffith observatory is the prize after the hike and offers great views of the Hollywood sign and the city of Los Angeles. Though some people drive there also. But I suggest you hike. The lawns are pretty well maintained and you can laze around and soak on the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maybelater15
40,Spectacular views of LA and Observatory perfect for novice atronomers,"The Griffith Observatory is worth the Uber fare up Mount Hollywood for the magnificent views of LA and the Hollywood sign alone. However, the grounds and surrounds are beautifully maintained with some hiking trails for the fit and energetic. All this before you enter the Observatory which delivers on its promise for free informal education in all matters relating to astronomy. We went during the day so did not get to see through the telescopes at night so a dusk visit might be a good idea for those wishing to see the sights as well as the stars at night. Traffic on the way to the Observatory was heavy when we visited so this should be taken into account with respect to travel times to and from during peak times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duncannj
50,Great experience,"My 4 year old loves space, so this was a must do. The overall experience was great, and the show with live narration is amazing. Parking was horrible, but understandable given the location. Only other strange thing is you can't go to the show if you're under 5 (unless you lie and say you're 5. Wink wink)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmDeeEm
40,Surprisingly good!,"We went on an afternoon and this is a surprisingly good attraction. No fee for entry, but Uber, or a taxi will cost you to get there. You'll get great views of the Hollywood sign from the roof of the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663patrickt
40,Half Day Adventure,"The Observatory is a great stop on your trip to LA. I've been with my boys a few times, and they enjoy it. While Griffith Park can be an entire day adventure (hikes, Autry Museum, etc), you'll only spend 1/2 day at the observatory.That's not the reason for my 4 vs. 5 stars. The parking here can be HORRIBLE. People are often forced to park far away and need to walk uphill to get to the museum. It's still worth the trip, just be prepared to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950brianz
50,Excellent Place,Good and interesting exhibits. Great place for everyone. You can learn a lot of things and have a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karensG3933PQ
40,Worth visiting,"This is a free attraction, and it is a nice place to spend a couple hours or to go for an easy hike. We had to park about a half mile down the hill, and the walk up was enough of a hike for us. We went in August, and it was pretty hot. The exhibits inside are ok, but the views are really cool. Great opportunity to see the Hollywood sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShinyShoes777
40,Classic LA experience.,If you want to see LA you must visit The Griffith Observatory. Best views and one of the best parks in the city. The Observatory is very interesting and you'll learn something as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344sethp

40,Griffith observatory,When visiting los Angeles you have to go up to the observatory ...for the best views and photo ops of the city ..plus it's just a very historic and great place ...there's lots of parking along the street going up the hill ..and then you walk ..but as someone who lives here and us up there a lot ..drive up past all the traffic to the top parking lot ..it's small ..but if yu go around in circles a couple times you'll get a spot ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arkitex
50,Amazing View,Great to hike up to from the bottom of the trails otherwise you can drive right up if there's parking available. The views are amazing on a good day. At night they let you look at the stars through the telescope. Great time. Be sure to take a picture standing in the spot where James Dean filmed Rebel Without A Cause. There's a plaque.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sebastian825dlb
50,Great skyline view; and worth revisiting school science days!,"Been there multiple times, for anyone visiting us in LA we keep this as one of the places to visit.Great panoramic skyline view of the LA city from the rooftop behind. And also you can see the Hollywood sign at far.Its just great fun for school kids. It brought out the school science kid in me too -- The Tesla coil (firing at intervals, make sure you wait in line on time), lot of displays explaining different astronomical items, and the planetarium shows -- great attractions for all.The staff were friendly to explain if any questions you have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TapanBorah
40,The Griffith Park Observatory,A little seen attraction unlike Hollywood Blvd but an educational adventure good for children and adults if they are interested in space and the universe. Great for hiking and an awesome view of downtown and on clear days the Pacific Ocean. The opening scene of the first Terminator was filmed there but unfortunately they removed the vending machine area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamikazi54
50,Must visit when in LA,Great place to spend a couple hours. The hiking is amazing and you get some of the nicest views of LA from there. Highly recommend next time you visit Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matiasstof
50,Good Place for a Date,Griffith is a must for a good date. The parking is tricky so just take an uber or lyft. The views are tremendous and the indoor stuff is also super fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelAMullins
50,Such a great place for family or even self,Ya can't go wrong adding in a stop to this place while in LA. Educational and some great views all around so not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjs508
50,My day at Griffith Park Observatory,"I highly recommend this facility to everyone of any age! All different age groups are bound to find something of interest at the observatory. They've completed additions in the past few years and what was a very interesting place has become even better! From watching the skies and checking out cool science exhibits to monitoring the most recent earthquake activity, The Griffith Observatory is awesome! AND, the views of the Hollywood sign and downtown L.A. from the park are spectacular. Again, highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurl758
50,AMAZING Place to Visit in LA,"** Please be sure to like my review so I keep on reviewing for my fellow friendly travelers!**Have lived in LA for 6 years but have only been to Griffith Observatory about 3 times. I should go more. It's BEAUTIFUL. Great for a visitor. Amazing views, laid back atmosphere with great places to hike, food if you are hungry, inexpensive to go into the planetarium and go see the show. Definitely go here!Tip - there is parking of you drive all the way to the top. The people that are parking on the way up are hiking. If you don't want to hike, drive to the top for amazing views. If you want to park up top, you can always hike on your way down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/238oceanf
50,AND it's FREE!,I live in So. Cal and have not been in the Observatory since it was remodeled 9 years ago! Just went last week and WOW! It had much of the old flavor but much improved exhibits and shows. Really if you have out of town guests and you want to go somewhere unique & cheap ...it is a must go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857michaelm
50,Wow! Great views!,This is a must do in LA to check out the skyline view. We parked down the hill and hiked 1/2 mile up. The venue is free and has really good exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ferrari458_Cali
50,Surprised,Didn't realize how great inside the observatory was planned to stop for a quick hour for photos spent 3 hours just exploring inside. Views was fantastic. Hollywood sign a little far away for a photo shoot thou from that location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairandb
40,Rebel with a Dawes,"I visited the Griffith observatory located in the Loz Feliz section of LosAngeles, Ca. You have a few options getting to the top of the hill; you can drive up, walk up (about 2 + miles) and I think there are shuttle buses that take you up. I chose to take an uber and have the driver drop me off a quarter of a mile before the entrance (I think you have to pay for parking, but I might be wrong). The walk was uphill and will give you great views of downtown LA and the observatory as you're inching closer to it. Once at the observatory, you are free to walk around and explore. Multiple levels and staircases will showcase the lovely views of parts of LA. From downtown, Hollywood sign, and Pacific Ocean on certain days. The observatory is a small museum with many exhibits and demonstrations. They have hiking trails to the left of the observatory and everywhere throughout the park. They also have a bust of James Dean displayed outside. Where a good portion of 'rebel without a cause' was filmed.You can easily spend a day hiking and picnicking. At the base of the hill is The Greek Theater. The concert venue has many big named acts and it's worth a look into syncing your visit with a trip to the observatory then having a picnic then catching a show at the Greek theater. Alabama shakes and Dawes were playing the day I came and it was an awesome way to end the night....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rgd973
40,"A lovely place, great view","The parking is awful when busy. A really nice view of the Hollywood sign & LA. Nice place, clean & tidy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigblueAl
50,Excellent exhibits,"Had a very enjoyable few hours looking at the exhibits. Great explanations and hands on things for the kids to try out. Great location, with excellent views of the city, mountains and of course the Hollywood sign. Only downside is the horrendous traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrDolittle1
40,Worth seeing,We parked down the hill and hiked 0.6 mile up- the views on the way we're worth it and I'm so glad we visited. Next time will also walk to the Hollywood sign. Is fab that this attraction is for free and really interesting exhibits. Would love to go back for a nighttime viewing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritinWien
50,Cool place,Lots of good exhibits... view great... loved the hourly Tesla coil firing! Great opportunity to get a Hollywood sign pic too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoryF1
50,Super epic evening views,"This is a must do in LA to check out the skyline view at night. Its a good place for kids too. We didn't go to a movie or anything and didn't hike in the immediate area, but it looked like it was great if we had more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimmyJ20
20,Not much to see,The view is nice and the architecture is good too but is a pain to get there and lots and lots of people go there. Why ? I still can't figure it out.Save your time and go to Huntington Beach instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalnomadforyou
50,"Great view, crowded!","Beautiful place, Great air, Hollywood sign visible from distance.Posibble hiking routes.Planetarioum offers free lobby exhibitions, than payed entrance for more.Police did great job maintaining the busy ttaffic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamglibovsky
50,Amazing views but lots of traffic,"Great views of LA from the top. Drove here to hit sundown, the traffic was really busy with limited places to park so plan ahead. Once at the top it's great, with telescopes set up to see various planets for free. Got some amazing photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9406BBdanb
50,Wow weeee,"Best time to go up is about 30 mins before sunset, reason be you have a great view of the city and also of the Hollywood sign be for the night.Note the sign does not light up so make sure you go up during the day/sunset.The other thing is parking you might have to walk a lot because most parking is on the side of the mountain but the walk is decently worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59juanr
40,Quite educational,"You do get a good view and selfie picture with the Hollywood sign got here, however like most attractions in LA it is busy. We were lucky to find a parking space close to the entrance of the observatory, however I wouldn't recommend walking with a stroller any further from there. There is no sidewalk or guardrail and cars all along both sides. However the observatory is very educational about the solar system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katt2212
40,Go at Night to see the twinkling lights of LA,This place can busy on a Saturday night. If you want to see the Big Telescope leave plenty of time as it shuts by 9.30pm and you need 20 minutes. Interesting place. During the day you can see the Hollywood sign in its glory on the hills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamali_kuri
50,"Great views, great science","Visited after a hike along the adjacent trails. I'm really glad we took the time to visit the observatory as well, next time I am here I want to skip the trails and just soak up the sweet sciencey goodness!This place has really interesting and easily understandable exhibits about astronomy...its history, current astronomy projects, and what we have learned from our study of space. Lots of hands on exhibits where you can learn about the periodic table and about the spectra of elements, different kinds of stars, and some live action displays that illustrate how seasons work. On top of that there are stunning views of the LA basin; the design of the building brings cool breezes in between the pillars of the building to create natural air conditioning.Definitely a place to visit when you come to the nearby trails!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retinol13
50,Amazing views over Los Angeles,"We stopped for a few photos over LA. Great views of the city and the Hollywood sign. Plenty of free parking . We went during the daytime ,and if we had the time , would have come back in the evening when everything is lit up .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samar14
50,An amazing place,We loved this place! So informative! And free!!Really loved the scales showing you what you weigh on different planets. Very clever. Richter scale was also very interesting.Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LothianArab
30,Great for Astronomy Buffs,"Hands-on exhibits perfect for astronomy buffs. Wonderful views of the city all around the grounds, and the somewhat distant, but still clearly visible Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herculesmom
30,if you're going to get a picture of the Hollywood sign,The day we went the Observatory was closed and taken over by a film crew. It was a smoggy day and the Hollywood Sign got lost in the haze. if you're going solely to get a picture of the Hollywood sign you might want to check to make sure it's a clear day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17SLing
40,To see the Hollywood sign,We didn't go inside it was actually closed on the day we went (Monday). We only went to get pics of the Hollywood sign and pics of downtown LA. Great spot to do both. Be prepared if it's closed you may need to hike up the hill ~.5 mile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amychab
30,Good views,Only gets a three because we didn't get to go inside but had a walk around the building. It was amazing how far you can see into Hollywood and surrounding areas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps582139
50,Awesome place to visit,"When I live in LA I visited there a lot, it is a good place to take a date, friends and see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigdogAZ2014
40,Enjoyed but very busy.,"Went up late in the evening, just before closing hoping for a romantic trip. Was still packed at 10:15 after closing. Great views though and an interesting trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaybottonley
30,Not so close to the sign,"Thought this would be closer to the sign, took a few pictures and stayed only 10 minutes. Can be hard to find parking on rush hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatsN369
50,Great hiking & views,"Did not go into the observatory. Strictly went here for hiking. Great location, with amazing views of Hollywood/LA. Cleared trails with some signage offering direction and distance. Be ready for a workout on the way back up! I exercise regularly, but felt out of shape with the shorter trail I walked ... took about an hour round trip. Felt good, but had to take some breaks, especially in the heat of the August sun! Bathrooms with sinks are available outside of the observatory, which was a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njtraveler848
50,Great Hikes,"Great trails and beautiful vistas. Trails are suitable for even the inexperienced hiker. The Observatory is a treat and the sunsets are incomparable. Observatory offers educational films and programs throughout the year. Special telescope access and specific times, check the website. Great for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssmelnick
50,6th visit here,"I can't recommend going here enough it's a gorgeous and interesting building and the views are second to none! You will not be disappointed and you must go and see the show totally brilliant,staff very helpful,love this place .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulinerodwell
50,Excellent view!,It was very busy the day we visited and parking was a little crazy along the side of the road leading up to the observatory but we managed to park and walk the rest of the way up. It was much quieter when we left so maybe we arrived at the wrong time. I'd suggest visiting early morning or later in the day perhaps? The observatory itself was interesting but we were more concerned with the view of LA and getting the obligatory view (and photo!) of the Hollywood sign. For that it did not disappoint!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseJ1029
50,Great view of the city.,"Went up to the observatory on a Monday when it was closed. The parking lot was full but was able to park on the road 500 feet away. Walked all the grounds which were very nice. This is possibly the best view of the L.A. area. Went back the next day with friends and it was so busy that you couldn't find parking within a mile. Great place to visit, but try to get there early in the morning or there will be large crowds of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morganvonsprecken
30,A trip we didn't make - Trying to get to the Hollywood Sign,"We were visiting LA and wanted to see the Hollywood Sign. From googling, it was stated that the Griffith Observatory was one of the best places to view the sign. We drove through traffic and winded our car up the hill/mtn.We went on a Tuesday at 12pm. After a good 10 minutes of driving round and round up the mountain, we were informed that the parking lot was filled. They were not allowing people to park in the lot and were directing people to go back down the mtn side and park alongside the road.We drove all the way back down to find a parking spot. We finally found one but it was at least a good 30 min hike back up. We also had little children with us. We parked our car and started the walk. Within 10 mins, the kids were whining and groaning. It was an uphill hike so it wasn't easy either. The sun was blazing hot and cars were zooming in close as they drove up and down the hill. About a third up the hill, we decided to go back to the car. The view was not worth it, seeing the Hollywood sign far away.We went back down to our car and decided to drive down the street where we can actually see it. We found a neighborhood street 15 mins away and simply took pictures there. The street is literally RIGHT UNDERNEATH the sign, in big white bold letters. The traffic was sparse so we were able to stand in the street and get photos.If you're trying to get to the Observatory for photos, I don't recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pafouay2016
50,Lots of science,"Lots of scientific information here but also some absolutely amazing views and fantastic sunsets, traffic can be a nightmare in the time leading up to sunset though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yabbie67
40,Lovely spot,"Great location to see the whole of LA and the Hollywood (though not close). The Observatory itself is fascinating (if you like that sort of thing, and very educational).Parking is a nightmare, and be prepared to walk a fair way if you can't get into the car park (very full most of the day), but worth the effort.Restaurant is pretty basic, nice but nothing special. Kids weren't over extra tic about the exhibits on show, or the walk up, but liked it (grudgingly)Overall very well worth a visit for the views, and the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RWCG
40,Incredible views & great exhibits; logistical problems,"The view from Griffith Observatory is one of the most breathtaking sights in Los Angeles. The observatory's exhibits and programs are also very well-done, interactive, and thought-provoking. It's also great that the observatory is open late, allowing visitors to see the city and the site's great 20th century architecture illuminated at night. However, the observatory's major stumbling block is the traffic and parking situation. On several recent visits, I had to turn around after waiting in the backed-up traffic running down the mountain for 30 minutes or so. On another trip, I decided to park by the Greek Theater and walk up the road to the observatory. Bad idea - the roads lack sidewalks in many places, and I felt in constant danger of either being hit by a car or stumbling off the road and down the side of the cliff. Plenty of other guests were doing the same - I don't think that it's a long-term solution! Until they figure out a shuttle or public transportation option to get to the observatory, I'd recommend trying to find an off-peak time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanlintelman
30,If at first you don't succeed,"Many people parked on sides of main road and walked to Observatory. The parking lot was full, so drove through park, turned around, drove by again and very polite attendant told us they should have enough room to open the gate again in about 15 minutes. We drove for five minutes, came back and were admitted. Plenty of spots to pull in, we we were very happy we waited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O2299XXkimberlyb
50,Day Trip with Grandson,"Had a great time at the observatory. Was prepared with what we wanted to do and saw 3 shows. Do your homework before you go to save time. Visit the observatory website for all the information, dates, times! Worth the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharon2maui
50,Best Free Family Activity in LA,"The Observatory is free to the public, although one has to pay for the planetarium show. We park in a parking lot below and then hike about 20 minutes to the Observatory. This is far better than going through bumper-to-bumper traffic to the parking lot on top, by the Observatory. The Observatory has many hands-on display and, being on top of the mountain, commands a panoramic view of LA. The architecture of the Observatory is beautiful. I think this is the best free family activity in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chastu
50,A classic icon,"You can't visit LA without stopping by Griffith Observatory. The views over the city are breathtaking and you have great opportunities for pics of the Hollywood sign, especially from the roof of the Observatory (fewer crowds). But don't just stay outside. Be sure to visit the planet exhibits inside.The only downside is that parking is an absolute bear. Be prepared for a long hot walk to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaYB
50,Fascinating,If you are visiting LA you have to make a trip up here. The Observatory itself is fascinating and you can spend hours here learning about space and the universe. The planetarium show was excellent and definitely worth watching.The views over LA from here are breath taking! Make this a must,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Will0ldham
50,Amazing view of LA,Well worth the trip up to the observatory. Some amazing views of LA and of Griffith Park. Enjoyable drive through the park up to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Jackson_6

40,Beautiful view if you find parking,"The Griffith observatory offers an amazing view of the city. The building itself gives a sense of timeless style and the museum offers free entry. The exhibits are educational and entertaining, they offer a show for an additional charge. It was well worth the time, although the only downside was we had to park very far away and hike up the hill. If you lucky enough to find parking close by that would be a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnw273

50,Full of Speechless Views,"The actual Observatory was a bit over crowded for my liking but I enjoyed hiking the trails. The staff were very helpful when providing information about the trails to ensure that we didn't get lost. Also, highly recommend taking the bus up instead of parking at the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S188UMashleyt
50,Beautiful,The ride was nice up the mountain. Trails are available to walk if you want to see more than the observatory. Great place to take pictures of the city and the hollywood signs. Loved this place very peaceful. Cool sculptures also!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unsatisfied19
50,Great visit,Great view of the LA basin even with the smog. Hollywood sign has a great view also. Parking is scarce. Traffic sucked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgm458
50,Nice Panoramic View,"We did a lot of hiking to reach the observatory uphill as the parking lots and uphill/downhill roads were filled with parking. We went much downhill looking for the parking space and I drove back close to the observatory, dropped my family, went downhill again till I got the parking. Walked a lot uphill to join my family totally exhausted but then getting a clear view of Hollywood sign and amazing city view I forgot my tiredness and relished the beautiful 360 degree city view from the top of observatory. I guess if you spend a little time driving up and down in your car you will surely find parking space from the cars that are leaving.Take advantage of clicking pictures as much as you can. I was lucky to have captured few breathtaking pictures.While there do attend the planetarium show with a nominal ticket fare which will be quite educational.For those interested in science, there is a large size Periodic Table displaying real elements in a wonderful background light. Shouldn't miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m_ahsan_uk
50,Beautiful and interssting,What an iconic view! We were limited for time and the Leonard Nimoy video was very informative. It was extremely crowded inside but outside we could enjoy looking at the Hollywood sign n the open air. Here's a tip....if you have a handicap placard drive all the way to the top for special parking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiBG
40,Brilliant views of LA,"The observatory has amazing views across the whole of Los Angeles, including the nearby Hollywood sign. Parking is free, but very limited. The first time I attempted to visit on an afternoon there was a queue of traffic most of the way up, the morning was much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gingerceej
50,Amazing views,Well worth the visit - best views of LA & the Hollywood sign.Disappointed that we couldn't get right the way up there as they were filming. I really wanted to see the place they filmed Rebel without a cause.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jlra1967
40,Great view of city and Hollywood sign,I know they do tours however this location was very busy when we went (Sunday evening) however the trip is worth it for the view of LA and it's free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kt632
50,Get there early for parking,"This is a great spot and a lovely way to start your morning in LA with a myriad of trails and drop dead views of LA and the Hollywood sign (although not the greatest view of it, being far away) if you care for that sort of thing.Really I class this as a must see when you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genki-nyc
50,Go At Dawn for Amazing Views and No Crowds,"We visited this the day after we arrived in LA after our flight from the UK. The eight hour time difference meant we all woke up really early, and I suggested heading here for the sunrise to get some shots of the Hollywood sign and LA.We weren't disappointed. The sunrise over the mountains was spectacular, the observatory is a gorgeous building, and the views did not disappoint. Going at 6.30am might sound crazy, but it really works. OK, so the observatory building was shut, but.... No crowds, light traffic, brilliant photo opportunities. Do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipandSheena
40,It's just something you need to have a passion for,"In a nutshell: It's just something you gotta love: Both Astronomy and Physics. That's mainly what the Observatory is about. You might as well bring the kids along- it's very kids-friendly. You never know, they might find their passion at an early age! Lastly, be prepared to spend around thirty minutes finding a parking space.As aforementioned, if you're going to the Griffith Observatory, make sure that you're a fan of Astronomy and Physics because those are basically the two main subjects shown. If you don't like these subjects, it's really just a wasted 3 hours for you. That's where those bad reviews on T.A. come from. If you're going to bring the kids along, be prepared to answer A LOT of questions they'll ask there! With each item shown there, you can see that they TRY to give a clear and concise explanation with signs to what is shown. It's always nice to have some background knowledge about these topics, especially if you're going with your family- it's not that easy to explain a spark chamber...Also, be prepared to spend time looking for a parking space. Tip: If someone leaves at the other side of the road, DON'T take the spot, because you will get a ticket (yes, I got charged $63!)Once you've parked, you are greeted with the huge building. When you're inside, the first thing you see is the Foucault Pendulum.Amazing sight. Several other amazing objects which are CERTAINLY worth taking a look at are the live seismometer and a real piece of the moon. Amazing sight.Lastly, you get a breathtaking view on the top view of the building, as you probably already saw from the traveler's photos on the Observatory's main page on T.A... You can also eat there (they've got salads, snacks, nachos, more than enough). You can see the L.A. skyline there, and you can also see the Hollywood Sign. It is a MUST-see at night-time!!In summary, come here only if you're a fan of these two subjects. Everything's inside as well, so it's great if you want to avoid the crazy heat of L.A. (or the rain!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharvinNP
40,Get there early!,"You can't beat the view from the Observatory. You can see downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. Our pictures were beautiful. We got there at 12:00 when it opened, but we had to park down the hill and hike up to the Observatory. We suggest you get there early for a good parking spot, but it was definitely worth the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EVGabriel
40,Can't pass up Saturn,"OMG! Getting to the observatory after sunset was horrible, with the Greek theater traffic being there as well. But we were told that it's the usual stuff and that it's worth making the trip, so we patiently drove, inch by inch. We finally reached the entrance, looked for parking along the canyon without realizing that there was still quite a long hike to the observatory itself. Good thing we had dinner before going and the weather was really cool so the hike was not bad at all. That night, our goal was to line up to the telescopes to see the planets (website says 5 planets are visible). Due to a long line on the second floor telescopes, we were advised to line up to the telescopes by the front entrance, which we did. Got to see Saturn and the moon, and by coincidence (as pointed out by observatory staff), the international space station, was also seen orbiting at that particular time. Really cool! Night-time views of LA also stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVMD
20,Yeah it would have been nice to see the sunset...,... but the traffic is just ridiculous. I've been in there before but this was our first time we tried to get there to see the sunset. We never did. We sat in the car in a line of cars that did not move anywhere. Nightmare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henna_mikkila
50,Beautiful View!,"The observatory has always been a favorite place of mine. I sometimes hike up to it and around it for the spectacular view, however going in for the tour is such a nice treat. It's always so interesting and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opheliabright
40,Visited during our Trek to Hollywood Sign,We came here on our trek towards the Hollywood sign - you can get some fantastic views of the city of LA from the viewing platforms located around the observatory. Can't say anything about the interior but there are many shaded areas (which we were grateful for in the 100 degree heat) and there's free wifi available which is always nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotAnotherTravelBlog
30,Good but not good,Good but I don't like two things: the parking and the restaurant. I was forced to park far away down then walk with my little kids to the summit. The restaurant is not clean and the quality of the food is not that much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khalidb583
30,Great View Hopeless Access,Best views of LA. Go hours before or you will be walking down winding roads in the dark to get back to your car. Next time review may improve if we get there earlier with a picnic. Did I mention the views are spectacular?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJMJanes
50,Amazing views!,Beautiful views across all of Los Angeles! We caught a Lyft to the Observatory which was an affordable way of getting up there without a car (and avoids having to find somewhere to park!) and went at sunset. It was extremely busy but to be expected given the time of day and year. Well worth it to give you a different perspective of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bystreetlight
50,Take in the sights,"One of the best places to see in LA, oh and it's free. Get there early to avoid parking far down the hill.Sights of the city are fantastic. Cafe has ok food. Good enough for a snack with the kids. Take in the views while you eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzyj905
40,Great view,This is a great birds eye view of LA. Best view of the Hollywood sign. We did not even go into the observatory. Well worth the climb up the hill. And it's free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKOvacation
40,Great Scenic place to visit,"This place is a must visit in Los Angeles, You will get the very good view of complete City view in evening. Unfortunately the day we reached had an power outage and it was closed. We just got the view from outside and had left back. Will need to revisit again when i revisit this beautiful place again.Note: If you are planning to visit this place, make sure you dial to this place and find out if it is opened if not all your efforts will be wasted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khadervalli
50,Brilliant views and free !,Just about the only thing we found in Los Angeles that you can do for free that is absolutely worthwhile. All of our group we impressed and enjoyed self opportunities and we're happy just sitting and enjoying the views.Parking is all free and it is worth heading through the observatory lot full signs as there were spaces there and on the downward road side near the top.Nice cafe with views on lower ground level but roof top terrace was perfect picture spot and look out. You can see the entire city and a great view of the Hollywood sign too.Telescopes weren't open to take a look through but I'm sure it would be interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuMeSomerset
40,Beautiful Views,I didn't go in to the observatory I was just here on a recce to find out my route to the Greek Theatre for a concert the next day. The walk up to the observatory is steep in places and the footpath not good. I assume for disabled people they allow you to drive all the way to the top. The views are stunning and even on a misty day the Hollywood sign was clearly visible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RexJS
40,Great hike,Hiked up to the observatory wth my partner. A lot more intense than I expected but great exercise. The views both on the way up and at the observatory are great. You can see all of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Lots of educational activities inside the observatory too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carmchanbrahar
40,The park is great and free traffic horrid!,"This is a great place for the panoramic views over the city, the ""Hollywood"" sign as well as very interesting in its own right.The traffic is dismal, and the parking is extremely difficult, which takes the gloss off the visit - we had a good wonder around the outside and learnt more around the relative position of the planets in relation to the sun from the map in the grounds - surprised by the distances and it is great fun watching kids try and walk around some of the tighter orbitsInside the pendulum is fun and interestingWell worth the hassle of getting there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryB194
50,Favorite spot on our tour,Really enjoyed our time here. The views from here are spectacular. Wish we could have returned at night so we could use the telescope to check out the stars and planets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieg1230
50,Smith Summer Holiday 2016,What a great find on recommendation from a family member. The best views of LA and the Hollywood sign plus all the great attractions inside. Persist with the traffic and parking a great place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3538EPdavids
40,Amazing views over LA,"Visited here back in May and it really does have some breathtaking views, which are well worth vising for! It was nice to get away from the city and be able to have a little wonder around and take lots of pictures. We got the bus, which was really cheap as we weren't driving whilst we were over there. Takes a little while to get into the park due to all the cars trying to getting in to but wasn't too bad in the end....and like I said was worth it for the spectacular scenery. Would recommend!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xSCBx
50,Simply Amazing,"There is nothing like!!! Parking is a beast but get there early and you should be alright. Otherwise youll enjoy a nice, possibly long walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vernonh410
50,Great museum and great views.,"The observatory provides amazing views of the city and the Hollywood Hills, especially around sunset. Griffith Park, where the observatory sits, is a beautiful and tranquil escape from the city, and provides some nice walking/hiking trails. The observatory itself is also very well done, with a variety of fascinating exhibits. There is also a cafe with decent food, and some outdoor seating providing very picturesque views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82
40,Must see in LA,Very interesting providing spectacular views of LA. Been there 3 times and each time close parking was non-existent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinej778
30,Parking is a nightmare,"Although it had a lot of interesting displays, the rudeness and quality control of the parking attendants, totally gave a sour impression. Realizing its free to visit, might explain the overwhelming amount of people as well. I was totally disappointed in my fellow patrons for the amounts of trash they would leave onsite. We went during the week, and was amazed how far down the path we had to park, and upon walking to the actual observatory, counted well over 25 free spaces. As we descended back down the attendants only allowed certain people to bypass the cones to park at the actual parking lot? The rest they just yelled and screamed at to keep moving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpieT_12
40,Great for Views,"The drive up to observatory was very busy and resulted in us parking at the side of the road about a mile from the top, we couldnt queue for much longer it was crammed. This was were we first saw the Hollywood sign in the distance. We visit before sunset so was nice to see the views before and after. Overal it is a very nice place, its free but very busy! We visited for the views but if it was less busy then we may have spent more time looking inside. Toilets are inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finn_Freya
30,Very crowded!,"We just attempted the Griffith Observatory with our 2 children, ages 10 and 11. It was extremely crowded. At 8:00 pm on a Thursday night, it took us 30 minutes to drive up the hill to the full parking lot (we kept hoping we would catch someone leaving), and 30 minutes to drive down. The view from the top at night was phenomenal. However, we didn't park, nor did we brave the throngs of hundreds (if not a thousand) people to make it to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mez
40,Great view of LA!,"One of the very best views of LA, including the famous Hollywood-sign.The best time to visit is definately afternoon and evenings. LA can be very foggy in first part of day. It normally clears up later in the day.Beware of way too many few parking-sports, so people park in the road up to the observatory. It's ok, but a bit chaotic, but you won't get fined!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SveinBjorge
10,Couldn't get near it,"Spent ages in the awful LA traffic, to get there, went up the hill, completely jammed, in a line for ages, then the staff waved us away and closed off the road. Went down the road looking for a parking spot - by the time we found one, we were miles away. To walk back up with no sidewalk was dangerous and not really possible in that heat.Would have appreciated the staff telling us way before that it was full up. About 4 or more hours wasted in the end, all told.Trying to find something positive to say to help you avoid the same thing but can think of nothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9412VIsteves
40,Beautiful views of LA,"Go in the morning before it's crowded and hot outside. The views of the city are outstanding. I haven't been inside in years, but the views and the grounds are worth a walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahaK7208CW
40,Brilliant visit,Visited in August 2016 and lovely views on all of the downtime LA area and thr Hollywood sign and a great way to spend a few hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
40,Amazing views/traffic a bear,"We wanted to catch the sunset at Griffith Observatory and it was well worth it. Gorgeous views of the city. The traffic to get to there was terrible. There was a concert at the Greek theatre and there was a sign that the parking was full. We parked pretty far away (about a 20 minute walk) to the car and we had to be creative with our spot along the road. My advice is to check the events that are happening before you go and try not to go on a weekend, but if you do, give yourself plenty of time and pack your patience. By the time we got to the Observatory, we didn't have time to see the shows as it overlapped with sunset. The free museum looks great and we'll come back to visit next time. The planetarium shows can be bought at the entrance for a small fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogimomma
30,Holloywood sign,This is one place to see the hollywood sign in a distance.Its a very popular place so try to be as early as possible.The availibilty of parking is a big factor.Its a must visit place.Its a very crowded place also. I dont think there are food stalls here so better get your food before starting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kuriachan
50,Breathtaking views!,"I don't know about the view through the telescopes, but the view across Los Angeles is mighty impressive. From up here, you can see where the city meets the horizon in every direction; a hot and hazy skyline, with DTLA shimmering like a mirage in the distance. You'll scarcely believe the vastness of the city from this vantage point and it's very much the highlight of the visit. The observatory itself is a wonderful art deco style building, with a range of fascinating exhibits, and you can also get an incredible view of the Hollywood sign from the front of the building. Parking was suprisingly hassle-free, though there was a bit of a traffic jam on the way in. All in all, an essential part of an visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilooliM
30,"Too busy, had to park over a mile from the observatory as parking was full and it was backed up the hill","Was such a shame after braving the traffic to get up there. People parked up to 2km back. This was on a sunday afternoon, avoid during peak times",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordannh2016
40,Great lookout,"Although we didn't go into the observatory, we did walk around the building, which is impressive. The views are phenomenal and it is a great place to see the extent of the LA smog",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jubilee-jo
40,Just go and enjoy!,"Originally I had planned to visit on August 7 but changed my mind and went on August 6 Saturday. Arrived at the Griffith Park and the Greek Theater 10'ish and the traffic going up the hill to the Observatory (Obs) started to slow and 'Stop-n-go' all the way through the tunnel. In fact many people had parked on the sides already and walked uphill. As I inched towards the Obs, I noticed a few traffic attendants directing cars towards Obs' parking lot area. I was expecting to drive thru the lot and going down hill to park but to my surprise there were plenty of open spots in the parking lot. So I Iucked out I reckoned. It was about 11am when I reached the parking lot.As many reviewers had already mentioned, this is a worthwhile attraction to visit. The view is awesome and the Obs is just very beautiful. Watch a show or two if you have the time.I watched the Center of the Universe show. It was no bad. The seat is so comfortable and I actually got a few minutes of shut eye 😄 while the show was playing. It was that comfortable!Next time I would go in the evening to enjoy the night view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/occasional_traveler2
50,Must visit - Great view of LA from there!,"We took the local bus and walked most of the way but it was worth it. The view from up there is fantastic and you can see the Hollywood sign and you can take picture from there for all of LA. The Observatory wasn't open on the day we went but it is still worth a visit. If you are walking take water with you and some food in a backpack. it is a great view if you are walking up on the walking trail. Very peaceful walk. there are several other walking trail there, which we will try next trip as we would love to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravsta2015
40,Beautiful views,"A great place to see over the whole of LA.. the best pics of the Hollywood sign we got from our whole trip. Inside the Observatory there is a wealth of exhibits which are really interesting..the staff explaining these were engaged,helpful and enthusiastic. Some of the staff selling tickets to the Planetarium show seemed somewhat bored but maybe I was just unlucky. The only drawback is the parking,get there as it is opening and you should be ok ...bizarrely the traffic staff seem to shut off the parking lot even though there were people leaving and therefore spaces were free. A fab building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279judyg
40,LA Top 20,"Griffith Observatory is definitely a Top @0 please to visit in Los Angeles. I've seen it as high as #1, which seems high to me. Anyway, the view from this property, on a clear day, is spectacular. The Hollywood sign is close and the entire Southern California basin is almost all viewable from the amazing perch above LA. on a hazy summer day or a day when we've had fires in the southland....not so good. Parking can be tough on busy days, so be prepared to walk uphill.Inside, some films are free and one cost $5 to $7. I've only seen the free film at the Leonard Nemoy Theatre....very interesting. In addition, you can experience, for free, many unique exhibits. Many look like science projects that explain how amazing the universe is in its vastness and how tiny the earth is in our little solar system.Hope you have a good visit.Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rnewcomb33

40,Good Family Experiance,"Great place to go check out with the kids, very educational and interesting exhibits. Be ready for no parking or having to park down the hill and walk up if your going in summer the place was extremely crowded. If you are going to need a upfront parking space you may have to circle repeatedly until a parking space is available. I have been there in non summer months and was able to park no problem and see exhibits without waiting for others to be done viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleycoop1
50,Group of 24,A must see place and a perfect rest site for soaking up some sun. You can walk around the observatory for a full panoramic view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTSCTO
50,See LA in a whole new way,"This is one of the first places that I take visitors to LA. In my opinion it is one of the top 10 things to do. The observatory itself is fantastic. It has great exhibits and appeals to both the scientist and the lay person. It also has much to offer to adults and kids. It is a true fusion of science, art and culture.Over and above that is the physical location and the views from all sides. It affords great views and photo opportunities of the Hollywood sign from the balcony. Sweeping 360 degree views of the LA basin and access to some fantastic and really iconic walking trails. that you enter and exit via Griffith park and so pass by such icons as the Greek Theatre is icing on the cake.As good as the views are during the day they are possibly even better at night where you see both the enormity and the (grid) organization of the city laid out before you.Try to avoid weekends as it can be super busy, but don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozefish479

50,Breathtaking views,"We went around 11 AM and the observatory opens only at noon. But we were able walk around and enjoy the view from the top of the hill. Even at 11 AM the park was crowded. I highly recommend taking walking shoes to walk around the observatory building, the nature is very pretty. You can have a up close look at the Hollywood sign on the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y0gaC
50,Great!,Really enjoyed our visit with my wife and 3 daughters between the ages of 21 through 18. Use the telescopes on the lawn as they are just as powerful as the one in the observatory but the lines are much shorter. Parking is a problem but worth the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdtess

Parking is an absolute nightmare so be ready for this. If you see a spot outside the observatory on the way up to it take that spot. The car park gets full quickly. Also, read the kerbs for information on whether you can park at certain spots or not, i saw cars getting tickets. High chance you will have to park outside and walk up. The walk is not too and though. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE VIEW.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centrepunch

50,Too short,"We arrived to late in the evening to really enjoy the beauty of this place. It was so crowded even on a week night that we only got to spend about 45 minutes there. Saw a full moon rise over the City of Angels and saw the Hollywood sign. I suggest taking Uber there as parking is a nightmare and usually full, unless you like fighting crowds for a spot and walking up a hill for about an hour. It's a great place to view the city lights and sunset. I wish we had had time to see a show and experience more. I highly recommend getting their early and making sure you have enough time to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolp59

30,Nice view of LA but bad traffic going up,"The night we visited Griffith Observatory, traffic was awful. We ended up having our driver drop us off half way up and hiking up the rest of the way. When you get to the top, though, the view is great. You can even see where James Dean filmed ""Rebel Without a Cause."" Warning: If you end up walking down, make sure you find the right trail. Not everything is well-marked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johninarlington

30,Fab View But So Much Work!,"We went on a Friday night and didn't allow enough time to fight the traffic up the mountainside and missed the program which starts at 8:45 pm. We did enjoy the lovely view of LA, but we had to walk about a half mile uphill from our parking spot on the side of the road to reach the observatory. I will return for the full experience, but I'll give myself a couple of hours to spare, maybe getting to the museum at 6:30 on a weekend night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Gypsy-Mama
30,Right tour,This is a good place to visit but up must get the right tour bus so shop around before you select one.The Rasta bus is meant to good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DreamJetsetter
50,Free and Beautiful,Unbeatable views and gorgeous drive. Word of caution that the weekends are really crowded and you could wait a long line of cars to get a parking spot during week nights. Great view of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dpeshl
50,Visiting for first time,Not enough parking !!! We need to be able to park and or Drop off passengers . Very packed tourist location . I still enjoyed all the views and the Hollywood Sign :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843fayep
50,Beautiful,"Be very careful driving up there with the winding roads. Not enough parking so you may have to park on the side of the road and walk a little bit. Try to visit during sunset, it's beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maritza776
50,Well worth the efforts to get there!,"Our trip to the observatory started out a little rough due to our GPS taking us up the wrong roads! The up side of this was a very interesting drive through some very winding roads to see some beautiful homes! Once we finally got to the park, traffic was very busy. We ended up parking almost two miles down the road and had a long walk uphill to get there. It was worth it! The views are amazing! We stayed till almost dark and saw the lights of the city below. Fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1896UFbrians
40,Great View,As a local I enjoy coming to Griffith to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city as well as enjoy the view.It can get crowded at times and parking can be a little mad depending on the time you go. And let's not forget the traffic getting to Griffith again depending on the time you go (like going anywhere during rush hour is a horrible idea),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Franceska249
50,Beautiful views!,This is a beautiful landmark! The views from the roof are fantastic. Take pictures of the Hollywood sign during your visit! There are also many interesting exhibits inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274pattit
50,Kids & Adults... This place is loved by everyone + the views are superb!,An amazing place to check out. If you want to go for a hike and learn about science its a perfect place. You don't have to go into the observatory but it is totally worth it. The information and presentations they have are unreal.Go inside the planetarium and prepare to be amazed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The-DKP
40,Nice place,"Nice view, nice building. Must go place. You get a great view of HOLLYWOOD sign and the best view of downtown LA. If you loke hiking, wear good shoes and enjoy the beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fiftop
40,Fun learning center with gorgeous views,"It was delightful to see so many families there with their children eager to learn about the planets, our solar system and all things associated. BUT it was very crowded. This may be due to free general admission, it's summer, it was a Friday afternoon or all three. (There is a special fee for some shows).I accessed via hiking up from Griffith Park.Wonderful views up and down.I didn't stay long because it was quite crowded but would absolutely go again and try to do so during a time that it would likely be less busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve
50,On a clear day you can see forever.,"This is my #! place to bring out of town visitors. first be aware parking is horrid here, but if you slowly cruise the parking lot you will find a spot as people come and go, it is worth doing this. Entrance to the Observatory is free and even if you have no interest in astrology do go inside and wonder at this magnificent building. From the grounds you have the best view from anywhere of the Hollywood sign, great photo moment. Then there is a bronze head of movie star James Dean because East of Eden was filmed here and in the observatory. Watch the movie when you get home and you will see it all looks the same. You can climb the stairs out side of the building and from the roof you can see Hollywood, Downtown Los Angels and more. I love to stay up here with my guests and watch the sun set. I never get tired of this wonderful historic location in Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugarmillgirl
50,AMAZING VIEWS,Worth the drive up the hill. Look into the telescopes and look out over the city of Los Angeles. Get a good photo of the Hollywood sign! We did this at night and during the day and the both offer unique perspectives. You can't go wrong the time of day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomsQ5601AR
50,Beautiful!!!,very beautiful to go to at night and very relaxing and breath taking would be back again on our next trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8972GGmelissam
40,Great view of the city,"Plan ahead !!!! This is a free attraction including free parking .We went at night and there was no available parking so we waited about 45 minutes on the hill and parked on the hill and walked up 1/2 mile. Since it's an observatory we thought getting there at dark would be a good idea , so by the time we parked it was 915 and it closes at 10pm . There was about a 40 minute wait to view out of the big telescope which we were told is actually not as good as the telescopes setup around the property (you can wait in a shorter line for those ) . The place is really nice so there are things to see in the building like a museum . What you really come for is the view of the city which is spectacular . And a big surprise for me is that the Hollywood sign is not lit at night !! Would love to come back in the daytime. There are hiking trails around and it's really beautiful !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellegD9641HQ
40,Wonderful experience. Great to bring a date.,"Parked along the street. A good 10 minutes walk to the observatory. It was a wonderful experience. We spend a good 4 hours there. From watching the various shows to talking pictures of LA, to the cafeteria, etc... Highly recomment for the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A-Y-Lukman
50,Very well run public observatory,"We had a wonderful time at the observatory. The views outside were beautiful. The building itself is an icon. The attractions inside were very educational and interesting. The planetarium show,the centre of the universe, projected on a dome top ceiling was amazing. The narrator did an exceptional job and the machine uses to project onto the ceiling was remarkable.We were worried about a large crowd especially as we visited on a Saturday. However, though there was a crowd it was still comfortable with a small family.Be prepared to park some distance away from the observatory. You will enjoy the walk from you car or even better a trek along one of the many trails though the Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91wesb
40,Wonderful view of LA but congested.,We visited on a Wednesday and were able to find parking up the hill. The interior is a bit dated and worn but the view from outside is worth the trip. Would consider visiting if staying in LA for more than 4 days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridaFamilyofFive
40,Great view to see.,"Great view around the observatory, but nothing interesting inside. The best time to visit is not on the weekend or night, and you should come soon because parking lot is limited. You can park along the street head to observatory, so do not try to drive to the observatory's lot. There are no places if coming after 11a.m. It just takes you maximum 2 hours to visit, (if you don't watch a show), in case you'll plan all day for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447minhng_cn
50,Beautiful views of the city,Out very first day we drove up to the Griffith Observatory. The building itself is what drew your attention to it from town. The kids all enjoyed touring the building and learning some pretty cool stuff. But over all the beauty of the building and its views makes this a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenangrignon
50,Amazing place to see L.A. from top,Great place too see. L A from top and sign of Hollywood. We were there at 27.8 and observatory was closed :/ but still amazing from outside. Must see place at LA!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurkuma2000
50,Visit to see the sights,"What can i say, the views you get from the observatory are amazing. You can see Hollywood, Downtown LA, the Hollywood sign as well as a few surrounding areas of LA. The sights you get from here are breath taking. You the head inside and if you are into science you are amazed at the facts and information this place offers. You could easily spend hours here. I spent 2 hours here and feel like i barely scratched the surface of what this place has to offer. If you are not into science you can admire the views, have a bite to eat and a drink at the cafe and then drive through the amazing views that Griffith park has on offer. You can also take a hike from here and while i didnt do this myself the tracks looked amazing. It is a must for anyone visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasmW3094WG
40,Very crowded,"We wanted to go to the observtory at night, but it took us about 90 minutes just to climb the hill. It was so crowded that it kind of ruined our experience, but the view is very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassdy
40,Good for Hollywood Sign View,This Observatory is great if you want some views of the Hollywood Sign. parking is a nightmare as there are so many people trying to get up with their vehicles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandywey
40,More views,"Nice place to visit, seen it in the movies and its another way to see Los Angeles with some great views over the city and across to the hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590janicem
40,Beautiful,"Parking was a little rough - but, a great view! If you can avoid going at busy hours it's a fun experience and an unbelievable view of the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creps7763
50,"Skip the parking, hike to the observatory","We stayed in a great little AirBnB on Franklin, only about a mile to the observatory, so we walked. Steep hills up to the site, but the the trail through Griffith Park was great. Opening time was noon, and there were a lot of people there (parking lot overflowing), so a bit crowded, but the location, the view, the Art Deco buildings made it a great trip. Some good star/planet.meteor exhibits there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AggieJoe79
50,Love the Shows!,"If all you do is head to the observatory and catch the shows - its definitely okay in my books!Watch two shows and fell in love with the live narration and performance by the orator. She really brought to live the feeling of wonder and awe as our ancestors would have felt initially.I love how friendly the staff are and accommodating they are with additional requests during closing time e.g. We wanted to join the queue during the telescope viewing of planets and the staff just accommodated us even though they could have just said they were closing and cut us off.Fantastic place - don't drive in though. Uber if you can and you save a lot of time viewing then finding parking, especially when the park rangers start shutting off the roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliebrown390
50,Amazing Views,"Love this place, good walking trails and lots of amazing views. Sometimes you can spot celebrities. love it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaliM_11
50,Amazing Views and Planetarium,"From Griffith Observatory, you have stunning views of Downtown Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and the Hollywood sign. There are so many activities you can do here. The planetarium is amazing (see my separate review for Samuel Oschin Planetarium)! In addition, this is a great starting point for hikes in Griffith Park! I would recommend this for all in Los Angeles!TIP: If you're coming by car, either come in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the parking crowds as parking is extremely limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710maximiliang
50,Griffith Observatory Planetarium,"Our planetarium show was amazing. The narrator was amazing, making it sound like a recording. Would definitely recommend it if you can spare some time when at Griffith Observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710maximiliang
40,Beautiful cityview and space at night.,It's a great place to see the city and they have special nights when you can look through telescopes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauricenederland
40,Crazy crowded but crazy views.,We almost turned around before actually getting to the observatory. The line of traffic was horrible but there might have been another event going on. We also parked really far away so definitely bring shoes that you can walk up and down the hill in. The place was busy but we went right before sunset so we got to enjoy sunset there and it was incredible. We actually didn't see much of the exhibits themselves as we went later in the day but we did enjoy a planetarium show. We just spent so much time enjoying the views from the top that it really made the trip to the observatory worth it. Just be prepared for crowds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoustonCoolmom
50,Interesting,"Very nice view, you see all the city from there and also you can take a wonderful pict to the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YanaraSosa
40,Hot mid day hike - easy to get lost!,We did the hike from the observatory to Mt Hollywood which was easy to do and follow. Then we got lost on our way back! We took the wrong path and were walking away from the observatory. Make sure to keep a copy of a map on your phone. Great views of the hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhadam
50,The best!!!,This whole park was awesome! The show at Observatory...wonderful!! This is a MUST see on your visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246kandy
40,Great Views & Free to enter,"IT gets busy and hot up in the hills so get there early to avoid the crowds and the heat.The parking is limited, and people park the whole length of the approach road up the hill, and its a fairly steep walk if you park further down. i would advise you use a Cab or UberThe views are great and you get an excellent view of the Hollywood sign on the hill and is probably the best spot in LA to get the photo you want.The observatory is free to enter and walk around but you do have to pay for the Planetarium show.However there are lots of free displays and interesting things to see and d as well.there is a cafe and toilets in the main building.a trip up here is a must if your in LA just for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tony20002
50,Great place to learn and look,"We had a few open spots in my conference schedule, but so many great choices. We choose this because it offer hiking at the park and great views of the city and it was a great choice. While the park was great, the Observatory was just as good. We started by taking pictures of the Hollywood sign and the city but we ventured in to look inside. There were some great educational exhibits on space with that function to demonstrate what we know about it. Also the exterior design and interior decorations were also great. We decided to get tickets and the watch the pendulum.The presentation in the planetarium was very good and very reasonable at $15 for 2. While my wife and I may have momentarily dozed off for a second in this cool, dark space, the presentation was very good and enjoyable especially on a hot day.We then went outside for amazing views of the city. We also followed up for a stop at a great cafe below the Observatory to load up for a hike up Mt. Hollywood which offeded great views of the Observatory.All in all one of the best things we did in LA. Take the time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
40,"Beautiful views, plan ahead and be prepared for long walk to observatory","We went on a Tuesday around 12:15pm. Parking was a challenge. We parked 15min uphill walk away. We were rushing to catch a planetarium show, so if you walk at leisurely pace, you may have to park 20-25min uphill walk away.If you plan on seeing a planetarium show, get there 1-1.5hrs ahead of show time b/c of parking challenges and also the shows sell out. We missed the 12:45pm show, so we got tickets for the 1:45pm show and it was already half sold out by 12:45pm. They also want you to line up 20min ahead of time, so for us around 1:25pm. We went to line up around 1:20pm and there was already 50 people in line. All the seats in the planetarium are good seats. They ask you to sit starting from the back to the front, filling every seat.The view is amazing. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2BOS2
40,A place for those who are interested in science,"Accessible by Dash buses also, these shuttles are available at a frequency of 20 minutes and run till 10 pm, they charge 50 cents from Sunset Vermont metro station to observatory.Hollywood sign is visible from the garden outside the observatory. The observatory is a good place for those who like sun, telescopes, space, etc. I found the infrared image screen interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vkothari1
50,Educational,"Nice drive, nice view, very educational, good for families, people young and old. Went with my 90 year old aunt an my young teenage kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailtaal
50,Very goog lookout,The best lookout for Los Angeles. Also the observatory exhibition was great for the whole family. For us one of the best highlights in this city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USASUN
40,Great View,Great view of the city and Hollywood sign. Parking can be hard to find close by and climbing those hills depending how far you parked can be harder. But at the end of the day it's all worth it!It will leave a great memory for us.Catch your breath...enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbussenius
40,Beautiful,I recommend allowing yourself 45 min to drive up hill and park! Once there it's great! Go see the planetarium shows. I wish I had seen all 3 but we only saw 1 because we got ther at 7:30pm. Big telescope closes at 9:30 so make sure you see that! Great for the whole family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllieSoni
50,Griffith Observatory and Hike - a great day!,"I found it hard to research much on the observatory or hiking trails online. But we went, and hoped for the best.First the observatory. As my husband and I walked into the mobs of people in the lobby of the observatory (on a beautiful Saturday morning in July), we wondered how we would tackle it. We grabbed a visitor's guide and got tickets for the first available planetarium show about an hour a half later. We followed the guide's ""What To See"". Why is Pluto no longer a planet? ...Check out moon rocks and meteorites...See live views of the sun. It was fun! The planetarium show was awesome. Great explanation of the zodiac signs!Even lunch in the cafe wasn't a problem, and there were spots on the outdoor patio with gorgeous views of Los Angeles. In front of the observatory, you can take your picture with the Hollywood Sign far in the distance.There is a great map for hiking trails near the observatory entrance that is better than anything I found online. I have included pictures of it. We hiked the Hollywood Mountain Trail, 2.4 miles round trip. (NOTE: This is NOT the Hollywood Sign trail, which is on Mount Lee.) Beautiful views. Saw a golden eagle. Vista of San Gabriel Mountains from Dante's View. Very little shade. Wear sunscreen. Bring lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyE-NJ
50,Beautiful place to watch the sunset!,"Great place to check out the Hollywood sign and when the sun goes down its a beautiful photo op! Be prepared to walk. The parking lot is very small and parking along the street st reached on forever. Skip the line to check out the telescope and take a look through the smaller telescopes on the front lawn. The picture is just as good and you are able to take a little more time to really look. Plus, the lines are a fraction of the length.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727JamieW
50,Family visit with adult offspring.,"Great, informative exhibits and terrific hikes and views in the surrounding hills. Birdseye view of LA and neighboring communities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria6110

40,Wow what a view,"A great place to look and take photos of the Hollywood sign, also gives you an amazing view of Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779katien
10,Overcrowded,With Pokemon go players. It took us more than an hour to reach with Uber. Seriously traffic jam..When we finally got out top see what were supposed to be the main tourist attraction it turns out it contains somewhat basic science education. (I might be wrong because we didn't get to see it all before the place closed) the telescope were closing as well. The view was amazing but if I knew that that was all I would have visited a rooftop bar and watched it more in peace and quiet away from Pokemon go..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917elineh
50,Beautiful views and lots to do,"I've been going to Los Angeles for the past 30 years and had never been here before. My family and I drove to the bottom of the hill, as we walked up we were awestruck at the amazing views! Just breathtaking. Once we reached the observatory there was lots to do, and even on a Saturday it wasn't so crowded that you couldn't move around and see what you wanted. A great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelemichelec
50,Good Visit,First time in LA. Enjoyed the exhibits and the view of LA. Was a hot day and was crowded but still got to experience it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9472ZJdavids
40,Crowded place,"Finding a parking spot to this place can be tedious. You will have to walk a lot to reach the top if nearby parking is not available, which is pretty much most of the times. The observatory is pretty decent. Nothing special, just like all planetariums. Worth a visit though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InTheZion
40,Crowded on a Tuesday Evening?,"We drove up from Hillhurst Dr. after 5pm on a Tuesday, and the place was packed. The lot was full so we (and hundreds of others) had to park along the road quite a distance away and then walk up. The views from the observatory are great and it has ample restrooms. There are many educational stations and exhibits inside. Alas, we did not go into the planetarium, but lots of folks did.If you want to see the Hollywood sign from here, you can; however, this time of evening was not good for photos of it. Early morning or as the sun is setting would be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatM402
50,place for sunset,great views of LA and good place to spot Hollywood sign. Nice huge territory of park. You can climb it or get there by car. defintiely worth going for sunset as views are gorgeos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belliiiiita
50,Worth it - but no parking!,"We loved going up here - but agree with other reviews, take an Uber! Parking was a nightmare. Plus they're beautiful homes to look at on the drive up, so sit back and enjoy that on your way up. Loved the view of the Hollywood sign - we got great pictures. And also fantastic views all around! Busy, but plenty of space for everyone. The facility has a neat history and was clean. I'd recommend a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Floridafunsun
40,Great views of the city,Go up there for a great view of the city and the sign on the hillDidn't do one of the shows in the observatory and the queue looked massive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonP917
50,Fabulous place to see the LA scenery!,"We went at the same time that there was an event at the Greek Theater. Otherwise, parking was limited. If it was full, then you will need to park on the hill and hike up. Free admission. Great view day or night. Can see the ""Hollywood"" sign at a distance. Telescopes were there for people to use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonggary23
50,Beautiful during the night,"During the day it's possible to see all los Angeles, but for the best view, it's better to come at night.The observatory is opened during the night, and it's possible to see stars and sky.Very good place to visit, in couple or with family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vishay88
50,Take a Taxi or Uber!!!,"First off parking is horrendous! If you want to see the observatory and not hike (average about half a mile up the hill) then have someone drop you off and pick you up.They are closed on Mondays and admission is free! Plan to spend at least a few hours here.The observatory is up in the hills and it is gorgeous, but that means there is very little parking spaces. So what happens is people park on the side of the curvy twisty road and walk up to the observatory. I'd you are driving and you see cars parked close to the observatory PARK!!! You can continue on in hopes of getting a spot, but you will have better luck seeing Big Foot. I'd you so decide to drive. You will head up the hill go through a tunnel and then turn around, head back through the tunnel, and and back down the hill to where you should have parked in the first place.The walk up isn't as bad as you think it will be. It's uphill but it's a small incline. The walk down is cake, but bring a flashlight so you can see!The Observatory:Is free to get into. There can be a lot of people if you go at night and lots of kids on field trips. The lines for the telescopes move pretty fast. They have a few on the lawn in the front and 2 big ones attached to the building on either side. I highly recommend waiting in line for either of these! There are many things to do inside. So plan for at least 2 hours to see it all. When you walk in there is stuff to the right and left. But if you keep walking past the pendulum and up the stairs head to the left and down the stairs. That will take you to more exhibits, the gift shop, and a little cafe.There are a few 'movies' in the planetarium. There are $7 a piece and well worth it! Buy your tickets as soon as you get there, they tend to sell out. There is a ticket counter to the left as you walk in the main entrance. Or go to the right and then left down the first seemingly empty hall (immediate left) and look to your left. There is a ticket kiosk so you can skip the line and buy all the tickets you want. No cash here though only cards. There is a schedule above so you know what to buy. They are all great! So I'd you can I would see them all! And get in line early (it's our on the west terrace) You will sit in the order you line up in and they fill back to front. The closer you are to the back the more you will see! The shows are about 15 minutes each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monkebones
50,A must do in LA,This is such a fun place to visit and you can learn while having fun. Best place to see the Hollywood sign and great place to enjoy a day or night in the Hollywood hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscomorales
30,Nothing Special,I went here for the view of the Hollywood Sign which was the highlight of my visit. There is almost no parking so I ended up walking nearly two miles to the observatory. I visited on a Sunday and the place was packed which made for a very slow walk. The observatory was very sparse with few exhibits; it took less than an hour to tour the building. The views of the sign are great but the rest of it was a let down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joefromjohnsisland
40,Great views over LA,"The views over the city are so nice and theres a pretty good view of the Hollywood sign here, although I'm sure there are other spots that can get you closer. The inside of the observatory is so beautiful and there are a few astronomy-based things to do in there. The drive up is quite windy and can be a little busy, but its not too tricky. The parking is always crazy busy when we visit, so if you see a spare spot on the road up just take it and walk the rest of the way, it shouldn't be too strenuous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8137UUemmaw
50,Be reminded of wonder,The visit to the Griffith Observatory is a reminder of the beauty and wonder of our universe. Don't forget to hold the meteorite. 20 lbs of outerspace. The only downside is the traffic driving up to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahloewe2
50,Iconic LA landmark,"Great place for young and old in heart of Griffith park, great history and lots of things to do for young and old rain or shine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crodgers34
50,Well worth the walk !,"You have to park quite far down the hill as so many people were there (we went at 11am). The walk is hard and hot but you can see the Hollywood sign clearly and take photos.However at the top, the view is incredible and the inside is wonderful. A reallt interesting display of facts and models linked to planets. All free and cool !! Well worth a visit .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georginas736
40,Great place to see fantastic views,Whirlwind visit here at the end of a long day. There was a long queue to get right to the top and it was so busy even at 5pm. However once parked we could take in the amazing views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. The building is great and we had a quick wonder through the space section. On of the few places we have visited where it was free to park and enter the attraction. Worth the wait,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesW18
50,Top attraction,Griffith observatory is one of the best places to bring visitors. First of all it's free which is rare in LA and it provides great views of the city. Come early bc anytime after 9am on a weekend the parking gets insane! The observatory itself is awesome and very educational. Love it here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BnRadventures2015
40,Mrs,Great place to visit with family and friends but parking is horrible. There are very educational information for both kids and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636candacet
50,Excellent place for families,Very good educational experience on space and related topics for our kids and ourselves.Great vantage point to see LA from.Very good shows in the theatre on space esp the Center of the Universe one.Traffic can be a problem especially if there is a concert on at the event venue.Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaMaSin
50,First time visit to Griffith Observatory,The buildings are filled with astronomy exhibits and knowledgeable docents who share their passion about space and the universe. Admission is free to see the exhibits. Tickets are sold for scheduled planetarium shows. Get in line early to view the moon through a large telescope in one of the observatories (or view the moon through smaller telescopes set up on the lawn). The hilltop location of the GO provides an extensive city view if it were not for the smog/haze. The Hollywood sign can be seen in the distance.There is a free parking lot at the top of the hill which can be full. Parking spaces along the road to the to the GO are good alternatives to the parking lot at the GO.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shewoo
40,Beautiful view of Los Angeles,A must see when in Los Angeles. The view is stunning from here and great for pictures. You can also see the Hollywood sign from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandram513
40,Great place to visit,This is a great place to visit. My daughter had to go here for an assignment and we were all pleasantly surprised. She loved how they had exhibits about what she learned in her astronomy course. She said that it was nice seeing different concepts come to life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GH123vacation
40,Out of this world views!,"I've wanted to mark this place off my list of LA landmarks for a while. The Observatory has been featured in movies, television shows, and music videos. There are some exhibits inside, but nothing extraordinary. We saw a film in the planetarium, which was educational and entertaining. At night, various individuals set up telescopes for night viewing, but the lines were a little long. I'd suggest you show up in the afternoon to ensure you have a good parking spot. I do recommend a visit if it fits into your vacation schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajbalbo
50,Great place which is a must stop,"First to mention is that it has great view of L.A. and also nice view of the Hollywood sign. The museum is really great, and it's quite interesting to learn about the history of the place. Lovely time spent there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kojowakizbi
50,Memorable walk at the Griffith observatory,"Walking, cycling, and just having a leisurely time in this wonderful place in Los Angeles is recommended for all ages. It is good to see the whole city from the top of the lookout.This is a haven for bike riders and fitness fanatics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623crisc
40,Show was too good,Must visit place in LA . The history of astronomy show was super. Not to be missed. The lines of cars on weekends are toooo long. Food in cafeteria was good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinazrames
50,Great location,Free parking. Great to go there for the views of the Hollywood sign and views all over Los Angeles. Nice inside too for some science!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amy1218
50,A LA icon that is free to visit,Ok this has got to be one of the most recognized building in LA (next to capital records). It is also one of the few places that is still free to visit in Los Angeles (next to the Getty). I will say this before I actually review the place. Parking and getting there can be hectic and heart attack inducing at times. Keep in mind this place was built way back when the population was low. If you are lucky you can get parking in the parking lot on top (that is if its not blocked off) You can park down the hill and make it a hike (not for all). So just be warned Griffith Park by itself is beautiful so you always have a back up plan.Anyway the actual observatory is amazing. All the exhibits are worth seeing and interacting with it. Also if you have the time and money catch a show at the planetarium. Beautiful building and amazing views all around. Like I said before this place was built way back when so it can get very crowded in there. overall well worth the drive and the crowd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chainsawmadman
50,Could spend all day here!,"Beautiful views, great hikes, gorgeous building, wonderful exhibits, something for everyone. Would do this EVERY trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCamperNorwalk
50,very beautiful,awesome place.. i had reached here by using the boys scout trail since i didnt take my car. it took me around 25 mins to reach up there by using the trail .. the view is awesome.. and the observatory is very beautiful..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sachindedhia
50,The peak at the top of our hike,My girlfriend and I did a short 2 mile hike from the base of Griffith Park to the Observatory. It was great to view from the bottom to the top and offered amazing views of the Hollywood sign and all of LA. Very nice to have the convenience of WiFi at the top to get an Uber back to our hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyv104
40,A must see in LA,Came here in the afternoon. Was visiting my older Sister and her family a couple of years ago. You can hike up to obsevatory or u can take your car..its overlooking downtown LA and hollywood...what a magnificent view..youll see the hollywood sign on the other side...great sights and views for picture taking...no wonder this place was feautured in the movie Charlies Angels 2...this is a must see in LA..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danrM3310IJ
50,Fabulous views over LA! A must,We loved the Observatory. The views over LA were amazing and there's also a great view of the Hollywood sign though not massively close. We had lunch brought from the Observatory cafe and ate it on the terrace over looking LA. You could eat your own lunch on the same terrace which is great if you wanted to take a picnic. The space installation was very interesting and the kids loved reading about all the planets and finding out their weight on each planet (they have scales next to each exhibit). The car park directly outside of the observatory was full when we arrived at lunch time but we were able to park on the hill leading up & we noticed on the way out that there was additional parking further down the hill though would be about a 15min walk up. The actual building is a beautiful piece of architecture and well worth the visit. Would recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesoley333
40,big hill,"cool building, looks amazing as you walk up to it. I got parking right there with no issues. make sure there is not a concert at the greek at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahuc
40,"Wonderful inside, awful outside","First off, parking is obnoxious. It doesn't matter which day you go, people are crazy on the parking lot. And, sadly, the staff assigned to monitor the lot need better training. We had handicapped people with us on our visit and the attendant claimed all the spaces in the top lot were full. Ok. Not his fault, but we watched five employees/contractors leave, freeing up five handicap spaces and we had to physically send an able bodied family member to show the attendant the five spots because the attendant was busy laughing at a fight over a spot.The city should invest in a shuttle for the park, so people can park off site. This would eliminate the congestion and anger.The observatory itself is fantastic. The shows are reasonably priced and the museum proper is free. We saw a presentation in the theater and were transported. The exhibits, when they're working, are remarkable. We had the privilege of being their on a day when the sun was putting on a lovely.display. it's amazing how some of the oldest, least technological tools create the most profound moments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildertori2
50,Worth It,"You might be deterred by how busy this place seems to be all of the time. We went on a Tuesday afternoon and had to walk almost half a mile to get to the observatory, and that's after circling the parking lots twice. I'm so glad we decided to make the trek! The views are truly incredible (you can see the Hollywood sign!) even if you don't make it all the way to the observatory. But I encourage you to go, even if you have a long walk. Visiting is free, but be aware that the shows have a fee. We watched ""Water is Life"" in the planetarium, and it was beautiful. Totally worth the $7 per person. Be sure to look up when you enter. The ceilings are beautiful in the main entrance. Don't just skim the top floor either. Go to the lower level for more exhibits, including giant models of the planets and a touristy photo op with a backdrop of Griffith Observatory (free). And of course, the views of LA from the outside decks can't be beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444candim
50,Must Do while in LA,"We got there at 730 am on a Saturday and the place was already crowded. We wanted to hike up to the observatory and its an easy hike. We parked across from the Trailside Snack Bar and wallked up the dirt path. We took the West Trail on the way up and found it to be very scenic. At the observatory itself, it is terrific. Please note that you can drive up to the top and just walk from the parking lot to the observatory. It has great 360 degree views of Bevery Hills and LA. I would put this on any to-do list on a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10
50,You gotta check it out!,"I have been here more than once and each time, it gets better. There is so much to see inside the observatory from the displays to the two different shows. There is a cost to see them, which if you haven't had an opportunity to watch either one, you have too. If you only have time or money to see one, I would recommend the Light of the Valyries. The music is fantastic and the light show is breathtaking. The view of Los Angeles is amazing. You can see for miles around if the smog doesn't block the sights. Parking is horrible and be prepared to walk a bit from wherever you park, but the view will distract you from the hike. No cost to go inside the observatory. I'm glad I came to visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nw478
40,Beautiful Place to Visit,There is no better view than the one from the top of this hill. So many exhibits and interesting things to see inside the observatory. The only downside is getting up to it. The traffic and parking...It's a nightmare! Still worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic201147
50,A hidden gem surounded by a megalopolis,"Here you can escape the chaos that is L.A. county. View the exhibits on the grounds of the observatory and walk around while imagining what it took to build it. Bring your camera, bottled water in summer and be patient if you arrive during the busy time. Day or night is a good time to visit. Walking shoes recommended too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603tonyv
50,Well worth the stop,We went early in the morning. We were disappointed in the fact that the observatory didn't open until noon. The views from walking around outside were spectacular. Lots of locals jogging the trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces28572079874
50,Excellent views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"The park surrounding Griffith Observatory is a must-see. Unfortunately due to the observatory being closed when we arrived, we were obviously unable to go inside, but the views make up for it. There are excellent photo opportunities from this prime location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasonakagary
30,Good view of the Hollywood sign,"I wasn't too fussed about coming here but I'm glad I did. The views of the Hollywood sign were fantastic, the best views we got of it the whole time we were there. Nice area and nice to see the observatory, probably really interesting if you're into that kind of thing.Views of LA were incredible too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ejrdn
50,Great place,We really enjoyed the Griffith Observatory. It is interesting for adults and kids all ages. I would recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/985malgorzatad
40,"Love this place, worth the while","The View is spectacular, the Hollywood sign is sure to stand out. As for the inside, it's amazing. There is surprisingly a lot more you can do than you think. There's an enormous moving clock you can watch, exhibits all around, and my personal favorite, the Tesla coil. It is turned on at specific times, so be sure to check it out as the lightning moves around crazy. I will say that some days the traffic is packed to a point where you'd have to walk a long way to get there, but it is most definitely worth the while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/primrosest
50,Great Views,"If you want yo see L.A. then this is a must. However, the queue of traffic can be long. We did it on a tour first, which got us as close as possible, and then I drove the next evening, for night views. The observatory is a magnificent building with some good displays, yet the views from the viewing areas are outstanding. To the one side you have the Hollywood sign, then the other a view of downtown and beyond. Whether daytime or night this is a must do when in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ianrey
40,Great view of LA and Hollywood sign,"My friends and I were lucky enough to drive and park a 5minute walk from the observatory. We visited on a slower day (Sunday) normally you would have to park farther down the hill and walk up. The view of LA was nice from the observatory, but what I really liked was the view of the Hollywood sign. To get to that view you have to take a trial away from the observatory, it didn't take us that long to walk it 15 minutes about. Make sure you bring water on hot days because the sun beats down on you and along the trial there isn't much shade. I think it's worth it for the close view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1853YOsaraha
40,Very cool site,Great to get pictures of Hollywood sign and neat inside as well. Definitely make this a stop if your first time here. You won't regret this quick stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyC259
40,Great view of the city,It was a surprisingly interesting and good attraction. I especially enjoyed the many and varied exhibitions. The great view of the city was worth the trip alone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956AndH
50,Wish I had more time to spend there,The observatory offers great views of the city of Los Angeles and provides a lot of information about the history of astronomy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarwinOK
50,Beautiful view!!!,"This place has an awesome view! You can see all the city from the top and see the Hollywood Sign. There is a planetarium which is very interesting for only $8. Also, you can get there by car, by bike or hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kekeyuri
50,"Beautiful views outside, great science inside","Gorgeous drive up through the hills and through Griffith Park. Expect to park on the road and walk up to the top of the canyon. Once there, you are rewarded with all of LA laid out below, ready for its close up. Look over your shoulder and you have the best view/pic opportunity of the Hollywood sign. The Observatory is free, but the planetarium show is about $7, which is very well worth it. Also, a wonderful, free video by Leonard Nimoy (Spock).We ate a salad and hot dog at the cafe...pretty good, and very fresh.TIP: Arrive early! The first time we tried to visit, we couldn't find parking and crowds were huge. We came back the next day and arrived about 11:35am. The Observatory opens at noon on weekdays. Perfect timing! Easy to park and got inside with no trouble, not too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriP920
50,You must go!!,"We have been visiting the Griffith Observatory for years! Every visit to Los Angeles includes a visit here. There is so much to do and learn. The staff is so knowledgeable and happy to answer all questions. Try to get into the Leonard Nimoy Theatre. It's a great narration about the history of the Griffith. The views of the city are spectacular, day or night. And before I forget, admission and parking are free. There are only minor costs for the planetarium and such. Gift shop has cool things too. Worth the drive into the hills!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrav883
50,Beautiful,"A beautiful building with someone me to excellent and informative displays and exhibits. Stunning views from here of LA and beyond.Observatory opens at midday but parking is limited, arrive early if you wish to avoid a walk up the hill. Make sure you go into the camera obscura to have a look and also to the displays downstairs.A really lovely place to visit suitable for all ages and interests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karstobb
50,Fascinating place,"Great place to visit, shows in the planetarium are brilliant. Only con is that parking is a nightmare, my advice would be to wear comfortable shoes, Park as soon as you see a spot and walk up. Views are worth it once at the top. (If travelling with kids you may want to drop them at the top with another responsible adult and then go Park)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaStych
50,FELL IN LOVE!!!,I thoroughly enjoyed this place! Be sure to wear some comfortable shoes as you may have to walk in case the parking lot is full and you have to park about a 5-10 minute walk down the mountain. It's not a bad walk though. The view from the top of the mountain is breathtaking. You see all of LA.I went during the night time as well. Bring a lite jacket. The night sky and view is also awesome. On the inside you will enjoy the exhibits as well and the Planetarium shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlott414
50,Magnificent!,"This place has one of the best energies in all of LA. The views are spectacular and the observatory is fascinating. I love this place! You can hike the trails, have lunch and visit the observatory all in an afternoon. I like to come here and write. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollywoodgogirl
50,An unforgettable experience,"We were pleasantly surprised to get to see this place for free! Actually, we did spend some extra $ to see a couple of the shows, but those were optional. It is a very popular place, so don't plan to park very close to the exhibit. I really liked the Valkyrie presentation, the speaker was wonderful. This is a great place to bring kids, too, as they looked very interested in the learning aspect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teriberi222
40,Very Informative,This is a nice place to visit especially if you have school age children. They have various exhibits about the solar system and other scientific inventions. The presentation in the planetarium is worth seeing. Since the observatory is situated atop a hill you will experience great views of the city of Los Angeles so it's good to bring a camera or a smartphone for picture taking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fred1021
50,Must see in LA,"I went to Griffith alot as a child, when my Dad and gradparents lived on the West Coast.On my most recent visit I just had to take my own grandkids to Griffith. It was everything I remembered. The view is still amazing and the Observatory is a must see sightseeing in LA. I found it a refreshingbreak. My grandkids had fun in the observatory.The hiing trails are well maintained. I commented a few times about the number of people, but was reminded by my party that there fewer people in the 60's:)I would recommend this as a must see when traveling to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinD1627
40,Beautiful views over Los Angeles,I have been here so many times to bring friends and family to see the stunning views over LA. Never been at night but day views are pretty spectacular and architecture is amazing! The science section and the planet center is worth visiting too. All free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellevlavianos
50,The Views!,We climbed up to the observatory and then hiked around the area for a bit. (although you can drive up and try to park near it as well) Come here if nothing else for the views of the sign. If you can come back at night for the views of the city. We did go into the observatory for a bit and there's a lot of information inside if you're into astronomy and science at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachaelVW
50,This place rocks!,I love it every time. Great place to kill some time before a nice dinner downtown. I have been coming since I was a child and I will never stop returning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C718WZanthonys
40,Must see in Los Angeles,"Its iconic , awesome views, nice area for hikes and totally FREE!!!Nice place for everyone, even for pets ! family activity for day hikes and awesome night LA city view is romantic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2044DDtonym
50,excellent place for famikies,We all enjoyed a day in griffith observatory. The shows were very good and the staff very professional. The best view in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamZ1193UU
40,Worth it for the views,The observatory itself I was not hugely impressed with. The building is very nice but the exhibits could be better to be honest. The view from here are amazing though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darrencru
50,Great for the entire family,The Griffith Observatory is an iconic Los Angels landmark (you've seen it on hundreds of TV shows). It is also a must see for anyone interested in science. The fairly recent remodeling have made it even better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timnr2016
50,Fabulous and unexpected.,We used the 50 cents shuttle available on Saturday and Sunday's. The attraction itself is then free. Great place to see Hollywood sign a and get fabulous views of the city. Spectacular. The. We went inside and found all the free exhibits on show to do with space and the sun. Excellent find and well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaP1985

50,Great views,Great place to visit. The views of LA from up here are amazing. Great place to take pics. Griffith park is a great place to visit. You will also fine the Greek theatre here.

50,AWESOME VIEW,Finally got to take a drive up here and it was amazing!! Unless u wanted to watch the shows in the planetarium it was FREE! They even put out telescopes for free viewing. There's also a free walk and talk sunset tour which was great! Can get crowded and u might have to trek up cause of limited parking. Make sure u spend time and look @ all the displays. Very educational!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannanat26

50,Great Afternoon,"The museum is interesting but the Planetarium shows are a must. The lecturer on our visit spoke in plain language that even a 6 year old was able to grasp. Best to arrive early to assure getting a parking spot or, better, hike up or take the shuttle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacko521
50,Awesome!,"This place is amazing. Highly recommend it. Only downfall is the parking! It's a terrible set up, so get there early so you don't have to walk miles to get to it. Can see Hollywood sign and all the other spectacular views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaP67123
40,A lovely view of LA,Driving up to the hill on a scenic route you will arrive at the observatory. There are more parking spot and if you are lucky or arrive early you can even park at the top one. from here you are able to see more then 300 degree view of the city. If it is a warm and foggy/humid day....it will be hard to see the skyscrapers of downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaperogaArchimede
40,Beautiful Views,"We just moved to the area and trying to get to know the area. I took the family here on a Sunday morning. Although it took a while to get to the top drivivg and find parking and was a bit crowded, it was still a very pleasant day trip. The Observatory was very nice, but the views were absolutely beautiful. We took plenty of pictures with the Hollywood sign in the background. Even my children, ages 20, 12, 9, enjoyed the trip and let us take pictures of them. We packed lunch for the day, but it's nice to know there's a cafe available. The next time we come, we'll try the hiking trail. Overall, it was a good decision to visit and was a beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987tamekaa
50,LA skyline,"Awesome place to look over LA. Although, Finding parking can be a chore. If you go right before dusk, you can get shots of daytime LA skyline and the sunset, which is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6229TZjohns
50,Great Views,This attractions hosts great views of the city as well as an amazing view of the Hollywood sign and picture opportunities for those who don't want to do the hike to the actual sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashkeel
50,Iconic Los Angeles landmark and great for anyone interested in astronomy,"The views of Los Angeles are wonderful (especially at night) but the wide variety of science and astronomy displays are the best reason to visit. Shows in the planetarium are well worth the admission fee, and nighttime visitors can view sky objects such as the moon and planets on clear evenings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandnut2016

50,A Must See,"This is the perfect spot for a view of Los Angeles, the Hollywood HIlls, and basically everything within the 360 degree circle around it. The observatory itself is also amazing and beautifully designed both inside and outside. I would suggest coming here and skipping the unnecessary trek up the hills, seriously!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215erikag
30,Tiring experience,It was a very tiring experience. Parking was difficult to find that everybody had to park down the steep hills and walk for up to a mile up the hill with no walkways. The lines to look through the telescope was huge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliak663
50,Hike Up!,"We like to park on Fern Dell below the Observatory. The hike up is pretty easy, with lovely views of Los Angeles. Once you're at the top, you can visit the Observatory, which has amazing planet exhibits. For lunch, we like to head back down to Fern Dell to the little rustic cafe at the bottom...yum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anneb65

40,Very nice,"Great break from the city, amazing views, check smog alerts before you go so you have a great view of the city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moneypenny21
20,Not at all what was expected.,We were so excited to go here and completely disappointed. We had to drive about 45 min up a mountain with loads of traffic. Only to get up there and have to drive around 10 minutes for a spot. Way over crowded and impossible to enjoy. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have loads of patience and don't mind swarms of people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433michellel
50,Great views of LA,This may be the best place to see all of LA! Parking is free and they let you walk around the observatory and inside for free! Very few places like this exist anymore! And you can leave your car in the parking lot and hike towards the Hollywood sign as well. Definitely a must see for anyone visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyk815
50,Summer Evenings,If your looking for a place to see the lights of the city Los Angeles. Talk a romantic walk along the Observatory or simply sit and admire the views this is the place to be in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieS861
50,Best LA view,The best view of the city at night.... But you have to be patient with the traffic in order to arrive upstairs! It totally worths and dont worry you will find a parking as there is a big rotation of the people - cars etc!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616renae

50,Perfect for Kids and Adults!,"We hadn't been to the Observatory in years. Took Aussie cousins. Parking a hassle, but once you take your seat and look up, you will forget where you are. The featured shows are so interesting, the seats so cushy that you could doze off. But don't! Because you will learn about the night sky, space, stars, all the things that bored you to tears in school but transfix you here! We felt that we were moving, as the scene above changed and transformed. This is a must-do activity in L.A., whether you live here or are visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarreJ
30,Great views!,There are amazing views of Los Angeles from this location and great hiking that originates from this area. But the observatory itself...it just depends if this is your kind of thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3022NRlisag
20,Just too crowded and not enjoyable,Really not worth your time. Really crowded and not maintained. You would do better going to the beach! Try Venice Beach or Malibu or both.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizmo013_13
50,Crowded But An Amazing View!,"I braved the summer tourist season, drove up the hill and drove around in circles for 20 minutes to find parking. This place gets packed early so go early! Despite all the work, I was rewarded with a beautiful view of LA. I would have liked to stay longer as the exhibits were quite interesting but alas I had my 3 year old with me and she doesn't let me stop and read stuff. We saw the star show at 12:30 which allowed children under 5. She was entertained by this show. The person narrating the show was awesome so it was both relaxing and interesting at the same time. We ate lunch in the cafeteria quite late and it was still packed! Good choices but a bit pricy and busy so beware!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DizzneyGrl
50,Great view of LA,I love visiting Griffith. Its location is nothing more that amazing. It has one of the best views of the Los Angeles Basin you can find. It also sits just below the famous Hollywood sign. The observatory is a great tourist attraction and the Science Center is extremely fascinating and innovative. They have a small Café but it's a great idea to bring your own food up and maybe have a picnic somewhere in Griffith Park. Lots of photo opportunities.If you're into hiking there are literally dozens of trails ranging from very easy to extremely demanding. You can definitely get your exercise done. The giant telescope is open on occasion. You can call them for schedules. my favorite part is just looking around the city with a pair of binoculars. So much to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredsplayland

50,Los Angeles day tripping,"Beautiful place, have been living in LA for a few years, but never visited. Took my nephews there. Gorgeous views of Los Angeles on a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracruz04
50,Family Friendly Day Trip,"A really pleasant place to visit in LA, whether you are local or from out of town. Always a good show in the comfortable planetarium, and the features in the rest of the building arel interested and and friendly toward young and old alike. Take a break during your visit and enjoy the views over LA from a well positioned lookout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579richm
50,Wonderful,"If there was any down-side to this was that parking could be difficult. Overcome the parking issue and you can spend an entire day having a lot of enjoyable time. However, in saying that, you will have to spend some money to participate in the different shows offered. Around the grounds you will find things to read and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grayson907
50,"Gravity, Planets and Comet's Tails Oh My!","Do you have teeny eye rollers? Well, I have a few grand kids that used to fit that bill and then something amazing happened. I had to take three of them somewhere for an afternoon...alone...no female help..... something I cannot say I am superbly well equipped to do, but magically settled on Griffith Observatory!Boy, the place was fun, indoors and interesting because you couldn't see the whole set up from the door, and docents actually speak and have interesting things to say. They're not all older adults so there is some relatability for kids. Some of them probably act for a night job, because they knew how to draw my teenies into something as dreaded as science. There is plenty to look at, and a fabulous planetarium show, so take a long look at the website, so that you see everything you might be interested in and plan enough time away from Hollywood Boulevard.Secret? one of my granddaughters actually asked to go BACK!!! 10 attaway-grand-dads for me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3636DQdanielp
40,One of the best views in Los Angeles,"Great view but it takes a few mins to drive up from Hollywood Blvd area. Parking can be a little challenging, I suggest parking on the street if there's a spot available when you get close. There's a nice little cafe there that of course has a great view also but I didn't get a chance to try the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6287LAstevek
50,Don't miss the Griffith Observatory!,The Griffith Observatory is a must for any tourist coming to Los Angeles. Try to get there early for good parking otherwise you will have a long walk. It's absolutely amazing with all of the exhibits. Give yourself plenty of time and if possible catch one of the shows ($). The Observatory is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457EstherK
50,Not to be missed,"Spectacular views. If you're the outdoorsy type park and do some hikes/trails before visiting GO. Don't forget to bring water. The Observatory offers a planetarium, exhibits, public telescopes, cafe, bookstore, and the best views of the Los Angeles basin & Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisatka_11
50,Showing out of town friends great sites,"Both the inside and outside grounds of the Observatory have so much to see. Outside affords you views of downtown, Hollywood, and the Hollywood Sign. It also had astronomy info on the grounds. Inside is a whole new world. The museum is free, but I recommend seeing a presentation/show (not free). There is so much to see and learn about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbranchaud4
50,OUTSTANDING VIEWS,"Beautiful views of LA area and wonderful displays! Very informative displays, films and programs. We attended the presentation in the Leonard Nimoy theater by a very entertaining pair of wacky professors. Very well done lecture/demonstration on how to make a comet... Beautiful gift shop. A lot of the observatory was free, but the $7 admission for going into the other lectures, etc. was money well spent. The planetarium show was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hugonaples
40,You can learn a lot of astronomy,"Griffith Observatory is located in a great area with amazing view. I enjoyed seeing from there the HOLLYWOOD SIGN. Inside I watched in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium the show "" centered in the universe"". Very impressive . In the building you have telescopes and other astronomy exhibits and you can learn many things about astronomy. A visit there is very interesting for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aikaterini2013
50,"""Great causual date night""","The Griffith Observatory, can be a great date night... just make sure to bring your comfortable walking shoes just in case you have to park far from the Observatory.During the summer nights, it gets packed and you can view the moon/skies (sometimes full or not), but the line moves fast to view the moon/skies and it is FREE the Observatory - good idea to check if they will have the telescope open to the public if you want to see the moon/skies?Inside the Observatory they have many different stations to see exhibits and pictures of the Moon, a giant pendulum that swings at the center of the floor and a great show of different titles (the Universe - I saw this one and it was good or the Water show or the lights?) were you have to pay to see - different times and they can last up to an hour and you are sitting down for this event (major credit cards- Visa, M/C or Discovery or cash to get in and see these shows).They have a café and a small gift shop with limited chairs/tables. It can become a romantic experience late at night outside looking down at the city lights with that special person! The attractions do close at 10pm and it does get dark outside quickly at the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgonez
50,Amazing view!,"The place is amazing. The view is wonderful. There is a lot to see inside the observatory. For public transportation, I recommend using the LADOT shuttle. It's only 50 cents and accepts TAP card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardopgodoy
30,Better Than Expected,"Yes, we did all of the touristy things while in California, and this was one of those. The GF is a huge movie buff, and since this has been in the movies, we had to come and see it.There was a lot more to this than I expected honestly. They had a number of different activities for kids, and plenty for adults if you like to read and are interested in this sort of thing. It took us a couple of hours to get through it.Kind of out of the way to the north, but still worth doing at least once to know what is inside that icon of so many movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
40,Breathtaking Views,"Great views to be had here. The observatory had some non-functional displays, but the visit was worthwhile. Very popular spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enigmaman95
40,Views,"Well, or you love to see the planets and the moon or there is no much interesting thing to see inside. However, the view to LA is one of the best I got during the time I was there. Regarding the Hollywood sign, try another location as this one is really far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvcardoso
50,Good Place to View Hollywood Sign,"Located on the slope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park, the Observatory is one of the icons of L. A. It is also a good place to view the famous hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanq442
40,See the sign!,"It's an easy ride from Hollywood (type Hollywood sign"" into Google driving).We didn't go in but it's a hot spot to get a bird's eye view of Hollywood and the sign.Parking is limited in the lot but you can park on the mountain road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GAkimberlyPEACH
50,Great view,Love the view of Los Angeles. Very busy and had to park aways from the observatory and walk up. It was beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveHawaii13
50,Great Stop,Stopped here on a day tour of LA; wish we had more time to spend as they have a lot of displays and information. Very nice views (great view of the Hollywood Sign) and pleasant to walk around the area. Would recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fan_of_travel_101
30,Beautiful views,"Just walked around at this location. Lots of people everywhere. Great views and picture opportunities from here. Didn't take an official tour, so I can't comment on that part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josht860
50,Quintessential Los Angeles,"Nothing says LA more than the Griffith Observatory. The observatory itself is very interesting, filled with exhibits about science and space. The movies within the observatory are fascinating and not to be missed. Outside the Observatory walls there are the iconic views that we've all seen in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and dozens of other movies. I believe many trails are closed for a couple of more months, but there are lovely hikes in the mountains surrounding the observatory - you can even get to the Hollywood sign. Flea (from Red Hot Chili Peppers) is one of many famous people who regularly run some of the trails. What says LA more than exercising with the stars? And after that, go back to the observatory itself and gaze upon the real stars. Not to be missed and never gets old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5162DFkimberlyb
40,Nice Views; very crowded!,"Offers wonderful views of L.A. and the Hollywood sign.We went on a weekday, around 5:30. It was packed. Had to park at least a mile and a half down the road; and it's a very long, steep climb to the observatory. It was worth the views, but be prepared! I would never go on a weekend.We went mainly to see the Zeiss and coelostat telescopes. The Zeiss telescope is nostalgic, but so old that it's outdated. The line for the Zeiss is horribly long. On a weeknight, we stood in line for 40 minutes. Out on the lawn, you can stand in line for the smaller telescopes for about 15 to 20 minutes and you can see the planets (Mars, Saturn and Jupiter, when we visited) just as well, if not better. Also, the Zeiss is only focused on one item; each of the lawn telescopes are set on various planets, so you can see a nice variety in a much shorter time than if you stood in line to see one planet on the Zeiss. Also, the Griffith is now surrounded by city lights, so it's difficult to see much of the night sky. That was disappointing.I was very disappointed about the coelostat telescope, also. One of the main reasons I chose Griffith over other observatories is because they are the only one that lists a telescope to view the sun. I apparently misinterpreted the description of that to mean that the public could view through it. I even called before I went to ask if the sun telescope was operating for public viewing and how late it was open. They assured me it was operational and open until 8 p.m. When we got there, we found out that the public is not allowed to view through it - there is a remote monitor set on an area of the sun for the public to view. I was told when I called that it would remain open until 8 p.m., but they decided - for no apparent reason - to shut it down at 7:15! Glad we got there in time. Not fair to anyone else who might have been told it was open until 8 p.m.If you want to see planets, check out the lawn telescopes at Griffith. Or better yet, go to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. Not nearly as crowded and it's much darker area to see more stars and night sky for a minimal charge. They also have lawn telescopes to view a variety of subjects - we even got to see many nebulae, as well as the planets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisared15
50,An amazing view of LA and great place to learn more about Astronomy,"We went on a Friday evening and although it was incredibly crowded, we managed to find a space along the road to park. The walk up the hill to the Observatory was very nice and we enjoyed the views. Once there, they had telescopes set up for people to view the moon (as the sun had not gone down yet) and the observatory was open to the public. There were lots of interesting exhibits inside to tell the history of Astronomy and a little bit about how telescopes work. This was great for families, couples or curious individuals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gh427
40,Great views of the city,The admission to the observatory is free. The exhibitions are very informative and the views are great! You could use the telescopes to zoom in on the city or the Hollywood sign. If you got the time to visit the observatory I would recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_1985_02
40,Wonderful View,Very Interesting inside with so much to see and wonderful view from outside. A long way to walk from car parking area if not on a coach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debrakdesigns
30,Go Early or Be Ready to Hike,"We went to Griffith Observatory (free) while trying to get to the Hollywood Sign (which we never got to). We went on a Saturday, and there was so much traffic that we almost left. If you see cars parked on the street, get ready to park there because there probably isn't parking at the top. We parked on the street and had to hike up the hill...not a bad hike if you're wearing the right shoes. The observatory was ok. There were movies and attractions to pay for, but we just looked around. You can get great shots of the Hollywood sign, but it is far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLP211
20,Couldn't get anywhere near it,"I read about Griffith Park and its views and I really wanted to check it out. Unfortunately, the twisty road leading up to the views was cluttered with traffic, parked cars and pedestrians. The only thing I could do was briefly look at the views at the top as I quickly began my descent back down the hill all while trying to avoid oncoming traffic and oblivious tourists walking in the road.My brief view was restricted by the haziness. I would research the time of day that the haze doesn't affect the view and go at that time to take advantage of the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDavis227
40,"Cool to see, but packed!","We went to this observatory because of the reviews. It didn't disappoint. There were some really cool views of Los Angeles as well as the Hollywood sign. Inside the observatory, there are plenty of exhibits / information about astronomy. They even seem to have programs available at night. This is a great FREE experience. The only downfall is that if you go later in the day, it WILL be packed with tourists. We parked going down the hill of the observatory and hiked up there. It was about a 15 minute hike, and it was worth it to see the views, but there were just so many people there...finding parking will be difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4NHTraveler
50,Excellent view of LA,The observatory gives you a full panoramic view of LA. It also has a very interesting museum enclosed in it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellH796
50,Fun at Griffith Observatory,Wonderful view and excellent display. Take time to spend a day and have a picnic in the park. August brings lots of tourist so parking may be a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802teachert
50,Wonderful views of LA - great for a short hike/run,"Went for a run up from Griffin Park. It's definitely worth and rewarding when you get up there as the view on LA is fantastic - obviously also if you don't run but just walk :). Suggest also to do the extra mile (or about that...) and go up to the Hollywood Peak, maybe another 20 min. run from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larry121
40,Great views of LA and the Hollywood sign,"We went during the day on a weekend, which isn't the best time to go, but it was the only time we had free. We parked about a quarter mile short of the tunnel and walked the rest of the way, which wasn't as bad as we thought it might be (about 3/4 mile uphill, but not steep). The view was fabulous, but this place would really shine more at night. Next time we'll come during an evening when we can enjoy more of the views and hopefully get a peek in the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLBogert
50,Must visit,"This is a must visit if in Los Angeles. I'm not big into astronomy, to be honest it confuses me, however the staff here are fantastic and even had me interested after a few minutes. The view from here is stunning on a clear day, All the way over downtown, Hollywood and with one of the best views of the Hollywood sign the observatory is dominant on the hills. To reach here you go via Griffiths park, through the Back to the Future tunnel and past the original bat cave. It's not until you eventually find a parking space that you realise how many movies have used this as a backdrop. Brilliant mornings exercise, well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neiltravels2019
40,Beautiful view at sunset,"Go there It is beautiful, there are many people, so the parking can take some time, but it is totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anonym92
30,"Closed, but very worthy views","The observatory was closed on the day we visited, but we made do by observing (!) instead the views over Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. The observatory building is a beautiful piece of architecture, and there were even hummingbirds buzzling around some nectar plants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972jennym
30,Not great at night,We decided to go last minute (before it closed) because we thought it would be quiet that time of day. It was crazy packed- my bf wanted to look out the telescope but by the time we drove from sunset Blvd to the top it took over 30 mins and we didn't get to see it. Very pretty views of the city though. We came back the next morning to hike and it was fabulous and hot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5668PYashleyw
40,Hollywood,Called here after visiting the Dodgers stadium as it was not too far away. It was midweek about 6:30 .. Did not expect the crowds of people or the volume of heavy traffic. The specified parking areas were all full so we were shown by police officers to park on the mountain side. The roads were quite narrow however we felt safe walking up towards the observatory.It was a pleasant night with good views of the Hollywood sign. There was a nice coffee shop and rest room facilities too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneC564
50,Beautiful views of the city and Hollywood sign,We parked at the Observatory to begin our hike up in the Griffith trails to the Hollywood sign. We didn't originally know about the Observatory but so happy we stumbled upon it. They have fun little classes for kids and the views are amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb515
50,Amazing view,Always wanted to come here. This place has lots of hiking trails. Amazing view of the city. There are bathrooms. I suggest going early as parking is somewhat limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chassidyl2014
40,Nice day trip - expect lots of people though,"We wanted to visit the Griffith Observatory on our trip to LA. We knew that it was near the Hollywood sign so we were hoping to just make 1 trip to see both landmarks. Upon arrival, you will have to park your car somewhere along the route to the observatory. We went early afternoon so we were able to park somewhat closer and the walk wasn't that bad. You can see the Hollywood sign once you get to the top and start walking toward the observatory (the sign should be on your right)We wanted to checked out the trails but the day was just too hot and we didn't think we had enough water with us so we just stay in the observatory. Alot of cool facts, artifacts and displays throughout the observatory. If you are interested in astronomy, history of the universe, natural occurrences etc this is the place to be. We didn't stay that long cuz it was very crowded. I enjoyed checking it out though but not sure I would return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahsyl
50,Excellent Evening Excursion!,"I've been to the Griffith Observatory several times over the years and it has never failed to be a ture enjoyment. Be aware and plan to walk, because parking is extremely limited and you may need to park along the road up to the Observatory and then walk up hill to get there. We attended the last show ""Centered in the Universe"" of the evening at the planetarium and it was fantastic. The narrator was amazing and it was a treat. Additionally, many of the exhibits are fascinating too, including the Tesla Coil and the Foucault pendulum. Plan in advance if you want tickets to the planetarium, but the exhibits, including a solar telescope and the Zeiss refracting telescope are free. Definitely a treat at sunset and would be at sunrise too. A great place to visit if you've got an interest in Astronomy, Astrophysics, or anything space!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyL755
50,Information overload,"This place is fantastic and I came out with my head buzzing.I have never taken much interest in anything scientific but wish i had now, as I leatned so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieCass
50,Sunset,"I walk from the hotel To the observatory. In the beginning it was pleasant but as the road arise, it was becoming very tiring.The vistas are superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranciscoFR
50,"Excellent, free attraction for all ages.","It's free, it's crowded but worth every moment. Astronomy at its best. The observatory is most informative and entertaining. The views are breathtaking. Parking is horrendous but spots can be found if you're patient. Otherwise, you can park and hike up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynn_FL
40,A good plaxe to vixit,"Opened in 1935, the Griffith Observatory has become the most visited public observatory in the world. It offers public telscopes, astronomy exhibits and a planetarium theater. One can compare the planets by using the telecopes and learn why Pluto is no longer one of them. It is definitely worthwhile to take a visit to the observatory. (Both admission and parking are free)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephen_Ng2014
30,"Beautiful place, parking attendants rude and unorganized","The views from Griffith observatory are absolutely stunning. The exhibits and information they have inside are extremely informative. You are better off going when they open as the parking attendants are not very pleasant and refuse to let you up to the top to park even when the lot is half empty! Poor communication between the employees ! Try not to get scammed into taking the bus to the top because it is extremely crowded, doesn't come as frequently as they claim AND they charge you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarapD8702XG
10,They need to close this to cars,"Maybe sometime I'll actually see the observatory. I tried several years ago, and it was closed for extensive repairs. On this trip my plan was to take the shuttle to the observatory from Vermont & Sunset station.We first ended up waiting forty-five minutes before a shuttle even showed up. I repeatedly checked the phone app, and the GPS showed the buses near the observatory and barely moving. When we did board a very crowded bus we found out why it had taken so long. The entire park road was backed up in both directions for miles with bumper-to-bumper traffic. All the parking lots were full, so people were parking along the road and walking--with the walkers going quite a bit faster than traffic. It was utter chaos! It took us 40 minutes (on top of the 45 we'd waited for the bus) to get to the top of the hill--a distance Google Maps says should take 10 minutes to drive. When we got there, the driver informed us that the last bus would be leaving in less than half an hour, so we just stayed on the bus we were on and went back down--another half hour's ride. We never did see the observatory, just an extremely crowded bus and lots of car traffic.They need to do something like at the Getty and just ban cars from here. They could offer frequent more frequent shuttles and eliminate the traffic all together. Until they do, it will be more of a chore than an attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmbia
40,Great views,Visited on a hot and busy day so parking was tight but we enjoyed our visit and views were great. Make sure to bring some water with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasportsmom
50,Worth The Hike,"As always, loved our visit to Griffith Observatory. We parked near the bottom, not too far from the Trails End Cafe. Made the mile plus hike up to the Observatory, spent some time viewing some of the exhibits inside and admiring the great views outside, hiked back down to The Cafe. Enjoyed a nice lunch which ended with one of their fabulous lavender cookies. On our next visit, we plan to take in one of the evening shows at the Observatory, complete with LA sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IraSez
50,Take the time to read and explore exhibits,"I have two teenagers and this was the perfect time to reinforce to them some concepts they have learned at school about time zones, day and night, seasons, solar and lunar activity, high and low tide. They were very interested because it was visual. I personally loved the sundial. We visited in late morning, explores for a couple hours, left to do other activities in the area, then returned later to view the night sky with the observatory telescope. Well worth the drive and walk from parking.Regarding parking, there is a main parking lot, but unless you get there early or whenever the traffic guards are there, you cannot use it because it is full. We and so many others had to parallel park on down the mountain road and walk about a mile to get to the observatory. But it was good exercise and still worth it. Just wear sunscreen. You could probably drop off family at the corner and the driver go park and walk, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96timothyt
40,Great little hike with terrific views,We hiked up to the top for beautiful views of the city. Hike is straight up for about one mile. We did not go through the observatory due to long lines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoTraveler042
30,"It's a hike, but the view is worth it.","You want to get here early, as the parking lot fills up by 9 am. From the observatory, you can hike up the trails to the top of Mt.Hollywood. From here, after the morning fog burns off, you can see a side view of the Hollywood sign. If you're a serious hiker, you can hike 4miles to the top of the Hollywood sign, or climb some of the ridges to get a better view of the sign. The observatory is rather unique, being located close to downtown LA. There is a lot off hinges to see for the kids, history and technology of astronomy.This place is worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plucky017
50,Very interesting!,"Wish we had more time here, it is very interesting and a great place to take kids. They do experiments geared toward kids and they all seem to be having fun. If your in the LA area be sure and go see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883nickih
40,Worth the Hike!,"Visited with family. We were there on Saturday in the late afternoon, which apparently is the peak time for visitors. We lucked out to get a parking space on the side of the road. (The parking lot was full.) We then walked up the hill about a mile, but it was worth the effort. The view was spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTraveler052
40,Excellent views of the city,The observatory is an attraction well worth the visiting when in Los Angeles. The facility is well maintain and provides a lot of astronomical information. The views of the city and the Hollywood sign are breathtaking. Only problem is the horrendous lack of parking space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecestafe
40,Good outdoor activity,"A good free attraction, especially combined with a hike up to it from the base of Griffith Park. A little less than a mile each way on nice wide paths that provide nice scenic views on the way up. Observatory was crowded, but not overwhelming. Beautiful views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520hbl
40,Popular for Sunsets,"Although this is almost in every shot of LA on TV, we did not mean to go here. We put Hollywood Sign observation into our phones and it led us here. It took a very long time to get to the top and people were parking all along the road and just walking up because the traffic was so bad. Clearly, this is a great place to take in the sunset over LA. Although you can see the Hollywood sign from here, it barely showed up in our pictures. Still, a nice view was to be had. If you have time, take it to walk around the observatory. My kids loved exploring space from the different exhibits inside and there were even telescopes set up outside for you to look through. A great, free attraction in the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globettotter

50,Amazing!,Beautiful views of downtown LA and an amazing drive through the hills to get to the observatory. The observatory itself is an impressive piece of architecture and definitely worth visiting when in LA.

40,Always a great place to see on a clear day,"Griffith park observatory is a nice place to go for first time visitors to LA. The view is incredible.

50,Amazing place!,"Griffith Observatory is in the City of Los Angeles. Dozens of exhibits inside and outside the building enable visitors to become observers. There, in the Observatory you can see the astronomical image of the Earth. Exhibits include the largest in the world (The Big Picture), rare and fascinating meteorites (Pieces of the Sky), stars and planets. Griffith Observatory isSouthern California’s gateway to the cosmos! Visitors can look through telescopes, explore exhibits, see live shows in the Samuel Oschin Planetarium, and enjoy spectacular views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign.Admission to the Observatory building, grounds, telescopes, and parking is always FREE! Those wishing to visit Griffith Observatory may drive up to the Observatory and park in the parking lot or on the adjacent roads.If you want to see shows, you have to buy tickets for each show, it is sold until 10 minutes before the listed start time of show. Once you have purchased planetarium tickets, there will be NO refunds (unless the show is canceled). You must be in line for your show at least 15 to 20 minutes before the show time printed on your ticket. There will be building announcements as a reminder, but you are ultimately responsible for being on time. There will be absolutely no late admission to the theater. Once the doors have closed, the show is underway and must not be interrupted. If you must leave the theater during the show, you cannot be readmitted.The shows are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sueli22
50,Great views of the city,We didn't catch any shows in the planetarium as our kids wanted to get going elsewhere. They did learn some neat facts n the museum and saw the telescope. There are some neat hands on displays too.Our family hiked up a trail to the observatory--the trails need to be marked better--or just marked. We took a few wrong turns I think before getting to the observatory. Bring lots of water for your hike. It can be long and hard. Slippery in spots too--so keep on your good walking shoes and forgo those flip flops.There is a cafe up top and a vendor selling ice cream and chips.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mama2potter
50,Go early to beat the rush,Oh my goodness! The amount of cars is ridiculous! We had to park about a mile from the entrance and walk in 80+* which was hard work as all up hill. Once there the views were breath taking and the show in the Observatory was brilliant. Get there early or expect long queues. There are two exits but most choose to exit the same way they drove in causing mayhem where the road down the hill takes you out far easier. One way in and out would be so easy to sort and prevent the idle cars and pollution.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lemonpips11
40,Great View,"We went to the observatory and walked around, but the actual observatory was closed when we were there. However, the view from the veranda was amazing. You could see the Hollywood sign, downtown LA, Hollywood, everything. We also went on the hiking trails near the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roselothbrok11
50,Worth the Drive,"A trip to the Griffith is truly worth the drive. Whether you see a star show, just check out the exhibits or simply enjoy the view of the city and the world famous ""Hollywood"" sign, the Griffith Observatory is a must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funnytraveler1
40,Parking Nightmare but Worth the View,A concert was going on at the Greek Theater on the same road that approaches the observatory. This made parking a nightmare but the views on the observatory of the Hollywood Sign and Downtown are well worth the wait. It is free which is always nice and if we had more time we would have gone for a hike in the nearby mountains. Go into the building for some great science information about astronomy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kswany
50,Great Views,Loved seeing the great views from above. Taking lots of pictures and seeing all the areas of the park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcinej2018
50,Amazing!! Must see!!,"This is a nice place, before enter into the museum, take some pictures of the Big sign ""Hollywood"". I enjoyed everything inside except it was too crowded. I especially like the little rock from moon. BTW, parking is a problem too. We needed to park from the bottom of the museum and walked up there. It was about 15-30 minutes walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hans0927
40,Unforgettable view,Went just for the view. Place is pretty popular and there are limited parking on the property so you probably have to park on side of the road and walk for the rest of the path. It is totally worth it when you see the LA lights by night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yenisshoes
50,Amazing place to stargaze!,Took the kids here for some star gazing. I highly recommend if you get the chance to come check out the observatory. Especially if you can go there during a meteor shower.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BryanW387
10,WARNING!!! DO NOT GO ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON!,"This is more of an informational warning, rather than a review of the attraction.I had a friend in from out of town. She very much wanted to go to this, despite my warning that it could be pretty packed. Holy cow was it way worse than I even thought it could be!We could not even get to the Observatory there was so much traffic! Nowhere to park unless you walked quite a ways and parked on the side of the narrow road. Was quite the zoo of a crowd. I couldn't help but think of the families that would be so disappointed.If you go on a weekend you should be prepared to be very patient and walk a hike up the hill to the place. Might be tough for a family with younger children to do.I've been there in the past and you have to really plan it out because of the showing times available in the attraction. You may not get in or have to wait a while. It is pretty cool once you do get in though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinet115
50,Great park!,Enjoyed this visit here immensely! Seeing the views and the Hollywood sign was very cool! Got some nice pictures of the city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suemU5626ZP
20,Never even got there - chaotic traffic situation,"We tried to get to the observatory twice by car, once right before sunset and then again the following day before noon, but the traffic and parking was so chaoticon both occasions that we couldn't even get up to the observatory without walking for miles. If this place is that popular, they should do what other popular parks with limited traffic capacity does, close the whole thing for private cars and offer an extensive shuttle service. Would have loved to come here, but had no idea that traffic was going to be so chaotic, wish I could have known and had time to plan different transportation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElinJanitz
40,"Basic, good museum, good views.","Museum is great for kids and scientifically uneducated. Views are outstanding, sorry I didn't get back at night. Parking was challenging, cars lined the roads on the way up and the lot was full. Best strategy for the Observatory itself was to watch for someone leaving and nail their spot. It didn't take long to score a good position. The park is large, so if you have time a little nature walk is called for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rigel54
40,Interesting place,"I thought this is just a hill that would allow you to get a better view of ""HOLLYWOOD""HILL. It turned out differently.When I walked in, it felt like I have travelled through the space. It actually is a science museum.Fascinating place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellene_santos
50,"Interesting content inside, beautiful views outside",Catch it at sunset. WOW. The views are just spectacular. So much to look at inside too--whether you're young or old!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krimsey
50,Breathtaking views of LA,"Parking is at the bottom of the hill, but transportation is provided at a cost of $1.50 each, each way. It's well worth a visit for the view of LA alone. Great information provided on the observatories history and usage and you can go inside one of the telescope rooms. Dining is available on site and is kept beautifully clean and tidy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheilaM70
30,Free admission and good views of LA,"There's a decent view of the Hollywood sign, and some reasonably interesting astronomical displays, but it's extremely busy, nor is it evidently worth the hike or drive up the top of the hill. Good views of LA nevertheless, and there is no admission charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8643LNmatthews
50,Great and free,"Been there many times in the daytimes, and every year I have to visit it again and again, because the view is so nice and fantastic! Especially at night, it takes a long time to come to the hill and down again, but you'll loose some calories and it is so cosy and wonderful :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristnekevin
50,"Historical, Scientific fun for all!",I love to park off of Fern Dell near Trails Cafe and take the 15-20min. hike up to the Observatory. If you do drive up - be prepared for crazy traffic - lots of congestion parking especially during the summer - full of tourists. Great for families - we will usually spend an hour looking at the exhibits and then buying an over-priced popsicle before heading back down the hill!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yaelles2014
50,Worth the drive to see it,"This is one of the best places in LA for sightseeing, as it sits high at the top of a mountain with excellent views of LA and the Hollywood sign. Plenty of things to do there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RudyO804
20,Never got near it,Probably an unfair review but we tried to visit on a Sunday afternoon in July and never got near the place. They seemed to be setting up for an event at the theatre and had put up loads of no parking signs at the spaces there so there were multiple tow trucks removing cars that were parked there. This was causing chaos as traffic was trying to get around them. Eventually crawled to top to find car park full and cars everywhere near by it very busy and chaotic. Views looked good but we could get near the place so gave up. Don't know if we timed it badly but not sure that I want to risk that again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3027MYgaryc
50,Loved the Information,Being able to walk through the Griffith Observatory was phenomenal and well worth the almost 1 1-2 hour trek up the hill to the top and 2 rounds around the parking area to be able to experience this place! Perfect place to take pictures of the scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
40,"Great view, really crowded on weekends","The place is packed on a nice sunny day. You can get there with a shuttle from Vermont and Sunset for .50. Really beautiful view from all sides, and somewhat interesting museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GypsyTraveller94
50,Griffith Observatory,"The observatory and the free attractions inside are great, engaging and informative. The Observatory offers great views over LA with a few good vantage points. It can get very busy so be prepared to deal with crowds and potentially a bit of a walk up the final section of road (due to traffic jams). Overall definately recommend you check this out whilst in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martyd240
50,what a view,"Such a slice of Los Angeles history and current life! Hikers, bikers, dog walkers, tourists all heading up to the Observatory and the best view. Off to the right? The HOllywood Sign! Don't miss this site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnygirlSanDiego
50,Nice Vantage Point,"The location is good to view the ""Hollywood"" Sign from a distance. The park is beautiful and worth a visit. There are a lot of tracks you can do around the park. If you decide to visit, either go there early to beat the crowd. It is also a nice place to view the sunset over LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aworldtraveller2016
50,Great view!,"If you want to see the Hollywood sign and the whole of LA, this is the place. INCREDIBLY packed with visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290vickyd
50,see all Los Angeles .,"clean and safe ,you can see all los angeles and make same photos for all your life memories , i loved this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntonisA888
50,"Best time to visit is in the fall, winter or spring, but NOT in summer!","in 1985, after my studies of management and engineering at a German Technical University, I travelled to NY City to make a broker training for stocks, options, commodities and financial futures.I lived half a year in a hotel near to Central Park in NY City, and after my exam as a broker, I enjoyed to travel all over the US. I especially enjoyed California. I visited Californai several times in all seasons - fall, winter, spring.I strongly recommend you NOT to visit California in summer, it is terribly hot and humid at the coast.I visited this observatory several times. You definitely need more than one visit, there is so much to see.And, maybe you have the luck to meet an interesting person and make friendship?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HamburgAlsterFan
50,"Awesome place, but fog covered the Hollywood sign",The views from the observatory are amazing. It's hit or miss with getting a clear picture of the Hollywood sign. Also the day we went the telescope wasn't available until after 7 p.m.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3626TFmariac
40,Must see in LA,"It was on the top of our list , however it was extremely crowded and impossible to find a place to park , the view is nice and the show is good if you can adapt the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrArafat
40,Great views and interesting experiences,"The observatory is one of the best places to view the Hollywood sign, and it also has fantasic panoramic views of Los Angeles and to the coast.We were there when they had one of their monthly ""star parties"", where loads of amateurs come up with their own large telescopes and allow you to have a look at something of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenr613
50,Excellent community facility,Venue provides an excellent place to view and take pictures of the Hollywood sign but also provides an interesting and educational venue to learn about space and the solar system. The scales showing an individuals comparitive weight were a great way to highlight the differences in gravity and the displays were interesting and informative without being overly technical.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJG1972
50,Take the time to go inside,"This place is beautiful. The sunsets are stunning. The inside museum has something for all ages. Be patient with the traffic, it is a unique experience worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610katherined
50,Part of LA RastaBus tour,Great views of LA and Hollywood sign. Just above the Griffith Park fabulous place to hike and bike. One of the FREE places to visit while in LA. Great tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyG912
40,Well worth the visit,"Visited Saturday at about 7pm, it was mobbed! The queue of traffic was right down hill, eventually parked at side of street and walk part way up! The views are amazing and the observatory was really interesting but unfortunately the telescope wasn't open due to a fire nearby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turner022
50,Way too popular. Way too beautiful.,"This is LA's central park. Not exactly central, but acres and acres of beautiful grounds up in the Hollywood hills. Sadly, EVERYONE loves it so parking can be a pain.. suggest you uber/lyft to it instead. Interesting free exhibits in the observatory; sadly we missed the last planetarium show... next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgC2012
50,great views,"finally managed to visit after my 4th LA trip and glad I didused the shuttle bus ( 50cents ) and was a quick drive upto the observatory , I went on the weekend and it wasn't overly busy on my early afternoon visit , plenty to see & do and the restaurant was very nice as wellamazing views of LA can be seen",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisThom666
50,Beautiful Place with Fascinating Experiences,The views were spectacular into the evening. The planetarium is a must with wonderful narration and a relaxing journey through space. Go out dusk You'll love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreakDash
30,Great view but limited parking,"We went up on a Friday afternoon and it was unbelievably busy, we were lucky to get a parking space but once you do get one you get a great view of the city of Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign and the area all around, although we didn't go into the observatory its worth going up to just for the sights of the city. Make sure you pick a clear day with minimal smog as we had difficulty seeing downtown through the fog. Be prepared for it being busy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeleV5435ZI
50,What views!!,Enjoyed the walk up from the base and it was well worth the walk. This landmark was one that we've not visited on previous trips so I wanted to see it and wasn't disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beauchicken
20,couldn't park,"absolutely no parking available on the day we tried, drove around for an hour trying. Would not recommend a Saturday visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297mh
50,Fun for everyone,"Fun for the whole family, very interesting educational experience and you get a beautiful look of LA. Admission is free which is always great, there are extra shows however that do cost money but they are well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dstreeton
50,Brilliant but busy,Had been wanting to go to Griffith for years and so glad we did. The building is awesome and so are the views.We went there at about 6pm on a weekday and access and parking was easy but when we left at about 8pm the traffic heading up there was backed up for miles.Thoroughly enjoyable and will return one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romford
40,Scout outings,We went with a troup of Scouts and had a lot of fun. It was so much interesting information that one trip isn't enough to consume all the knowledge. Awesome. Thanks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaiderRonH
50,Really good place to visit,"The views of L.A are amazing and worth visiting just to have a look, the whole place is very interesting and a good place to sit with a drink and watch the world go by...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay8991
50,Hollywood Must see,"All we could say was WOW! As we were walking thru the parking lot, I noticed a man parking a 1968 Camaro near the front door. I assumed that he worked there. So I asked him. He said, ""as a matter of fact I do"". He was the curator for the last 40 yrs. What an awesome opportunity we had to speak with him. He was very friendly and entirely knowledgeable. Of course I wanted to see and hear everything about James Dean and the Rebel without a cause movie. And the view of LA was incredible. A must stop when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timv0960
30,Parking is a nightmare !!!,Whilst the views are spectacular the parking is minimal so you really need to time your visit well !!!! Mostly you will drive around a lot then give up and leave or be prepared to do some serious walking. Little can be done to realize it I guess so just be warned.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatW338
50,Best free attraction,"After a round of business meetings I had some free time and decided to look for free attractions in the vibrant LA.It took me a while to choose, but most definately Griffith Observatory was a great choice.The complex is amazing, very clean, and most important interesting and educative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/browniedonald
40,Out 1st visit to Griffith Observatory.,"Although it was closed because Monday, my son-17yo- and my daughter-9yo- loved this place. They loved the scenic views from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldenb408
40,Great view,"It is not a lonesome walk from the park to the observatory. However it is much better than driving on busy days. The path is dusty and quite steep,so wear durable shoesThere are several other longer paths but we just took the 1 mile path to the observatory. I would recommend checking the map before planning your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acahillmd
50,Great views,After reading other reviews we decided this was the best and easiest place to see the Hollywood sign. Parking is a little tricky to find but just drive towards the top and you will find someone leaving. It has great views of the sign and city. Worth the drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjZ163PR
50,Free and educational!,"This place was amazing! On Wednesdays they are open from noon-10 p.m and it's free! The building is beautiful with amazing views of the Hollywood hills, downtown L.A, and the Hollywood sign. It has great exhibits about telescopes, stars, and the planets. You can also pay for extras (shows and planetarium). I found it very interesting, I'm a teacher from Nashville and I wish we had a free resource like this for our students! I highly suggest if you are in the area to go visit, it's very cool and serves as a trail head for hiking on Mt. Hollywood and Mt. Lee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleytM993WU
50,"Beautiful views, marvelous shows","As I live in the vicinity, I've visited on several occasions throughout the years. I absolutely love the vantage point of the observatory, the exhibits, and the laser music shows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
40,BEAUTIFUL,"Views from the grounds of this venue are amazing, including a view of the ""Hollywood"" sign. Was very crowded on the day we visited. Had to park at street level and walk up the mountain-side. Good workout, but could be a difficult climb for some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angievaughn
50,Stunning Night View,"With a few hours left in my stay, my friend and I decided to visit the Griffith Observatory at night, right before closing. The view from up here is spectacular. I could sit here and think all day. It's such a serene place. Come to find out, one of my best friend's great grandfather's helped build this observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayEmBey
50,"More stars than Hollwood, incredible views!","Despite parking that is sometimes tough, this is a place to visit. Enjoy the route up through a beautiful canyon. Monuments here include on obelisk to astronomers and to one of my fave films, ""Rebel Without A Cause"". Can't you just see ""the kids"" here? The interiors and exteriors here are deliciously Art Deco, and cool on a warm day. Great spots for photos with the Hollywood sign, the downtown skyline, the hills. Bring a picnic! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKharleyrider
40,"Entertaining, in a fantastic location",The Griffith Observatory was entertaining and informative. The best part of the Observatory is the Samuel Oschin Planetarium which is not to be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73natashaa
50,Amazing!!,"Best free attraction in Los Angeles. amazing at night. Parking can be a nightmare, but get there early and enjoy it. Watched a $7 show and it was so worth it! Loved my night here. Recommend it to everyone visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IlanaG18
40,Good!,"I was great to visit the Griffith Observatory to see the space educational things. I wanted to see it after James Dean ""Rebel without a cause"" and there is a creepy James Dean memorial statue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeadey72
50,Go for the view! Stay for the movies!,"When people ask me for ideas of places to check out when they come to LA, I always recommend a stop by the Observatory. The grounds, the exhibits and the view are all worth it. But, one of the most fun things to do is to catch one of the Planetarium shows. You need to purchase tickets on site but you can usually get into one of the shows. And, if you like stargazing, they also have Star Parties one Saturday a month. Check the website for show and event times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmbgypsy
50,"Free attraction, great views and interesting exhbits","Very educational museum with chance to use telescopes at night (not sure how much can be seen due to light pollution nowadays). Fun exhibits for kids - this is a place that one can really feel good about taking children to. Lots of information about stars, meteorites, galaxies, and planetary astronomy. The planetarium does charge admission but it is quite reasonable and has differing shows.Great view of LA from the location in Griffith Park. A monument honours James Dean as several scenes from ""Rebel Without a Cause"" were filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnTheBear
30,Great views but YAWN inside.,The inside is like a 2nd grade science class with the exhibits. There are some cool views if it is a clear day but I would not necessarily worry about getting inside if not open. (They aren't on Mondays). Great place to go for a hike at the park or snap a pic of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glk16
50,Great date location!,"Whether you're planning a first date to impress or this is a time you can get away from the kids for a few hours, the Observatory is a must visit place.We go up regularly and mix it up with day time and night time visits.Keep in mind that the parking there can be a chore (unless you go on a motorbike or bicycle), but know that in advance and if you have to park 1/2 a mile away then look on the bright side'''you have a 1/2 mile walk along a hilly, curvy, tiny road with nothing but great views around you.Why is it good for dates? At night time you see the city lights and the night sky (awesome!) and during the day you can use the telescopes to check out Los Angeles in detail from above. We also had a little picnic on the grass which was nice, but I don't think you're supposed to.All of the activities in the Observatory are fun and as educational as you want them to be. Free parking and free admission rock! So you should spring the few bucks to go see the Planetarium show while you are there (very cool).The menu at the cafe is pretty big and, for LA, the prices were reasonable especially with the view while you eat your hot dog.A good day/night out for a couple looking for something different to get up to together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9612RAkevinb
40,You have to do it!,"we live here but this is a place we visit frequently -- it's a great way to get our young daughter to hike as the great reward at the end is the amazing observatory. sometimes (like the blood moon) we'll pack a picnic basket, spread out in the lawn & enjoy a day there. it's a lovely place & I can't recommend this place high enough with or without kids - the best part it's FREE!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3TravelMonkeys
50,Great place to visit! Must see or place to visit in LA,"The observatory is full of interesting facts on planetary and has a great telescope. in the Day time, you get to see a great view of LA and Hollywood sign. In night time, you see a great view of LA at night and also, see the stars on a clear night. Great lookout of LA and city skylight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffJenny88
50,The best views,"I went here based on a friends recommendation! As I arrived I wasn't expecting much as it was crowded after I explored more I was surprised to see the city from the top.After the exhibit we went on a hike and stayed till dark, I recommend seeing the city at night as it looks amazing this is a must visit place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyG3543
50,A must-see destination in Los Angeles,"Not only does Griffith Park Observatory offer one of THE best panoramic views of the Los Angeles basin available at any public place, but it is also a wonderful and interesting place to spend some time.The building is a fantastic Art Deco edifice, a real period piece that has been maintained beautifully over the many decades it's sat upon its mountaintop site. It underwent a massive renovation about ten years ago, and is now in pristine condition. Both inside and outside are extremely elegant and gorgeous, with beautiful marble work and Art Deco decorative details on the building's interior.The exhibits are marvelous -- extremely well done, very informative, and interesting. The planetary exhibit in the lower level is extremely great for kids or for anyone interested in astronomy. The lobby's Foucault pendulum never ceases to captivate me, no matter how many visits I've made.Best of all -- it's free of charge! Parking and observatory are completely free. Planetarium shows require a ticket: $7 for adults, $5 for students with I.D. and seniors, and $3 for children between 5 - 12 years old. Children under 5 are admitted to the first show of the day, only, and must sit on an adult’s lap.Very much worth a visit, whether you're visiting Los Angeles or you live here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6793YDcherylm
40,Mixed bag,"This iconic building is a must-see. The views from the top are stellar, however, parking is horrific. Unless you go early you will park down a steep hill or you will be turned away. The Observatory itself is small and the exhibits are limited. The show is very good but a little scary for children who are afraid of the dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dwilcox000
40,What a view,"This was absolutely fantastic once you got up there. We went on Saturday night and it took us about an hour of barely moving to get up there. We just happened to get lucky and have someone pull out of a spot. I don't know how we would have gotten up there otherwise. There were many telescopes set up on the lawn and we were able to view the moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. We did not have enough time to get to see the large telescope in the observatory. It closed at 9:30. Everything else closed at 10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTraveler6
50,Beautiful at night,"Born and raised in L.A. And this was always a landmark. Wonderful amazing views and the exhibits are interesting and informative. A great date place and the night views of the sparkling city lights are amazing. Try to get there when they have astronomy sightings, viewings and its a lot of fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sally88
50,Great Experience,"This is just a terrific 1/2 day activity. It is relaxed yet interesting and, if you enjoy some walking, it can begin when you park your car and walk up to the main building. The views from there are spectacular, the weather usually fabulous, the planetarium and exhibits first rate. Even the gift shop is fascinating and fun. Traffic can be challenging so plan your day and time accordingly. Most importantly, have fun and learn something!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valtraveler10
40,Awesome place,One of the best spots to see Los Angeles and the hills around it. Also a way to get close to the Hollywood sign.Wonderful place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRentel
40,Very Educational and Great Place to Visit Especially on a Hot Day,"Griffith Observatory offers an educational treat for those interested to learn more about the stars and the earth. It has much to see and explore. There is a lot of hands on stuff which is great if you have kids and they run regular programs for a cost that are worth trying too. As you walk outside around the Observatory, you get a great shot of the Hollywood sign and of LA. Plan to spend at least 3 hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CARLH_13
50,Wonderful,"This place is absolutely wonderful. The views are amazing. Our whole family enjoyed it! We were lucky enough to get a parking spot that was close, but it can get crowded so I would suggest you go early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljc39991
40,Phenomenal views!,"We went last-minute, one night while in Hollywood. Only went around the outside, to see the views - out of this world! Very busy place, tons of people, but traffic was actually not bad and they handle it well there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMcAbee68
50,Amazing view over los angeles and the hollywood sign,"Easy to drive, park, walk up to the observatory and enjoy the view. you have a great view over the city and able to take pictures with the hollywood sign in the back. we didnt go in to the observatory but it was free to go on top of the building for the view. highly recommend if you dont feel like hiking to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nin182
50,Get Spaced out!!,"Great place to learn about planets, stars, weather, the earth, sun, and moon. Many hiking trails too. Weekends are busy so be prepared to wait a bit for the shuttle bus to go up the hill if you dont want to walk. Nice views of LA, the Hollywood sign and nearby cities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mytravel360
40,Worth a visit,"Parking was hard, perhaps an expansion of the parking lot or something is possible. Sure the hike up to the observatory was beautiful.Inside it was growded, so it was hard to see the exhibitions fully.The ""show"" in the planaterium was woaw. You lay there and get woawed by the screen above you.Beautiful view over Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shmp95
30,Never open!!,"I looked online to find out the opening times, hiked up to the top TWICE and both times it was shut, despite being its opening hours!! Most disappointed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophie1988_06
50,Fabulous views of LA!,"I wasn't eager to to go the Griffith Observatory, but I am certainly glad I did. It was very easy to find from Westwood, where we wee staying, and clearly marked as to how we should go up the mountain.Drive slowly-lots of curves and low rails, but worth the trip to the top. They have hiking trails for those who are adventurous, and different picnic spots along the way-so very pretty. Once at the top you will have lots of opportunity to take photos with the famous HOLLYWOOD sign in the background (if it's a clear day!)with spectacular views of the mountains. Park and continue to the observatory-really great stuff awaits you!A pleasant surprise-cold water fountains and very clean restrooms are at the top.We were there on a week day and it was very crowded, so the weekends must be even worse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370camilleq
50,Incredible Views of LA,Magnificent building perched atop LA - hike up there on a nice day from the Ferndell Trail - a fantastic walk. The views of and from the Griffith Observatory are attraction enough - although I didn't actually go inside for a tour. It's free to walk around the outside the building and some of the inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bazroy99

50,Nice View of the stars and LA,"So many things to do in Griffith Park and the Observatory is literally its crowing glory. Lots of nice, informative exhibits and a wonderful view of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srobby
50,Worth a visit when in LA !,"The observatory is small but has quite an array of exhibits so you defiantly need some time to visit all of them if that is your plan. During our visit we decided to attend the Centered in the Universe show and it was very interesting. Closing time was a problem for us so would recommend you get there early to really get the full experience of what the observatory has to offer. Traffic and parking may also be packed, but traffic continually moves and you are likely to find a parking space on ground or near the observatory. There are plenty of staff members throughout the observatory and are generally friendly and ready to answer any questions that you may have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ram0nlara
50,Griffith observatory show,"Me and my girlfriend decided to take a trip up to the observatory and we are absolutely glad we did! What an amazing place, we arrived at a perfect time to buy tickets to see a show in the planetarium (centre of the universe)What an amazing experience this was, in which I highly recommend anyone visiting the observatory should go an see!! Apart from the show the observatory makes for some of the most amazing views!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danibanez
50,Amazing place..Worth the trip,"If in LA, you have visit this place as it has so much interesting stuff to discover. You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours here and then look at LA views..Really really nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loomi
50,Cool,Had never heard of this place and it definitely wasn't on my list of places to visit in LA. Our über driver recommended it so we thought we'd give it a go and I must say he wasn't wrong. We visited at night and the views of the city with all its twinkling lights was amazing and breathtaking. They also have a giant telescope which you can look through and see all the stars. I haven't been in the day but the views would also be spectacular and you are very close to the Hollywood sign so you would get a brilliant vantage point for this too especially for the old selfie. The only downside was the traffic on the road leading up to the observatory took a good half hour just on that road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888freyal
40,"Saturday night in traffic,....what a nightmare ?!","Visiting our son at USC this summer and after a nice visit to the Broad Museum we thought sunset at the observatory would be nice. Apparently half of LA also had the same idea. An hour in traffic just to get through 1-2 miles into the park and even then they tried to route us back down the hill past the lot at 8PM ?! Ridiculous. We managed to score a sketchy spot near the buses and hiked up the rest of the way. Long lines at every telescope on the grassy area outside the main building and we even tried to get to look through one of the internal/fixed scopes but after 30 minutes and with an hour until closing we were advised that we wouldn't get in so we hiked back down and tried a few small scopes outside. We did get to see the moon and Saturn and Jupiter so hard to complain but the city really lets this major site remain poorly maintained and with poor signage, crappy parking and almost no sidewalks ?! Glad to be heading home to SF soon. Exhausting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDaddyAlan
40,Great view,"We have been up there in the morning and returned at night again. Great view over the city, Hollywood sign is still far away but better to see compare to other places. I would suggest to go up around 7pm so you can have daylight photos, after have a drink up there in the little cafe, and after when the sun went down take night pictures so you need to go up only once. Parking are issues so you need to bring time to find a spot. If you go early morning parking is ok, around 09am",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wisetraveller81
50,Really great views of L.A and a TELESCOPE,The Griffith Observatory has many great views of L.A! You have to go if you are in L.A. The inside of the Observatory is pretty interesting but small. Parking is pretty bad so learn how to parallel park and have patience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hydrati0n9
50,Amazing views!,This place was pretty easy to get to with a car and we were rewarded with breathtaking views of Hollywood below and Downtown Los Angeles in the distance. With no haze you have a gorgeous unobstructed view of the entire city of Los Angeles. It was really nice to walk around and take some pictures... the best part was that it was a free activity!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derrick_Ross
50,Loved it!,"Loved the whole thing. The observatory, the astronomy exhibitions, the planetarium show, the gift shop, great view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor78
50,Fun inside and out,"Eclipses, tides, Moon Phases. Excellent educational exhibits inside for young and old alike.Great views of Hollywood sign (to the rear) and various parts of the city (to the front) from the upper levels of the observatory.Deservedly one of the best attractions in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
50,Panaroma of City!!,"Had to wait in long queue of traffic as we visited on the eve of new year but the wait was worthwhile when we saw the view from the top, just speechless, marvelous. The observatory is also excellent and the planetary weight machine was interesting.Overall a must visit attraction in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abutaiyab
40,Great Canyon View,Took pics of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Interesting exhibits inside and don't miss the movie if you're with kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tj_ncinci
50,Loved it!!,"The exhibits are top-notched, although you may not see anything that you will have not seen in other observatory of this kind. However, it was a beautiful building with absolutely stunning view of the city of Los Angeles. And the ""Hollywood"" sign is in the backdrop. If you like hiking, you can easily hike around and have a great day with inside and outside activities. If you plan to hike, do dress appropriately with plenty of water. Best of all, it is completely free (unless you want to see an IMAX movie).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLlovetravel
40,Great views,"It was worth the queues to get up to the Observatory to see the views, but be prepared for the long queues to park. The bathrooms need cleaned!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleyk760

50,STUNNING,The griffith is definitely a place you need to spend several hours at. From exploring their wonderful exhibits to just enjoying the breathe- taking view from every single angle! Me and my boyfriend absolutely adored having a picnic in the grass in front of the observatory and watching the sunset over the mountains!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meilylopez
50,Great day out for all the family,"A must do in LA. The observatory is a learning experience and fun for all the family about our solar system, with amazing views all the way to the ocean. There's a cafe and plenty of places to buy water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesinParis
50,Worth a visit,Visited it whilst we we stayed here. We had to park on road and walk up quite a steep hill in the heat is not a good thing but when we got to the top the views were amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinac492
40,Great views over LA!!,"Griffith Observatory has lots to see and do, not least of which absolutely stunning views over to the city of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign (especially at the evening) .

40,Overlooking the City of Angels,The Griffith Observatory is a great place to check out but the real gem is the trails next to it. My girlfriend and I decided to check out the trails behind the observatory but found ourselves starring at the hollywood sign and walking ten miles. The trails aren't that tough with gradually climbing hills and various ways to go. I would highly recommend these trails if you are in the area but be sure to wear good shoes and bring some water as well. The only fountain is at the very beginning of the trail. Check out some of my great pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFishersCS
50,Verz interesting,Very interesting. You can see how much you weight in another planet. You can also see the city from above and the hollywoodsign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenamohr297
50,"Very cool for teens, kids, adults.","Beautiful view of L.A. Can see the Hollywood sign. Beautiful park for hiking, many sandy/dirt trails all around the park, steep at times. Wear good hiking shoes and bring water. The Observatory is free to visit, planetarium shows are low cost at $7 a person (adult). The planetarium is beautiful, and nice cozy reclined seats for viewing the show. I recommend taking picnic lunches and snacks. There is a café on site, somewhat mediocre though and very pricey. There are many clean bathrooms in the Observatory, more rugged outhouse type but with running water on the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joangQ4260WQ
50,"Amazing, interesting - beautiful!","We only had 2 days in LA and wasn't sure what to do down to the size of the place! We spotted Griffith Observatory as a top rated on Tripadvisor so decided to go there first thing.. This place did not disappoint! Even if you are not into Astrology it's fascinating and the views of the Hollywood sign and LA are spectacular!There was plenty of car parking - a steep walk up a hill to it but we managed fine in 25+ degree heat. It is quite exposed so be careful on the hotter days. There is a small cafe but is expensive and very limited so I would personally take your own snacks and drinks. It is free admission which is also a bonus and it's really easy to find via a sat nav :)We spent a good 2 hours here and then popped to LA zoo straight after before going to see a baseball game, it was well worth it and I would come here again if ever in LA - maybe at night time to see everywhere lit up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauren3817
50,Fun and informative,"My girlfriend and I had a great time. The views from the observatory are amazing and the exhibits are full of interesting facts. We took in one of the shows and it was amazing. Be mindful of the exhibits, they are pretty grubby and both my girlfriend and I came down with awful colds. Bring some disinfectant wipes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessec748
40,Review on 'The View' only.....traffic is horrid,"We attempted to visit Griffith observatory in late June 2016. We went around 3 in the afternoon and traffic was absolutely horrid. Apparently the parking lot was full because people were parked all along the side of the road. The had parking personnel waving people 'away' from the full lot at the bottom of the lot toward a tunnel but no one offering any advice on where one might park/go after going through the tunnel. We decided we would simply attempt a return visit as parking at the end of the 'line' would have created an uphill walk of at least 30 minutes. On the way back down, my son decided that he just really wanted to climb a hill, so off to the right we saw a gated drive with a tree next to it and a trail going to the top of a hill away from the drive. We decided to stop and let him climb the hill and we are glad we did, because at the top of that hill was an amazing view of both the city of LA and the Hollywood sign! (and no one else around). So if you ever go to Griffith and you're simply interested in the view and can do without the telescopes and the ticketed attractions, (and you're able-bodied) this dirt trail is a great, quick alternative. If you were exiting the Griffith parking lot, you will turn left and go back toward downtown Hollywood. Keep looking for a blocked drive to your right. Next to that drive you will see a tree. At the bottom of that tree is a marker stating when it was planted and by whom (Boy scouts, I think, over 100 years ago) This will tell you that you are in the right place. You'll see a trail on your left going up a hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ngachick
40,interesting place if you like astronomy or want a really beautiful view of the city of Los angeles,wonderful place to take pictures and learn about astronomy. has a museum inside related to astronomy and the skies. love it very much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennSutrisno
50,A great place for views of L.A. and learning about astronomy,"I spent about 3 hours here, but could easily have done an entire day. The afternoon I went there was when a super moon was going to rise so finding parking took quite a while, but it was well worth it. The exhibits are great, and they have educational movies throughout the day. Kids will enjoy it, but it is just as interesting to go by yourself and take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisvip53
50,Hollywood sign,As many others already stated this is a really nice location to see the Hollywood sign. It does get crowded in the weekends but there's plenty of parking space along the road. The observatory is surrounded by a park which did not look that appealing to me as it was mostly arid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Country_hopper99
50,A-MAZE-ING!,"The views from this place are astonishing. Iv been to many view points in LA, but this was by far the best. And with the free planetarium it is very much worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_nicolakhillier
10,"boring, not worth the trip","it was a boring place. Nothing to see. Exhibits were lame, mostly photos. I think they only allow to look into the telescope after 7pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinewood523
50,"Great views over LA, nature and observatory cinema",Griffith observatory was one of the highlights of our LA trip. We went in the evening so we were able to see LA lit up as well as the stars. The best part is the cinema offering which fills the whole observatory ceiling and is fully immersive with a live speaker who is outstanding. She sounds like she does voices for movies or animated movies. Really great experience. The observatory itself has many fascinating things in it that would be great for kids to learn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crystalarts
30,Information and view.,Parking is horrendous (we went on a long weekend) and it was already past dinner time. View of LA is so-so (you can see the smog). The observatory itself is very good though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8budweiser
50,Amazing sun rise view,Decided to get up at the crack of dawn and watch the sun rise here. Was amazing! there would have been maybe 4 couples in total around the entire observatory so no obstructed views and was very peaceful. Do yourself a favour and get up early 1 morning on your holiday just to go up here first thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amygT6171GB
50,Beautful,What a busy and beautiful place! The views are spectacular! A must see! I would advise getting here early as it's a very busy place. Drive and park at top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bacm
40,Great if you are into astronomy,"This was a great experience for anyone interested in astronomy. The area is also beautiful as you can see the city, mountains, and the Hollywood sign. They had telescopes set up each showing a different planet. We could even see Saturn's rings and some of it's planets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1988GGsandys
30,Don't go for the fireworks!,"We were in LA for the weekend before the 4th. Not knowing any better, we decided to drive up to the observatory to see the view and maybe some fireworks. Us, and 10,000 others. We first got stuck in Greek Theater traffic, and caught a little of Ringo Starr! We thought the traffic would thin out, but no - it took about an hour and a half to get to the top. We got to take in the view for about 10 minutes before the park closed and we were ushered out. It was a great view, but just really poor planning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nessakitty
50,super fun,its hard to entertain a 16 year old these days. my son was totally stoked ! we spent the whole day taking in the views!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanieptx
50,Star Gazer,"We love to visit this place for the star gazing connections. This review is based a number of visits over the years. The planetarium is great and tickets are reasonably priced. We love the huge Foucault Pendulum that demonstrates the rotation of the earth. There are really cool astronomy exhibits. We also travelled there to see the lunar eclipse. We tried restaurant down stairs, but the menu was limited. The next time, We picniced with some fried chicken , chips and soda from a local grocery store. On an alternate star gazing account , we once even saw a Vulcan of Star Trek Voyager fame. If you follow the Star Trek voyager series , he was there once before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
40,Quite a view of the Los Angeles basin.,"If you plan to visit the observatory, go early, before it opens. Otherwise, you will have to park along the road leading to it. The road climbs the mountain up to the observatory and is winding and long. When we went, cars were parked for miles. The lot had filled up hours before. At any rate, we found a spot to park along the road about a quarter mile from the top so we were pretty lucky. The observatory is interesting but not thrilling. They have halls of exhibits and information. Several theaters provide history and special exhibitions. There is a cafe located inside as well. The outside decks offer excellent viewing of the Los Angeles area. the Hollywood sign is also visible from here. There are trails you can hike too. At the time of our visit, there were so many people that it was hard to move around inside the observatory. Lots of people were laying out in the grass in front of the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
50,For star lovers!,One of the best observatories I have visisted. You can have a view of the city and the Hollywood sign. Very interesting information provided and the shows are interesting. I visited on a open day and I had the chance to speak with astronomers and watch through their telescopes as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/103vicky
40,Worth a visit,"Fantastic views across LA, can get crowded, we had to park down the bottom and walk a fair way but we didn't mind. Perhaps keep in mind if elderly or have young children with you.The cafe there is not very nice I would visit and have lunch elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5891

50,excellent,"This is a great place to see the Hollywood sign and the Observatory in one trip. After reading all the TripAdvisor's reviews, we went early on a Wednesday at 10am and got a parking spot. After walking around and eating a picnic lunch at the picnic tables, the observatory was open and had a great time inside. The parking lot starting an hour after we got there was packed and the whole road coming up had cars parked on both sides. Would recommend to get there early and enjoy the quietness and sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142joannet
50,"Beautiful, Educational, Very Busy","Lots to see here. We went for one of the shows in the planetarium, and walked the grounds too. I suggest going early if going on a weekend. We went around noon on a Sunday and it was madness. We parked in the lot at the top of the hill; I don't suggest parking on the hillsides. Also great for hiking around the hills. If I had been more prepared I would have worn hiking clothes. Their website has lots of helpful info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretR550

40,Busy Place!,"We decided to go up to the observatory for sunset on a Saturday night. It was incredibly crowded and the smog blocked the view of the sun. It was still neat to watch all the lights from LA come on. If you don't mind waiting in long lines, you can look through telescopes for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimimary2016
20,Great location....too bad it was closed,"On our one day spare in LA between flights, we hired a car from LAX and drove up to Griffith Park for 2 reasons....to have a look at the view (which didn't exist due to thick smog), and of course, to visit the Griffith Observatory. Hundreds of people everywhere...a huge crowd, and as such, the parking was a joke...parking attendants directed us out of the full car park and we had to park a long way away down the hill, and struggle to walk back up the winding road to the top of the hill in the heat to the Observatory. Once there ....it was closed. What? I asked one of the traffic attendants, and he advised it is closed every Monday. What sort of ""committee"" came up with that idea for a tourist destination? Hundreds of visitors everywhere, and doors closed. We walked back downhill to the miles-away-car, and left. I guess I'm destined to never get to see the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248grega
40,Amazing lookout,The place was crowded and it was difficult to find somewhere to park but it was well worth it because the views of Los Angeles are spectacular.

30,"Great activity , poor transportation","It was a great activity , the staff very knowledgeable and helpful.The only negative point was a poor transportation system to get there.Only during week-ends they had a shuttle bus , but nothing during the week.Being one of the main attractions , it should also be considered having access , only by shuttle , since it gets very crowded with all the cars getting up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fr0ntierman

A free, great experience for adults and children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisagH741WD
50,"History, Science, and a View",A landmark we all have seen in movies dozens if not hundreds of times. The view of the LA basin is spectacular even on a hazy day. Displays are informative and the overall facility is well maintained and controlled. Best view of the Hollywood sign you can get get without a tiring hike. Best to get there early or on a weekday. The main lot fills up quickly and you can end up on side roads winding around the hills for 2 miles or better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460RobertS460

Beautiful locations and interesting exhibits as part of the planetarium, but can be painful to get there due to traffic and a lack of parking (the staff managing traffic are totally useless and add not value, in fact they irritate the hell out of you), once you overcome the frustration of getting there, is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorBurchell
30,Vey busy and not worth the hype!,"Our family, including children aging from 8-13, stopped here on a Tuesday night. The place was packed! The parking lot was closed to traffic because it was full, so we had to park down the hill on the side of the road. It was about a 15 to 20 minute walk up the hill. We went in and looked around. There were some displays and such, but nothing that sparked lots of interest. Then went outside to the top for the view. The view was nice, but it was super crowded and hard to find an open spot on the railing. We did not do the planetarium show. Then we walked back down the hill in the dark to the car. Ultimately we spent more time walking to and from the car than we did in the Observatory. I wouldn't go back. Once was enough for our family. I'm glad I got this out of the way on our first night in Hollywood, as this was the most stressful part of our trip in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jans778
30,A Must do when visiting LA,"GO is a must, if your visiting LA, it's a piece of LA history, and a good outing. It was super busy, so I'd recommend going early (before 10:00am)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMB7694
40,A definite must,"Best views of LA, a definite must, specially on a first visit. Beautiful and really gives you a perspective of the whole city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandodlm
50,Excellent Views,Very busy yet civil and organised observatory. Wonderful planetarium with breathtaking views of the city of angels.This is the best place for views of the hollywood sign in the background as well as LA city views. Would be a great outing for kids (I'll take my kids here the day I have them :) ),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599starb
50,Griffith's great views,"We went to Griffith Park spontaneously during a trip to Los Angeles. The parking lot at the observatory was full, but we found a spot along the access road. It was a long walk, but worth it. The views from the observatory are amazing (including a great view of the Hollywood sign), and the facilities have bathrooms, exhibits, a gift shop and cafe. Definitely worth a visit!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cbr00k
50,Worth the Drive,It was our first visit to Griffith Observatory and well worth it on a clear day. Parking is an issue. We went on a Tuesday and arrived at noon ( the park opened at 11am on that day) and had difficulties finding a parking space. When we left at 1:30pm there were plenty of spots to park. Lesson: go later in the day. We didn't spend a lot of time viewing the Observatory exhibits since it was filled with shool groups. Next time we will wear hiking gear and explore some of the trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMJ024
50,"You don't even need to enter, the best views are in the parking lot!","We were visiting from out of state and decided to go on a Saturday. They open at 11, and parking was backed up miles away very quickly. We went ahead and drove up to the entrance anyway just to see if a close up spot would be free. Lo and behold, we found a great parking spot right up front. You have to remember, most people just spend a half hour here, so spots free up quite frequently. I felt bad for the folks that were not even checking and just parking in the last spots. They probably had to walk for 30+ minutes UP hill. We had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharberfam
50,Awesome spot,Scenic & educational. We had a lot to see that day & didn't want to spend the whole day here. I was almost scared off by the number of cars / people figuring we'd be there forever. Things actually went pretty quickly. If you wanted to be in & out in 30-45 mins you probably could.Glad we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TCLudtke
50,stunning views of the city,Visited here while on a tour of LA. Absolutely a good area to see breathtaking views of the city of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meongo123
50,Best view in town,"Awesome views of LA and the Hollywood sign, and just a nice open space to hang out. Plus the inside of the observatory has a bunch of neat and free things to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougmendoza
50,We are all made of moon dust,"I chose the last show of the evening in the planetarium and sunset views for picture taking. The 'Centre of the Universe"" show was beautifully narrated and inspirational for those which want a reminder of the universe we live in and where we have come from.Once the sun was setting allowed for spectacular pictures and a lit L.A.As the moon was out the observatory has several telescopes placed for everyone to take a peek. Well worth the time and effort to get there. Parking can be tricky. I used an Uber share - which took me up and back to town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllaninWanderland
50,Friday afternoon visit,Loved the show in the planetarium. My kids enjoyed finding out what they would weigh on different planets on lower level exhibit. My 12 year old enjoyed seeing the Tesla Coil in action. Great view of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nSpeaks
50,Knock-out view!,"What a fabulous place, Learning about the heavens is awe inspiring. The building is historic and amazing and the views of the city knock me out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabaDi
50,Very nice night view!,It was very beautiful at night! We wish we came earlier to see the sun set. I feel that it's a great place to hang. We went after 10pm when it was closed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471mandeeph
50,Beautiful views of LA,"We visited the Griffith Observatory because my son is so into astronomy. It was a beautiful day to go and see the grounds and the views of LA. We got there around 12:30 and needed to park down the hill. It was only about a 15 minute walk, so not that bad. The hill up can be a challenge, so if you have any issues, I would definitely talk to the people working he parking going up to he observatory.Once we got there (it was a Wednesday), there were a TON of kids - not sure if it was a camp or a school field trip. The place is large enough that t didn't really matter. So many cool things to look at and we dos take in one show ($7/adult). We ended up staying about 3 hours in total and probably could have stayed longer. I would deforest go back and even take a picnic lunch next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKS28
50,Perfect for a view of the city and walking opportunities,"The Observatory has a prime location overlooking LA, so it's a great place to really see the City (not that it's one of the world's beauties...). You can see the Hollywood sign as well, so it's good to tick that off. If you're feeling energetic there are quite a few walks you can do from the car park.We didn't pay to get in, so can't comment on the insides, but you can get up to the roof without paying which is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiep84
50,"Gorgeous view at night, beware the crowds","I recently visited the observatory at night. It's gorgeous, you won't be disappointed.Some notes however:1) It can get VERY crowded. Lines for the telescopes that were set up on the lawn were 15-20 minutes long.Parking/traffic can be a hassle. Traffic was so backed up going up the hill, I told my Uber driver to just let me out and I would walk it..for our mutual sanity.2) More lighting would be helpful. Not huge signs, I am aware of light pollution. But just some signs to let you know what each of the telescopes is pointing to.3) The view of LA and it's environs is quite pretty. That's half the attraction.4) The first floor of the observatory is open late at night and features exhibits on space/stars. It's cool but you can look all of that up on Wikipedia. Go outside and enjoy the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samir427
40,To see LA from above,If you want to see how big is LA come here! I was there at sunset and also saw the lights of the city at night and it was worst.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sergio_Nogueira
50,good views,great views of Los Angeles and Hollywood sign and was featured in the James Dean film Rebel without a cause,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3515RMjuliel
50,Astronomical,"What an interesting little museum. The view of Los Angeles was huge, Hollywood sign in perfect view, and the little museum inside was full of cosmic nformation. My favorite thing was seeing Jupiter through the giant telescope (only during designated times).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9543RSstephaniel
50,The best thing to do in Hollywood!,"A very nice view with a very nice observatory, very pretty decorated. Walk through and look at all of the different telescopes and the uses for them. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToniBuilt
50,Best View of the City,"There's nothing like seeing Los Angeles, surrounding hillsides and the famous Hollywood sign from the Griffith Observatory. It's a great place for all ages, as evidenced by the many school field trips taking place the day we were there. It's a must-stop during an LA visit....if you are lucky enough to get a good parking place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918dewayneh
50,Great Place!,"Great place to visit, the views from up here are breath taking, looking down at the city below. Great photo opportunities! Plus you can get great pics of the famous 'Hollywood' sign from here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieF522
50,Interesting Place to visit when in LA,"Fantastic Observatory, great views of LA and not to forget the place where you can click your picture with HOLLYWOOD sign in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BimalB
50,Breathtaking! Go on a clear day for great views and Hollywood sign.,"I came here twice while I was in LA, once was at 6pm and the other was at 7.30am. I found that in June it's very cloudy and we could BARELY make out the Hollywood sign which was a shame, but despite that it's a fantastic view of LA below. We also did a walk up to the top where you can see the observatory from afar which was pretty spectacular. It gets really busy though so expect quite a walk up the hill from where you park on the road climbing up. Definitely worth the visit :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193moniquecs
40,A great destination while in LA,"I rented a bike near my hotel in downtown LA and rode out to Griffith Park. The ride out there was well worth it, taking in Sunset Boulevard, etc. The park itself is a fantastic place to hike and the Observatory makes for an ideal target destination. Once there you get a really good view over the city (and the ride back is downhill!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TObiker
40,Good to kill time,I had time to kill so I went for a walk. Take in the observatory but give your self a few extra hours to hike around mount Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marsbr_540
50,LA trip 2016!,"I've visited Griffith Observatory twice now, 2 years in a row and I will always be blown away by the breathtaking sights and architecture.My partner was however mildly harassed by a Buddhist monk, and out of politeness gave him $5 for a small book. People like this are everywhere just outside the perimeter, just a word of warning, if you don't want to give up your holiday spends on pretty useless things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lollygrace91
40,"Nice place to visit / small, but very well done",Beautiful surroundings. Parking can be tough - you might need to walk up a hill from the secondary parking area. Very customer friendly - not overly scientific,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom_B_NJ
50,Heaven on Earth!,"I absolutely loved the Griffith Observatory so much that I visited 3x during my 6 day stay in LA. On top of a glorious mountain 1134' in altitude, the observatory is an architectural and scientific delight. I joined the observatory as a Friend of the Observatory (""FOTO"") and as such, saved money on tickets to the planetarium shows (which were marvelous!), the gift shop, and the onsite cafe. Located in beautiful Griffith Park, the observatory is both planetarium and museum, as well as providing fascinating panel lectures the first Friday of each month. I am planning a return visit to LA next year and I shall be sure to visit the Griffith Observatory at least 2-3 times again, making sure I catch the First Friday panel again. This is a have-to-visit place in LA - not only can you see the Hollywood sign clearly from up here, you get a clear and extensive view of LA as well. It is a beautiful park and observatory and includes a cafe and gift shop as well as the museum, telescopes, planetarium, and view. This must be on your list of what-to-see in LA; it is a breathtaking experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJMK
40,A must see,The inside was closed on our visit but there is plenty to see walking around the area. Parking is hectic at the top but you will definitely find a spot if you keep circling. There are may hiking spots and great views of the Hollywood sign and LA. Neat place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertbJ2259YU
50,Great Date Night,"We actually didn't hike up to the top of the mountain. We ended up taking a Lyft to the top and we saw a movie. The movie ticket is like ~$8-$11/person so it's cheap and actually very insightful. The movie theater is pretty cool because the chairs recline so much and the movie is actually projected on the ceiling. You won't get to experience this anywhere else! After the movie, you can enjoy the sights and views. If you have time before the show starts, you can do a quick hike around the Observatory.Great time! Around 10pm, we requested a Lyft so we didn't have to worry about driving in traffic :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446cynthias

50,A must see,A great place to visit for views over Hollywood. You can get pictures with the famous 'Hollywood' sign in the background however the sign is quite far away it is only just legible. A must visit though when in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMN1986
50,American 'Jantar Mantar'..😂😂,"It's a fabulous institution, at a location which happens to be out of the world. The view from the Observatory of the city below is great. This also is a spot from where you can hike right up to the Hollywood sign.The observatory is a great source of information on the solar system. There is a great sun dial where you can see the correct time bases on the position of the sun.You can miss the avenue of stars on your first LA visit, but please don't skip the Griffith observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhawaniPathania
50,what a view,"For most of my life, i have never been to the observatory until recently. yes parking can be a hassle but when you do park and make the walk up the hill, it is worth it. the views all around, especially at night are gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575lynnl
50,Amazing Views,I visited this place with a friend at night and was absolutely captivated by the views. Perfect for picture taking - just make sure you stop there on a not-so-smoggy day or evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crmhous312
50,Great Learning Experience on a weekend excursion,"This place is very educational, not only for students. The astrology shows are worth watching, well worth the wait. The view over LA is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UlrikeZ280
30,Go after a Raining day,"Best time to go would be right after a rain during day or night. You ask why? Because all the LA smog would be covering up most of what you want to see. After a rain, everything clear up make it far out stretch where you can see the ocean. Also night time would be lovely time to go after an rain. Also parking is a major PITA, so you better walk a bit, maybe like an mile or more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbabyboy
40,Fascinating,"Wonderful view of LA from here, very crowded with fellow tourists, lots of school kids as well. Enjoyed some of the scientific facts demonstrated in the observatory, all well presented and easy to view.Parking was tricky, never enough spaces, but free 🚙",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F64FPlouisew
50,Must See for Everyone visiting,"This is the one place I always take people visiting me from out of state/country. Not even is the Observatory absolutely fantastic (and free!), you ca even hike the area for a little bit, have a great view of LA, and even see that Hollywood Sign.Been there many times and will be back many more times.If your visit to LA is short, don't skip this one, you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ilseum

50,"A great view, interesting and free exhibit, and great biking/hiking.","We always visit when we are in Town. From the James Dean bust to the incredible view of downtown(when clear!!) to the beautiful structure the observatory cannot be missed. I love biking up the hill from the Valley for the great views and we like hiking above the observatory. One note of caution is that it gets very busy on weekends. You may have to park way down the hill. But it's worth it.,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureBiker21
50,Great view of LA with an education,Took the family here for the view and found a lot of education displays that you can walk around and read. Parking and the attraction is free. If you want to watch the presentation it costs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishmister
40,Perfect stop to view Hollywood sign,"Enjoyed the exhibits and great view of the city & Hollywood sign. Wish parking was improved, only spots were parallel along the curvy uphill narrow road which were sketchy at best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sscheuri
50,Something new,"We had never been to the Griffith Park Observatory. My first suggestion is get there as early as you can. The parking is real bad in the middle of the day. You could end up hiking over a mile up a hill just to get to the observatory.Once there, you will experience the most spectacular views of Los Angeles. If you are photographer, this will be like Disneyland for you.The show we saw was spectacular. It was like Soaring over California in California Adventures. You felt at times as if you were in the story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpetiti21
50,Very interesting and free!,"We were able to see Saturn, Mars and Jupiter through telescopes. Very interesting displays and information about planets, tides, seasons and various other matters. Also Tesla wireless electricity machine demonstration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ipmunday
40,A different top view of Los Angeles,"Griffith Observatory is great to visit if you are into science, planets, milky way or galaxy.If you're driving a car to Griffith Observatory, make sure you go there before 9:30am so you can park your car closer to the Observatory, otherwise you might find yourself in a 10-15 minute hike from where you park your car to the Observatory. Pay attention to the walk way before the entrance of the Observatory. I will not spoil the details, just look where you're stepping, truly educational.Overall, the Griffith Observatory is a great place to visit with your family, friends, or just go there by yourself and it will be awesome still. When inside, do not rush yourself going from one area to the other. Enjoy the educational information and (sometimes) very entertaining way how science is being presented to you. On your way to the underground floor where all planets are there and you can stand on a weighing scale and see how much you weigh if you're in Mars or Venus, etc. you will pass a circular stone in between the steps, try to say something and your voice will echo.The fee for the planetarium is very decent given the fact that you will be inside the planetarium enjoying a comfortable seat and being educated for an hour. I think the fee is more or less $8 each person.Don't forget to go up the Observatory patio where you have a great view of Los Angeles. Take a picture with the Hollywood sign at the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockf2016
50,Amazing - Perfect for a Romantic Date or to Renew Romance,"This is an amazing place. Our son loves to go there with girlfriends, picnic and view the stars. Romantic - wonderful. My husband and (40 years of marriage) loved this place as well. Can't go wrong. They have food or you can bring your own. They offer so very much if you are really interested in seeing and viewing and learning about our universe and beyond. Can't say enough about this place AND the surrounding area. Recommend seeing Fern Dell before, strolling thu the grotto, hiking the area and then enjoying a romantic evening at the observatory. Truly a wonderful thing to do for summer, winter, spring or fall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
50,Great- visit!,"Beware: you might end up walking a long way because there is no parking close to the observatory.However, it is well worth the walk.You have a great view over the city and inside you will learn a lot about space and earth.And it is all free, well almost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiDuchi

50,Always a good idea!,"If you want parking space, go early. Good for adults, kids, teenagers. You can do different kind of hikes or just going into the observatory but always check their schedule. Amazing view from any place. They also have a coffee place, wifi zone, etc. bring money in case you want one of the exhibitions they have.Have fun and bring always water",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cotita76
40,Awesome time,My family and I have been coming here for years and we love it! We especially like to visit during a week day because it can get a little crowded and noisy on Friday and Saturday nights.Wear comfortable shoes if you plan on going to see the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87aracelim
40,Interesting Visit,"I enjoy taking guests to the Griffith Observatory. The location is superb situated high up in the hills.

50,Awesome view AND it's free!,"If you are visiting L.A., you definitely need to go to the Griffith Observatory! There is no entrance fee or fee for parking...Did I say FREE? You will have a perfect view of the famous Hollywood sign and L.A. from the observatory. This is definitely a first class observatory and houses one of the most famous telescopes in the world. If you want to see one of the movies inside, there is a fee for that, but all of the other exhibits including an introduction to Griffith Observatory movie and some of the science demonstrations are all free. Parking, although free, is in high demand, but if you don't mind walking, it's all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRosenbloom
50,Excellent location to view Los Angeles!,"Wonderful exhibits that are friendly for ""science-phobics""! The exhibits are wonderful especially the area that displays the planets in scale models. The movies are also worth watching (for a fee). The museum is free. One could spend a couple of hours there easily. Recommend for children and adults of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P9218BCchrisb
40,Worth it for the views on a clear day,"I'd recommend avoiding the place on a weekend - but during the week, crowds are less and it's more enjoyable. It's best to go immediately after a rain - the views are incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer803794
50,"You've seen it in movies, and it is that amazing in person!","Getting here and back down the hill is a challenge, as I had to take a cab there and (as far as I know) there is no public transit system, but once you are there it is totally worth it! It's fun just walking around thinking ""I remember that from Rebel Without A Cause"" or ""I remember that from Terminator or The Rocketeer or Bowfinger or that Paula Abdul music video..."" but also seeing the views are remarkable. I took ALOT of pictures here and prepare to do so yourself. A must for movie fans visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismQ4711XU

40,Outstanding views of L.A!,"Obviously the Observatory's number 1 purpose is to educated the public about space, but the views of L.A from outside are amazing.Well worth the visit, but beware of parking issues. We had to park halfway down the hill and hike up. So dress for walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A-V-Williams
50,Beautiful views!,I loved the trip up to Griffith Observatory. We caught the weekend shuttle which cost 50cents each way!!I wanted to go for 2 reasons-the view and the James Dean connection and wasn't disappointed on either count.The place is stunning and the views exceptional. We went late afternoon and he sun was just starting to set making it all the more beautiful.Definitely return if ever back in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charli3p
50,Out of this world,Initially I was very sceptical about visiting a large telescope but our LA friend highly recommended it & I'm so glad they did.It wasn't massively busy but there were enough people there that you had a queue up for 10 minutes + to have a look at the exhibits/telescopes.The best bit for me by far was the show in the planetarium - Light of the Valkyries. It was absolutely amazing. The lady doing the voice over had such enthusiasm in what she was explaining & a very soothing tone of voice which I felt really complimented the show itself.Definitely worth a visit at all times of day as the views of Los Angeles were breathtaking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katy_shivers

50,Don't Miss It!,"This is where you go to see great views of Los Angeles and get closer to the Hollywood sign. Make sure you take your camera. There is a city bus that you can take up to the top of the Observatory and then catch it again to go down when you are finished with your visit, it costs 50 cents each way per person. This is a great thing because it is a hike especially if you are visiting and don't have a car. I was visiting with my adult children and we took Uber from our hotel, it was great as we got a narrated tour all the way there and right up to the top of the site. We learned so much more about the area. When we were done, we took the bus down to the bottom. It was a beautiful summer day, glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesat2013

40,"Awesome sights, great show, and not too pricey!","The main reason we went up here is because a plenty of locals recommended it, I wanted to see the HOLLYWOOD sign and my wife wanted to see the planetarium. My wife loved the planetarium, and I won't say I didn't... the experience was almost unique. It felt very ... bedtime story or narrative TV show esque, but it was a great experience with the narrator(lady with a lovely voice) making me not only learn, but become interested again in space. I very much appreciated it ... and the low $7 adult price! Now, the views of the HOLLYWOOD sign from here are fair ... photographers, bring nice lenses if you expect a nice shot. But! There are great views of Downtown LA and others.If you're looking for an inexpensive family idea or a nice, INTERESTING cheap date ... I totally recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/structureofzero

30,No parking,We went all the way to the top but there was a big event going on in the area so there was absolutely nowhere to park within 5 miles up an down the hill to get there. The view from the top of the mountain was great though. Would like to go and enjoy when less busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirbyfive
50,Stunning View of L.A. and the Hollywood sign,"We saved this for the last day of our two week trip and it was a sensational ending, getting to see lots of L.A. from a brilliant vantage point. Perfect spot for some fab photos, get the panorama mode on! We went at sunset which also cast a lovely effect. The observatory itself was closed at the time but does have fantastic exhibits as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/788joshuaj
50,Great place to visit day and night,"we have been there several times already and each time we enjoy this place a lot. The view from the observatory is great whole visiting at daylight and at night too (but you will not see the hollywood sign at night). The observatory itself is worth seeing and the admission is free.There can be some problems with the parking, due to heavy traffic of tourists and locals who like to spend the time there, especially during weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronikak694
50,A must see place when visiting LA,"Great view of the city and hollywood sign. Plenty of parking space. Nice exhibitions and all for free, except for planetarium show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grzegorzd667
50,Need more time!,"This is a must see, not only for the view but for the details of things we take for granted. Both inside and outside the observatory is unbelievable! And because of its purpose is almost like a living thing. You learn and see so much. There may be a bit of a hike to get there if the parking lot is full but DO IT! You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nosocialmedia
50,Amazing view,Seems to get crowed quick but worth the traffic. Amazing views of the city from all sides. The planet exhibit on the first floor is very impressive.Very educational and entertaining.You can also view the sky using the telescope after 7pm. Well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsupra22
50,Lovely Observatory,Very nice Observatory which is a must for all visitors to LA. Incidentally we did not have much time as we were on a bus tour. You must provide at least two hours for this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/admireindiaholidays
50,Love This Place,I remember visiting this place 40 years ago with my dad and uncle. I was so happy to see it again and bring our son this time. I'd love to return soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraf330
30,Nice from the outside...,"We picked to visit this on a Monday not knowing that they are closed on Monday. What a shame. I think it was worth a visit. But with 111 degrees to walk under the sun...we did it fast and short, surrounding the building, looking into the nice views, taking as many pictures as possible and as fast as possible...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngridHA1973
50,What a place,"First stop on my tour of LA with my teenage daughter, amazing place with panoramic views. Do not miss this place, very crowded with cars but we just did Uber which turned out great.

40,Great views and cool astronomy museum,I loved it. I love science and astronomy. I would recommend this to anybody that loves science or a great view of LA and for all ages. Most of this is free to the public. There is a theater but the line was too long and I did not quite understand the show time schedule. I wish there was an information desk to help with that stuff or pre-selling tickets. You can see a free museum about astronomy and also see the telescopes. Most do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexWorldTour
50,Great,"Visited here as a part of the ""day in LA"" tour and for me it was very interesting, the views are stunning and probably one of the best places to go to see the Hollywood sign on the hill.Lots of information about the observatory and the skies and planets, very interesting. The access road was very busy so allow plenty of time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveeQ7649ZQ

50,Good astronomy stuff and great views,I liked the exhibits on space a lot. Even got to hold a piece of a real meteorite. The views outside of LA and the Hollywood sign were great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813HenrikH
50,Totally understand why it is one of the top Tourist Attractions,I was fortunate enough to visit by both day and night. The views are stunning light or dark. The building is stunning in its own right. My only regret is I did not block out a whole day to enjoy everything this wonderful place has to offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaffer66
50,"Exploration worthy, breath taking,and educational!!","Go before noon on a week day. Bring water, camera , sneakers. Be curious, patient and learn about our planet,stars, moon,meteors, astroids and comets. Find out the truth about why dinosaurs disappeared. All interactive and employees couldn't be more helpful or knowledgable . If your in to optics you will learn about telescopes and how they work.A fun relaxing free day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcd931
50,Great views,"Awesome views to the city especially at night time. Make sure you go with plenty time and patience as you will need it trying to find a parking spot.The observatory closes at 10pm. The Hollywood sign can be viewed from here, also recommended to have some snack on the grass admiring the skies.The traffic can be tedious but that's the only downside.Can't wait to visit it again!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBenjamin74
50,Los Angeles must!,"Griffith Observatory and Park is one of the best ways to get the full grasp of Los Angeles. The views are unreal and one could easily spend an entire day exploring the hiking trails throughout the park. If you are visiting Los Angeles, Griffith is a must! You're welcome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanceivanharris
50,Great Place to Visit when Sky is Clear,We loved it! We really liked the exposition on the lower floor about the planets. Specially the fact that we all weight much less in most planets :) If you are not a hiker this is the best spot to take pics of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarlaStegui
50,Must see in LA,"The view of LA is breath taking ! Easy to get to, just follow signs ! Once at the observatory , it is crowded . Parking spots at the top random , but people come and go rather quickly and I've always been able to park there . Good view of Hollywood sign too! Before parking along the road on the way up , go all the way up to observatory and check out availability if walking is a challenge . On the way down stop by the Greek Theater ! Easy to park at the Greek and look around ! Once in a life time for many of us !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maribethg_13
50,Science & Breathtaking Views,"I have over the years been to this location, but this time I took my fiance. On our way up to the observatory there were many visitors as well. It was kind of difficult to find close parking. But by the time you get there the views of Los Angeles are fantastic. Inside we learned about the sun and other stars. They do offer shows to learn more about stars and solar system. In some ares it's handicap accessible. Perfect place for pictures and to learn all in one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/388raymondd
40,"Exhibits and shows are wonderful, parking is terrible","We have been to several Space Museums and Planetariums and this is one of the best. The exhibits about space, planets, and telescopes are really, really good. The star shows are also excellent. Parking is terrible. You end up parking on the side of the road and you have a steep hike up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckBrooks
50,Great place for a moonrise picnic,I can't speak to the actual observatory because I've never been!! But what I can tell you is that this is a gorgeous place to see the lights of Los Angeles - skip the sunset crowds and go after dark (but not too late because the close the gates at 930 I think) - being a picnic and enjoy the view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debc619
40,Great view of LA,We arrived at the Observatory at 5pm on a very hot Tuesday. The parking situation was quite ok - plenty of free spots within a 500m walking distance. The inside of the Observatory was crowded but what was exhibited was not really interesting. I guess its the breathtaking view of LA that attracts people to come here. We will come back to experience a sunset and experience a bird's eye view of LA at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krummi1978
40,Very Cool!,We went to the observatory in the early morning and didn't go inside because it wasn't opened yet but the building is very cool with great views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648elisem
50,Views and history,"This is always on the agenda for anyone visiting LA. The panoramic views of the city, Hollywood sign, and the building itself is something to see. The history and astronomy lesson within the building is fun and interesting no matter the age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napakettu7
40,Cool spot,"Great overlook, horrible crowds. The exhibits were pretty cool. Mainly here to take pictures of LA. Excellent views of the Hollywood sign, and makes for good sunset shots. Would be arrange to see after dark. The observatory apparently lets people use the telescope but good luck getting through that line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720jaredm
50,Great views! Go early,"Definately worth the time! Go early to beat the crowds on the weekend ( take water, especially if you want to side-hike) ""Opens"" at 10 like everything else around LA, but go 30 mins earlier to see the sights before the observatory is open.Goto the planetarium show, interesting content, but its very hard not to nap in the comfortable seats!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scojac
50,Amazing sunset,"Like half of the tourists in LA, I went there for sunset. (Related tip, I highly recommend you get there a good hour and a half before sunset if you want to park close-ish to the observatory) The view is amazing! The observatory itself is also very nice for anyone curious about outer space, astronomy and such. The explanations are very accessible, including for children, and the personal there seem really passionated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamilde
50,Great place to visit while in Los Angeles,"We enjoyed visiting Griffith Observatory, particularly the views from the roof-top area near the telescope. You can see the Hollywood sign on the hill and much of the city of LA from there. Of course the price is right - free! And the exhibits and displays inside are very informative. Parking was an issue that probably cannot be rectified but having to walk a long way uphill to get there, on a warm day, wasn't real pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/281dalej
50,Entrance free and amazing displays,"Located on the top of a mountain, stunning view walking up already, got really surprised this was admission free. They also offered free telescope viewing starting at 7pm. Definitely worth going if sky and stars are your cup of cha :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneChenShen
40,Very Interesting,"While somewhat difficult to get to, you get the best views of LA, the Hollywood Sign, and great science exhibits. 7 year old enjoyed all of the planetary interactive activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMVpalms
50,Absolutely a must!!!,"We drove here at sunset and found ourselves going round the winding roads on the hills for what was a surreal experience, it felt like we were in some David Lynch film. as we reached midway we noticed alot of cars parked on the sides and decided to do the same and hike the rest of our way to the Observatory which is at the top of a hill.The hike was not very demanding it was pleasent and as it got darker it got colder but nothing that you cant manage. the area felt safe but there is this eeriness as knight falls.Once we reached the observatory you are presented with a beautiful vantage point to soak in Los Angeles ""the city of angels"", I'm so glad we did it at night it really added to the experience and the atmosphere was hypnotic.The observatory itself was lovely and you can purchase tickets for the planetarium whereby you are treated to a documentary on space, stars and historic developments in the field. I was very much in-tuned with the show and would recommend it to people who love the subject matter and who are generally curious about the sky and the stars.Overall, this was an unexpected highlight on our LA trip and if you;ve got a car I would wholeheartedly recommend an evening trip and stroll to the grifith Observatory. it can be an excellent activity to end a day out in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWanderrr
50,Griffith Observatory,Great view of The Hollywood sign and LA skyline! Plus it is free of cost. Also has tons of great exhibits inside the building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meyers96
30,"Good view of LA, unless you are an Astrology buff",Nice views. The picture shot of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Nothing much. You can also hitch on trails to the observatory. Thought will see giant telescopes. They are not really that huge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RohitM296
50,One of the best panoramic views in Los Angeles!,To walk around and enjoy the awesome views it's free. If you want to visit the Planetarium you will have to purchase a ticket but it is well worth it! AMAZING experience overall! This is a MUST see if you are in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837manuelv
40,Nice view of LA,"Really nice view of LA, mostly there is a lot of smog so it isn't a very clear view all times. If you don't have a car, it will be hard to get up there. The observatory is a really nice building and there will be a lot of nice fotos! It is also nice to get there at sunset or when it is dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickylito
40,Great haven in a city,"This is a great place in Griffith Park. Without even going in, the location is great and cool. Inside there are free attractions and those you pay for depending on your interest. Great way to enjoy nature and the skies in the middle of a metropolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msa23_2000
40,Beautiful views of LA and the Hollywood sign,We didn't have as much time to spend here as I would have liked. The pictures and views of the Hollywood sign are some fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATrusty
50,Worth seeing!,"We took an Uber to make our way up there and it was free admission. The view is unbelievable and you can see the Hollywood sign quite clearly from a distance. It's definitely worth going to appreciate a beautiful view of LA. Inside the Observatory is insightful and would recommend putting this on your to-do list when visiting LA.There is also free WIFI for anyone who is restricted in data roaming, and it was easy to arrange another Uber to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annamN7359PN
50,Cool Place,My cousin and I went at night. We were looking for something free to do. It was worth it for the views alone. It's a beautiful place and there are educational benefits. You can't beat that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eileens700
50,Beautiful views of LA,"I am so surprised something like this is still free! What a gem. The observatory is always crowded, so expect to park far and walk up. Bring lots of water, and a camera that has a good zoom lens (so that you can shoot the hollywood sign). The observatory is very peaceful... there is a silence that lingers at the top. There's also a cafe if you are hungry/thirsty that offers a great view of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorg287
50,Spectacular views and educational experience all in one,Spent an hour here on a day tour and it was very educational as well as a great stop to see expansive views and the Hollywood Sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454tammyt
50,Great Views,"Great views of the Hollywood sign and downtown Los Angeles from here. Also hiking trails from the observatory to the Hollywood sign. The observatory also has many educational exhibits inside, and many movies and TV shows have filmed scenes here, so also some history here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMB-001
50,Great place for the views and sunset,"You can easily spend a few hours just in the observatory but we came for the views, just before sunset. Be prepared if you arrive before sunset, parking is very hard to find. Would advise to plan ahead and arrive a few hours earlier or believe in your luck.You have to visit the observatory when you are in LA, the views are great day and night. Also we saw many people hiking so I guess you can easily spend a day here if you are into hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glemmy87
40,Pretty Awesome.,"A great place to learn! Griffth Observatory is an observatory, planetarium, and astronomy educational museum in Cali. You get a great view of the city and the Hollywood sign too. One of the Terminator franchise was shot at Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timmylai
30,Good view of the city,This place offers some of the best views of the city. The Hollywood Sign is far away and there are better places to view the sign. The museum is informative but I would rather do something more fun on a trip than spend hours inside. Parking is difficult. The board says parking full even when parking slots are available. Always be sure to drive up and check instead of parking on the sides of the road leading to the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakshubkn
50,Breathtaking views of the city,"For people visiting Los Angeles this a must see sight. There are many overlooks to see the city. You can see downtown LA, Hollywood, the Hollywood sign and all other areas of Los Angeles. It is especially beautiful at dusk when we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acejosh11
40,Great Hollywood sign views,"Great place to go see the view of LA as well as the Hollywood sign, go early (before opening time is 10am) to secure a car park otherwise you will have to trek up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthah635
50,Most Awesome!,"Griffith Observatory is a must-do for any science enthusiast. We only visited for about 30 minutes so were not able to go in the planetarium shows, but we did walk around the outside and inside which is all free. You can see the Hollywood sign but the day's haze will control how clearly. Cool views of downtown L.A. are there, too. The HUGE downside is the parking--HORRIBLE! There are only about 30 spots up at the observatory and it is a free-for-all up and down the very steep mountain drive. Everyone is in a hurry and honking and rude trying to grab spots. We had given up trying and were on our way down the mountain when a spot opened up. When we returned, the car parked in front of us had gotten hit all the way down there driver's side by a hit-and-run. :( Drivers beware!! (The coolest thing in the observatory is a periodic table which includes some of each element when possible. So cool!!!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fepeaux
50,Great view of the city and great for astronomy buffs,We spent only a short time here while on tour in Los Angeles but could easily have spent the whole day. Lots to see for lovers of astronomy. Bonus is that it has a great view of the city including the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77adelinap
40,Nice view of hollywood sign,"If you want a nice pic this is a very good spot...dont need to get inside of the observatory, park at the top or anywhere ypu can. If you go at sunset time you must have a professional camera otherwise choose to go in the morning or before gets dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafamar
50,Amazing,This stop was well worth The effort Of finding a parking space At sunset!! The views are Amazing and you can't get a better sunset in LA then this! Crowded but totally worth IT! Educational for kids! Loved IT!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaSjogren
50,Great staff.,"After walking up we had an hour to kill as doesn't open till 10 on a Sunday but we enjoyed our time taking in the sights of the city & Hollywood sign. The cafe& gift shop were average & over priced but the cinema was amazing! The narrator had the most amazing voice I've ever heard which really added to the amazing experience of the dome screen above us taking us through the Galaxy. The museum itself was very interesting too, great way to spend a few hours, we took an alternative walk downhill past done amazing housing estate, look around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gurnico
50,Awesome learning experience!!!,"The view from up there makes you see just how big this city is! Also, the museum underneath is really instructive and pretty big for the place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparkrai
40,Amazing views of LA,Unbelievable views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign with plenty of photo opportunities. Worth the taxi ride up the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheAdventuresOfMike
50,A Must Visit,This is one of the best points to see the LA city from her mountains. You can visit the observatory either by the trail or you can go up to the hill by car either way is very interesting and you see a lot of nature on the way up. This place has amazing views and going into the observatory and know a little bit about how his history is something very interesting. Make sure you bring something to drink or you can buy there because it can turns very hot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrat480
50,View from the top of LA,"Whether you live in Los Angeles county or are visiting from afar, the Griffith Observatory is worth a visit and another visit and another. Any time of the day or evening, the view from the Observatory and view of the HOLLYWOOD sign is fantastic. The film is worth viewing as well. I highly recommend this attraction.Sometimes, parking is quite difficult, but walking up the hill is good exercise. For the handicapped, parking is available near the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878beverlyn
50,Must in LA,Go there around sundown and watch the spectacular view of the sunset as the city becomes bright and sparkling. Magnificent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_Wolf_Bek
50,Awesome view of Hollywood!,"This is one of the places which offers you an awesome view of the Hollywood sign that you keep watching in the movies. In addition to that, it is a VERY INFORMATIVE place to be. This visit, had I had a chance, I would have planned a whole day in here. Definitely going back there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metahuman
50,Best place to see LA sunsets,Walked up to the Observatory on my first night in LA. It's a great hike at dusk and the views all the way up are fantastic. Watching the sunset from the Observatory itself is AMAZING and a little surreal. The Observatory inside has loads of informative space exhibits which you could definitely explore for a good few hours. Also definitely queue up to have a look through the telescope-- really novel experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/n_ttd
50,must visit,I loved it. Informative. My 10 year old granddaughter enjoyed it also. The views are awesome. Very busy. The planetarium show was good. Well worth the $7. Take a short hike afterwards and take pics beyond the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pr0ject0ne
50,Griffith Observatory at Sunset,We drove up (and hiked a bit) to the Griffith Observatory. We went at Sunset and the view was spectacular. We could see the lights of LA and Hollywood come on and twinkle as the darkness fell. We could also see the 'Hollywood Sign' up on the mountain to to other direction. It was visible even in the low light of a fantastic sunset. Lots to see and experience inside the Griffith Observatory. Great for all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142yvonnem
50,Neat place,"Unfortunately it was not very clear out so our visibility wasn't real great. Upon entering we were forced to park a long way away and told that the upper lot was full. While we were walking up the lot there were tons of places open for parking. When we got to the top, there were all kinds of open parking places.I imagine it's very beautiful up there on a clear day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snyderfamily1994
40,great LA view,Great place to view LA and the famous HOLYWOOD sign. Also great place to visit. The way to the observatory is via nice streets with fab houses and beautiful colourful trees :) probably occupied by famous people.

50,An overview of Los Angeles City and the universe.,"Beautiful view of Los Angeles in the early evening to night. A very excellent presentation of the 8 + 1 planets in the solar system. Free entrance, except for the 360 degree movie.Also to be appreciated, the world's first public telescope.Just a note: Parking could be very challenging. Parking near the shuttle bus that departs from the base might be a better option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246valentinek

50,excellent,"Must see if interested in the planets etc. The planitarium is great charges reasonable they do adult, seniors, student prices. Very informative . Outside biews of the Hollywood sign, the whole of the city is dpectacular if the smog isnt there. Parking at a premium at the top so you end up parking on the hilly areas on the way up be prepared for a hike! Theres restrooms and a cafe up there too a lovely day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffd929
40,a must go for the LA first timer,"An amazing observatory atop the hills surrounding LA. You can see the Hollywood sign easily enough (little small for a tourist pic).

50,"Views, Smells, and Excitement","Locals and tourists enjoy Griffith Observatory alike, with the great views on the outside, and the fun and excited atmosphere on the inside.

Watch out of the parking situation too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gus_Lindholm
50,Great place to see and learn,"The park outside offers great views of Los Angeles, Hollywood and on a clear day the Pacific Ocean. Inside, the Observatory also offers great views of Space.

50,Absolutely beautiful views of LA,"Such a wonderful experience at the Griffith Observatory. I'd never been before. Only an $11 Uber ride from Sunset Strip. The greatest views of LA and absolutely free. Also amazing walking trails right behind the Hollywood sign. For $5-10, you can't miss the Planetarium show. I had such a great time, it's a must-see destination in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annaaltheide
40,Great view of LA and HOLLYWOOD sign!,"This is a wonderful place to learn about astronomy. The entrance contains a device that ""proves"" the earth moves on an axis through a large pendulum. It is VERY cool. The views from around it are outstanding. We went on an overcast day which I would NOT recommend but we were still able to see the 'HOLLYWOOD' sign. There is not much parking so plan on walking a bit. The Leonard Nimoy exhibit is fantastic for budding astronomers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaspahl
40,"Pretty, Pretty, Pretty","The Griffith Observatory is near the very top of Griffith Park. The view from there on a clear day is wonderful. You can walk around and look through the little machines to get a better view--I am sorry, but the name of those things escapes me.Call ahead and make sure the Observatory is open. On some nights they have light shows and on some days they have interesting talks and shows.Parking is free, but a bear. It is a hike to get to the Observatory. But the drive up is lovely and take a different way back, there are lovely homes to see and it is relaxing.Make sure all valuables are locked in your trunk. The area is patrolled but don't leave your phone or camera on the seat of your car.Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

40,The long walk,"Griffith park is awesome. Fantastic hiking trails, amazing views and the observatory is awesome (although shut on a Monday which us and a million others hadn't realised).Only moans are the general lack of signposts on the hiking trails ( we got so lost) and the addition of some water supplies dotted around the place would be great.Go here , it's great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gibbo1969
50,this is about the brilliance of earth phenomenons.,"I would certainly suggest visiting the Griffith Observatory, especially with mature children. The interactive presentation of our Earth's involvement and presentation is affirmed by the observatory's surrounding grounds that has a multitude of paths that meander throughout the hill. Parking is along the ascending hill to the observatory. Use a GPS devise to track your proximity to the destination to assist your street parking selection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525jenningsm
30,Amazing views but chaotic car park,"We arrived at the Griffith Observatory to be confronted with a mass of cars all fighting for the very few spaces available. It was total chaos, people shouting and getting angry.Once we found a space, it was nice to wonder around taking some great photos. Good opportunity to get a decent photo of the Hollywood sign too. Worth a visit but avoid the busy times as it wasn't pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rich210uk

40,Closed on Monday.,"Was a beautiful view but that's about all we were able to see. Parking is horrendous so be prepared to walk uphill. Not open on Mondays and of course, that's when we arrived.

40,LA panorama,"Beautiful drive up to the observatory, free parking on the top of the hill. If you are not interested in visiting the observatory itself or miss the opening hours, you can just walk around the building and see the LA panorama, depending on weather and visibility. You'll see how spread out LA is. Take a different route down to drive through the deluxe houses scattered along the hillsides and check out the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/articok
50,"History, Present, Future, Science","One of the most amazing places in Los Angeles. Take your time to explore the free area inside the Observatory. Awesome view to Los Angeles area outside.

50,Great views of the LA Basin,"Fantastic views of the LA basin in all directions. The Observatory and Museum have many interesting exhibits and everything is FREE of admission.

40,View was slightly blocked by clouds or pollution,"Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and parking was a bit of a challenge. We parked on the streets and it took about 10 minutes to reach the Centre by foot from our car. View was pleasant although there was a lot of haze. Not sure if this was from pollution or clouds. We didn't stay too long, just enough to enjoy the views and had a quick walk through the ground floor. It was pleasant. Tip: arrive earlier for good parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmeraldDee
50,Exceeded my expectations,We met in Griffith park and hiked up to the observatory. There was an excellent coffee shop at the bottom before we hiked up. It was an amazing hike. Easy but steep. At the observatory we were treated not only to extraordinary views but to amazing exhibits. Visiting the observatory is a must on your itinerary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HCottrell2

40,Sunset,"Went up there to see the Hollywood sign and the sunset. Very busy with cars. I would advise parking further down the hill, facing down hill. A walk down hill is better than sitting in a traffic jam. Lovely view and of course iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/369greigb
50,Great view,This classic place has great views all over LA. It's a place that has served in loads of movies like Rebel without a cause and many others. It's been restored in a beautiful way. Good place try and understand the logistics of LA. Nice drive back to West-Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolffman1973
50,If you're not into science - go for the amazing views!,"Let's set aside the shows they have and the exhibitions (I had a heat stroke by the time I got there so I couldn't really enjoy those I'm afraid - the Tesla show was cool though!), the observatory has the most amazing views of LA ever. Just make sure there isn't a show at the Greek when you go, as traffic would be hell.Also, check out their website for all the fun free activities they have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NameisAlreadyTaken02

50,Great views at the Griffith Observatory!,"I visited the Griffith Observatory as a solo traveler and found it lovely. Great views of the city, mountains, and Hollywood sign. The observatory itself I found very majestic and the museum was educational and quite enjoyable, especially for those interested in astronomy. Great spot to rest on the grass and read too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacjohnson869
30,Great Views of LA,"This was all about the views for me, had a quick look inside and had some food at the cafe, nothing stood out too much. But went back outside and watched the sunset over LA and the view is incredible - definitely worth arranging to visit late afternoon to catch daytime and evening views.Caught the Observatory Shuttle from Vermont/Sunset station, 50 cents each way at weekends, much better than trying to park, runs every 20mins and it drops you right at the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katien225
30,Not that impressed,This location doesn't allow a very close look at the Hollywood sign. Parking was a nightmare and park rangers are quick to ticket anyone not perfectly parked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracO5470UY
10,"Avoid -- Horrible Overcrowding, Mismanagement","I really fail to see what the hype is about. There is a small museum (really just 2-3 rooms) with a very basic exhibit on the solar system and space. The main attraction, as far as I can see, is a nice lookout point with views of LA. But lots of other places have nice views, so why people think this one is so special is really beyond me.To get to those nice views, moreover, at most other places, you don't have to ensure the horrible overcrowding, gridlock, and poor management that this place entails. On he way up, there is horrible traffic as far as the eye can see -- and when you finally get up top, you see it's because the three traffic guards are standing off to the side joking with one another and doing nothing to actually manage the traffic flow.The only thing they did do was prevent people from dropping off passengers anywhere near the observatory. Instead you have to go to remote parking lots that are about a 20-minute walk from where you need to be. Once you finally arrive, there are even more long lines. There is only one person selling tickets so there's an incredibly long line of people trying to get tickets to the planetary show. Then there's only one ticket machine, which also has (you guessed it) an interminably long line.I looked around but failed to see the appeal so I left rather quickly. Getting out of this mess is even more difficult than getting in. There's little cell reception so you can't call an Uber or Lyft. If you didn't park at the remote parking stands, you'll basically have to walk 45 minutes to the bottom of the little mountain this is on, in order to reach civilization and end the debacle.This place is tons of hassle for very little payoff. Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjhughes3
40,It's very good,Go on a nice day and be prepared to walk up hill - good interactive information posts throughout the observatory . You can the Hollywood sign from there too .......We got a taxi from Glendale and it cost $30 but take a number for a return journey -,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5641JEsusanr
40,Great Views,"The observatory itself is beautiful. The location is perfect for checking out the skyline, scenery and of course the Hollywood sign.The parking situation at night is crazy, which wasn't entirely unexpected. We had to park on an adjacent street and the walk was significant. My 19 year old son and I are both very fit people, but I was wondering how an out of shape person would handle that walk because it was pretty steep and lengthy. If I were out of shape, I'd probably get halfway up and just turn back. (seriously)They had telescopes on the lawn to view the sun and Jupiter. My son really enjoyed that because he's into astronomy and has never seen Jupiter in that much detail. The gentleman on the rooftop telescope was very informative and passionate about astronomy so it was cool listening to him talk while we waited our turn.The exhibits were interesting and informative. We had a great time and will probably come back again next time we're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kallijo001
30,Crowded,"It was so crazy busy when we tried to go that the lot was full and we would have had to park half way down the mountain and walk up. We opted not to, which was a disappointment as we were really looking forward to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherG773
50,MUST visit,"Its a must visit for everyone. There is a lot to learn if you are interested in astronomy, the view of the city is sublime on one side and the Hollywood sign on other side. Entree is free but the place is maintained very well. Its a wonderful place for tracking as well!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harjotsingh87
50,Fantastic,"What a fantastic place! If you're a star gazer this place is like heaven and even if you're not...this place is pretty cool.Great views of LA...it wasn't a very clear day over LA when I went but even so the views were quite spectacular.Of course you get to see the famous ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign but before you start snapping away on your phone/ camera as soon as you see it...walk up a little and you'll get a better view.There's lots to learn about here at the observatory and it's free. Make a donation to keep this place going...it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenj102

50,First rate experience,"Built by a philanthropist, the Observatory is free to enter although it doesn't open until 12 noon, so no point arriving too early. Possibly a good thing in Los Angeles traffic!The exhibits are excellently presented with static, interactive and film all available. Plenty to see and do for the afternoon, but if you finish early, there are trails to follow in the hills for some fresh air. I found the on site cafe good value too. All of the staff to whom I spoke were very polite and helpful, not sure if they were volunteers or not, but well done to them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGF03
50,Must visit for great LA views,This is a great place for everyone. Great LA views are for everyone. If you have a science background or are a student you will enjoy the observatory even more. Late evening / night trip is advised.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdityaSP
50,One of the highlights of my US road trip,"This place is just awesome. The grounds are perfectly kept, the views of the city are sublime and the science demonstrations are fascinating (and easy to understand). I visited here twice during my stay, one in the day and one for sunset. I recommend coming here when the weather is a little cooler, as the heat is very intense during the day, especially if you want to do some hiking. I highly recommend staying until after dark and looking through the telescopes (they focused on the moon when I went). Plus, LA looks incredible lit up at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackLFC05
50,Great place and great view!,"This is such a great place to hang around and look at the LA skyline and the Hollywood sign. Also, a place to brush up on your astronomy! There is a cafe for you to stay at should you get tired or hungry, and there are some shows worth watching. Be sure to come and visit early as the late morning and afternoons can be really crowded and parking would be extremely difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArtSax

30,Needs better parking options,"Granted, it was Memorial Day Weekend, but we tried to do this twice. Our GPS took us via Vermont entrance on our first attempt Saturday late in the afternoon. We got stuck in a traffic jam of people going to The Greek Theatre for a concert and finally turned around. (Note to those of us not from LA: read the Griffin Observatory website section ""Getting Here"" in detail. Looking at it post-trip it does reference how concerts at The Greek Theatre may affect your trip and provides a link to a schedule of concerts.) Sunday morning was not a success either; we tried the Fern Dell entrance but there were cars parked everywhere on the road, people everywhere, and no parking to be found. Finally gave up. Would have been happy to park down in a parking lot further down Mount Hollywood and take a shuttle up there if that was an option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Audrey

30,Good for grade school level understanding of astronomy,"Went on Memorial Day weekend and was extremely crowded, making parking difficult and overall enjoyment hard. Does have great views of LA area and Hollywood sign, but overall was disappointed. Information displayed was very general and did not talk to some of the discoveries made by the Observatory when it was functioning. As adults, the information was too low level, but would be good intro for grad school level kids with an interest in astronomy. Park surrounding the center is also a great place to escape and picnic. We did the movie presentation which was a nice break from the crowds, but quickly left afterwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247wendyn

The observatory is an outstanding experience: an amazingly beautiful (recently renovated) building; interesting displays; a first-rate planetarium show; great views of the LA basin, the Hollywood Sign, and the surrounding mountains and valleys; and Griffith Park itself. This is as close to a must-visit in LA as you can get. Try to come at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimlockard
50,"beautiful view, I enjoyed the history","I am not always a fan of art galleries. I went to the Griffith because it is close by and I have never been. I was pleasantly surprised. The grounds and view are worth it alone. Some of the famous artists were spectacular, while others, I just don't understand why they are so famous vs some of the lesser known artists. It was fun to see them all. The real treasure for me was the antique furniture, chandeliers, books, etc. The history was my favorite part and what would bring me back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197kellye

It was still pretty busy at 9pm and people were even having wedding photos taken, which I thought was a bit bizarre but whatever floats your boat I suppose. Free to visit if you are just taking in the views, not sure if they charge to go inside as we didn't get that far.

However, that is not all there is to see here and do on the top of this wonderful hill in Griffith Park.There is a planetarium with at least two shows a day, the cafeteria with food for people of all ages, a wonderful gift shop, a walk through time and space leading down to the Leonard Nimoy Science Center, and at night telescopes on the roof and sometimes out on the lawn. The scientists who are here to answer your questions do so with ease. They are most gracious and helpful.There is a moonscape, life on all of the planets, and a sculpture of Einstein which you can sit on and also take a photo of your kids sitting on him.Plan to spend the better part of your day and/or evening here.

40,Great views,Try and plan this on a clear day. We went at night it is was pretty hazy and we couldn't see a lot. But still very cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33Jess33
50,Stunning view,We really enjoyed the view and of course the bulding.. i just remind the movie Charls Angel2 and had to laugh because I never though i ll be once there. I recommend to go and visit it. You can see the Hollywood sign from far away. Its plenty of things inside. We are happy we could make it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90vivianar
50,Nice place to visit,"Educational & interesting place to visit. There is a big telescope to see the stars,etc.Nice for family outing and walking around in a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/om6114
30,Not what I expect,"Honestly I like the place it's perfect for a walk but all lose the sense when the attraction is to take a photo of the ""Hollywood"" sign that it's far away, but try to see the pendulum inside the observatory , in general it's a touristic point of the city!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609magdalenae
50,"HOLLYWOOD Sign, Panoramic L.A.Views and Brilliant Sunsets","Iconic white-domed Griffith Observatory draws me back to revisit when we’re in L.A. I would visit every time we're in L.A. if time allowed. The mammoth museum, decks, and exhibits are free. But, I would pay for these fascinating educational experiences. Underground, the interactive exhibits get even better. Everyone, adults, kids, couples are mesmerized by these extraordinary planetary exhibits. There is so much more to see and explore on every trip. For those with the time and a little extra money, watch the awesome show in the planetarium. This is a highlight of any visit.For us, once in the park we like the scenery driving and winding up to and around the hills to get to the observatory. Parking can be frustrating, so plan your visit early in the day or earlier at least 2-3 hours before sunset. Views (and photos) of the HOLLYWOOD sign are amazingly close and the views of L.A. at dusk and the sun setting over the ocean are breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
50,Griffith Observatory is in a class by itself - MUST SEE,"Griffith Observatory is in a class by itself this must see attraction is rich in its history yet cutting edge. This free (with the exception of the movies) Observatory has so much to see and do. We arrived around noon and had to park a bit away from the observatory. The walk up to the observatory is uphill so wear the appropriate footwear, if you have to park a bit further away you will be thankful!On my visit there were staff members giving mini lectures in the Gunther Depths of Space area about ""The Big Picture"" this lecture was helpful in understanding the tremendous undertaking in learning more about our galaxy by studying other galaxies. There is a statue of Einstein seated on a bench in this area - we took a couple of photos here before moving on to the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater and learning the history of Griffith Observatory and it's amazing founder Griffith J. Griffith and his philanthropy. If you have a chance to see this free movie please do so - it will certainly make you appreciate this Observatory even more.The Wilder Hall of the Eye and Ahmanson Hall of the Sky Exhibits - informative and eye catching engaging exhibits and displays kept us entertained. While we were visiting a staff member operated the Tesla Coil and that was NEAT. I wish I would have known this demonstration were occurring ahead of time I just happened to be in the area but would have loved to get a better view. Fortunately, kind strangers let my elementary aged child ahead of them so he could see the demonstration. If you plan to visit perhaps ask a staff member if they will turn the Tesla Coil on for a live demonstration and when:)The outside of the Observatory has an Astronomers Monument and a sun dial along with the solar system lawn model and the rooftop terrace of course offers stunning views of Los Angeles to include the iconic Hollywood sign. The actual Zeiss telescope is only open at night when the sky is clear. You can view it but the room remains locked until it is operable and open for public viewing.My family loved this outing and we will be back again, and again anytime we are in the area. Next time we plan to come at night to look through the incredible telescope that started it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickS2K
50,You gotta' see this,"The Griffith Observatory is on every ""must see"" list I have seen. And for good reason.The views are spectacular. You can see the Hollywood sign on one side the LA skyline on another. Just walk around the perimeter and enjoy the view.After that, do go inside for the exhibits and shows. I highly recommend the space show but don't go if you are sleepy. The chairs are sooo comfortable and the speaker may sound a bit soothing if you missed a few hours sleep the night before. Please don't ask me why I suggest that. It's too embarrassing.After the Observatory, do take time to explore the park. It has some wonderful history so get a guide book and drive around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donsC6831FZ
30,It was a pleasant surprise!,While on the hunt for the Hollywood sign we had no idea that it would lead us to the Griffith Observatory. What a pleasant surprise!Wish we had taken a lunch so we could have stayed longer and enjoyed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JELiaso

50,Best free day in LA,"In the ultra costly LA area, there are very few things that you can do for free. This is one of the very best. We took our young daughter with us and had hours of fun exploring all of the hands on science experiments. If you are going to catch a planetarium show and have kids, take a look at the website for which show times are kid friendly. Drive on up and check it out, you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/147tjj

You're in for a lovely time at the Griffith Observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynS943

50,Outstanding views over LA,"Very high up in the Hollywood Hills sits this oasis of science and astronomy. Fascinating and beautiful at the same time. Although there was a slight haze it did not detract from the view. The Hollywood Sign is very clear from up here. There is a cafe with food by Wolfgang Puck and a gift shop. Highly recommended, parking can be a challenge but there is plenty on the approach roads. Note the further down you park the climb will do wonders for any exercise regime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redcetera

40,Wonderful View of the Hollywood Sign,"If you've never been to Los Angeles, you need to visit the Griffith Observatory. Watch a show in the Planetarium, visit the exhibits, and then head outside. You can get amazing views of both the Hollywood sign and the valley below. I recommend going in the afternoon so you can be there for sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeFeeny
50,Amazing Views A Must Do !,"The Observatory located in Griffith Park. Is accessible by car but with limited parking. On Saturday and Sunday they have a free shuttle bus LADOT which you can get from Vermont and Sunset Metro station; cost 50cents each way and takes about 20-30 minutes. Once there you can take the steps up to the Observatory where you are greeted with spectacular views of the Hollywood Sign and downtown Los Angeles.Inside the Observatory (free, except for show) you can explore the exhibits of our solar system. Look though telescopes.There are many great nearby walking tails with breathtaking views. I hiked Mount Hollywood, with great fantastic views. If you decide to hike the trails make sure you have good shoes, take water and stay on trail.Would highly recommended and differently would return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catOntario
50,Crowded Memorial Day weekend,"We were in town for business over Memorial Day weekend and decided to check out Griffith park on Sunday.

50,Must see on any Los Angles Visit,"Super visit, but must/should make reservations to planitarium. Best of the best I have visited in my lifetime. And we had one both in High School and College. Narration and presentation is epic. Location of Griffith Obervatory is nested in the hills of LA and presents great hiking opportunities and interesting and engaging display. Some can be busy but others are easy. The Tesla exibit so intrigued my son that his nickname has become Tesla Josh and permenently changed his look on science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vigusfp

50,"Epic views, not too busy in the morning",A great drive up with some epic views. Started to get a little crowded by the time we left at 1100. There are a bunch of Hummingbirds that zip around in front of it in May which was a nice surprise. View of the Hollywood sign is a tiny bit skewed but view of the city is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gipsymagie
50,A delightful visit in all respects,"Beautiful views, beautiful observatory. Just make sure you go when they're open unless you just want to see the views. Can get extremely crowded in season, though there is plenty of parking if you're willing to walk up the hill a ways. Lots of hiking trails, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLVAGUY
50,A must visit in LA,It's a nice place to go and chill for a few hours.

50,"Views, interesting tidbits and great walks","A must in Los Angeles and well-loved by locals. I've been here more times than I can count and simply love it.

Well worth the potential crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sotraveling
50,"If you live on a planet, you need to check out Griffith Observatory","After a half day at La Brea, our family made the drive up the hill to Griffith Observatory. I’ve been an astronomy buff since childhood, and this was the best space-related attraction I’ve been to, ever. This was a place that we could return to again and again, to be sure we experienced everything it had to offer. As it was, we saw quite a bit, and it was all very impressive.Just inside the front doors, we marveled for several minutes at the Foucault’s Pendulum after we had purchased tickets and admission to one of the planetarium shows. Downstairs, we spent over an hour in the lower hall with the great exhibits on all of our solar system’s planets, having fun with the scales at each one which displayed your weight on that planet.What was most impressive in that room, however, was the huge print of the world’s largest ever photograph, taken of a small slice of the night sky which when zoomed in revealed an astonishing array of thousands of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. It stretched the entire length and height of the room, over 100 by 30 feet, easily.Overlooking this area were some excellent exhibits on meteorites, and adjacent was the Leonard Nimoy Theatre, where we watched the late Star Trek actor narrate an informative film on the amazing restoration done on Griffith, including lifting the entire building to dig out the space underneath it to expand the exhibit space (including the very theatre we were sitting in).Probably the highlight of our visit to the observatory, however, was the planetarium show we attended. The technology was awesome, the visuals stunning, and the descriptions of what we were seeing by our host simply sublime. Her narration was full of emotion and wonder, and we made it a point to thank her for making the show so special.We ended our visit to Griffith Observatory with a walk along the perimeter, taking in the lights of Los Angeles spreading out before us like a huge grid of animated lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
40,YOU MUST GO,"Why? Because it is free (most part), nice, enriched, can see the Hollywood sign and will not take all your day.Try go earlier as possible, some times is hard to find a parking. But, if it happens, take a time and waiting for some one leaving the parking. A great way to start your day at LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabio-Cipolla

50,An Excellent Attraction,We spent a very pleasant 4 hours at the Griffith Observatory and could have easily spent more but as it was our last day we couldn't afford the time.This must be one of the best free attractions in Los Angeles as can be seen from the number of people attending especially the school students.All of the exhibits are great and very educational and the staff go out of their way to educate and illuminate what is on display. The Planetarium experience is one of the best I have seen and is well worth paying that little bit extra to see such a marvellous show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetsettingOzpatriot

50,Worth a visit.,We seemed to arrive on national tourist day. All the car parks were very busy. You can take a shuttle from the lower car parks and that may be the way to go if it is a nice day. Some impressive views and also impressive displays inside. Defiantly worth a trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliamanning2015
50,Excellent!,"The only place in LA which is free to go and alot to offer.

50,Everything is FREE. LA is lucky to have this facility!!,"We went here 2 or 3 times, we went in the day & saw the gorgeous view % went for a hike around the mountains. We also came on a very clear Sunday night we qued for 5 mins & looked through a 3 meter telescope then we qued for 1.5 hours and we SO lucky we were the last 20 people to get in to see the 5 meter telescope to look at Jupiter. Amazing fun and view of LA at night. Get there early to avoid disappointment we had to park far away which was fine because we were early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M7370GAstephanieb
50,Amazing! Awesome view,"Amazing! Even if you don't go inside the museum, you will still enjoy the view. Also, the observatory is free, only the shows cost money. However, be prepared for a long drive up to the observatory due to its popularity with all the visitors. We took über up and down instead of driving and it was great because we didn't have to worry about parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrilx

40,Top of the World,"We enjoyed the Griffith Observatory. Unfortunately due to time, we did not do the hike up to it, but having driven and found parking, we thoroughly enjoyed it. the exhibits were good and the views for photos were also great. I am now ready to read up more about planets, tides, equinoxes and all sorts of other things!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenwb
50,Fantastic views,I travel often for work an arrived in Los Angeles this past month. I have always been real out doorsy and was very disappointed when I took a taxi to Runyon canyon to find it was closed. Hotel staff where I was staying mentioned I should try Griffith Park and it blew Runyon away. Pleasant mistake,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snihalfuad
50,Must See at LA!,"Not inclined towards the scientific, we almost skipped it on our visit to LA! But reading the reviews here for the best view of the Hollywood Sign, we decided to give it a try. And so glad we did! It did have the best view of the Hollywood Sign and the best vistas of the city. And did not even have to venture inside the observatory - the scenic views, the air, the nature, even on a cloudy day of our visit - was just sheer enjoyment. One can even take the walking trails around. Definitely a must visit at LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desi2007
50,These views!!,I recently hiked the Hollywood mountain from the observatory. It's definitely a MUST when visiting LA but make sure you have suitable clothing! Trainers or hiking boots are a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamierising
50,Amazing!,We got an uber up to the top of the hill where we looked over the 'Hollywood' sign and had a wonder around the observatory. We happened upon a list of shows and as we were in no rush we booked our tickets. We were so impressed with the show - you sit in reclining chairs and watch as the domed roof becomes the night sky filled with millions of stars. The narrator of the show was amazing and should go into films! We then walked down the hill back to busy LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3019VTemilyw
50,The quintessential first stop on a tour of Los Angeles,"Try to avoid weekends or holidays if you are driving as you would have to park at least one mile away, and even if you take public transit the drive up will be slow. This is a beautiful place which has it all: A clear view of the Hollywood sign, a great view of the city from downtown to the ocean, a statue of James Dean, a nice little science museum and even screenings of futuristic movies on a large sky screen.The cafeteria is not up to par, they should build a pretty place worthy of this location. The gift shop is not bad. There are great hikes nearby and I highly recommend the hike up passing ""Berlin Forest"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DariusLA
50,Go on a sunny day and you will see!,"It will be busy but great view and photo place once you get there. Lots of parking on the top and around, it's all free parking.

50,The View Of LA,"Griffith Observatory was part of a tour we was on. The views over the Los Angeles are are absolutely outstanding. It gives you a real insight on how vast this area is.

Still it is worth the efforts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lala_Tink2008
40,Great city views!,"We drove ourselves up to Griffith Observatory. Parking was tricky, with heaps of cars and buses vying for parks up the top, but we got lucky with someone pulling out of a carpark just as we arrived. A short walk up to the top of the observatory gave us stunning views of LA city. The big telescope seems to only be open later in the evenings. Got a distant view of the 'Hollywood' sign, which we were happy with - would be quite a hike to walk up to it. I'm sure the city views would also be stunning at night when it is all lit up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriscU3808TP
50,Best attraction in LA,"We only stopped for a fleeting visit as part of a larger tour, however this was my highlights.

50,Multi-faceted experience,"Whether Art Deco architecture is your thing, or breathtaking views, or astronomy, the Griffith Observatory is a must-see.

50,Great place,"Parking is free but can be difficult. We parked quite the distance but enjoyed the walk/hike up to the observatory. Plenty of bathrooms inside and outside. Inside it was very nice, a lot of information to read and look it on all 3 different levels. The gift shop is very nice, got a lot of neat things to buy. The top balcony parts really gave you a great view of LA and the Hollywood sign.

I visited this place on weekends, the place was PACKED with cars and people, didnt get any parking space so went home after going round and round.The view is amazing though even from the car i can tell that it's a beautiful place.

40,A beautiful and informative space,"It is really worth the drive up to it. the information you are subjected to is amazing. One can also hang out there. Take your food and water with you though.

20,To infinity and bored?,"Is it sad to say that my main reason to come here is because I've drove to it on gta 5? I'm going to say no. I actually did the walk up to the Hollywood sign first then walked to observatory. I highly recommend you doing this as you feel like you accomplished something. The actual observatory was alright, nothing special..u pressed a few things inside, paid for an over priced sandwich and then walked back to LA. I'd give this two stars but I really enjoy the walk before and after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JordanUpton
30,Only visited the outside and at night,"I'm more of a do-er and not a see-er, so this attraction was just ok. I don't have appreciation for bright light cityscapes nor was I patient enough to wait in line to hear the astronomy or astrology lesson, so I did not get as much out of it as other visitors. This probably isn't a fair rating/review, but it does reflect my personal interests. I would suggest people read other reviews to get a better sense if this is something they would like to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eva_Hsu
50,stunning views.. very touristy,"another must see in LA. Great photo opportunities of the City, Hollywood sign and the hills. Try to go when its not so touristy as there can be bus loads of people there at certain times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chazzaguapa
50,beautiful view!,We drove up here just to have a look at the view. Parking was easy and the view was amazing!! We didn't go into the Observatory as it was closed but we still enjoyed the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cvg11
50,Wonderful,"Great views great walks, lovely way to see Los Angeles at night ( smog permitting ) a nice drive up to it and the observatory has a great and informative museum/learning centre, excellent for families, do take a coat because it gets cold later on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismE5291OE
40,Perfect view over LA and the Hollywood Sign,From the Griffith Observatory you have a beautiful view over LA and the Hollywood Sign. Make sure you go on a day it's not foggy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizaV26
50,Vistas,"Like many other reviewers have stated, the views of LA and the Heavens are spectacular. We went to Griffith on a very busy night (full moon, Mars and Jupiter very visible), however it was worth the drive up and the wait for the telescope. The gentleman running the telescope was very knowledgeable and answered many questions. The telescope is a 12"" refractory scope so not as big as we'd hoped however still a great experience for kids and novice astronomers. We also got there just as the sun was setting so it made for some great pics of the sunset and the Hollywood sign off in the distance. Also the LA lights go on forever. There are other activities at the observatory and unfortunately we didn't have time to visit all. We will have to come back another time. Don't forget to take a light jacket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y705YZbrians
50,Griffith Observatory where you can see the Hollywood sign,If your traveling to LA and have a car or going on a tour bus this is a place to see.It's has a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign from way up in the hills. You can go there to just walk around and have a look it's free and has free parking .You can also see all of the Hollywood walking trails. So if you love hiking take your work out clothes and go for it there are heaps of popular tracks to walk or ride bikes on if you take your own bike you can workout for hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahjustinwilkie
50,A must see in LA!,"This is an iconic location in LA. Take a photo with the Hollywood sign in the background. The planetarium show is worth seeing! It gets very crowded on the weekend. If you don't want to hike up the hill, then drive up to the top and wait for a parking spot to open up. We only waited 5 minutes for someone to leave. There is a nice café and gift shop as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridaNativeJan
40,"If you drive here, plan for the entire day.","The observatory is a treasure, but the parking is atrocious! We stopped there as a part of a tour so parking was not a problem for us, however I probably would have abandoned the trip up there once I saw how hard it was to find a parking spot. If you are going to make use of the whole park or most of it, then go. If you are only interested in the observatory, book a tour bus and visit it that way, as about 30 minutes is enough to take in the expansive views and the major points of interest in the observatory. You can also view the Hollywood sign from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberr14
40,What a view of the city!,"Griffith's observatory - Make it a point to visit this place when visiting LA. Free to enter but keep in mind that this attraction is almost always crowded. Very busy. So the downside to this is that you struggle to find parking. Once the parking lots are full , people tend to park along the road downhill and then walk from there. That apart, you are assured to have a good time , irrespective of whether you are geeky (lots of interesting science stuff , the pendulum activity is really fun to watch! ) or not. We visited around 4 pm in the winter. Spent some time outside viewing the Hollywood sign at a distance and taking in the views of the city. It was a beautiful sunset that day and we also got to see a proposal (very cute!). We went through all the slides inside the observatory and booked for a 30 min show - which was quite informative and engaging. All in all, it was a fun evening. Though this can be a rainy day activity, highly recommend a sunny clear day for visiting the observatory since you will have expansive views of the city from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vidya_Marpalli
50,amazing view!,My friends and I went up at night and the view of LA is amazing!!! You will not get a better view of it and the pendulum is pretty cool too! There is no celular service but there's a free wifi hotspot! I loved this place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cordelias220
40,Great views of the city!,"It has been a long time since visiting this icon building, but it was great having a chance to go again. Once at the top, take advantage of the great views all around the building, and the various terraces, especially if you go during the day or at sunset. The inside of the building has some great exhibits, but it is typically very crowded. We did not get to go into the Planetarium, but will try and return again soon. Parking is a tough, so plan ahead accordingly. Give yourself at least 1-hour there, but also time to hike up and down from the street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt
50,Unbelievable views and sites,We have visited LA many times but never took the time to visit the Griffith Observatory and I urge you to please not make the same mistake I have made too many times. This will be on our list every time. The views from the Observatory and then inside with the Planetarium and those views. This is a place you can visit during the day or at night and it will be spectacular. Don't make the same mistake I made make sure you visit and it is FREE.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryK126
30,Very busy,"The observatory is fine, but when we were there it was very busy. The parking lot was full so we had to park along the narrow road and walked up about a quarter of a mile maybe. Great place to photograph the Hollywood sign, though it was a little hazy the day we went",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patio77
40,Nice place,This is a very famous attaction of LA and it has a wonderful view of Los Angeles also. Good to spend some time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viviangom
50,On top of the Hollywood Hills,"Great Hiking, Great LA Views, and best place to get mesmerize with being in Hollywood! There are so many hiking trails that go off the beaten path and find yourself in the Valley!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/treborjacquez
40,Interesting,"Went here as part of our day tour, but had plenty of time to look around and admire the view over L.A",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianneKamerling
30,Great view shame about the fog!!,"It is well worth the drive up to the observatory if you are visiting LA and have a car. We went on sunset, which was great, but there was a bit of 'mist/fog' to obscure the view.It was busy!! Lots of cars parking on side of the road as you got to the observatory car park, so make your decision on whether to get out early or take your chances of getting a park in the carpark (we did and lucked out on a park)It would also be a great place to walk, jog or cycle up to if you had the chance (and fitness).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlieu44
50,Griffith Observatory,"This place is a very well situated observatory on top of a mountain, inside a very large park called Griffith Park. I spent days wondering around the park before getting to the observatory, but it was a day well spent. THe park has to be one of the most beautiful, and the Mediterrian like weather year around makes for perfect hiking. Be sure to take a backpack with water for hydration.The trails are well maintained, the wildlife varied with eucalyptus scent permeating all through the park. I have been told to use care in certain parts of the park, for there are warnings of rattle snakes, but I have not seen even one.To get to the observatory, drive to Western avenue and make a left on Ferndale street. This is an era with many movie star 's homes, an adventurous visitor may buy guides to hike by them.After entering Ferndale, where a bear statue can be used as a signpost-which was erected there as a signal of friendship to a sister city of L.A., drive to the end of this little street, to find a large parking place there. Your car can be parked there free of charge, from sun up to sun down.The hike up to the observatory takes about forty minutes to an hour, depending on your pace, and a backpack with bottle water is useful, although there is running water up on the top. A little cafe has snacks at reasonable prices, and the observatory has a small. fee to go through the various exhibits.Incidentally , a scene from a James Deaan movie was filmed there, and the area was used for many a film. Horses can be rented in stables in Burgank, however horses are not permitted near the Observatory. Certain nights has shows in it, usually laser shows with astrology as thems. These are usually worth a nominal admission price.We had a wonderful day in the park. Which features other attractions : the Los Angeles Zoo, Travel town- featuring old time trains, a Merry Go Round., and a RounRogers Museum. So the area is definitely worth re-visiting. There is also a mini train ride, a pony ride for small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamg36
40,A definite must see - best views of the city!,If you want the best views of the city and the Hollywood sign this stop is for you. The observatory is surrounded by hiking trails and nice gardens. Parking was ample and fun to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5092GFjessicab
50,A Must!,"A different perspective of Los Angeles, and a landmark. Parking is easy enough and you can go on a hike before going inside the Observatory. Very educational for older children (over 10) - and adults, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reba1970
40,Go at Night,"This is a great experience. We went at night and had a stunning view over LA. The exhibits here are really interesting, as are the guides. The Tesla Coil is cool! As is the pendulum. There is a nice atmosphere here in the evening as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EF982
50,Great View,"We hiked up to the Griffith Observatory, it was a breath taken view and we managed to take lots of great pictures........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissPankey
40,Breathtaking Night view,LA is breathtaking from Griffith all the more better combination after one visits Hollywood Blvd because its just a few minutes drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elma_D047
50,Under the stars,"I live in Ohio and haven't been to the observatory in over 10 years. I was amazed that I couldn't remember anything about this place. This observatory was amazing!! The best part was at night time, I couldn't believe how beautiful L.A. Can be. If you ever come to L.A. You definitely need to come to the observatory, it's a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustcallmeDee
50,Astronomy Museum,I liked the lens pointed at the sun. It has special filters and I was able to see a solar eruption. Nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7474id
50,So much to see and learn about.,A great place to go when you are in the LA area. This is also a free place to go. They also have many walking trails all around the mountain. The view is spectacular. Loved the giant pendelium that shows how our world rotates.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmssun50
50,The best view of the city,"Was a wonderful experience, the beautiful gardens, the excellent view, the observatory with a long information about the space and much more. Absolutely you have to visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelaTT
40,A Los Angeles landmark well worth the visit,The park is fantastic and offers plenty of trails. The observatory has some of the best views you can come across in Los Angeles and for the younger audience the exhibition has lots to offer. Parking can be a challenge at times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radius360la
40,"Explore the Entire Park, Pop in to the Observatory","The Griffith Observatory is beautiful, of course. The architecture, the views. However, it's not going to take much of your day. It's a beautiful stop for a picnic and to relax while you're hiking around the park or heading to the Hollywood Sign, but I wouldn't plan on making this the piece de resistance of your trip to Los Angeles or even Griffith.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chateaucrowley
50,So much fun,"Love this place. Go on a weekday and still be prepared to park down the road and walk up. It's free, it's beautiful, it's fun. Even if you don't get to look thru the telescope, the exhibits are cool. The hiking path near the observatory is beautiful and relatively easy. Interesting history of the park as well. Great refuge in the city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly1558
50,A must if you are in LA,"Very educational, with very nice exhibits so you should tour them all. Also, the place has the most breathtaking view of the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaMagdalena
50,Star Struck!!,"This is a must see if you visit Los Angeles, California. I learned so much about the universe, the history surrounding the observatory, including the observatory's architecture and so much more. It is a beautiful location, overlooking the Hollywood (sign) and Los Angeles areas. There are walking trails surrounding the observatory as well. It is just a beautiful location!! I have been twice in one month and will go back time and time again!! Great for any age!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debraw679
50,One of the truly legendary historical must see places in Los Angeles!,Whether it's Back to the Future or Transformers that drives you to this truly remarkable location it's worth every moment. This place has so much history and offers so many sights that it will be a place to remember and we are nearly talking about the exterior. It's practically free and fun for the whole family or as a romantic getaway. The view of the city of Los Angeles is second to none. Within you can stroll around or check out the museum or shows. Even as a local it's one place you can keep coming back too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmoz78
50,Visiting LA with kids - this is a MUST.,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the track up to the Griffith Observatory.As a lover of astronomy - this was really awesome. The views at the top of the mountain were stunning of LA. The Observatory itself has so much to offer - the education is enjoyable regardless of age. To learn so much about the weather, the tides, change of seasons, the elements, etc....... is so educational for all, yes I must admit I found it awesome! La piece de resistance - ""the Tesla Coil"". Specific times of the day they light up the coil. Everyone will want a photograph of this.I promise you your kids will all enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretD855
50,One of LA's best free activities!,"The GO is one of my favorite places to visit. I live here in LA and the GO is second only to the Getty Museum to the free sites to see and visit here. GO has numerous displays and things to see inside it and is an awesome way to learn about the universe, the solar system, stars, etc. The exterior grounds and surrounding area are also very enjoyable - plenty of clean, grassy areas to rest, relax, have a picnic, etc. The GO is sooo much more than an observatory or landmark - it's just an awesome place to visit and spend an afternoon or evening!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero
50,Great views! See all of LA and beyond!!!,Beautiful views to see all of the landscape of LA. 360 degree views!!! Walk right in and enjoy. Balconies all the way around the observatory. Bonus - good view of the Hollywood sign without the hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdreiling
50,Amazing view,"Being that I'm a native of Los Angeles I don't typically take advantage of anything I would deem an attraction. If you don't mind a short hike and a bit of a crowed then you're in for a treat. The observatory offers nice size courtyard for a picnic . There are also several space lovers and star gazers who bring their telescopes out for public use.My husband and I decided to have a "" date day "" I packed a small lunch some wine and enjoyed the view. We then purchase tickets to one of the shows. How about "" mind blowing"". We loved love our day and we'll definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111kaliak
50,"Astronomy, Architecture, and Amazing Views","Perched on the foothills of the mountain range above the Los Angeles Basin, Griffith Observatory is an art-deco architectural beauty. Though a nighttime visit may offer a glimpse of Saturn or Jupiter, its humble telescopes are limited by L.A.'s considerable glow below, but as an educational facility it is wonderful. It offers state of the art planetarium shows all day long, a Foucault Pendulum, and a slew of exhibits and interactive demonstrations. Set on park-like grounds, it offers unparalleled views of Los Angeles, including the Hollywood sign! Los Angeles at night is truly a magical view, and the observatory is the place to see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimayerson
40,Reach For The Sky,"Great place for a fun way to learn about Astronomy, and its also located along really cool hiking trails in Griffith Park. Great city and park views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanyikasooalo
50,A must for astronomy-lovers and fun for everyone.,I don't know anywhere else that you can experience so much about astronomy and also be able to start hiking a trail straight out of the building. Also a great place for a aerial view of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Signmanpro
40,Nice view and a nice walk,"We walked there and it's a nice thing to do when it's not too hot. The view over the city is spectacular. For those who are interested, you can also see the hollywood sign from the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prahier
40,A must visit place in LA,"I've been here 15 years ago in the daylight and was here in the night for my most recent trip. I highly recommend going to this place at night as you will enjoy a more breathtaking view of LA's lights! This is an active observatory and you can look through their telescope, at the time of my visit they were directed to see the Jupiter and its moons! Certainly a good activity to go with small kids for astronomy, but my groups are all in the 20s and they all enjoy going to this place. This is a MUST visit place in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duohungryhippos
50,Very nice,Very nice place to go and understand more about our universe and history. strong suggest you go to planetarium and see one of their presentation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895guilhermec
40,Become one with the universe,Griffith Observatory is a educational way to spend some quality time. Great place to take children or grandchildren. Tour the place is fascinating but the show in the planetarium is not to be messed. Get painlessly educated on the stars and the universe in great presentation done by knowledgeable experts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801alw
50,More than just an observatory,"You can see a lot of LA from this place. You have a nice view of the Hollywood sign too. But, honestly, the best part about this observatory is the park that it is located it. If you like hiking/walking, the trail up to the observatory via road or walking trail as great. Park near the bottom and walk up. Start in the morning when it is nice an cool and make you way up. It took me about 45 minutes from the Greek Theater area.Now, back to the observatory. You can go up to the roof for an even better view of LA. the observatory inside has some interesting things to see. If you are interested in the galaxy and stars, this will have some stuff for you. Free parking available near the observatory. But, I saw a lot of people park along the roads all the way to the top too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ishm_13
50,My fave,"Came here on my first trip in Los Angeles and fell in love. The trails and views of the city are amazing. Their are very interesting exhibits within the building as well. Mostly about the stars, planets and outer space. We also saw a great 20min show in the planetarium. I went during the day and loved it. I was told its even better at night. Completely amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneA246
40,Wonderful trails & views,"Bring your walking shoes. You can go for miles. From the Observatory, the views of L.A. are definitely worth the climb to the top. I wanted to continue onto the Autry Museum along the main roads, thinking there would be public transport but I ended up walking the entire way, which took well over an hour. Again, well worth the visit & the bus to downtown left from across the road at the Zoo. Easy as when you know where & how.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annenewzealand
40,Cool Views at Night,"I've lived in LA for 10 years and recently went to the observatory at night for the first time and it was spectacular because of the night views. It was also a fun atmosphere. There were a lot of people there, so it took some time to get up to park, but it was worth it. I could also hear the music from the Greek Theatre down below. This is a good LA thing to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenRiley44
40,Best view of LA,"Recommend - checking timetable before going as not always open.The day we traveled the Observatory was not open, but there were still plenty of people around & you are still able to walk around the grounds & around the balcony of the observatory. Plenty of photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodies807
