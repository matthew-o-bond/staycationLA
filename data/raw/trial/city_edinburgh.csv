40,“Amazing castle!”,"From the outside the castle looked like a big building, but once we entered the castle gate, a whole town appeared. The castle is very good maintained and the view from the walls looks amazing! However, I'll definitely recommend to take a tour guide during your visit, since it'll give you a better understanding of the history of the castle and it'll make your money more worth it!"
40,“Walk through Edimburg”,"the castle and its surroundings, the old town, are pleasant walk destinations. Edimburg is a city that invites you to walk if we are not afraid of the cold and wind"
50,“Lovely People and wonderful City and safe lots of history”,Just nothing bad at all about Scotland and the city. lots of history good food great nice locals all citys and a special place to visit.
40,“Good experience in a different country”,People is very nice the city has a lot of history. The buildings are completely different from what I ever saw. The experience at the pubs was also interesting. I learnt that foreign people get their acquaintaces there.
40,“Beautiful city”,Buildings are really old but amazing. People were very friendly Was very easy to get around..City tours were excellent value for money The couriers were well informed and did a great job We bought tour tickets which was valid for 48 hours It was really worth the money
50,“you must visit this city”,"we visited Edinburgh on our own, by car and walking : by chance no traffic jam, but nice weather, very sympathic peopel and helpful; lot of places are very nice ,I recommend to climb on the hill , from there you have a view on the city, and on Queen Elisabeth's castle; the heart of the old city is very nice ; we had the chance to park our car in the middle of the city , close to the castle , in front of the famuus scottish pubs, we went to the royal mile, where the food and beer are more than good !!! to recommend, after 9 pm there is live music"
50,“Perhaps the best (Italian) Deli North of London”,"An Edinburgh institution, the V&C empire keeps growing (website, food halls in the major Princes Street Department Stores and a family finger in a number of City Restaurants). The original store in Leith Row keeps going but has become a ""Destination"" as much as a ""superb"" Italian Deli Store. There is now the CafeBar at the back - and very good it is too. The wine shop has a wide selection of Italian (and a few other) wines and regularly won awards. They sell wonderful breads and olive oils (available to taste). There is still a wide selection of Italian delicacies BUT shelf space that was previously given over to speciality foods is now given over to souvenir mugs, shopping bags etc., good selection of local and Italian cheeses and meats. Good (but less good than used to be the case) selection of bottled, canned and dried italian specialities. Fresh veg, but less interesting than it used to be. It is still worth a major detour but sliding down the slope towards Waitrose, rather than trying to be the very best Italian Deli in the UK,"
10,“Parking in Edinborough”,"Beautiful place to visit, BUT, they are putting in tram lines, which have become alot more expensive than first quoted, and appear to be revenue raising by booking every-one multiple times, for the first time in my life, after driving for over 30 years I managed to get 3 parking offenses in 16 hours, 1- placed paid for parking ticket on dash in wrong place, 2nd got towed, after being told by reception that it was ok to park on street between 6.30pm and 8.30 am, was towed at 8.01am, cost 180 pounds and about 2 hours in time plus 20 pounds for taxi, 3rd ticket had parked in private street parking for 5 minutes, sign approx 10 meters away to inform you of private parking. Edinburgh/Scotland, great place BUT as a tourist BEWARE, parking inspectors average about 3 per street"
20,“Edinburgh was a good place to visit now it seems very jaded.”,"I have visited Edinburgh several times over the years and each time my girl friend and I stay there we have always been happy with the people and to explore the history behind this great city. However, our last visit earlier this year (2011) was more than just a disappointment, we were shocked. Tramps/beggars lying on the pavement at almost every bridge and block, particularly Princes Street. Every large store or shop seems to have an adopted tramp sitting near to the entrance. They are usually accompanied by the inevitable large dog, who when not holding out the begging bowl are fast asleep, including the dog. Every city has it's beggars but this is out of hand and appears out of control. No sign of social services or police moving them on. It has also been spolied in my view by what appears to be an invasion of gays, particularly of a night to the hostelries in and around the Grassmarket are. Not knowing this had become the case we visited a pub for a couple of drinks one evening and we felt distinctly out of place and uncomfortable. We drank up and left. Now while we are of the old school and what goes on behind closed doors in private is none of our business but when their gay behaviour is publicly flaunted then we were shocked, angered and very disappointed.Peoples' sexual orientation is their affair but it almost seems that it is a prerequisite to be homosexual when out and about in parts of our cities now. I will let you decide for yourselves. We are not prudes, we just know it will be some time before we visit Edinburgh again and no doubt it will be the same for many others too."
50,“What aCity”,"Me & my new hubby spent a weekend here recently on our honeymoon. The architecture is outstanding. Everywhere you look there are statues and wonderful buildings. The Film festival looked good though it was a bit cold & wet so we didnt sit out in the park. We enjoyed the Hard Rock Cafe, though the Black Rose Tavern was more our kind of pub. The castle is an absolute treasure full of interesting history & memorabilia. My hubby (driven for 23yrs) hates driving around the city centre though as there is a vast lack of signage - afew choice swear words were uttered in frustration! When we return we will invest in a B&B in the centre as Cameron Toll Travel Inn was too far out of the centre & very basic (especially when you've stayed in a boathouse by a loch the week before!)"
50,“Great City Break”,"Recently (May 2011) had a great weekend in Edinburgh. Travelled from the Midlands by Cross Country train which, with our rail cards, was good value for money and a lot easier and less hassle than flying.Visited Edinburgh Castle which had great views over the city and provided an insight into the history of Scotland. Holyrood Palace is also worth a visit - tickets valid for a year so we can return on our next trip!After all the walking we were very glad to spend a day on the hop on hop off bus which included a boat trip - highly recommended. It also gave us the opportunity to visit the Botanical Gardens and enjoy the tranquillity of the beautiful gardens - the weather was good!"
40,“Edinburgh - visit to meet proud Scotsmen”,"Lately we spent a week in Scotland. Even for a Swede tthe weather in june was terrible with sunshine just a day and when it was windy!However Edinburgh was a nice town to visit. The history of Scotland is interesting and you find a lot of illustrations of it in Edinburgh. The castle is impressing situated on a cliff high over the city. It also make it easy to find your way in downtown as you could determine your loation from the sightof the castle. It is also easy to go aroung withe the busses, both sighseeing buses and local busses as well as buses to the airport. And it is cheap too!For us it was interesting to get some keys to the importance of Edinburgh for the development of Göteborg (Gothenburg), the second biggest city in Sweden. Chalmers is an important name in both citys and we found a statue of the Scotsmaan Cgalmers who founded the Technical University in Gothenburg.The new parlament building of Scotland is a fascinating building, very interesting as well as the royal summer palace.There are plenty of hotels and restaurants however early booking is important.Finally a friendly and proud city which was very interesting to see.Thanks for your hospitality!We with relatives in Gothenburg"
50,“Edinburgh A Favourite Capital CIty”,The Scottish people are very friendly and welcoming to all visitors and this can definately be said about the folks in Edinburgh. A stroll along the main street called Princess Street you will be sure to be greeted by many a local and other visitors alike. The wonderful Floral Gardens is a great place to visit and if you are fit and able it can be used as the start of your climb up to the Castle. By crossing over the railway bridge and climbing up the steps at the side of the cliff face up to the Castle Battlements is something you should at least do once in a life time. What an excellent view you have from the Battlements looking down onto the city.
50,“Fantastic place to visit”,"We visited Edinburgh for the first time recently and are so happy we did!!! There is so much to see and do. Yes, it's touristy and full of people but the history just comes alive as soon as you arrive! We walked the Royal Mile dozens of times as you miss so much the first couple of times. My one piece of advice for first time travellers is to wear VERY comfortable shoes and clothes. I was completely unaware how many hills are in Scotland....even in the city centre. You will climb hill after hill after hill and your legs will be sore for a few days!!!!!! Bring a good raincoat and an umbrella because you will get wet. And for the ladies, don't bother bringing a hairdryer or curling iron because three seconds after walking out the door your hair will be a mess....it's VERY WINDY in Scotland!!!! And although I haven't researched this fact yet, I SWEAR the sun is stronger there. I got quite a severe burn one day that I was not expecting.It's worth every minute though!!!!!!The great thing about Edinburgh though, is if you do happen to run out of things to do ( which wouldn't happen) there is such an awesome transportation system. We got on the train and took day trips to other towns and cities (CHEAP). As well, we booked with a tour company based in Edinburgh and went to the Highlands and down to the English/Scottish border towns. It's such a great base of operations for going anywhere in ScotlandAs I reviewed in another area, if you're coming to Scoltand for the first time skip Glasgow and stay in Edinburgh!!!! You won't be disappointed!!!"
50,“A wonderful city at any time of the year”,"Edinburgh appeals to all travellers of all ages and all cultures and of course the locals are very proud of their city.One important yearly event not to be missed is the Edinburgh Festival in the summer - it is full of music, dance and laughter and appeals to all ages including children.Quite often the venues can be visited and some are free to enjoy music and dance etc - many different cultures take part in this very special event from all over the world.Enjoy!"
50,“A Great City”,"Edinburgh is a great city filled with lots of great restaurants, pubs, and history. The bus tour giving you an overview is highly recommended. The city itself is the greatest attraction. Don't miss the castle and walking down the Royal Mile. And at the bottom end drop into ""The People's Story"" museum (free admission) to find out how life for the average person was through the centuries. While on Grassmarket drop in for the world's best pizza at ""Made in Italy"" or in the evening listen to a Scottish Fiddler play at ""The Fiddlers Arm"" pub.We ended up finding an apartment on Grassmarket not listed on trip advisor. The location could not be beat. The view from our window was the castle. It is called Castle Apartment and you can find it on the internet. Highly recommended!We loved our stay in Edinburgh and are so happy we visited."
50,“Fabulous City With Wonderful People”,"Came to Edinburgh with my 25 year old son and 22 year old daughter....Weather was cold, damp, windy but the city was fabulous and it's people are warm, friendly and have great senses of humor. The city is ancient, beautiful, clean and welcoming. It's bus system is excellent and sights very much worth seeing especially if you are into medieval history. So glad we came to this great city. I want my other children to see it too, so we'll be back! PS. the food was delicious, the whiskey amazing, and the beer and pubs a blast."
50,“Edinburgh...the city like no other....”,"I love,love Edinburgh... I have been there 4 times, and would go again that many times more, and not tire of it. Particularly during the Festival in August.. the whole month of August is jam packed with so much to see and do.. something for everyone. The people there are fantastic! Very friendly, helpful and loads of fun.Some must do's...The Royal Mile ..of course, Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, Arthur's Seat (for those of you who like to hike), Scott Monument, to name a few.... and simply being in the streets, taking in all the sights and sounds. Also, you must, must get to a local pub.. My all time favorite, I hate to almost post it here, is Sandy Bells, so, so much fun!!I could go on and on, but I'm distracting myself from my house cleaning and a kazillion other things I must do to save up so I can go on another holiday to Scotland...simply the best!! Love you Scotland...!!!"
40,“Great”,"I had a great time in Edinburgh and unfortunatelly much less entertaining tiome travelling there from Warsaw, Poland.First, about the positive things about my trip. i satyed at the Grassmarket hotel at the Grassmarket Square, which seemed at the first view a very budget place, and would probably need a bit of repainting, but proved to be a nice place. They also served very good (both tasty and filling) breakfasts. Thisn is a recommandable place to stay for anybody with limited buidget and a busy agenda, due to its perfect location at the very heart of the historical city centre,5 min. walk from the castle and 10min. from the city's principal railway station - the Waverly.As I said earlier, fliying into Edinburgh was a completly diffrent kind of story. I flew Lufthasa via Frankfurt, abd due to the heavy winds there there were serious delays to many Lufthansa flights. This is a matter of bad luck and it may happen any time. Nonetheless I really disliked the way the Lufthansa dealt with this problem. Despite the fact the Lufthansa knew that there is delay and the transfer passengers would most probably loose their further flights, there was insufficient information on the flights and rebooking after landing in Frankfurt. What is more, the rebooking desk was in distant part of the airport to the gates. Before embarking to the next airplane, the passenges were kept for good twenty minutes on board of the airport bus parked next to the airplane, just because the crew was not on spot on time. After getting to Edinburgh with a few-hour delay, it appeared my sitcase was missing, and delivered only the next day at 5 p.m.Concluding, Edinburgh is a gret place to see, but beware of the Lufthansa - it seems there is nothing left of the so-called German precision and punctuality.Badger"
40,“Modern with old word charm”,"Edinburgh is a marvelous small city. Most of the activity takes place on the ""Royal Mile"", which runs from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood House. We stayed at a marvelous B & B, The Hedges Guest House, which is within walking distance of just about everything. Don't miss taking the tour of the retired Royal Yacht Britannia."
50,“Beautiful city - a must see”,"Everyone should see Edinburgh at least once. It is truly beautiful with loads to see and do, it is also the perfect size for a weekend break as there is no need for taxis. The food is yummy and the people are fantastic (even to an English girl : )). It is one of my favourite cities I have visited.For history lovers like myself I would highly recommend both the castle and Hollyrood palace, I was flabergasted at seeing Mary Queen of Scots hair! The nightlife is also brilliant, we enjoyed a sing song at a pub in the Grass market and a night of dancing at a fun Indie club called Citrus, the seafood is also not to be missed!Just be warned it is not too different from London prices, but totally worth it."
50,“A well rounded city with something for everyone”,"Im an American who has traveled most the major cities in Europe and I must say that Edinburgh is a wonderful city. It has the historic architecture, the modern facilities, and everything in between. I feel no trip to Europe is complete without a visit to Edinburgh, Scotland"
50,“Everyone MUST visit!!”,"We loved Edinburgh when my fiance and I visited a few days ago. Where do I start.....Let's start at the hotel briefly, the Ibis in Hunters square. No frills, good value for money, cheap, clean, tidy and the staff are all helpful.During the day to visit the city attractions you are spoilt for choice and it's difficult where to start, however, I'll start at what I thought was the best attraction by far and that is of course... The Castle. £14pp entry, about £3 to by a booklet guide and I loved it. The views at the top are second to none and I was in awe at the history of this castle. I was in the same rooms and walking along the same castle grounds of most of our past King's and Queen's, wow!!There are several rooms you can enter when in the grounds of the castle, each with it's own story and history, but what took me back was seeing a foot away was the crown, yes, the crown worn by Queen Mary of Scots, exhilerating.On from the castle is the Witchery which is on your right hand side. This is an elegant, class restaurant visited in the past by the likes of Jack Nicholson, Ewan Mcgregor, Jacques Villeneuve and many more., you'll have to see for yourself if your lucky enough to get a table booked. Seriously!The Edinburgh Monument over Waverley bridge is just ideal to get some great pics of the city at height. It cost £3pp and you walk up a narrow spiral staircase of Ibelieve 287 steps in total. At the very top, you get a lovely panoramic view of the city.The Edinburgh dungeons nearby are worth a visit if you don't have young children.At the far end of the Royal mile, is situated the Holyrood Palace, about £10pp to visit inside with a cafe next to it for an afternoon tea at the Queen's!!!If you are a country walker, you'll love the walks over the road from the palace where there are plenty of hills leading of into the wilderness.There is an Earth museum near by which we personally found disappointing due to the lack of exhibits it had to offer. However, saying that it is quite high tech and ideal for a family with young children to spend a couple of hours, again at about £10pp (don't know per child).The bus tours are a fantastic way to see the city with various tours ie, the majestic tour, the city tour all at different prices.On one of the tours you will come across the Royal yatch and according to my father the highlight of his stay in Edinburgh where I believe you can visit inside etc. We didn't, no particular reason, will do though next time when we go back!!If you love wining and dining, you're spoilt for choice on places to visit especially on the Royal mile. Again, the Witchery is a must!!Two things that I loved about this city, firstly the clean air. Unlike most cities in our country I've visited, you don't smell or taste that horrible smog/fumes in the atmosphere, the air is fresh and clean. Secondly, the friendly and warm welcoming people, of which I mean when you walk into a shop for a general browse, the staff inside take a general interest in you without being too nosy.Overall, this is a good break for a family with kids but like for me, special for couples. Not only will we come back here, but in an ideal world I'd love to live here, my second home."
40,“never been before but would go back in a heart beat”,"spent wed, eve in edinburgh .. went for a meal thai/indianwas ok . out of 10...........6spent a couple of nights staying just outside edinburghabout 10min bus ride , excellent transport links , would def stay just outside the city againthursday spent in city , walked till my legs fell off ...went to the art gallery ....... FREE... and i would say wow . not really into art but some of them blew my mindwas going to do castle but was foggy so we di the dungeon was a bit cheesy but funwould i return ..................... YES tomoz if i could"
50,“The place to see”,"My wife and I had a fantastic time in Edinburgh. 4 days of sightseeing, relaxing, walking, talking and getting to know the place.Would recommend absolutely everything concerned with Edinburgh. Another highlight was the train travel from London. So easy to book and such a relaxing trip.Would certainly go again."
50,“Athens of the North”,Edinburgh has so much to offer the visit but very expensive car parking if you find a space.My tip is to take the open top sight seeing bus that allows hop on and off for 24 hours (Not just a day ticket )take the complete trip then go again and hop off at the top of the royal mile at the castle and meander down the Mile on foot visting the museam of childhood and mary Kings close and hop back on when you are ready this will cover a vast amount of tourist areas in a short space of time.picnic in the princess street park with salads and wraps etc from marks and spencers on Princess street and enjoy the views.The bus leaves from the waverly bridge just outside the rail station.
20,“Edinburgh - Stag doo not welcome!”,"Heard a lot of good things regarding Edinburgh for a Stag doo but have to say was very disappointed with our experience, mainly because we couldn't get in anywhere! There were 9 of us and they just kept saying no groups, even when we split up into a 4 and a 5! It was only 9 when we headed out after grub so were all relatively sober but the bouncers just didn't seem interested, just said no! Ended up getting into a pub just down the road from Espionage, So thanks very much for that!! Can't remember the name though, we tried so many! beer and music was good though and they were the ONLY saving grace of the night because at 1 when they closed the 5 of us left still couldn't get in anywhere else, crazy!Think something must have changed over the last 6 months because we certainly wouldn't class it as one of the top stag locations in the UK!If you are going to go I would definitly suggest using an organiser so you know you can get in somewhere!"
40,“Charming Edinburgh..”,"City Edinburgh is a well connected place. There are so many panoramic views in the city. When you walk in the city, you find several things on your way. It is priceless to take photos of Edinburgh city especially from the Edinburgh castle. I took one-day trip to Highlands and Loch Ness at the last moment early morning like 07:15am. A 45 seater coach collected me in front of a place called ""Carpet Rite"" in the corner and it was so exciting to see such a landscape along with a fascinating local music playing on. If you are in the UK and planning to visit Edinburgh for a weekend, you must arrive in Edinburgh in the FRI eve, so that you can start at early AMs the next day. I liked the funny cow called ""Hamish"". Airport-Edinburgh city centre connection is nice after you land in. Nightlife is very niceeven in winter. I was so surprised to see so many beautiful ladies at 02:00am outdoors. There is variety of the food choice available for everyone. B.Regards,. Derya"
50,“What a city!!!!”,"I have been to Edinburgh 3 times over the last 3 years, two of those times was for new years(hogmanay). It has to be one of my favourite spots in the world. Its not because of the weather :) but because of the type of city it is. Its friendly and has so many warm pubs to have a pint of belhaven in and warm yourself up by the fire. The sights are amazing, its a maze of little cobble streets and alleys. The style of the city is very medievil, its like going back in time in some parts( I mean that in a posative way). There are endless things to see, such as the Edinburgh castle, the underground city, the vaults, the whiskey tours, the optical illusion attraction, the pubs, the resterauts the list goes on and on. Its very hard to put this place into words. You have to go and see for yourself."
50,"“Perfect, just perfect.”","Get your walking shoes on. Morning, noon or night this town gives the explorer a little more with every turn. Friendly people, and beautifully cared for this City really has to work hard to disappoint"
40,“Interesting Edinburgh!”,"October 2010,Just a two day taster of Edingburgh, but what a lovely, friendly, interesting, accessable city.Can't wait to go back for alonger stay. Lots of free museums, beautiful buildings, walking up to Arthurs Seat a must, views are breathtaking.But only one place to definately avoid like the plague!A small pub near Edinburgh castle on the Royal Mile 'ENSIGN EWART' we called in for a snack. Horrible Microwaved Cottage Pie served with burnt and under cooked wedges(don't ask how thats possible).Very expensive beer/soft drinks- said they couldn't do tea or coffee, obviously beyond thier catering skills.Then to top the lot secret code on the toilet door to stop any desperate tourists using their facilities which weren't very clean anyway.So enjoy Edinburgh please! Hundreds of lovely eateries and watering holes- Whiskies, The White Horse Bar, even Macdonalds would be better than the Ensign Ewart.Have Fun."
40,“A very nice weekend”,"Drove to Edinburgh with my wife on Friday 1st October to stay at the Fraoch House in Leith on our way to Inverness. The accommodation was excellent except that our room was overlooked by every single double decker passenger that went by. Also the cooking of breakfast penetrated every part of the house and was overpowering on both mornings we stayed there.Other than that the service and the food was first class.As for Edinburgh itself Leith is an up and coming area but still retains some of the less attractive aspects such as drunks and certain people which made it a little uncomfortable late at night.We dined on the Friday evening at the Vittoria Italian restaurant in Leith Walk and the food was quite acceptable, on the Saturday evening we dined at the Brittania Spice Indian restaurant where the Britannia is moored. This was both Thai and Indian and was absolutely superb.We did shopping in Princes Street and back streets adjoining same and it was excellent, a good way of getting around other than walking is to buy a bus pass £3 for a full day and again well worth it. The one unattractive element of Edinburgh is the number of people openly begging from Asian to Eastern European to locals but again it is true of almost every city these days.Weather was excellent on the Friday and Saturday which allowed us to sit in the park opposite Princes Street on the Saturday. All in all a great weekend."
50,“What A Beautiful City?!?!”,"The hubs and I spent several days in Edinburgh and loved it. The city is old and yet full of life. Every where you look there is something beautiful and amazing. When the fog rolls into the city, it is just magic. Totally planning a trip back!"
50,“Such an enchanting place!”,"While my husband and I were in Paris, we decided to take this little vacation-within-a-vacation to Edinburgh. The Ryan Air passes were only 8£ each!!! We couldn't beat that. Plus the St. Valery Guesthouse had awesome prices.What a wonderful surprise it was! The city is gorgeous and the people are phenomenal! The culture is so intriguing and I wanted to look at real estate because I never wanted to leave.It’s not crowded, the buses run perfectly on time, the prices are excellent and you have wonderful shopping there too! We tried to eat what the locals eat... haggis, tatties, neeps...something like that, and it was different but very good.Edinburgh is picturesque with the Castle, the park along Princes Street, the Royal Mile, and the Queens Botanical Gardens.A must see!"
40,“Edinburgh in two days”,"In my opinion two days are enough to enjoy the capital of Scotland.I started with Arthur seat (the hill) that is really breathtaking and after went to the free walking tour with Joe, the slim guy that made the complete difference on my trip.With him I got a great and funny historical explanation through the ages, events and battles.Undoubtedly, one of the best thing I did on the trip.I also recommend the haggis that is a typical Scottish dish.Everything is amazing: The Castle, Childhood museum, Whisky Museum, Baked Potatoe, haggis and the People that are really polite with the indescribable Scottish accent.For me, a Brazilian guy the best thing ever was to see inside of the Whisky Museum a picture of another Brazilian guy called Claive Vidiz who was owner of the largest collection of Scottish Whisky of the world and his whole collection over there!Second him, the good sun always returns home!"
50,“Edinburgh Festival”,"If you are seeking lodging during the Edinburgh International Festival, I highly recommend Festival Beds. Members of the Friends of the Festival offer spare rooms in their homes on a bed and breakfast bases. I have always had wonderful experiences booking through Festival Beds and have met many wonderful people."
50,“Take your time getting to know this city!”,"I was lucky enough to visit Edinburgh Sept. 2nd through 12th, 2010. We stayed at a great apartment called Canon Court Apartments. The apartment was in a great area down the street from the Botanical Gardens. The bus stops right out front so we were able to get where ever we needed to go with very little effort.Within the city we did a walking tour of the historical area of Edinburgh starting at the south bridge, through Princes Street Gardens and then up to the Royal Mile. It was great to see all the locals going all over the place and we took some beautiful pictures of the city. After we got up to the Royal Mile it felt a little more touristy, but still pretty cool. We took the guided tour of the Edinburgh Castle and this is one place where you should take your time. We spent about three hours there finding all the different attractions and were impressed by the tour guide that we had there.After exploring the city we took guided tours of the highlands. The top tour that we took was called Hairycoo.com and they took us on a fantastic tour of the highlands. We went up to a beautiful national park and did a short hike up to one of the prettiest views of Loch Lomond. This wasn't your typical tour as it is free and you just pay at the end for what you think it is worth. I paid $50, but some people paid anywhere from $30-60 per person. It is well worth your time. I am not sure what they do in the winter, but I imagine it's still great.There are so many things to see there and we packed a lot into our 10 days there. You can view the full blog on http://whirledtraveling.blogspot.com/ and view the posts from September. I am headed to Dublin at the end of November and will blog and review then as well.Happy Traveling!"
50,“Beautiful!”,"I was really surprised by how beautiful this city was when my girlfriend and I visited late September 2010. Being from the US, I had always heard from fellow traveling friends that I needed to visit Edinburgh, but I never realized it could more pretty then I ever expected. In my opinion it is up their with Prague in terms of beauty. Every where you look you see something cool. The city has an infectious vibe almost like a fairy tale. This is a ""must stop"" for any avid traveler. You have to see this place.Only drawback, is everything is REALLY expensive; but so what; it's worth it."
50,"“lovely city, steeped in history.”","a wonderfull city waiting to be explored.hop on a open top bus, a great way to see all, you can hop off at any point you wish.the castle takes up the skyline which is a wonderfull sight.plenty of places to eat whatever takes your fancy, and a host of souveneer shop or two, too take something back as a reminder of your visit."
50,“Best B&B in Edinburgh”,"We visited Edinburgh in September 2010, and stayed at the most delightful B&B in our experience of many B&B's. Ramsey's is located on Broughton Street, a fabulous location, and is delightful. Sharon and Norrie run the B& B which is absolutely spotless, beautifully decorated and they are so welcoming. We arrived early in the morning and hoped that they would let us leave our luggage for the day. Sharon prepared a fresh pot of coffee for us, and talked about how to get around the city, and , what tours outside the city we might like. It was a lovely welcome. We left our luggage, and explored the city for trhe day. Ramsey's has a great location as there are really nice restaurants up and down both sides of the street so that you can sight-see during the day, come back and pick up a bottle of wine from one of the wine sellers on the street, rest a bit, then take a short walk to any of the fine restaurants there. When we go back to Edinburgh, and we will, we will stay with the Ramseys."
50,“A delightful city in Scotland”,"Edinburgh, Scotland: A delightful city!!July 2010Trip Advisor Member, ColoradoEdinburgh is a fascinating city. There is so much to see and do. We enjoyed walking the Million Dollar Mile and seeing all the sights. The castle was so beautiful and majestic. There were gardens along the river where it was so nice to take a walk and people watch.We saw several wedding parties in the square. That was interesting to see the formal kilts, beautiful ladies hats, and cute children.It was fun to go thru the kilt factory. We saw beautiful kilt fabric along with many, many kilts. This was a unique experience.Of course, the music of the bag pipes thoughout the city made the visit very special."
50,"“My hometown - still pulls me back, warms my heart”","Rated the second most popular destination in the UK. If you visit Edinburgh be sure to get beyond Princes Street and the Castle (although worthwhile and beautiful). Visit the TI and ask about walks along the Water of Leith, the Royal Botanical Gardens, the city of Leith (and the Britannica yacht!), the Edinburgh Zoo, not too mention any number of cultural events taking place (assuming you're not there during Festival month!)."
50,“The Heart of Midlothian”,"Edinburgh is one of the most beautiful cities on earth. From the castle, which looks out proudly over the city centre, to the gaol on Calton Hill Edinburgh is also full of history. I would recommend a free tour of the city centre(a New Europe tour) that l took to learn all about Edinburgh's past. I heard the story of Burke and Hare(serial killers), the inspiration for Jekyll and Hyde, the history of witch hunting and burnings at the castle, the haunted graveyard at Greyfriar's Kirk and many more interesting stories.I would also recommend heading up Arthur's Seat. lt is a beautiful walk, and the view from the top is stunning. The same can be said for Calton Hill, though l would recommend going up there at night time for the view. Calton Hill is also home to the ""shame of Scotland""- what was meant to be a replica of the Parthenon, but was never completed. lt is lit up at night time so it looks really cool.The Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh are brilliant as well and they offer free entry. Pick up a coffee or hot chocolate at Artisan Coffee on Broughton Street on the way. It is really cute and serves amazing drinks. I think they even roast their own beans.Rosslyn Chapel(from the DaVinci Code) is just a 15-20 minute bus ride from Edinburgh(just take a 15 south towards Penicuik-the bus drivers are really friendly so just ask) and if you have the time, it is worth seeing as well.If you are going to Scotland, Edinburgh is a can't miss destination. I spent the last 19 months living there, so if you have any questions or want any other suggestions, feel free to ask."
40,“A great city break!”,"Just returned last night from Edinburgh and would like to share my experience with you guys!Not much of a fan of history and culture but just wanted to get away with my boyfriend for the weekend and so glad we chose Edinburgh. Was a little aprehensive at first as my boyfriend had bruised his ankle and wasnt up to walking much...but it didnt stop us from having a good time as you will see from reading my report....arrived at edinburgh airport 9am and caught the 100 bus that took us straight to our hotel ie marriotts....great service to and from airport by the express buses.www.edinburghmarriott.co.ukthe hotel let us check in early so we managed to get breakfast and few hours sleep as my boyfriend was working nights. was impressed by the marriotts service.We hit the centre in the late afternoon and the bus stop was 2min walk with buses going every 10 min. bought the £3.00 all day ticket and thats definitely your moneys worth!as we we only had a few days to get around we decided to do the bus tour. got some advice from the tourist information on princes st (very helpful indeed). We booked on the Majestic bus tour for £11.00 each (ticket lasts 24hrs so make the most of it)and you could hop on or off when you want and the bus comes every 20min. the guide on the bus was fantastic and was so funny....throughly enjoyed it even though we got off at the castle and didnt complete the tour.Spent the evening exploring the royal mile and this was very pleasant. Had some food at the Omar kyyam and would definitely go again - busy restaurant and nice food.www.omar-khayyam.co.uk/The next day we decided to hit the high st shops on princes street but gave up after an hour as didnt seem worthwhile when you have all those high street names at home. we then got back onto the majestic bus and did the remaining sightseeing eg holyrood palace, arthurs seat, scottish parliament etc. once again amazing experience.shattered by now ...got onto a lothian bus and back to hotel to have some rest.in the evening we caught the 48 bus from the hotel and it took us kebab Mahal ( place recommended by you guys) the food was delicious and very hot and spicy. we loved it as we are proper curry lovers. we actually went back for more the next day.overall had a great time and would like to say thank you so much to trip advisor for all its advice ...especially the forum posts.I hope you guys find this useful. x"
40,“Scotland Crown Jewel”,"We had one day and night and filling it up with fun things was easy, and could have done even more and not scratched the surface. Definitely a city with a lot going on. We stayed at Arden B&B in the suburbs the bus stop was 150 ft from the door and 3 services so easy 15 min to downtown.The Edinburgh Castle is 1/2 price to free if you have a Heritage membership (check if your country has one and if it offers reciprocity). With the views, live acts, canon firing, royal history and crown jewels, and so much more it was short changed at 1/2 of our day.The National Museum Scotland was next at a short (10min) walk and 3 floors with special exhibits and a much needed tea break till closing at 6.That night we took the Double City of the Dead tour with Black Hart to see the underground Crypts, Covenanter's Prison, and Greyfrairs Cemetary. Lots of fun and informative and just 1.5 hr. so left the rest of the night for eating out and hitting up the great clubs for lots of Scottish music and dancing.All this in the main downtown area with all the beautiful buildings, street acts, shopping, mini tours of whiskey, Camera Obscura, wool mills of Scottish plaid, and food of any kind or type."
50,"“Super tour Edinburgh, Loch Ness, Inverness”","We had a great break to Scotland and decided to take 2d/1n tour from Edinburgh to Inverness. Many tours available, finally decided on Timberbush Tours. Had a great tour guide David Wilson, with a ever-smiling face & great sense of humour. The drive from Edin to Glasgow to Loch Lomond right up to Loch Ness and city of Inverness. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!! Weather was cold & rainy, but David did a great job of taking us into quaint villages whilst sharing interesting bits of history & amusing stories. From Inverness we took many a detour, including the most amazing waterfalls, 300 year old scottish homes and finally Edinburgh's beautiful coastline with 2 bridges. Great memories indeed!!"
40,“Scotland Forever!”,"We just returned from nearly 2 weeks in Edinburgh, Scotland, one of the most beautiful and interesting cities in the world. We stayed in an apartment called Ashdene House which was spacious and clean. It was across the street from the bus stop and Edinburgh has a great bus system so need to have a car in the city.Loved the shops and the historical sites downtown. Weather was fair but not the reason you go to Scotland. Had great food at the French restaurants and pubs including Wildfire on Rose Street and Le Cafe St. Honore' on Thisltle Street Lane. Loved the bag pipers, scotch whiskey tour, and the castle.Rented a car and loved driving through the highlands. Stopped and had a ""to die for"" lunch at Yann's at Glenearn House in Crieff.Played the local courses and viisited St Andrews which is a hour north.Bring your wet weather gear, buy the wool sweaters, and enjoy the ale"
50,“great lifestyle”,"Edinburgh is not just beautiful, but a very historic town. Try one of the free tours that are offered. I can recommend the Celtic Tour which is offered by the City Mission. You get a different perspective and the tour guides are more like actors. There is also a life singing peformance included. Go to Broughton Street and enjoy one of the nice Cafes there."
50,"“Hotel du Vin, Edinburgh”","Well located in the old town, Hotel du Vin was one of those pleasant surprises where excellent taste and style is combined with good prices and service. A small boutique hotel with a very good bar and bistro restaurant, it is beautifully decorated throughout and makes staying there a special experience for those looking for something more than just the high-standards offered by all four or five star hotels."
40,“Always a great time”,"I was in Edinburgh as a member of the USA Duathlon Team racing in the World Championships. I had been to Edinburgh for The Festival several years ago and had a great time with good dining, pubs and friendly people. This trip was no different. I rented an apartment for the week, Royal Mile 3 on St. Mary Street. It was basic and servicable. Great location. I had coffee and breakfast at Foodies near the Holyrood MacDonald Hotel on several mornings. Dinners at local Pubs were typical and good (fish and chips, salmon, and other local specialties). The history and archetecture in the Old Town is great. I recommend Edinburgh for a long weekend or as a needed stop on a Scotland tour."
10,“bow bar edinburgh”,"During a very enjoyable day in Edinburgh, we decided to go for a wee drink at the Bow Bar. Our order was a glass of whisky, a vodka and irn bru. We were quite surprised to discover that the establishment did not have any of Scotlands other national drink (Irn Bru)! However no big deal or so we thought. we had our own and added a splash to the vodka. Shortly afterward the barmaid swooped on our table and removed my wifes drink! then asked us both to leave the premises! taking offence to us using our own mixer. On thanking the lady for her hospitality we left DISGUSTED!"
50,“LOVELY EDINBURGH”,"my first trip to Edinburgh was great the castle with it's spectacular views,the buildings with the window boxes,the old and newer building were a good match,so quick to travel in the city and out to the country was the thing a really liked not a huge city like most others.The greenery everywhere of the gardens and fields too was great as we have water restrictions in australia so that i loved to see. All over the city was really nice and the grave of little Bobby the dog and his owner such a sad story.My tour had a scotish night of entertainment too which was very nice especially hearing the bagpipes my favourite musical instument to hear that was very special."

50,"“Best Bed & Breakfast in the UK, 23 Mayfield Gardens, Edinburgh, Scotland”","My wife and I have just returned from our three week self guided tour of Scotland and England, and I wanted to let everyone know what a great city Edinburgh is, and the best B&B in the UK. Edinburgh during August is Festival Month, and with the Military Tattoo at EDinburgh Castle, its a very exciting place.During our travels around Scotland, and later on to England, we stayed at several high quality hotels, and two other B&B's and 23 Mayfield Gardens in Edinburgh was without a doubt the finest accommodations we enjoyed. The owner and his staff were extremely welcoming and hospitable and made our stay very relaxing and enjoyable. The huge, modern room we had, with its fine furnishings spoiled us for the rest of our vacation. (And I don't want to forget to mention the delicious breakfasts.) As we traveled about the UK my wife and I would compare our new accommodations to those at 23 Mayfield Gardens, and everywhere we went they came up very short of the mark.We would highly recommend this B&B to anyone wishing the best in accommodations, clean modern facilities, and a highly competent, professional, and friendly staff.Thanks for a wonderful stay in Edinburgh.Larry & Linda S.Orlando, FL09/1//2010"

10,“Timberbush Tours”,"Three of my friends & I recently took a trip to Scotland. We were in Glasgow and then in Edinburgh for the Tattoo--Fantastic!We decided to do Timberbush's 3-day Highlands tour which initiated in Edinburgh on Aug. 26. The itinerary sounded great. Unfortunately, our tour guide, James, evidently needs a career change. He did not welcome questions and was quite rude at times. When someone was ""brave"" enough to ask a question, his response was often ""didn't you read the brochure?"" Despite his doing this tour several times a month, he couldn't get the microphone right and when told we couldn't hear him, he simply rolled his eyes. He didn't seem to know how to work the air conditioner either as we either froze or the windows steamed.Very little commentary on the sights.I have traveled extensively and have never had such a disappointing experience with a guide. Actually, I think we received a bus driver--not a guide. Too bad for Timberbush--another guide could have left a positive feeling for all of us.Kat"
50,“Edinburgh Vaults”,"Edinburgh Vaults Paranormal Tour, outstanding experiance no fake ghosts just real ones. I was a scepitic until I took this tour."
50,“The Fringe and Edinburgh”,"I travelled to Scotland for the first time,with a University Group for the 1st two weeks of August. The weather was great and we stayed at Pollock Halls, a dorm complex for the University of Edinburgh. The rooms were 2 twin beds en suite. The breakfasts were included and were excellent. They served haggis and blood puddding(yuk) for true Scotsmen and women. The transport system is excellent and I recommend the 5 day bus pass. The Fringe festival is a month long affair with over 2000 eventsa ranging from World Class Jazz and Blues to high school muscials with street performers, comedians , actors young and old. The food was generaly very good and you could wear it off with a hike to Arthur's seat. The highlight was attending the Tattoo at the Castle with side trips to Rosslyn Chapel, Glasgow, the Aran Isle and a number of close by towns and cities. The locals were warm, patient and forgiving despite the deluge of people descending upon the city for fringe. Wear good walking shoes and bring a fleece and a waterproof jacket."
50,“Ashcroft Farmhouse East Calder near Edinburgh A great place to stay!”,"If you're travelling north towards Edinburgh and need B&B accommodation, look no further than Ashcroft Farmhouse.Here you will find warm hospitality, immaculate accommodation in a spacious, beautiful bungalow, set in a well-tended garden. If you are less mobile, this is the place to stay, as there are no steps to negotiate.Elizabeth and Derek, your experienced hosts, look to your every need and are a mine of information if you wish to visit Edinburgh or the Coast. Generous and imaginative breakfasts will set you up for the day. We'd happily return!"
40,“Mercat Ghost Tour Edinburgh”,"Booked the ghost tour as part of a night out, what a night!Emma the tour guide was fantastic, very enthusiastic about the job.Highly recommend Mercat tours!"
50,“Edinburgh Internatinal & Fringe Festival 2010”,"Edinburgh International and Fringe Festival August 2010 - alas only for a few days enjoyed by me - was as in previous year a pure delight. Lots of guests , everwhere in venues big and small staff are delightful and I do like to stay at the City Centre Ibis, staff are so friendly and helpful."
50,“My favorite place in Scotland”,"What a fantastic city Edinburgh is, clean, safe and the people were so friendly. We were there for the 2010 Edinburgh Tattoo, which was great. We made a week of it, and it was also the Fringe Festival, with lots of shows in the streets. We visited the Castle, and the Royal Yacht Britannia. There was restaurants, cafe's and bars everywhere. Loved it."
10,"“Ladystairs Edinburgh, Scotland, Self Catering 'money grabber'.”","Had this accommodation paid for 'up front' for a visit in April 2010. Due to the volcanic ash in Iceland, our flights were cancelled and we were not able to travel. We contacted the agent and tried to change the dates or get some kind of riembursement. ALL attempts to negotiate change with the agent were unsuccessful. We also contacted the VRBO head office. Again, nothing. We are out of pocket over 600 GBP. I will never use this site again and will do what ever I can to get the word out. This agency is totally in it for themselves, not the customer."
40,"“Edinburgh, Scotland”","This Unesco city is the larges city in Scotland.Edinburgh is very old city with history completely everywhere.You can walk in the streets and feel the mysterious atmosphere. In the city is many beautifulhouses and majestic castle.You can find nice accommodation, eat in good restaurants and have a good time. During thesummer time is lots of festivals in the city. Which supplies more magic to this uncrediblecity. If you are looking for some historical, relax and lovely place for your weekend, stop inEdinburgh."
50,“I feel really at home”,I love Edinburgh and wonder why it took me so long to discover it. It has everything a foodie like me enjoys with beautiful architecture and is close to the sea. It's easy to walk around but the public transport is well organised and cheap. I used JSB Executive Travel and was very impressed with their service. The only thing I think could be improved is the commentaries on the sightseeing buses. Sometimes it was difficult to understand what was being said and there were no earphones to hire. The Firth of Forth Bus and boat trip could also be better. It felt a little lacklustre and more could have been made of the experience. I didn't realise you could hire binoculars until the trip was nearly over for example. The lack of real food for the lunch time trip was also a negative point. If you don't like junk food there was no real option - sandwiches would be a good idea as a basic. But apart from that - tourists are well taken care of in Edinburgh and it is great to stay there as a base for travelling around.
10,"“White Hart Pub, Grassmarket, Edinburgh”","Thursday 8th July 2010, 6.30pm.Six of us dined at this pub on this date, as the Grassmarket used to have a really good reputation for good food, good prices and friendly staff. I used to dine here regularly when I lived in Edinburgh, one reason why we went this time.Not any more. I no longer recommend this place.For 3 of us, 2 steak pies, chips and peas, 1 haggis, tatties and neeps, 1 can of coca cola, and 2 ""pints"" of coca cola, our bill came to £29.57.The portions were all small (we went to a chippy afterwards to fill up), the food was microwaved, and there was more rocket lettuce (as garnish) on the plates than there was food. Instead of flaky pastry, the pies were rock hard - we couldn't get our knives through it, and the meat inside them was certainly questionable, but didn't taste like steak. The turnips were hard and lumpy, the peas like bullets, and the ""gravy"" was a brownish smear on the side of the plate.The ""pints"" of coke cost £2.50 and had the same amount of liquid as the can of coke costing £1.50. On the plus side, the pint of tennants special was good and reasonably priced.All in all, VERY disappointing, and won't be going back. There are still a lot of good eateries in Edinburgh."
50,“Fantastic city with a fascinating history”,"I have just got back from my second trip to this amazing city. Edinburgh really lives up to it's reputation of history and beauty. There is so much to do with a varioty of places to see. I highly recommend the tours, they are both informative and enterntaining. The main attractions are of course the castle and ''The Royal Mile''. If you are willing to catch the bus or take a little walk you will also find many other things to look at. A good example is the zoo which is just a short bus ride away or Dynamic Earch which is about a half hour's walk away from The Royal Mile.If you do decide to go; look up the Edinburgh Pass. For about £20 a day you get free access into tons of attractions and free airport transfers. In two days that pass saved me at least £50 (which I happily speant treating myself to a nice meal and bottle of bubbly)."

50,"“Edinburgh, the Old College and a great bar.”","What a beautiful city Edinburgh is. We are lucky to have had the most sunny weather. The locals told us it was unusual. There are many interesting and historic places on Edinburgh's Royal Mile and we also ventured off to see ""The Old College"" quadrant which was the citys old university and a wonderful building with an art gallery at the back. We then took refuge in a tiny bar that we found in South College just at the side of the Old College.It was called Captains Bar and had some flower baskets hanging outside. It had the fresh smell of paint and a friendly couple behind the bar. They spent time talking to us about the city and were most welcoming. The bar had a historic interest and has traditional folk music playing at night and a connection with a local poet whose plaque is hanging up outside the Captains bar. I would recommend this city and the area and bar to everyone."
50,“Beautiful CIty!”,"Having spent a number of years living in Edinburgh, I highly recommend a visit here. Although the weather might not always play in your favor, the city itself is beautiful.Take a walk down the Royal Mile and see the 17th century townhouses. Unfortunately this is a bit of a tourist trap, but still definitely worth seeing. The streets which make up the Royal Mile are (west to east) Castle Esplanade, Castlehill, Lawnmarket, High Street, Canongate and Abbey Strand. At the top is Edinburgh Castle where they hold the annual Tattoo parade at the end of August.Lots of great restaurants, bars, pubs and clubs in the Old and New Town. Although very busy, it is worth visiting for the Edinburgh Festival throughout August. Lots to see and do.Another highlight is Edinburgh Zoo, it is only a 15-20 min bus ride from the city centre.Many low cost airlines serve Edinburgh, including Ryanair and easyJet so it is well connected. Trains also run from Edinburgh Waverley Station to other parts of the UK."
50,“My Scittish experience.”,"I visited Scotland in June, 2010 for four days. I had a great time in the Scottish Capital of Edinburgh. Edinburgh is a small city, as capitals go, but a very interesting and beautiful one. I did not go on a high-end holiday, so I stayed in a four star Bed and Breakfast place called The Waltons on Dandas Street. It was a very cute place, with a reasonably good breakfast. The room was quite spacious as my companion and I booked a triple room which was the same price as a double room. The bathroom was adequately sized, with a modern shower stall. The price was about GBP 70.00 per night, booked through the internet.In Edinburgh one needs good walking shoes as a lot of the tourist attractions are within walking distance from the center of town. The Edinburgh Castle ""dominates the city like no other castle in Europe"" as written in the guide to the castle. It is 3000 years old and sits atop the Castle Rock. In the middle ages ""Edinburgh became Scotland's chief royal castle, enduring siege after siege during the long wars with England"". The other place of interest is The Palace of Holyroodhouse. It has been a royal residence for 500 years and has the royal family reside there even today. The Queen is in residence here at least once a year, for a week in the summer.All these historical sights are on the Hop-on-hop-off tourist sightseeing buses routes. There are boat tours around the Edinburgh sea, to some of the Lothian islands on The Fife of Forth. For Art lovers, The Royal Scottish Academy houses a most incredible art collection. The Edinburgh International Festival takes place from the 15th August - 5th September, a very good time to see Edinburgh.I enjoyed my Scottish experience and would like to go again and see the rest, like Inverness and Loch Ness!"

50,“Edinburgh/Highlands/Island Tour Mini Tours Scotland Craig Flynn”,"A group of 7 US women had an AMAZING 6-day tour of Scotland with Craig Flynn, Mini Tours Scotland. We had booked the tour by e-mail about a year before our trip, and I had been e-mailing with Craig with all our questions before the tour. He was always prompt with answers. He picked us up from Edinburgh hotel, and his van was adequately roomy enough for the 7 of us and all our luggage! We had chosen the highlands/islands tour from his website. Each day, he showed us a map of the mileage we would be covering and give us the options of places we could stop. We made plenty of stops to get out and walk and hike so it broke up the 1,200 miles we covered during the 6 days. Craig is very knowledgeable of the history of Scotland. We saw parts of Scotland that you'll never see on a bus tour, and we liked the fact that we didn't have to wait for a bus load of people - we saw so much more than you'll ever see on a bus tour! Plan to go back in a few years and do a week of Ireland with him. I highly recommend him if you want a day trip, week or longer."
40,“Free walking tour of Edinburgh”,"Based upon the advise of someone I was working with I went on a walking tour of Edinburgh. It is offered by NEWEDINBURGH and is FREE yes, FREE. The tour last about 3 1/2 hrs. and the tour guide is very knowledgable about Edinburgh, and at the end of the tour you just ""tip"" him what ever you think it was worth. All other comparable tours were costing abour 9-12 pounds. Also he recommends good places to eat at the end of the tour and I took him up on his suggestion and it was good food and very reasonable. They also do the same thing in Berlin and Munich (which I'm going to do in September) Just google ""free walking tours of Edinburgh"" and it will come up."
50,“A Scottish Weekend”,"The JourneyI look out of the window - and there it is: the most beautiful landscape! Green hills, forests, the sea...I have to smile. Up to that point of the day I had been in a kind of trance, getting up in the very early morning, travelling to the airport, flying to Amsterdam, hurrying to the righ gate to catch the next flight... but now here I am: On my plane high above the sunny hills of Scotland and I am so looking forward to the weekend with Julia!A few minutes later I look out of my window again. But - what the hell...?! No sun. No hills. No green Scotland anymore. It looks as if we are going down through the clouds and I wait for the white, unfriendly rain-causers to end so that I can take a glimpse of what Edinburgh looks like. But then - Rooom!What was that??""Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to Edinburgh! Please remain seated until the plane is in its final position..."". It wasn't the clouds that welcomed me so nicely to the city, it was the sea mist. And there are no indications that it takes any effort to move one bit the following hours. But you know what?That is just the right atmosphere to visit Edinburgh!Tea for TwoDie perfekte Art ein Wochenende in Schottland zu beginnen ist ein gemütlicher Tea for Two mit heißer Schokolade, Scones, Sandwiches und Kuchenstücken! Diese riesige Portion für zwei gibt es sogar schon ab zehn Pfund.Man muss sich schließlich stärken, denn es gibt eine Menge zu sehen......Da wäre einmal das Edinburgh Castle, in dem man nicht nur viel über Schottland's Geschichte lernen kann, sondern auch einen großartigen Ausblick über die Stadt hat.Jeden Tag, Montag bis Samstag, um 13:00, wird seit 1861die One O'Clock Gun abgefeuert. Die Idee dafür hatte John Hewitt, der eine ähnliche ""Zeitkanone"" in Paris gesehen hatte. Sie wurde eingeführt, um den Schiffen im Hafen von Leith dabei zu helfen, ihre Uhren nachzustellen.Gleich neben dem Eingang zum Castle befindet sich die Camera Obscura, ein Museum der besonderen Art.In der obersten Etage befindet sich die ""begehbare Lochkamera"", die Camera Obscura, die schon vor 150 Jahren die Menschen verblüfft hat. Man steht um einen großen Holztisch herum, auf dem eine Abbildung der Geschehnisse der Stadt zu sehen sind: Autos parken ein, Menschen bummeln durch die Gassen... Was für uns heute nicht mehr so aufregend erscheinen mag, hat vielen vor 150 Jahren noch die Sprache verschlagen.In den unteren Etagen hat man noch einige Attraktionen hinzugefügt, so kann man in der World of Illusions seine Sinne täuschen lassen, sich in besonderen Spiegeln bewundern und vor allem alles mögliche selbst ausprobieren!Die Dachterasse bietet wieder eine großartige Aussicht inklusive Erklärungsschildern. Camera Obscura ist wirklich sehenswert!Ein weiteres sehenswertes Museum ist das National Museum of Scotland - Eintritt frei!In sechs Stockwerken kann man über die geographische Entstehung Schottlands, die ersten Bewohner, die Könige und Königinnen lernen und riesige Maschinen aus früheren Zeiten bestaunen. Zwischendurch hängen wieder wo Kostüme, die dazu gedacht sind, dass man sie anzieht und sich wie eine richtige Schottin oder ein richtiger Schotte fühlt!Der dritte Stock ist Schauplatz für verschiedene Aussstellungen. Bis 10.Jänner 2010 war zum Beispiel ""Salt of the Earth"" zu bestaunen, eine Fotoausstellung von Craig Mackay. Der Fotograf hat berühmte Persönlichkeiten aus Schottland oder mit einer Verbindung zu Schottland portraitiert.Einen Besuch Wert ist auch Leith, ein Stadtteil am Hafen von Edinburgh.Leith war früher eine eigene Stadt, und hat sich über die Zeit von einem Ort der Drogenszene (Handlungsort für den Roman ""Trainspotting"" von Irvine Welsh) zu einem touristischen und innovaten Teil der Stadt Edinburgh entwickelt.Heute findet man hier neben Einkaufszentren die ehemalige Yacht der Queen, Her Mayesty's Yacht Britannia.Besonders schön ist es, nach einem Besuch am Hafen, den Lauf des Water of Leith entlang zu gehen, und auf diese Weise einen etwas anderen Teil von Edinburgh kennenzulernen. Hier bekommt man eher das Gefühl, in einem norddeutschen Ort zu sein, als in der Stadt der Burgen...gemütlicher Ausklang...... nachdem man von Calton Hill nochmal einen letzten Blick über die Stadt genossen hat...... lässt man das Wochenende am Besten in Greyfriar Bobby's Bar bei einem Glas Cider und Live Musik ausklingen! Wer will, kann auch hier wieder eine Geschichte erfahren, nämlich die von Greyfriars Bobby, einem sehr treuen Hund, der vor mehr als hundert Jahren gelebt hat. Aber da es schon spät ist, lehnt man sich am Besten einfach zurück, und beobachtet das bunte Treiben, begleitet von Graeme E. Pearson's Gesängen..."
50,“Edinburgh - Enticed by their culture of Bravery and Defiance”,"Edinburgh is simply a place that you will be absorbed by its legends, myths, stories, characters and architecture. An ifusion of the old and new, the city attracts me right from the time i arrived.There are simply so many things to do in Edinburgh. History Buffs will enjoy the museums, castle and the stories behind every corner of the city. Artisitc people will enjoy the Georgian and Victorian acrhitecture of the City. The young ones will enjoy more than the 700 pubs on offered. Those interested in culture and ethnographies will surely wanna visit places such as Mary King Close to understand how the poor lived in the 17th C. People who are into scares and horror will enjoy the stories of some of the most bizzare and grusome murders ever to happen with a myraid of horror tours on offer. Those who would just want to enjoy the beautiful scenery and of course the scottish highlands, Edinburgh is the place to be! On the whole, Edinburgh caters to people all walks of life!!Special praise must be given to my two guides in Edinburgh. First one is Andra from the New Sandemen free tour. Her dynamic and interesting storytelling style will keep you indulge and emphatise how much the scottish people have been through and their strong character of defiance and bravery. Simply the best tour guide i had in my life! The other is Daniel from the Highland Explorer tour. His high level of knowledge and information of the highlands simply bombards you to pieces. He is always very readily to answer your queries or assist u in any way he can. You can certainly feel his passion and love for the Highlands as he gave his commentaries of the Highlands.On the whole, it is so far one of my very best trips in my life. Thank you Edinburgh!! You make me fall in love with you just within 24 hours too!! =)"
50,“Beautiful city!”,"We recently spent 3 days in Edinburgh on our first trip to Scotland. The city is very beautiful with lots to do and see. The castle is well worth the visit. Just seeing the scenary from the top of the castle is worth it. We stayed at a 2 star hotel The Osborne, and it was clean and came with a great ""full scottish"" breakfast. Our room was small for 3 adults, but clean and in a good location for about 75PS per night. There is lots to see and do within walking distance. We did hiking (in the city!), great pubs, lovely old churches, great shopping, everything you could need. The old buildings and houses were really something to see too. People everywhere were friendly. The Tourist info centre was a great help too. We would recommend the guided tour into the ""underground"" for a real taste of history. It was an eye-opener!Loved this city! We definately would come back."
50,“fantastic city”,"Historic beautiful buildings, great nightlife, great vibe, good shopping and lovely scenery in surrounding countryside.Great place to visit"
50,“A special favourite of mine”,"Just returned from a 5-day trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, with friends. We were most fortunate with the weather and believe we saw this beautiful city at its very best.It is a relatively compact city, and is so well laid out it is quite easy to find your way around. The local buses are frequent, spotlessly clean, with the most friendly and helpful bus drivers I have ever come across!The museum is a family affair with something for everyone - it includes many artifacts and stories from the past as well as ""discovery"" sections that encourage the minds and imagination of both young and old. There are 5 floors to this museum but we only managed to complete 2 floors on this visit in 3 hours!While the castle is justifiably famous and is a must on everyone's itinerary, I strongly recommend a visit to the Royal Britannia Yacht berthed a short bus ride away from the city (bus no. 35). A truly splendid insight into Royal life aboard in conjunction with an honest portrayal of the crew's life and living conditions. You can enjoy an afternoon cup of tea on board in the beautiful on-board Royal Cafe. Don't forget to buy some fudge that is made in the ship's own galley - It is gorgeous and I am sorry I didn't buy more of it!Two members of our group went further north on a 2-day trip to Loughness and the surrounding countryside. Their reports were full of historical facts about the heritage of the Scots and while I am sure some of the information was accurate, I am also sure there was a bit of the ""Gaelic"" charm and amusement mixed in. Either way, they had a wonderful 2 days and we thoroughly enjoyed their tales.It is no wonder that JK Rowling was inspired by this wonderful city especially when you see the Herriott School on which her books are reputedly based. Even if you are not interested in Harry Potter, when you look up at this building you can almost ""feel"" Hogworts oozing from its walls! Just around the corner from the school is the cafe in which she used to sit for hours writing.Edinburgh is a very special place indeed. With is magnificant buildings, facinating history, spectacular views, and most pleasant people, it is difficult not to want to return sometime in the near future. Enjoy!"
10,“MAC TOURS EDINBURGH - NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.”,"My wife and I were unlucky enough to select Mac Tours out of all the hop on hop off bus tours in Edinburgh. The performance of the guide verged on insultingly rude and the tour itself was certainly not worth the money that we paid. My wife and I were the only passengers on the bus and were sitting adjacent to the guide, who avoided any human contact and provided a lack luster half hearted performance during the tour. At one stage the guide acknowledged us by stating ""you Americans like that!"" Unfortunately her ability to accurately identify accents matched her performance as a guide. I'm Australian and my wife is English. Luckily in the three weeks that we were in the United Kingdom this was the only disappointing experience. I would never waste my money on the Mac tour nor recommend it to anyone,"
50,“My trip to Scotland”,"Monday 18th May 2010 - Highland Experience Tour - Best of the West Driver - Michael If you want to see dramatic scenery and travel through the Trossacks then this is the tour for you. We left Edinburgh at 8.00am and travelled to Glasgow to pick up the other tour members. Whilst on route to Glasgow the tour operator gave us lot of information regarding the area. We picked up the rest of the tour in Glasgow and made our way. Our first stop was St Connans Church where there it is said to have a bone of Robert the Bruce. At Loch Lomond we stopped Luss which is like a chocolate box village. We then proceeded to Loch Awe and then onto Oban for lunch, I had the best fish and chips ever. We then stopped at Inverary and they have an amazing old fashioned sweet shop, we then made our way home via Loch Lomond. The driver was very knowledgeable of all the areas visited. The driver very kindly dropped us off at our hotel as it was on route to Edinburgh town centre. I would thoroughly recommend both the company and the tour. Highland Experience is located on the Royal Mile near parliament square."
50,"“Edinburgh...a beautiul, magical place”","How did I forget to rate Edinburgh after my trip there last summer? It is one of my favorite places in the world. It is a beautiful, clean city with very friendly people. There is so much to see, so much history, so many places to go and explore. I want to go back. Edinburgh is one of those cities I felt right at home--like I do in Paris and Toronto. All of the castles are a must see.The docents (wardens--they call them) are all consistently nice.The Rosslyn Chapel is a quick bus ride out of town and well worth seeing. Other than in Ireland and in Halifax, I have never encountered so many friendly and nice people. The public transportation is great--frequent--fast--cheap. Where have you ever seen people thank a bus driver when they exit? They do here! Fans of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" will be thrilled to visit her neighborhood (Morningside) and the historic cemetery where she and her gels met up with Teddy Lloyd. Excellent (free) art museum, the National Gallery (Scottish history) wonderful and you must visit High Kirk of St. Giles. (Those of you who are observant will note the kirk is right across the street from the fictional Marcia Blaine School for Girls.) Shopping is great here too. Edinburgh is an hour's plane ride from London so is a perfect accompanying trip to that fun city. Don't miss Edinburgh! History, magic and mystery await around every corner!"
50,“Edinburgh was FAB!!!!”,I loved Edinburgh. The Royal Mile was so beautiful and the city had such charm for such a large place. We only stayed for the day and I know I will be going back there someday. I enjoyed touring the castle and am blessed to have been able to visit there.
50,“SCOTTS IN THE PARK”,"Whilst visiting edinburgh, we fell upon the most delightfull eatery which is a fabulous large kiosk in princess street gardens, We normally avoid these type of places, but after so much walking, we were desperate for a coffee,We ended up having the best coffee i have tasted, and the most amazing carrot cake! my other half had some shoe string fries, he said they were awesome.The lady was so freindly that served us, and gave us some great tips to help further our visit, she even gave my daughter a free ice cream, which i ended up eating, I was told it is very famous ice ice cream called luccas! I have to say it was that good my hubby went and bought another tub!Whenever we are in the area, we will make scotts in the park a first stop on our list, and would reccomend it to EVERYONE!"
50,“Edinburgh: the Athens of the North”,"The beautiful old buildings, the winding streets, cobbled roads, and an aura of legend and myth. This is Edinburgh. A city so rich in history, that almost every step you take is significant. The Camera Obscura, in the Royal Mile is a must visit attraction. Apart from all the illusions and amusing artifacts inside the museum, the best thing about it is the view from the roof top. Almost the whole of Edinburgh can be seen beneath you, and it is probably one of the most breathtaking views of the city, obviously apart from Calton Hill. Calton Hill is a great landmark. Climbing it, one can see the new town and old down beneath it, and come face to face with 'Edinburgh's Disgrace'...which is no disgrace at all!! Looming above you, this huge building was meant to be a copy of the Acropolis...but due to financial problems only a part of it was complete (thus the 'disgrace'!).One cannot not mention the Edinburgh Castle, the home of the Crown Jewels, and the famous, most loved 'Stone of Destiny'. It is a castle worth visiting.Additionally, tours of any kind are a must, and there are plenty : The Ghost Tours, Pub Crawls& the Day Tours... 'Sandeman's New Edinburgh' are simply fantastic tour guides! The Day tour is free, and the Ghost Tour and Pub Crawl are worth the money (9sterling app.)Additionally,make sure to grab a cup of coffee and a bite to eat from The Elephant House, at the heart of the Royal Mile. This place was made famous by J.K. Rowling. The Elephant House is the birth place of Harry Potter, since J.K.R started writing her books in this cafeteria. It is said that Hogwarts was inspired by Edinburgh Castle, which can be seen from the shop!There are plenty more to say about this magnificent city, the charming pubs, the Edinburgh Dungeons, the Whiskey Tour...are all part of this exciting, tourist friendly city."
50,“What to AVOID in Edinburgh”,"Overall, we had a great trip to Edinburgh- with one exception. I DO NOT recomment the Edinburgh Bus Tours. They have lots of different bus tours and they are a RIP OFF! We didn't know the city at all and thought we'd need a tour - but maps are everywhere and the old part of the city is small enough to walk everywhere or get a cab (for a fraction of the price). Also the city bus service is fantastic - and trams will be working soon as well. The bus tours also boast a service to get on or off whenever you want... but they don't stress the fact that they stop running the buses really early and you often have to wait about 20 minutes for a bus to arrive at a stop. By that time you could have crawled to your next destination! The Edinburgh Bus Tours are overpriced and not good value. I thought it would be great to have a guide, but every one I heard seemed to spend a lot of time making derogatory comments about the English. (I'm not English but it was annoying all the same!) People in Edinburgh are so friendly that you don't need to spend a fortune to get a little information. Just ask!Apart from that bad experience, our time in Edinburgh was wonderful! It's a beautiful, vibrant and fascinating city. There is so much to see and do for all ages - take in historic sites, go on a wonderful Mercat walking tour, eat in one of the city's restaurants... the list is too long!"
50,“Visiting Scotland is a MUST if you like travelling.”,"I had a wonderful holiday last January at Edinburgh in Scotland.Although it is a cold place to be during January we could still feel the warmth of the Scottich people.This wasn't my first time there and definately not the last as there is so much one can do.We enjoyed ourselves so much while we were sightseeing the Lochs & Castles,above Caingorm Mountain,touring Edinburgh-Stirling and Glasgow,Shopping and much much more.The Scottish Whisky Trail is a must when visiting Edinburgh.I also visited Glasgow and stayed at the Park Inn and we were well looked after- Great Staff but Karen at Oshi Restaurant slightly edged everyone with her genuinity and kindness ( YIC attitude).We enjoyed the Celtic concerts across the street at the Royal Concert hall.Great Restaurants at Sauciehall Street and the area close to it.However it was a pity on the cheap customer service at Hertz at Edinburgh Airport.Well I didn't let this one incident effect such a wonderful holiday as I will be coming again in a couple of months.More rent a car available as having a car is important but surely not Hertz.Darren"
50,“Amazing city”,"We booked a long weekend in Edinburgh primarily to see an international rugby match at Murray field, but we were able to explore the rest of the city and we had an amazing time.We were lucky enough to have great weather so walked around the city for hours, it really is a place of two halves and the old town has a very different vibe to the new town.There are bits of it which are very 'touristy' as you'd expect, but it doesn't feel too imposing or tacky in the way that it often does in other big cities.Great places to eat are everywhere, we'd recommend Pickled Green, Massimo and Cellar 9. The atmosphere in all the bars and pubs is very welcoming, but of course the prices in the city centre area are on the high side.We visited Edinburgh castle, the views were great and the War Museum is very good and gives an interesting perspective on Scottish history. We also visited the Edinburgh Dungeon, I wasn't keen beforehand but it was actually loads of fun, very good actors and the group we went round with had a good laugh.In terms of accomodation, we stayed at Halcyon House Hotel on Royal Terrace, very good value, friendly and does a good breakfast.Overall, such a great weekend, we loved it and would definately recommend!"
20,“Edinburgh - beautiful-dirty city”,"Last summer, I decided to visit the UK, of course, everyone told me that Scotland is by far the best part of the island and that everyone should visit Edinburgh, the city called Athens of the north. Since I was in the original Athens, I decided to see this one in the north. From the moment our plane landed in Edinburgh, I was fascinated by the monumental buildings of the truly beautiful city, but at the very beginning I noticed the remains of many different fast food meals, thrown on the road, the pavement, etc. However, I attributed this to the fact that it was already too late, although it was strange. In the morning I got up and went to book a trip to Loch Ness, it was around 9 am, the city was astonishingly dirty, everything I saw last night, plus double the amount of the same garbage was on all streets. Also our hotel, The Carlton had quite dirty rooms, with heavy curtains, which were full of dust, also in the toilet we had no brush, which was really incredible. However, despite all, the city still had enough attractions to remove all the negativity from the mind. Considering a complete ban on smoking in UK, pubs are mostly empty inside, while the majority of guests were on the terraces, which are extremely modest and have only two or three tables each. So if you are a smoker, you have to go out, but you can't go out with the beer because drinkin alcohol is forbiden on terrace after 22.00 hours??? British tend to pretend that since the ban of smoking, no one smokes anymore, which is very far from the truth, so they don't clean the ashtrays and since it's raining quite often, the ashtrays are wet and full of filth, so, people are forced to throw cigarettes on the floor, also there are no waiters in most of the pubs, so you have to come and take your beverage on your own.?, Ok, so, nevermind the fact that you can't even drink your beer properly, nevermind the filth on the streets, the city had still that architecture that was astonishing. Edinburgh castle is truly impressive, unfinished copy of Parthenon on Calton hill is equally impressive, and the view from the hill is spectacular. But nevermind now the atractions, the city is not made of buildings, but of people. And the people, were mostly very rude, and the overall expierience was despite the buildings very poor. Im sorry if my english is bad since it's not my first language."
50,“The perfect place for a getaway with culture.”,"After returning from the United Kingdom a week ago, the one place that stands out in my mind for it's fantastic memories is Edinburgh. I stayed there for three nights with my family, and it was one of the most fantastic destinations I've ever been to, and is high on my list to return to.Staying during the Hogmanay period, it was difficult not to feel the excitement building up as the big day came closer. A large theme park style area was set up in the Princes Street Gardens, and could be seen from the Royal Mile, the Castle and Princes Street itself.On our first day, we decided to go on a free walking tour of the city with Sandemans NewEdinburgh Tours. The tours are conducted on a tips-only basis, which basically means that it's completely free, and at the end you can give the tour guide as much as you think the tour was worth. It was an incredible three hour tour around a large proportion of the Old Town, and into the New Town. During the tour, we found out many odd things that as a normal tourist, you wouldn't know, and were told lots of fantastic stories.On our second day, we visited Edinburgh Castle. The views from The Mound are truly spectacular. The castle itself had less in it than I thought it would, and not many rooms or anything to see. That being said, I probably was confusing it a bit with a palace. It was still an amazing site to visit, and it is the tourist highlight of the city.On our final day, we visited the Royal Palace of Holyrood House. This is the Queen's Royal Residence in Scotland, and I think that it is more worthwhile than the famous Castle itself. If it is your first time to Edinburgh however, definitely see the Castle as it is a highlight. The Palace has a fantastic free audio-tour, which guides you around at your own pace. The rooms are magnificently displayed, and you really get a 'Royal' feel as you walk around. Photographs are not permitted to be taken inside the Palace, but outside you can snap away. The Palace Gardens are only open during the summer months, but if you happen to visit in winter like I did, there is some information in the audio-guide about them.Overall, if you're going to visit Great Britain, Edinburgh should definitely be on your list of places to go."
50,“Best city ever!”,Edinburgh is by far the prettiest city I've visited. Everything is close enough to walk to. Visiting the castle is a must and the tour will take 2 hours at least. Edinburgh is way better than Glasgow. I will definitely go back!
50,“great place to visit”,"A great place to visit. Loads to do and see.But dont expect to meet many Scottish people.I divide my time between edinburgh and birmingham, and although I love Brum, I cant wait to get back to Edinburgh. Always discovering new bars and restaurants.Check out the Camera obscura.Loads of good cocktail bars Tonic ,Dragon fly,Voodoo RoomsOpal lounge.Grassmarket full of Hen amd stag parties on sat night , can be fun or a nightmare."
50,“Beautiful City”,We visited Edinburgh for a couple of days in July 2009. The city was unbelievably beautiful. It is so historic and we really enjoyed The Royal Mile and Edinburgh Castle. One night we took two haunted tours and had so much fun. (One was a haunted graveyard tour and the other was an underground city tour.)We also visited Glasgow for a few days while we were in Scotland and while it is also a beautiful city we were more drawn to Edinburgh. We would definitely go back to Edinburgh if we ever visit Scotland again!
50,“Festival Fever”,"Spent a wet and windy week in Edinburgh in August amidst the fun and frolics of the festival. Entertainment not only free but in many cases fantastic. Stayed in outstanding selfcatering apartment at The Mews, 8b Broughton Place Lane, owned by Alan Berrie, Worried about visiting Edinburgh at such a busy time of year, but fears were unfounded, Well worth the visit, enjoyed famous military tatoo extravaganza, book well ahead for tickets. Did touristy castle visits, and rounded the week off with a free guided ghost tour,with a very comical compere .......... (tips expected at the end !!) couldn't fault a thing."
50,“Favorite in the UK”,"Edinburgh is definitley a favorite city in the UK. Beautiful, cultural with a lot of sights to see. We spent two nights there and were able to take in a very scottish experience. You absolutely must do the hike to Arthur's seat and the Mary's Close experience. Those two made the trip complete for us. Oh and try Haggis at least once. If you don't think about what it is, it's actually not too bad."
50,"“Edinburgh, Scotland Highlands, UK Beautiful!!!”","This was the first time in Scotland. Edinburgh is the most beautiful city I have ever seen. I have a very good friend that lives in Scotland and he showed us around the city and took us to the Scottish Highland cities of Glencoe, Ft. William and Eilean Donan Castle in Sky. Absolutely breathtaking. The mountains (the call them munroes) take your breath away. Eilean Donan castle is awesome, you can imagine what life was like back in the times of Wallcae and Robert Bruce. I just got home a few days ago and i so miss the people and the country of Scotland. I am planning my next trip. Hopefully it will be very soon. ( Like this Christmas)."
50,“A City With It All”,"Though I didn't know much about Edinburgh and had never had a strong desire to visit, I decided to take a weekend trip from London to stay with a friend. Since arriving in London to study last month, I had heard good things about Edinburgh from fellow travelers. However, my visit was all I could have wanted and more. The city was absolutely breathtaking and full of history and life. We took a free tour provided by Sandeman's New Europe that was one of the most interesting and informative tours I have ever been on, filled with stories and fun facts that you don't get on your typical city tour. The city is split into New Town and Old Town, so you get your fill of contemporary city life and shopping along with fascinating history and gorgeous architecture -- not to mention you can go on a challenging and beautiful hike up Arthur's Seat from right in the middle of the city! The nightlife was great and the people were friendly-- only complaint is that we found we had to pay a little more than we would have liked for a good meal, but that's the UK for you. Overall it was a fantastic trip and I would recommend the city to anyone."
50,“Outstanding Edinburgh”,"What a wonderful city to visit. Edinburgh exceeded all our expectations...terrific meaningful museum, fascinating historical sites, diverse restaurants, and pleasant helpful residents. We stayed at a lovely B & B near the university and used public transportation and invigorating walks to get around town. The large parks (called ""The Meadows"") around the university are great for jogging, walking, and cycling. The ""Old Town"" has retained its charm and is quite interesting...from its architecture to its historical significance. We visited the Parliament while in session and were impressed with the stunning building and active sessions. We also attended a local community meeting as observers and met a number of residents which added to the flavor of the trip. Side trips to other towns while still lodging in Edinburgh are easy due to the timely train system. An inexpensive bus ride from the airport to several points in town, plus the city transportation system, make car rental unnecessary. We highly recommend a vacation in Edinburgh."
50,"“Love it, Edinburgh”","From beautiful botanticals, to the water way, Edinburgh in September is great. The Royal Mile, Princess St, there is so much to see and experience. Full of history and warm hearted people, this is a must in your list of places to see."
50,"“Four Days in Edinburgh, Scotland”","We chose to be there during the final week of the annual International Festival and boy was it busy!! I would like to be there again when it isn't festival but I thoroughly enjoyed the festive atmosphere and the ""theatre in the street."" If you don't like crowds, don't go during August.In addition to the shows and venues we visited related to the festival there were a number of attractions we took in that were wonderful. Here is a list of the MUSTS:Holyrood Palace and Park - if you are able, you must walk across Salisbury Craig and take in the view of the city from on high. The Palace (at one end of the Craig) is spectacular and the Queen's Gallery is a great art collection.High Street is High Street. You have to experience it but do your shopping over in New Town. There are a couple of Starbucks on High Street which was wonderful.Edinburgh Castle was fantastic. A must-see! The Military Tattoo hosted by the Castle each year during the month of August is a definite must-see! You have to buy your tickets well in advance and be prepared for rain. My only complaint is the seats feel like you are packed in a sardine can. If you are clostrophobic, it might be uncomfortable. Almost any seat in the place though gives you a good view. It's just very crowded!!I recommend the Scotch Whisky Experience. That was a great educational experience and very well done.Don't leave Edinburgh without venturing out (by bus) to Leith and touring the Queen's retired yacht - Royal Britannia. It was worth it and it is attached to a great shopping mall.It is easy to get around with the bus system so I don't recommend a car unless you plan on using Edinburgh as a basecamp for touring around. I would recommend something out from town if that is the case. Getting in and out of downtown in a car would be a nightmare!!I can't say that we saw it all and I'm sure there is much more to take in. That will be our next trip....."
40,"“Edinburgh, a Night to remember.”","With a little forethought, the hotel and the train fares were booked well in advance. We thought it would be an astronimic price to travel the 300 miles, but with TripAdviser we got tickets for less than £35 each/ return. We arrived comfortable, enjoyed the views of wonderful countrysides and mesmerised at the changing scenery as it flashed by our windows.Our hotel was basic, yet absolutely adequate, a comfortable bed, coffe/tea and a powerful shower. That's really all I ever ask of an overnight stay. I like a good breakfast in the morning, and in Edinburgh there are hundreds of places to find just what you need.We visited Edinburgh for a ""day out"", but were so relaxed, decided to take advantage of that evening we arrived, to wander around the bars. It didn't take long before we found a brilliant place and we joined in Salsa dancing all night long. The night was so long and energetic that next morning, wifey was extremely tired and unable to attack the morning with as much vigour as she would have liked. Brilliant for me because I hate shopping anyway, and it saved me a fortune. By lunch time she had woken up enough to appear out into the street, a little groggy, but ready for battle. OOps, Shock, Horror, (No it wasn't her hair), Oh dear, Half day closing... Well who would have guessed it, Lambspark strikes again. I recall a trip to Brugge that turned out to be a public Holiday.. I'm getting good at this.. I must write a book about it."
50,“A Great City”,"Edinburgh is a wonderful city for walking. You can easily get to most of the places you would want to see on foot, including walking from the Castle at the top of the hill to the Palace at the bottom on the Royal Mile, with lots of interesting things to see along the way. The closes (little alleys) off the Royal Mile are fascinating. Down one I found a kilt shop with a tremendously helpful fellow. The Castle was built over hundreds of years and is well worth a visit. Be sure to keep going to the top to see the wonderful small Margaret's Chapel, the oldest structure.There are also five or six pubs where you can hear folk music. You take potluck on whether it'll be happening when you get there, with the weekends your best bet. I enjoyed the music at Sandy Bells and the Royal Oak.The New Town (from 1725 or so) across the bridges is also fun and good walking. Directly across from the Tourist Information Center on Princes St. there's a hotel with a nice dining room overlooking the street. Nearby is the monument to Sir Walter Scott, which looks like a Jules Verne rocket ship. Biggest surprise: a statue of Abraham Lincoln on a monument to Scottish soldiers who died fighting for the US in the American Civil War.Oh, and there's a mountain (Arthur's Seat) in town with several trails to the top. When you descend you walk right into the downtown!"
50,“A great city for tourists”,"Edinburgh was he last stop on a two week tour for us, and it was a good way to end a lovely visit.We stayed at the Priestville Guest House based on the recommendation in Rick Steve's Great Britain book and it was a good choice: comfortable, reasonable rates, close to public transportation, off the main drag so it was quieter, and the hosts were extremely helpful.The first day we hopped a bus into the center of town and walked theRoyal Mile. It was rainy, but not uncomfortable, and by being in town in early October we did not have to fight big crowds.We dropped by St. Giles Cathedral, which proved to be a gem, and were fascinated by the tales told by the docent who showed us around. He also tipped us to the stunning old court building across the courtyard, and to a fine small cafe in the basement where we had a reasonable lunch.We then took the walking tour (with audio) of Edinburgh Castle. You could devote an entire day t the castle, and it provided great background on Scottish history and culture. During the summer festivals they also have daily military tattoos, including bagpipe bands, but we missed that.We walked back down the hill to the parliament building and the Holyrood House, the queen's home in Edinburg, popping in and out of shops along the way.The nicest surprise of the visit was the small free museum operated by the city council. It is called ""The People's Story"" and depicts life in Scotand for the working people, unlike castles which are always about the rich and the wars fought over territory.The next day the weather was cold and windy, and we opted to spend our time inside the National Museum of Scotland, another stunning example of great museums in the world. It is every bit as well-done as the Smithsonian museums in Washington, covered history from the dawn of settlement i Scotland to the present, and even offered hands-on learning/adventure sections for youngsters. Undoubtably one of the best museums, and most interesting, I've ever been inside.We ended our visit at the high-end and highly-rated restaurant upstairs in the museum. Maybe it was the end of a long trip, but it seemed overpriced and over-rated, high on pretensions and low on actual food quality.A word about the people: everywhere we went in Edinburgh people on the streets and buses were eager to help us. If we had a map out, someone stopped and offered help, and a friendly chat. When we were confused about where to get off the bus, a young couple with kids took us in hand and showed us the way.A very hospitable city.Our final day required an extremely early trip to the airport. Our B&B host at Priestville arranged for a cab to pick us up at 4 a.m., double-checked on the plan the night before, and made sure we had something to eat set aside the morning we left.A great city, well-represented by courteous and helpful people."
50,“Edinburgh adventure”,I went in July and the weather was beautiful. It's a fun city with lots of history and culture. I went to Edinburgh Castle it was very interesting and gorgeous views from the top. It overlooks the city. Also went on a night time under the street to and got a scream out of it. If you are into photography this city will keep you very busy. I took so many shots and have great memories. Had outstanding fish and chips everywhere I went. The city is very easy to walk and very affordable to ride the busy around the city in and out.
50,“The Ireland Scotland Trip -- Edinburgh”,"Edinburgh was the final stop of a two-week tour we took with Trafalgar tours. After spending a week traveling throughout Ireland, our second week took us to Scotland. Our tour group was made up of experienced travelers, and those who had never left the U.S. We had previously traveled to Russia, China, Republic of Moldova, Yugoslavia, Finland, Spain, Germany, France, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, etc., so we were very comfortable in a venue where they actually spoke the mother tounge. We took advantage of a few of the city guided tours, but enjoyed ourselves most with a city map in hand, headed up the hill toward the Edinburgh Castle where the view was spectacular, and the photos were just out of this world. Inside the castle compound are the apartments of royalty, gigantic halls, military baracks, and other wonderful sites. Thankfully, rain was not a problem and we spent at least 2-3 hours up at the castle. A few days later, we were fortunate enough to obtain tickets for the Military Tattoo, a spectacular formal event where marching units, bands, drill teams from about 10 countries joined a production with 5-6 units of ""pipers"" from several countries of the UK. I wasn't prepared for the overwhelming musical outporing generated by these massed units. Do not think for a moment that this is merely a military show. It's far more than that, and if you're ever planning a trip to Edinburgh, be sure to make reservations for that tattoo months in advance."
10,“What is all the hype about?”,"Ok, so it is Scottish and it has some good elements, but please don't rate Edinburgh as a 'must' see and do city. After months of international travelling, Edinburgh is not fit to be ranked as a top city. The Royal Mile is more like the tourist mile, the castle is high on the hill, but there are 100's more better than this one. The people are friendly, but that alone dosn't warrant a visit and the nightlife and vibe of the town is just plain boring. There are so many more better cities to visit and spend your hard earned cash on. Take my advice and look elsewhere before deciding on a visit. Ableit, the highlands and country side are a different story and well worth a look."
50,“Edinburgh.....certainly is capital!!”,"A vibrant, cosmopolitan, historical capital city. Good selection of nightlife, food and history. A MUST to see on your visit to the UK and Scotland if coming from overseas."
50,"“excellent,lively, cultured”","we went to edinburgh on the way back from lochness excellent place found some excellent restaurants and visited some excellent places , the castle was smaller than i expected but interesting all the same and it took 3 hours to get round, and we went to mary kings close that was brilliant, and we also went down the edinburgh vaults the history of the place was fantastic and we'll definatley be going back we went for 3 nights an extra night or 2 would have been great"
50,“Touring Golf Courses”,"A group of us came up to Edinburgh to play golf all around the area. The golf courses were incredible even though my golf was not on best form. We hired a 9 Seater People Carrier (Economy Hire) it's worth a mention because it actually made the trip so much more enjoyable having the freedom to go when and where we wanted altogether and with Sat Nav provided it was great. The guy gave us some great advise on some lesser known courses on the East coast which were quite spectacular Links courses. If you enjoy Golf this is the best place to do it even if the weather can be a bit unpredictable (it all adds to the enjoyment). Edinburgh itself is an amazing city, with something for everyone, great restaurants and bars. I would indeed highly recommend this for any keen golfer from anywhere in the world. Favourites:-Golf Course:- ArcherfieldHotel:- Raddisson on the Royal Mile with Parking, near the castleRestaurant:- Monteiths incredible food, atmosphere, a must tryEconomy Hire:- Friendly, informative, and really great car for 9 of us and 9 sets of clubs."
50,“Edinburgh transport brilliant”,"we went to Edinburgh sept 11th for 3 days..just would like to say how brill the bus service is there..you never have to wait very long for a bus to come along..never seen so many buses..also a day ticket costs you just £3 and you can get on and off as many buses as you like..very impressed,a single ticket is only £1.20..which is excellent value..wish i could say the same for (hants and dorset buses ) such a rip off..and they have taken many buses off the routes..not the best time to go though at the mo..as they are doing lots of road works in the city centre for..new trams for 2011.Edinburgh that is."
10,“Royal Mile 2 Apartment/Venere.com”,"A friend and I had a cofirmed reservation, made through Venere.com, in the Castle 1 property. I believe we were victims of a ""bait and switch"". The management company was Apartments Apart. When we arrived at the management office,(after waiting an hour for the person on duty to show up) we were told that we were booked into Royal Mile 2 and, even though we had a confirmation for Castle 1in hand, it was not available.We had chosen Castle 1 because of the great reviews we had read on Trip Advisor, including location, comfort and cleanliness. While the location of the apartment we were given was adequate, the other aspects were the opposite in every respect.The flat was extremely worn and shabby. Blankets covered the couch and chair in the living room, masking stains. The blinds in the kitchen were broken and we could not raise them. There was no light bulb in the vestibule. The shower walls were spotted with black mold. The living room pullout couch(on which I slept) was uncomfortable. In addition, streetlights flooded the living room and we had to cover the windows with the blankets from the couch and chair. It was also very noisy. There were inadequate linens- not enough pillows, cases and blankets for the extra bed. We had to take them from the double bed in the bedroom. The towels were thin and stained, etc., etc.Since we did not have a mobile phone, communication was difficult.The price we paid for this ""mistake"" was exorbitant.I have questions about the communications between Venere and your agent in Edinburgh. Where did the confirmation come from? Is this just a dishonest agent?This was quite a distressing experience. Fortunately, we were only there for two nights.On a more positive note, the Fountain Court apartment we had for the last two nights of our trip(Sept. 4 and 5) was lovely but the location was a bit remote.Judith Goldberg"
50,“wonderful time with Edinburgh Pass”,"We decided to take our kids (11&13yrs) to Edinburgh for the last day of our school holidays and were not disappointed............We bought Edinburgh Passes (adults £24 kids£16 each) Now I cant stress enough how much money we saved with these for the 1 day we were in Edinburgh.....We arrived at 10am and using the bus tickets(ad £3 ch £2.40 each) went to the zoo(family ticket £42)using our bus pass we went back into Edinburgh to the Loch ness 3D experience (family £16.50).........We went to the Dungeons (ad £15 ch £10 each)...........We then went to the camera obscura and world of illusion( ad £8.50 ch £5.75 each)..........We got the bus to leith for the Maid of the forth 90 minute cruise to see seals and puffins (ad £10 ch £3.50 each).........Bus back to Edinburgh and then the Caddies and Witchery tour (ad £7.50 ch £5 each)I only spent money on food while we were there (Saigon Saigon Dim Sum Restaurant 14 South St Andrew Street) the kids fell asleep on the train home, we will definately be doing this again as there are still some things I would like to visit.....The Edinburgh Festival was also on at this time...more free stuff to do.........."
40,"“Love the City, but new Scam to seperate American's for Dollars”","I love Edinburgh. It's a great old city with much to do and see. I attended Homecoming Scotland and it was great also even though it wasnt well marketed in Edinburgh and many seemed clueless that it was going on. Also participated in Clan Parade which was also a blast.However, after over 20 yrs of visiting this city, I ran into an unfortunate scheme which separates unsuspecting US tourist from their money. I made purchases at my previous ""favorite"" merchant. I say previous because after this visit, I probably won't be shopping with them again unless they change their policies, the Edinburgh Woolenmills group which includes Pringles among other shops. I made purchases in two shops on the Royal Mile with my credit card that does not charge a conversion fee. Without my knowledge or permission, the clerks rang up the purchases in US Dollars not GBP as they should have which left me with an approximate 3% conversion fee added to my total. I didn't discover this until it was too late to rectify. I spoke about this with another merchant who said that what they did was not lawful. I don't know about that, but I do know it was in my mind, unethical. From then on we were extremely vigilant when making a credit card purchase to make sure we were billed in GBP's not dollars. A little bit here, a little bit there and soon we're talking real money.Despite the merchant scams, I still love the old city and will return, probably next year but a lot more wary and cautious when makeing credit card purchases. If you can, I highly recommend getting the cash from the ATM and paying in cash. I found most of the ATM's but not all, so be careful, do not charge for withdrawals. I also have an ATM card that does not charge fees for either use of the card or conversion into GBP's .Go have fun and enjoy a great city, The bus system is pretty good too. We took the #15 from Lothian Street heading south to Roslyn Chapel. It lets you off about two blocks from the church an easy walk and the price if right. You can get an all day bus pass for 3 GBP's or pay per ride at 1.20 GBP. The day pass was a no brainer for us."
30,“Not Welcoming To Families Anymore”,New licensing laws are being strictly adhered to in Edinburgh. You will find it very difficult to go to a restaraunt with kids under 18 - impossible after 9 in the evening.We even got told we could not sit in the bar of our hotel after 9!! We had been on a tour of Scotland and had no problems anywhere else. It's a shame that a great city to visit is making it impossible for families to have an evening meal and a quiet drink.Licensing law madness!!
30,“Beautiful Maze”,"Of course this is a beautiful, historic city. The castle is not to be missed; people are warm. But with the crescents, street work, and paucity of street signs, it is the worst city to walk in I have ever encountered: easy to become lost and turned around. Be sure your hotel is in the city centre (and double check as hotels misrepresent themselves in this city) and use busses."
10,“These Brewers Fayres are a joke!!”,"Brewers Fayre restaurants, no matter how cheap they are stay away if you value your sanity.No doubt they receive many complaints from what I am reading on the review sites and probably don't care about another one. The service and staff at this rest should all be sacked. We waited over 1 hour for food, even the friends we met who ordered 15 minutes after us got served before us and I had to repeatedly go to the bar to request our initial drinks be served to us, I even offered to carry them myself (as is usual) to save time. The manager was indifferent and could not care less. The coffee when it arrived was cold and like mud, very nasty.This is the second time we visited these inns the other one was Bankhead Gate Glenrothes Scotland where the food was disgusting to say the least. AT least the manager there did try to rectify the situation though. In future we will NOT be using these establishments and will recommend to all our friends and on the review sites that people stay away. Once they lose trade like little chef did perhaps they might want to serve customers properly and train the staff better.Drinks are overpriced at £1.40 for a small bottle of coke, food is disgusting, staff have a could not care less attitude and really do not care. Not even worth going for the £9 menu, cheap food but very low quality! In fact one wonders what is in the food if it is that cheap."
10,“was my home now a distant memory”,its a nice looking town steaped in hundreds of years of history and each street has its own little story to tell..i left edinburgh a few years ago now and went back to visit.its all changed some parts for the better but others for the worse.its a very expensive place to live and work and would not recommend living there to anyone anymoreim glad i done the right thing and walked away from the town and place i once called home as its now no more..good bye new towni will enjoy the old times more in memory
50,“3 weeks in a wonderful country”,"Many will never think of Scotland as a place to travel. we spent 3 weeks based in Edinburgh - rented a townhouse - adult children visited at various times- traveled to outlying areas by city bus in several cases. toured to St. Andrews - best fish and chips anywhere!!the city is clean, people friendly, no honking cars, generally a peaceful place. You have to be prepared to climb hills, though. Museums are very interesting - the Mound has 20 million pounds on display.The City Centre is laid out in rectangular blocks, so you can go around the block. A Lothian bus costs 1 pound, 20 pence to any destination, but you need the correct amount as driver makes no change. For example, Rosslyn Chapel is 20 miles out in the country but still a city bus ride. A city bus goes to North Berwick - buy an all day pass so you can get on and off at the small towns along the way.Weather is normally on the cool side which is great for travel.So, consider Scotland - The Royal Highland Show in July is a fabulous event.Tom1"
10,“edinburgh what a rubbish tip !!!!!”,"when visiting Edinburgh on Monday July 6th we were very upset to see black rubbish sacks on every street, with their contents spilled all over the pavement. you may say this excusable for early morning but not at 16.00 hours!!! what a way to spoil a wonderful city ?????"
50,“Edinburgh”,Spent two days in Edinburgh fantastic place food really cheap and massive portions. Lots to do and see. Stayed in an apartment Holyrode Aparthhotel the best place I have stayed.
20,“My most annoying experience in the U.K. and Europe”,"We stayed in many hotels and B & B's on our recent trip and on the whole found the standard of accomodation good. Perhaps the most frustrating thing for me, as a female, was the lack of power points and mirrors within close proximity of one another. A must for drying and styling your hair. As an Australian used to power points in the bathroom this was extrememly annoying. Quite often there was a power point but no mirror and vice versa. I am amazed by this as I'm sure females have a lot of input into the layout, furnishing etc of these facilities."
50,“Great place to visit”,"Have just spent 4 days in Edinburgh and would recommend it to anyone wishing to have a packed few days away.The city is small enough to walk around, decent shoes are needed.The Loithan bus is great. For £3 each (adult) per day you can use the bus as often as you wish. The buses are clean, frequent, and on time and this was the best way to get around. They even go some way out of the city. ie Rosslyn Chapel.Another good way to travel if you wish to go a little further afield was the train. Again clean, fast and on time, and not too expensive, especially if you book online before.Load of attractions, some free others a bit pricey, most ok though.Loads of good restaurants , pubs, clubs, and a very eclectic mix of foods and culture.Loads of ""green space"" and the botanic gardens were really goodOverall we had a great stay and would recommend it too all ages."
40,“lovely historical city”,"we arrived at the airport and we had a taxi, but there is a good bus service which runs directly to the city centre for approx £6 each return and the drivers are friendlyPrincess st is closed to traffic as they are fitting tram tracks to the roadswe were very lucky with the weather, sunny and warm every day for the whole weekenddont stay in the hilton hotel in the haymarket - very poorbetter to stay in the premier lodge or apex in the gass market as this is the main place for tourists and the oldest pubs in the citythe grassmarket is very pretty and fairly safe with lots of police on patrolwe went to mary king close - £10 each - not a bad price and the tour guide was very entertaining and funnythe royal mile was very pretty and full of tourists and very little trafficthe night life is difficult to find for the older persons (35+) we tried the jam house on george st - it was ok but would not go backthen on the 2nd night we went on rose st which runs behind princess st - some nice pubs and some rough ones but all in all a better night - i would recommend the grassmarket for all your drinking and entainmenta walk up the castle can be quite a climb but worth it just for the view, beathtakingnice city and worth a visit but perhaps not a return trip"
50,“Edinburgh apartment - just what we wanted”,We just returned from a short break in Edinburgh. We stayed at Castle View Apartment in Cordiners Land in the Grassmarket (Edinburgh Old Town). There was just the two of us (me and hubby) though the apartment has two bedrooms. We loved the area and the apartment was cosy and spotless. The owner met us when we arrived and he was really helpful and easy to deal with. All in all just what we wanted. We would definitely go back and would recommend it to anyone visiting Scotland/Edinburgh. Sorry no pics of my own to add but they have a website that shows the flat - www.edinburgh-holiday-lets.comTrudyJM.
50,“Edinburgh is a very beautiful city...”,"Wow, I loved just walking around the city! I came into the train station that is right in the middle of the city. I went up both hills that both have picturesque views and I also paid the £12.50 to go inside the castle (to be honest, you can live without seeing inside the castle if you're tight on cash).I spent most of my time just walking around and it was great. The city has so much to offer in food/shops/museums and the people are very friendly.If you enjoy walking around a city and taking pictures, this is a city you must visit. I wouldn't go for more than 4 days however as the city is kind of small but it would be a great addition to any European trip."
50,“One of Britains best cities.”,"I am quite supprised at some of the reviewers anti-english experiences. I have just got back from a few nights in Edinburgh and found it a very pleasant and safe place to stay. We stopped mid-week when it is probably a lot quieter than the weekend and found all the staff in the hotel, pubs and resturants to be very friendly and helpful. This also extended to the bus drivers on the excellent bus service and the couple of taxi's we got.Edinburgh is a beautiful city and very east to get around. There is the Royal Mile tourist area and the Princess St shopping area which seem to merge nicely. There is a lot of road works at the minute as the are getting a tram system which will make getting about even easier.From my point of view I wanted a nice looking historic city, lots of olde world pubs and resturants and lots of visitor attractions to see. This city certainly ticks all the boxes."
50,“A perfect bite sized city that welcomes tourists”,So much to see and do and not enough time. For a small city Edinburgh packs a lot in. And the best bit is most of it is walkable (if you don't mind a few hills!). From the Edinburgh Castle sitting up above the city to the Botanical Gardens in the middle of a gorgeous residential area this is a very beautiful and peaceful city. Apart from the main shopping street which seems to be completely dug up for a new tram line. I suppose it it will be worth it in the end but looks like the locals will have a couple of years of disruption before they see any benefits.If you are into art there a several great galleries. The Modern art gallery is a bit out from the centre and weirdly is in a beautiful old building but its well worth jumping on a bus to get there. I would also recommend Cockburn Street and its little alternative shops and bars - just off the tourist trap of the Royal Mile but much more local feeling. And there are bars everywhere - a local told me if you don't like the bar you're in you can always just pop next door to another and see if it suits you better. Apparently they have more than 1000 pubs in the city but luckily not too many drunks (unlike Dublin). I was there midweek so maybe its wilder at the weekend. I'm definitely going back.
20,“DON'T STAY IN A CITY CENTRE HOTEL .”,"Are you looking to come to Edinburgh for a city break or a lovely holiday during the festival then if you come stay in the hotels on the west side of Edinburgh like the 5 star marriots either dalmahoy which has great lesuire facilities plus 2 good golf courses ,or the marriot glasgow road both serve great food also,and easy access for trips into town .There is also the post house hotel which sits next to the Edinburgh zoo .The reason for giving you these 3 five star hotels is, Edinburgh city centre looks like a disaster site due to the council wanting to put trams in this area, and who would want to pay 5 star prices to look over a street full of barricades over a mile long i certainly would not.Also if you are coming for the festival and you have heard about our festival procession then you may be disapionted as it looks like the work may not be finished in time,and may not go a head and that would be ashame as this starts the whole festival off and it is a great day for everyone .Don't take the car as the streets around the area are not easy for parking and if it is the first time to the city you may find your tom-tom will send you on a wild goose chase ,so come enjoy but stay out of town you'll see what i mean . ps you could look on the web for Edinburgh evening news ther always writting about the trams and the problems around the city centre due to these road works being carried out . Have the best of both world's stay outside the city centre and travel by bus to tourist attractions."
40,“So full of character I can't wait to go back!”,"Edinburgh is such a fabulous city! I've been twice and can't wait to return. A particularly great time to go is during the fringe festival (in August).The city has a vibe all of its own, and I found people to be really friendly. The touristy area (the royal mile) is still used by locals, so it has a nice lived in feel."
50,“One of the most beautiful cities”,"My boyfriend and i decided on a city break of 3 days. We decided on Edinburgh. It's one of the most beautiful cities i've ever been to.There is so much to do and we couldn't fit it all in, we would have liked a fourth day.Edinburgh Castle is amazing and you could stay there all day, it's fab for all the family. As you walk down the Royal Mile from the castle we went to Camera Obsecura, it gave me the biggest laugh of the year. It's great for kids and adults, the place really brought me back to being a child it was so much fun.We took a day trip to Sterling Castle, and Roslyn Chapel too. Sterling Castle is having works on it so part of it was closed and it wasn't as spectacular as Edinburgh Castle.Roslyn Chapel was just out of this world, i was stuned by the beauty and history of it. It has to be seen if you go to Edinburgh.And then we have Prince's Street, full of high street shops. I spent the majority of my money here. It's about a mile long and you would need a full day of shopping and a man to carry your bags."
50,“Weekend Break”,"Great place for a weekend break - lots to do , the castle is a must see, most of the 'top things to do' are within walking distance of each other. Shopping is great with lots of little coffee shops and bars to stop off in to revive yourself !If you have some time to spare - take a day trip to the Highlands -really worth the time out to see the other side of Scotland , away from the city"
50,“Wow!”,Magical and awe-inspiring - What more can we say...?
50,“The retreat for the urbanite”,"The place is so lovely, especially if you are travelling durin July, august & September. The weather is pleasant, If you rent a car and travel all the way to Dundee, the scenary is really mesmerizing. I Just would love to be there once a year if my finances are supportive."
50,“a great city to visit.”,"just spent 3 days in Edinburgh, this is a wonderful place to visit, spoilt for choice in restaurants and pubs. Great shopping too.It is also a city that is very easy to get around on foot and does an excellent job in catering for the tourist. Would recommend a visit to the castle and even though I am not really into royal stuff a visit to Britannia was superb. Could have stayed here a lot longer."
50,“Amazing Place!”,"Went to Edinburgh, Scotland for Christmas, 2007. Stayed at the Hilton Hotel. Great location and fantastic room. We got lucky and was booked on the side above the lobby; not across the street. Very friendly staff and clean rooms, couldn't ask for more! Shopping in Scotland is great fun and so much to see. Hopped on a city bus and explored Rosselyn Chapel on our own. Since it was closed, we walked around taking pictures. There was a German Market intown and we bought Christmas decorations and ate great food. Transportation was great; walked a lot and rode the buses. Since I was getting a Scottie puppy soon, I just had to buy a MacKenzie tartan blanket, scarf, and named him Piper T. MacKenzie. The people were very friendly and I can't wait to go back. Use KLM if you can..."
10,“be prepared for gruff”,"It is a beautiful trip by car up the coast to Edinburgh. It is also interesting (although expensive) to visit Edinburgh Castle. The tour guides are very informative, humorous and friendly. At night, the view of the city is breathtaking from any vantage point. Mary King's Close is THE TOUR to take of the underground.This is where the fun stops. It is an international city (good). It is more expensive and remote than London (bad). There is not a single space that is hanidcap or elderly friendly (bad). The people are ill-tempered, with the attitude that they are all quite clever (bad). The locals seem to dislike pleasantries when given to them, and do not express common courtesies back (please, thank you, smiles etc).Saw it once, will never go back, because the people are not at all welcoming. Not at all what I expected. Bads out weigh the goods."
50,“Scotland Summer trip”,Acer Lodge is a B&B that is very nice.Climb to Arthur's Seat provides beautiful view of cityTake bus ride before setting off within city so you know what you want to see.
50,“Breathtaking”,A glorious blend of old and new. Cannae wait to return.
50,“Awesome!”,"Awesome! That's what I have to say about Edinburgh! It was so full of history. We stayed right on the royal mile in a rental apartment and we could open our window and look out on the mile. We were only about a hundred yards down the hill from Edinburgh Castle, which was a wonderful attraction by the way. So full of Scottish and British history. We also went on the ghost tour of George McKenzie, the most haunted ghost tour supposedly in the world. It was awesome. We had a great guide and visited a wonderful cemetery and Covenanter's Prison, where we were treated to a dose of history and interesting situations. I loved it. Edinburgh is a beautiful city and we always felt safe there. Good pub food and a great city tour on the big red bus. Stayed three nights there but wished it was longer. By the way, we arrived in June and it snowed the first night we were there. Unbelievable and great. Cool wet weather the entire time but didn't mind it at all. Take an umbrella, cool weather clothes and some kind of windbreaker that will keep off rain."
50,“Overview of October 2008 trip”,"It was hard to find reviews on what October in Edinburgh was like when we were planning our trip. What a great city! We loved it. The biggest thing to inform anyone of is the weather. I never got it right even the day of. Layers doesn't even describe what you need to do. It rained one day - so I dress in layers with a sweater and trench coat. I was so hot that at my siesta in the hotel required a shower. The next day we woke to beautiful sunshine. I froze outside because I needed an additional sweater to my 2 shirts and jacket. Don't leave your hotel room without every piece of your typical layering outfit. Umbrellas are nice to have but make sure they can stand up to a stiff wind.As for hotels, we stayed on the university property at the Salisbury Green Conference center. It was very nice but I would suggest you stay closer to the royal mile if not on it. Every day started out in that area. It would have been wonderful to be staying there.Word of caution - the city buses are great when they are not redirected due to road construction. ASK THE DRIVER before he leaves if he is going to your destination. I grabbed the #30 into town but was shocked that it did not stop at the same location going back (thanks to a nice lady who gave me very quick alternative instructions). I think I was headed to the highlands or the outskirts of town. They are putting in a tram line and doing other major gas line work on the road. Didn't find one local in favor of the projectTouring was a breeze. I walked the first day on my own with a map in hand (hubbie was in a meeting). The second day I headed out again on my own and discovered the Museum of Scotland (highly recommend) and the Real Mary King Close Tour. From the museum I attached a photo of a gold bowl made for Robert the Bruce in the early 1300's - unbelievable! I entered Mary King tour completely unaware of what it was and felt that I left with a wealth of knowledge about life in the 1600's to 1800's. Saturday we took the hop on hop off bus tour. We combined tickets so we could get onto any tour bus and get to the coast as well. We did not tour the Brittania but had a wonderful lunch in Shore just a 15 minute walk from the yacht.When near the castle, find the guy dressed like Braveheart (Mel Gibson). He is very nice, intelligent and loved to talk about his 'role' in battle reinactments with his wife and kids. His 'donations' for photos and such are said to go to a local children's hospital.And finally, shopping. I was told that there are 26 kilt shops on the royal mile. The shop owner that told me that also said that many are not authentic and the labels say 'designed in Scotland' and were mostly imported. From a locally owned store I bought some scarves for presents. I brought home biscuits/cookies from the grocers at just 59p each. Very discounted from the touristy shops. You can even treat your friends at home to some mushy peas.Loved the city. Look forward to going back one day. Enjoy your trip."
50,“Surprising”,"I was in Edinburgh at the end of July. The beauty of such an old, well kept city was unbelievable. The Castle overlooks the city, and it was so large! I hadn't realized that it was almost a city within itself. Everywhere you'd turn, down old walks and breezeways, there would be a 'close' or a small square amongst the buildings in town. Gargoyles could be spotted on various buildings and at the time, the Fringe was just getting started, so there was some street entertainment also. Anyone having any interest in old architecture would be in seventh heaven there. The city is clean and safe. I was staying just off of the Royal Mile. The only thing that was ﻿annoying was the traffic. Because of the cobble stone streets, any car that passed sounded like a big truck going by. The weather was sunny and mostly clear, temperature in the upper 70 degrees and beautiful. I left Edinburgh for London and it rained almost every morning there. I have to admit that Edinburgh wasn't on the top of my list to visit, but I am so glad that I went there."
50,“Ancient city with friendly people”,"My husband and I recently traveled to Scotland to set up our daughter at the University of Edinburgh. Although we stayed with a friend while there, we traveled about extensively and ate at local places. This is a rather long review, but I have tried to include some of the subtle but important items that out-of -country travelers would not generally know.First, Edinburgh is a busy and very friendly, ancient city. The dominant feature is the Edinburgh castle which sits high on a bluff overlooking the city. The city is filled with museums, most of which are free. There are two royal residences in Edinburgh...Holyrood Palace and the ancient Edinburgh castle, which sit at opposite ends of the Royal Mile, a long and beautiful sloped road. A visit to both places is highly recommended. (At the Edinburgh castle, I suggest renting the audio-tour, which makes the experience more detailed. There are also tour guides, but sometimes Americans may have difficulty understanding their accent.) There are great shops dotted along the Royal Mile, and some of the prices are surprisingly good.Food: Because the dollar is devalued right now, all of the UK is relatively expensive for Americans. Meals can be very high. To save money and get great meals, check out the Tesco grocery store on Nicholson Street or the food Court at the Marks & Spencer on Princes Street (almost across the street from the Walter Scott memorial) . Both have an impressive collection of prepared sandwiches and other foods for lunch or a light dinner at very reasonable rates. In both places, the wine selection is extensive and very affordable.Other affordable choices include Thai and Indian restaurants, which abound in the area. Other than that, most restaurants post the menu, and the food is generally good. Pub food is especially fun and good. Pubs generally come to life after the work day and stay open very late. If you want pub food, go early on (football) game nights. Locals crowd their neighborhood pubs to cheer on the team. So, while you will definitely get a drink, you may not get a seat. (They form a queue to get to the bar too, which was refreshing to me as an American.) When you are ready to pay in any restaurant, ask for the bill. In Scotland, the server brings the bill only when you ask for it, not before.Coffee & Tea: When I traveled to Scotland 25 years ago, tea was the dominant drink, and the coffee was downright bad. Today, there are many more coffee drinkers and great coffee houses everywhere - with terrific, dark coffee. (And tea is now served via tea bags.) Take a seat and linger at a coffee bar. That is what the locals do.Travel: I strongly advise against renting a car while in Edinburgh. The city has terrific public transportation using an extensive network of city buses that come frequently and operate 24 hours a day. That is how the locals travel. A day pass on the city bus is 2.5 pounds, no matter how often you use it. A single ride is 1.1 pound. You need exact change to purchase a tcket. In the city center area, electronic signs at the bus stops tell you when the next bus is due, so you can plan your time.People in Scotland form a queue for everything, and they dislike people cutting the queue. It is important to be respectful. However, when waiting for the bus, you will find that many people form a single line for multiple bus lines. If you are waiting for a particular bus number, the people ahead of you may be waiting for another one. Be alert to move ahead at that time.The train station is close to the city center and the Royal Mile, so getting in is easy. From the airport, take a taxi if you are traveling with three or more people. If traveling with fewer, the local shuttle service (just outside the airport) delivers you to your door. If you are on a budget, take the bus. It picks up right outside the arrival doors and travels to the city center.If you rent a car to travel out of the city as we did be aware of the following:- there is a huge surcharge for extra drivers...about 20 pounds per day.- the most cost effective rentals are standard transmission; that is what locals drive. Automatics are nearly twice the daily rental rate.- It is the UK, so the driver's side is the right side of the car, and you drive on the left side of the road. The shift lever is on the left too, which is very tricky for Americans.-Some roads are single lane only with the occasional pull off to pass. Know how to reverse comfortably.To rent a cell phone while you travel, we had success at Hertz car rental (you can rent a phone without renting a car.) The rate was very good, and it gave us a way to connect with our friend and our daughter. The Hertz rental station is near the city center on Picardy Place and very friendly. Interestingly, the cell phone companies did not know how to rent by the day for us (or, they were too busy setting up cell service for the hoards of students to care about daily stuff.)Taxes and getting some of your money back: Scotland assesses a value added tax (VAT) to purchases. At some shops, they post a sign to inform tourists that the VAT can be refunded. In order to receive the refund, you must notify the clerk when you make the purchase, and they will compete a VAT refund form. You must then save your receipt and mail it for the refund. This is most useful for large purchases, such as sweater. Participation by shops is voluntary, so be sure to ask.Finally, the people of Scotland are polite and very, very friendly - even in the city of Edinburgh. While they may not be assertive in their approach, they are very responsive, kind and filled with information when asked. It only took a single question to have people offering all sorts of guidance. Do not be afraid to ask questions or to look like a tourist. They know and seem to like tourists very much. They are also immensely proud of their country and they want you to like it . Plus, Edinburgh is full of students, so the city is accustomed to playing host to a changing cast of people."
50,“Information for the short break visitor.”,"Edinburgh is one must-visit city. It has history, charm, art and architecture, that each time you visit, you find something new to do, see or learn. At festival time, first three weeks in August, the city swells its population but it still remains very easy to navigate. Arriving by plane, catch one of the Airlink buses from outside the terminal. An open return ticket costs £5 and buses travel every 10 or 15 minutes throughout the day with a reduced service in the early hours relative to the airport hours. When travelling back to the airport though, give yourself plenty of time as there are tram works in place in the city until 2011 and they are having a serious effect on Edinburgh traffic especially at rush hour. Most city centre streets are being dug up to carry out work on utilities to facilitate the laying of tracks for electric trams similar to a lot of European capitals. Personally i feel they will take away some of the charm of the Old Town area of the city and the amount of buses makes you wonder why its needed at all! These Airlink buses have a number of stops on the way in and the drivers will generally tell you which stop will suit you if you are staying on the western side of the city near the Zoo. The bus terminates at Waverley Bridge in the city centre. A smaller shuttle bus also operates from the airport which will drop you at any address within its operational area. This costs around £9 for a single journey. The city has an overwhelming bus infrastructure with Lothian Buses and First Buses operating both city and rural services. An all day ticket on the city services costs £2.50 and can be used until around 10pm. There are maps on the bus stops which are clearly marked and many have ticket dispensers next to the stops. One word of caution though, if you are travelling to Roslin Chapel, used in The DaVinci Code, the various web sites and literature says catch the number 15 from outside HMV on Princes Street. The bus leaves from the OTHER side of the road, on the Castle side of Princes Street and services are only every hour it appears, so dont miss the bus!!Princes Street must be the busiest street in Scotland during the day bustling with tourists and locals visiting the various business facilities. Give yourself a few extra minutes as the pavements can be thronged during festival time and the pedestrian crossings can be busy. There are a lot of shops and outlets on one side of Princes Street and a total contrast on the other, with the lovely park on the otherside. You can buy anything from a rain pancho to jewels on this street but not so much in the line of nice restaurants. At one end near the Balmoral Hotel is the John Lewis Centre on Leith Street. Here you will find many shops under one roof and across the road is a cineplex for that rainy day. At this end of Princess Street is also Waverley Bridge which acts like a hub. Your visit to the city centre generally starts and finishes here. The Airlink bus arrives and departs here every 10 minutes. the Waverly railway station which is the main terminal is also here. There are five main bus tours which leave from here too with frequent services every 15 minutes or so. You can buy a tour ticket which has hop off/hop on facility valid for 24hrs for £10 but the best value is the Grand Ticket, 4 tours with one ticket which is £13 adult, £5 child or a family ticket for £31 which is 2 adults and 3 kids. Children under 5 travel free. These tours use modern open top buses which are wheelchair accessible or the more quaint vintage Routemaster buses which have the old entrance platform at the rear. The buses stop at various attractions around the city and your ticket may entitle you to discounts to some attractions. Most of the museums in Edinburgh are free admission incidentally. The guides are well informed, friendly and humerous which is welcome on a rainy day. The bus lines can be very busy but with the frequency of them, you wont be disappointed. Why not climb the Scott Monument on a clear day and marvel at this city while you wait or sit in the park and wait for the cannon gun to go off at Edinburgh Castle at 1pm.Visit www.edinburghtour.comNo trip to Edinburgh goes without a trip to the Castle. This magnificent attraction stands proudly over the city, sitting high on a rock. The annual Military Tattoo takes place here in August during the Festival with thousands of people watching a musical and arts extravaganza of 90 minutes with military bands, bagpipers and displays and the odd burst of fireworks which resonate around the city each night. Tickets need to be booked early though, they go on sale in December for the following August but you may be fortunate enough to pick up returns at the Tattoo Office on Market Street and in some hotels. Get to the Castle at least 30 minutes before the show for comfort and if you are afraid of crowds, then give a few minutes after the show as everyone squeezes into the narrow Castlehill on their way down from the show. Visit www.edintattoo.co.ukLeaving the Castle you enter the High Street or Royal Mile. This beautiful street is a cobbled surfaced street steeped in history. It has many walking tours, some with the ""fear factor"" and shops, places to eat or drink and street entertainment is not very far away during the day. Take time to explore the many closes, narrow stepped alleys, on each side which lead down to the streets around.The busiest areas tend to be in the areas by Princes Street, the Cowgate, the Cannongate and the Grassmarket. All are visited by tour bus so hop off and explore and relax over a coffee in the many cafes like The Elephant House at George IV Bridge,just like a certain JK Rowling while she was writing about a certain young schoolboy. Some people will claim she got her idea for Harry Potter here but she had actually started the book before she moved to Edinburgh.The best way to discover the city centre is with a good pair of walking shoes and a map. Scattered around are a multitude of narrow streets which have the ""fringe venues"". There are hundreds of them during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, drama, music, arts, comedy and some with big named performers. Tickets can be bought on line or at the box office and some at the various venues. A discount tent also sells cut price tickets near waverly Station at Princes Mall. www.edfringe.comIn the evening take a stroll around the city centre and wander in to the many restaurants for something to eat. Many are recommended on various websites but sometimes use your instinct and you generally wont be disappointed. You can get all types of cuisine here from fast food to cordon bleu. Many websites list some of the best and better known, but sometimes you find a gem hidden away or chance some of the local pubs which serve food up until 9 or10pm. Near The Royal Mile you may have to wait to be seated but lines move reasonably quick as tourists come and go. On a recent visit I dined in Wildfire in Rose Street, a small pleasant 30 seater restaurant serving good food and we were not disappointed. There are many more which are just there to be found. Visit www.thelist.co.uk/places/restaurants where you can search by price, location etc. for Edinburgh and GlasgowMany of the city centre pubs are generally quiet early in the week but liven up mid week and week end. Even during the Festival in August you will have no problem finding a place to drink. Rose Street has a pub every few yards and is a favourite for a ""pub crawl"". Visit The Hebrides Bar on Market Street, it is small but busy as it is near Waverley Bridge and Edinburgh Dungeon. You can have a Speckled Hen or Famouse Grouse here to settle the nerves before visiting the Dungeon across the road. Music here at the weekend too. Visit www.edinburghpubs.co.uk or www.bestpubs.co.ukHotel rooms can be pricey in high season and many of the more popular hotels near the city centre tend to be expensive but no more than any tourist attracted area. We stayed in The Hudson Hotel on Hope Street whch is excellent as a base when visiting the city centre but its location means a lot of traffic noise with buses and emergency services passing regularly. The hotel itself I have reviewed separately. We used www.centralr.comSo thats it, this has been our experience and I know that many more reviewers on TripAdvisor will probably turn out a wealth more information and tips. I do not have any affiliation to any business or web site mentioned but found them very useful when researching our trip. Finally, do try some Haggis, Neeps and Tatties.Harry and Myrna, Cork, Ireland"
50,“Historic Edinburgh”,"If there is one city I would live in (in the UK) it would be Edinburgh. There is something about the place that makes me want to go back year after year.There is a buzz about the place, the city is alive with people and things to do and see and if you are keen on history, then there is plenty of that around too; Edinburgh has got a long and sometimes violent past (as most European cities have had through the ages), which is one of many reasons why I find this city so fascinating.Edinburgh is also crammed with culture. There is something for everyone here; great sights, great food, great bars and for all you shopaholics out there, the shopping isn't too bad either!We have only been during December when the weather can be a little on the cold side but this adds to the experience of being in Edinburgh near Christmas, which is an amazing experience to be had.Sure enough, Edinburgh won't be the place for everyone but those who appreciate a slice of Scottish city life, be it any season, will always be drawn to it charm."
20,"“Edinburgh - Way too overrated, overpriced and aloof”","After doing a lot of research and talking about Scotland for two years I finally went this summer and it was nothing like what I imagined after reading so many web sites saying such wonderful things about Scotland and Scottish people. I was even planning to relocate to Scotland. Perhaps my expectations were way too high.It’s true that the Highlands are stunning with their misty green hills and thousands of lochs but Edinburgh is a different story.Edinburgh must be one of the most overrated cities in the world! It’s true that the view from Arthur’s seat is great and Princes Street Gardens are a great place to relax but besides that and the Royal Mile there isn’t that much. And as for the “very friendly and hospitable people you would encounter”? Where were they? I found people to be aloof and inhospitable and I can remember only one person smiling at me. In other countries local people are at least courteous to tourists. I took the Scotch Whiskey experience tour on the Royal Mile – for £9.50 I got a bit of whisky, a glass and a guide who looked positively mad at all those bloody tourists coming to learn about whisky – after all it’s just water, barely and yeast damn it! Needless to say I didn’t feel welcome at all on the contrary it was like we were bothering our guide. Same thing in restaurants, even in the expensive ones and even if you leave a large tip (which you don’t have to do).If you want friendly and unpretentious people who smile and chat with you, you should go to Glasgow. Glasgow has undeservingly a bad reputation. In fact, it’s a very modern, cosmopolitan and friendly place with beautiful old buildings. People are nice and courteous and they actually smile at you. What they say in Glasgow is true: You will have more fun at a Glasgow funeral than at an Edinburgh wedding.”"
50,“Cant wait to return”,My husband and I recently returned from a wonderful vacation in Scotland. We spend 3 weeks there total and 1 week of that was spent in Edinburgh. Wow what a beautiful city and the people of Scotland are the nicest people you will ever meet. We were fascinated by the architecture and loved the history. I can see us returning again and again. We loved this city.If you ever get the chance to go remember you do not need a car to get around. everything in edinburgh is with in walking distance or you can take public transportation. A few must see's are the edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace. Also do go to the pubs and enjoy the pub meals that they serv. The food is wonderful and the beers are terrific. I am not a beer drinker and I really enjoyed the beer in scotland.We did not stay in a hotel we rented a private apartment near the old toll booth wynd and we spent allot of time in the old toll booth wynd pub. Our host for our apartment were the sweetest people. They made sure there was hot tea on when we arrived and homemade sweets and a welcome basket of cereals and bread and milk and fruits to start us off. When we return we will definatly stay in the same apartment. You couldnt beat the location and the hospitality.Do try and visit Scotland and most definatly spend some time in Edinburgh. you wont be disapointed.
20,“Not what I expected”,"I was in Scotland for the Six Nations Rugby match which I had been looking forward to but was terribly disappointed. The taxi driver from the airport was my first shock. According to him the English should stay in England. If I had known my way around I would have stopped the cab and got out but I didn't so I had to put up with him telling me what was wrong with us, all the way in to the city and when I refused to give him a tip he just said that was typical of the English who ""don't like the truth"".The hotel was a very good standard and my room was excellent but the bar staff were rude and surly, apart from one young lady who was in Britain on work experience and who was extremely polite.After the match I went back to the hotel but it was very difficult to get a drink in the bar and priority seemed to be given to locals.In the end I got fed up with listening to anti-English remarks being made by the people around me. I gave up on the idea of a drink in the bar and took a bottle of wine back to my room instead."
50,“a must to visit!!”,"My daughter is studying at Edinburgh University this winter. We are from Ohio and she attends Ohio State University the rest of the year.I stayed at the Clan Walker Guest House which is run by the most wonderful young couple. The people in Edinburgh are very friendly, helpful and I felt like I was at home. The transport system is amazing along with all of the hisorical sites, restaurants and pubs etc. I left with a heavy heart and plan to return!! Thank you Edinburgh for 2 of the best weeks of my life!!COP"
30,“Overview of Edinburgh”,"The heart of Edinburgh is divided into two main areas: the historic Old-Town and the modern New-Town.The Old-Town comprises most of Edinburgh’s oldest historical buildings, and many tourist spots which attract a lot of visitors each year.The New Town contains a lot of shopping centers primarily established on Princes Street.This surprising arrangement is actually the main advantage of Edinburgh's scenary making Edinburgh one of the most beautiful city in Europe. In one side, you'll get a lot of shops and in the other one, you'll have many attractions to visit such as the Castle, the Palace of Holyrood, Britannia or the several hills...Besides, the city is probably one of the safer big cities in Europe and the life is rather quiet but also quite expensive.Actually, I reckon that Edinburgh is a nice city to visit for a couple of days but not to live because the weather is very unstable and the city is itself quite boring after having pass certain hours..."
10,“Dont go for a night out here!!!!”,I organised a short weekend to edinburgh for all my friends ages ranging from 23 to 35 and now wish i hadnt done! We are from newcastle only a short trip on the train away and were treated like scum from the minute we got off the train. My opinion of large majority of scots has totally changed over the course of this weekend. We werent a rowdy group drunken animals on the rampage but a group of professional people out for a good laugh. After 5pm we were turned away from every bar in town just about and fobbed off onto the next one with the same poor excuses and shocking attitude as the last. As the night grew on everyone had just about gone their seperate ways in twos or threes and even then were turned away at the very hint of a geordie accent. The majority of people we spoke to were harsh and very forthcoming about us. We even went about with a couple of scots lads from glasgow who turned back just the same as us for where they came from and they were scottish! In all my friend and i got into only three bars from 6pm to 1am when we gave up and went back to our hotel. It totally wrecked our weekend and none of us will ever be returning and will tell anyone thinking of going not to go themselves! I was told all this by a fair few people from around the country including a few scots but chose to still go as i know alot of scots and as a former soldier served with them i wish i had listened! This is not how to treat visitors who are willing to spend alot of money and leave an impression on them well a good one anyway! Disgraceful! DONT GO!!!
40,“Unexpected snag”,"I have just come back from a packed and interesting 3 days in Edinburgh. Even the weather (in late October) was fabulous. BUT, the streets are paved with cigarette ends. It seems that the smoking ban has had the effect of forcing the addicted to chain smoking where ever they get the chance, which is now in the street. There are very few receptacles for the rubbish so the empty packets and fag-ends are thrown on the pavements. Outside shops and offices,where employees gather to smoke,little heaps of rubbish don't seem to be cleared away. I'm all for a smoking ban but we must take note of the consequences"
50,“A great day out in Edinburgh”,"A great day out in EdinburghGet up early and visit the Castle, at 1pm the Castle fires a single canon - originally so you could set your watch to the right time.Head down the HIGH STREET and turn left in to COCKBURN STREET for some unusual and interesting shops. Remember in Edinburgh your never far from a pub.On the corner of GEORGE STREET and CASTLE STREET you will find a restaurant called “Oloroso” which is situated on the top of the building (3rd floor) with stunning views of Edinburgh and the castle. You need to look out for the discreet glass door and lift. This is a great place for a coffee and they have amazing bathrooms.Head along to the Scott Monument on PRINCES STREET taking in GEORGE STREET and ROSE STREET. Well worth the climb to the top.If you still have the energy one of the best views of Edinburgh and Arthur’s Seat is from CARLTON HILL. Climb the columns and take lots of pictures. Head down the other side of Carton Hill in to ROYAL TERRACE and the top of LEITH WALK on the right you will find a gem of a deli called “Valvona & Crolla” which serves the best cakes and coffee in town, you can also buy the most amazing Italian food and wines. Look out for the statute of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the Giraffes.The main Bus depot is at this end of town so try and Edinburgh double Decker bus."
50,“Edingurgh in the Spring”,"My friend and I went to visit another friend who lives in Edinburgh. The people were very friendly and were willing to answer our questions when we told them we were dumb Americans. The city was beautiful although a little chilly; lots of fantastic architecture and historical sites. Princes Street is great for shopping and the Royal Mile is great for touristy stuff. We took a tour of the Royal Mile that was very interesting: Secrets of the Royal Mile. I strongly suggest hiking up Calton Hill; lots of good views and picture opportunites on the Parthenon replica. You should definately check out Roslyn Chapel (from the DaVinci Code). It's about an hour bus ride out into the country but it's worth it. A good place to have high tea is Tigerlilly, very posh so you should probably make a reservation. As for pubs, Sandy Bells has live music nearly every night, Frankenstein was great for dancing, and Bar Kohl has the most amazing shots you'll ever see (or taste). La Favorita is an awesome authentic Italian place in Leith. There are also tons of little authentic restaurants of all nationalities (Indian, Jamaican, Mexican, etc.). All of the ones that we ate at were delicious. All in all, an excellent city with something for everyone."
40,“Everything in Edinburgh is up-hill”,"We were in Edinburgh for 5 days in August for the festival and Tattoo.While the Tattoo was a slight dissappointment (they have singers and acts that are not pipers) when the pipers were on it was magical and majestic.Some of the street performers was also fantastic, funny, enjoyable and unbelievebale.Dundin Guest House on Priestfield had very nice rooms, great food, a lukewarm host and no general sitting room.Hewats is an owner operated restaurant at 19-21B Causewayside and it is fantastic. The best of our whole 19 day trip.The Witchery, near the castle was fun but oh so expensive.Check out the stained glass windows in Edinburgh Castle War Memorial room. Done by Douglas Strachan they are fantastic. He also did one in St Giles Cathedral."
50,“Absolutely Gorgeous City”,"Flew from London to Edinburgh, Scotland on July 22nd, 2006. Got a cab and went to our hostel, the Globtrotter Inn of Edinburgh. We were delighted with the security and rooms at the hostel. There were 4 of us traveling together and the room we had included 4 bunk beds new, made of wood, new matteresses, with curtains and privacy lights inside each bunk. Such a delight compared to the hostels we had visited the previous week in Ireland. In our opinion the Globetrotter Inn of Edinburgh is one of the best managed hostels we stayed in. We were there for 3 consecutive nights.Edinburgh as a city is absolutely gorgeous! If you love old architecture and double-decker buses, this is the city to visit. We spent over 1/2 a day wandering around the Edinburgh castle simply soaking up the atmosphere and yet didn't see all there was to see . You can rent audio equipment that tells the history of the castle and see it at your own pace or join a tour group.We had the most delicious dinner at a restaurant called Stac Polly on Grindlay St., Edinburgh. They specialize in authentic Scottish meals, including surprisingly good Haggis! The Lamb dinner was simply wonderful! The desserts melt in your mouth....can't say enough good things!Also, we hired Sam from Kayak Scotland and he took us out early on the Firth of Forth and was both an entertaining and informative guide. One of our group (age 63) had never been kayaking before and as a result of his instruction and attention to detail, she now is planning on taking her husband kayaking when she is home in the USA.Edinburgh as a city was charming, clean and easy to get around in. There is a fantastic bus system that is easy to use and will get you just about any place in the city you want to see. I strongly recommend a visit to Edinburgh, Scotland. There are so many castles to visit and so much old history, you may feel you have gone back in time!"
50,“Wonderful”,"Great city! We stayed 3 nights in July and it was wonderful!! You can basically walk wherever you want, it feels very safe day or night. The streets are lined with nice pubs, cafes and restaurants. We found the best burger place ""Wannaburger"". 100% scottish beef - great quality- best beef we had since moving to the U.K 3 years ago!The castle was interesting, I would recommend one of the ghost or history tours. It's also a good idea to start your trip with a bus tour, e.g hop on-hop off, which you can start from the train/bus station. It will give you an idea of the city lay -out.You will find the new city with all the modern shops on one side and all the all cobblestone streets and old town on the castle side. Just a 10 min walk.Perfect 2-3 day trip, if you're staying longer I would recommend a day tour to the highlands!Hope this helps!spyflugan"
50,“Family day out in Edinburgh with Children”,We were staying just outside of Edinburgh last weekend for a wedding. We had our 7 year old and 10 year old with us and spent a day in Edinburgh. I had looked on the web for some tips on what to do. We went to Camera Obscura and all four of us really enjoyed it. It is a couple of hours attraction but quite different from anything we had seen before. Lots of illusions and the Camera Obscura is especially good fun.We then got cycle taxi's that were fun down to Dynamic earth. The Iceburg was the best thing about it . The staff tried hard to pretend we were in tropical storms but the effects were just ok.The bus tour is good if you need to rest tired legs and in all languages.We even managed to squeeze in a performance by the Yarnbards at the fringe. They were very family friendly story tellers and we all laughed a lot. we would recommend them if they are there next year. Booking was very easy next to Waverley station there was a tent for online booking and also a half price ticket booth for tickets on the same day.
50,“People's Museum - little gem of a museum”,"Having just had the luxury of a day trip to Edinburgh from Kent, courtesy of the new budget airline EUJet, I do want to say what a wonderful city Edinburgh is. There is so much to see and do and it looks particularly beautiful with the Christmas decorations in Princes Street Gardens. The famous museums and galleries are excellent but it was the less well known People's Museum in the old toll booth along the Royal Mile that was a real surprise. A little gem. I'm looking forward to a return trip soon."
20,“Will not return”,"As a native born Scot, now an American citizen I came home to Edinburgh to visit family for a month. it was embarrassing, drunken young louts, profanity in the streets at night, violence when the pubs closed down, a nd I hate to tell you how EXPENSIVE everything was. then there was the hate newspapers and the BBC, reviling everying about America, our politics, our way of life.I shan't return and I told all my American friends not to. I had about 4 friends waiting for my return to tell them where to go to in Scotland in October. I told them to forget it - keep their dollars in the USA -- the Europeans can sink or swim as far as I'm concerned. It will be cold day in hell when I spend any of my hard earned American Dollars there ."
10,“Edinburgh was...”,"Edinburgh was...disappointing. Traversing the city by car was a nightmare. Our only saving grace was the purchase of the AZ Map of Edinburgh which eased our perpetual confusion. If you travel here be careful where you park. Parking fees are not always posted in plain view. Our room at the Holiday Inn on Queens Ferry was horrendous in service/information/cleanliness/food. 3 pounds 10 pence for a cup of coffee was a total rip off. We took a side trip to Pennicuik to the Edinburgh Crystal factory that was loads of fun. We blew glass and cut our own crystal. One thing that totally took us by surprise was the late hour for sunset in June. It was just setting at 10:00 P.M. My recommendation for anyone visiting this city is to take the bus tour first. This will give you an idea of the history of the city and things to see and do. It was the only thing in this city that was tourist friendly outside of the pubs. Must puchases for foreign travelers are: your family tartan, cashmere sweaters, and Edinburgh crystal. Food here is pretty much limited to pub fare. I couldn't wait to leave."
50,“Why no USA-Edinburgh direct flights?”,"Edinburgh is Scotland's best kept secret!Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful but why no direct flights from the USA.? I was directed via Glasgow Airport but why? I was amazed after a 2.5 hour surface transfer trip to Edinburgh to find planes flying into an airport barely 7 miles from Edinburgh City centre.!A total nonsense and USA airlines should hang their heads in shame for not providing a direct service to Edinburgh.I changed my schedule to fly home from Edinburgh to Salt Lake City via London Heathrow.The thought of enduring another enforced visit to Glasgow Airport from Edinburgh was incentive enough.Sorry Glasgow but you are downtown compared to uptown Edinburgh."
50,"“brilliant city, lovely traditional stores in cobbled streetsstreets in”","there are lots of fabulous things to do and see in Edinburgh and much has been written previously so I won't go on.But do visit William Street which is tucked away in the West End, this is a cobbled street with speciallity shops. The shops include The Embroidery Shop which sells traditional Scottish styles of embroidery and tapestries which make an excellent souvineer and momento.Visit and you will Enjoy"
50,“Magic in the capital city”,"I lived in Edinburgh for about 7 years and I just wanted to recommend that anyone who is yet to visit should book now! Edinburgh has a true magic about it, whether its sitting out in one of its many metropolitan cafe's in the summer or looking out over the city lights on a crisp winters night. Edinburgh manages to capture the diversity of modern life perfectly i think and remains one of the most beautiful historic cities in Europe."
30,“Razoável”,"A cidade é bonita e toda uma cultura que a define. Os pubs são optimos e as compras valem! A vida nocturna é boa, um ovo muito simpático e os acessos aos principais monumentos são bons. Os jardins muito cuidados e a rede de transporte muito boa. O hotel não se justifica pelo preço e serviços oferecidos."
50,“3 meses desbravando Edimburgo.”,"Falar desta cidade é dificil, pois ela oferece muitas atrações para quem busca cultura, a única cidade no mundo que no verão exibi quase 1000 apresentacções culturais em 1 mês.3 meses ali convivendo com milhares de turistas e Escoceses foi fantastico, uma verdadeira imersão cultural, a cidade de Edimburgo oferece boms restaurantes, hoteis e boas opções de lazer.Muitos museus grátis por toda cidade, visitando outras cidades da Escocia, continuo tendo a minha preferida, claro que Edimburgo."
40,“Caos ma ne vale la pena !!”,"Ce un sacco di cose da visitare, dai vialetti stretti, ai tunel e strade, da chiese ai castelli..insomma cose da vedere x tenervi impegnati x almeno una settimana !!Tra attrazioni piu valide castello di Edimburgo , passeggiata ai closes, chiesa s maria ..visite guidate cn tour di sera x vedere fatasmi opp di giorno x conoscere punti piu famosi!!Pub con stili davvero da andare vedere , tipi bashnee cn corridoi x tortura e celle tipo galere, opp worlds end pub cn un ottimo fish and chips!!"
40,“Überraschung”,"Soviel hatten wir von Edingburgh gar nicht erwartet und wurden positiv überrascht. Die Stadt hat uns total gut gefallen, viele alte renovierte Gebäude. Da die Stadt auf vielen Hügeln liegt hat man dauernd interessante Blicke auf die Burg, die Alt- oder die Neustadt. Da alles recht kompakt in der Innenstadt liegt kann man alles super gut zu Fuß erledigen. Der Eintritt in viele Museen ist frei (z.B. National Gallery oder National Museum of Scotland), der Eintritt in die Burg kostet aber 14 Pfund, was uns dann doch zu teuer war. Leider waren wir nur für 2 Tage, was absolut nicht reicht, wenn man sich noch etwas von der Umgebung (Hafen, Highlands) anschauen möchte."
30,“secondo me è importante sapere che..”,"secondo me è importante sapere che, se siete attirati dall'atmosfera magica che immaginate possa esserci in una capitale se vogliamo enigmatica come edimburgo, sconsiglio di andarci ad agosto.la presenza dei numerosissimi festival porta intanto un sacco di gente e soprattutto un sacco di artisti di strada. Questa cosa te la aspetti a Barcellona o in altre città e, secondo me, fa peredere un pò di fascino all'edimburgo che io mi aspettavo di vedere..La, secondo me, vera edimburgo si respira quando esci dal centro del caos e del marasma di gente del festival. Li respiri davvero un'atmosfera un pò magica alla Harry potter..viceversa se vi piace il caos e la confusione e vi immaginate edimburgo come una qualsiasi altra capitale europea allora agosto, il mese dei festival, fa per voi"
50,“Königliche Hauptstadt Schottlands”,"Edinburgh ist sicherlich aus guten Gründen ein Touristenmagnet. Schottland allein ist natürlich schon wegen seiner schönen Natur und bekannten Kultur eine Reise wert, aber die königliche Stadt ist einfach vielseitig. Man hat einen Strand, einen ehemaligen Vulkan, eine riesige Burg und noch weitere Hügel, tolle Museen und Tours sowie eine vielseitige Einkaufsstraße in der Neustadt. Zudem gibt es interessante Stadtviertel mit unterschiedlichen Kulturen."
