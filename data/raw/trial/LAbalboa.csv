40,Walk the alleys,"Balboa Island is the only island in Newport Beach with a sidewalk all the way around it. Unfortunately, it is temporarly closed do to social distancing considerations. The alleys are still open. They are 12 feet wide. People are staying to the right and social distancing. It's interesting to look at the rear of the houses.",Mike
50,A SAFE Walk Around Balboa Island during the Coronavirus,"You still have to exercise during the Coronavirus ... and doing so by taking a walk around Balboa Island was essential for my wife's birthday.It had been almost 3 years since we had done it. And the Bay Fronts never looked so beautiful. Balboa Island had imposed a ""One Way"" (clockwise) use of walking on the Bay Fronts. And while there were a number of people walking, it was seldom that we ever passed (or were passed) others. And a sand sculpture reinforced the need to have 6 feet between you and others.Stay safe. But getting some exercise during the Coronavirus, as long as you obey safe distancing, is still a good thing to do. And not a better place than here.",help32250

50,Fantastic Island,"I spent over 80 years visiting Balboa Island. During my younger years I camped at the end of Marine Ave on South Bayfront. During my teenage years I taught swimming off the pier. When I was married and had a family, we spent many years on Garnet St. We swam, fished sailed and used our power boat and paddle wheeler there. Since I love the Island so much, I go there frequently, even though it might only to buy a frozen banana on the Island’s main business street.",Marion Coddington

40,Boat Cruise Dear? Sure she says....Travel back in time. Take a boat cruse! Impress the Ladies !,"Yes with a little too much effort (like parking) issues. You can bring your date/spouse or both with you on a boat ride to Balboa Island. The cruse take about 9 minutes and you will not get wet. Usually. From The Pavilion area of the Newport Peninsula, you wait in line, looking for a smallish sign, and your car slides right on ( after a long wait) to get on the ferry boat. When you hit Balboa, the Main Street is located on the other side of town. The chances of finding a parking space is just zero unless you park in the residential area (without NO PARKING signs) and hike to the island’s main shopping street. There, you are supposed to buy a Balboa Bar (ice cream) or Frozen Banana (dipped in chocolate). You have just traveled back to the 1950’s in terms of food and ice cream choices. There are places selling things like shirts with Balboa Island printed on them. So, you might as well go big. Splurge on the Ice cream, put your name down for a restaurant, walk around. Keep walking the same direction that got you to the ‘Main Street’ and you will find the water. Everything is now...just fine. Yes, your spouse and girlfriend will be so impressed with you. Good luck going back ! The good news is you can return to your home or hotel without reversing your tracks. You just, using that trusty Apple phone, head back to the mainland by crossing the nearby bridge. Happy Trails !",998sunshine
50,If you are in Newport Beach don’t miss out on the true flavor of visiting Balboa Island.,Balboa Island has been a mainstay within the city of Newport Beach and today it remains as one of the top attractions in the city.The Island is between the Balboa Peninsula and the main Balboa Island and has a very small car Ferry connecting the two. This Balboa Ferry carries only 2 cars; many passengers and a great deal of bikes from early morning till late at night! When you cross on a weekend day the ferry is crisscrossed by many small boats and many large sailboats.This is a man-made island yet it now affords a great time for shopping; walking; jogging or simply finding a great restaurant to enjoy a great breakfast; lunch or dinner.If you are in Newport Beach don’t miss out on the true flavor of visiting Balboa Island. You will not be disappointed.,THOMASFROMDAMASCUS

Don't miss the Museum, as it tells the story of this little island from the very time, 100+ years ago, when was developed from a sandbar to the charming village it has become.

50,Spent the afternoon shopping at the small businesses!,"It was ""shop small businesses day"" and my daughter and I spent it on Balboa Island going from one cute shop to another.Just one adorable shop after another! Each establishment had its own look and theme along with some very unique shopping experiences. I especially enjoyed the shops that featured handcrafted one-of-a-kind items -- there were several.We had intended to also eat at one of the many restaurants on the island, but shopping took up all our time. There were just so many interesting shops, eating just didn't seem a priority. It was, however, nice to stroll past the eateries and watch the various meals being brought to patio tables.Since it was the end of November, it was a bit too chilly for us to join the long lines at the frozen banana shops. Yet, not to worry, there were plenty of youngsters and their families enjoying the famous treats from the frozen banana establishments. I wouldn't be surprised if some families came to the island specifically to experience the frozen treats.Parking is not easy to find, so if you can carpool or bike to the island, it is highly advised.",Amelia P
40,Nice downtown area,"There is a nice downtown area with some cute shops where you can buy sweets, ice cream etc.The waterfront near the ferry is also nice.

30,It’s all about the sun and the beach ...,"Okay, here are some nice things about Balboa Island ...• the beach is very nice, although it is not really a swimming or surfing type of beach. The beach seemed to be well maintained and clean• the little town center is nice, but it is mostly geared for tourist• there are a few restaurants and sports bars.Now comes the down side ... during a nice and sunny weekend the traffic to Balboa Island is bumper to bumper for at least five miles and then finding a place to park can be problematic. From what I can tell, there are no free public parking on the island. The sports bars on the weekend are very crowded and very noisy.I’d say Balboa Island is a nice place to take a walk and enjoy the sun, but I’d say do it on days other than the weekend ...",treerod1
50,The Best Walk in Newport Beach,"We have been to Newport Beach at least 10 time over the past 10 years. Each visit has included at least one walk around the shoreline of Balboa Island.

It is a lovely place for lunch or brunch.",Fletch1946
50,Amazing plac,We were lucky enough to spend a few nights at a friends house in Balboa Island and it was the highlight of our trip to USA and Mexico.

Just a wonderful place to visit.,Peter S
50,Worth a visit,We took the ferry over and walked from the ferry to Marine St. It was a stunning walk and I wish we had more time to walk further and explore more. We ate lunch and checked out some of the stores. Would love to go back and explore more.,Samantha S
50,Love this quaint little island,"It is very difficult to find parking, we'll grant you that. But... it's really worth checking out this beautiful little island.

The whole ""feel"" of this place is laid back.",Janice K
40,"Nice, Quaint Island","While sightseeing around Newport Beach, we saw that Balboa Island was easily accessible from a main road near our resort. So we drove over to check it out. We parked on the main street and strolled by the many small shops and eateries. We were hungry for a quick snack and found a nice bakery that also served frozen yogurt. We then got back in the car and toured some the rest of the island that was primarily residential. We then found the Balboa Island Ferry which made it easy to connect to the peninsula where we were able to find bike riding along the coast line and plenty of beach space. Overall, we enjoyed the hour or so we spent on the island.",MycoEJ
30,Well... it’s island but not much to do there,Balboa is mentioned in every Orange „What to do” - but personally I am not aware of a single reason to go there. 1/4 miles of „promenade” with some lousy boutiques and even worse restaurants. Most of the food places close before 9 pm (even on Sat evening). On top of that parking there is a problem and if traffic is heavy - You can spend a lot of time just to get in and out. Choose other locations to walk/ eat & shop in Orange! :),Grzegorz S

50,"Balboa Island, Newport Beach California","Take the cute car ferry to the island, takes only minutes and saves a 12-mile drive from the mainland. The island has a short 'main stree' with a number of restaurants, bars, souvenir shops, ice cream and real estate offices. Parking is a huge problem unless you're lucky enough to get a spot on the street. The island is small and very densely packed with small homes and vacation cottages.

40,"Not really that much to do, but amazing properties to see","I read that Balboa Island is the second most expensive real estate market in the U.S. after Manhattan. Walking around, it seems obvious. There are lush, expansive homes thanks to the great wether and a lot of water front since it's two small man-made islands. We spent a couple hours just walking the perimeter of the island and visiting the main area which is just across the bridge from the mainland. Parking is probably going to be a problem if you come at a prime time so good luck :) You can park on Balboa Peninsula or the mainland and ferry or walk over. It's a great way to spend a morning or later afternoon (avoiding the crush of midday)..",cbeard

40,Beautiful location with a nice Main Street,Great little peninsula location over the water from Newport .. accessible by road or on the little car ferry which takes 2 mins over the harbour ... we went whale watching and the boat departed from Balboa island .. on one day we took the hotel bikes from our Lido House hotel and cycled the boardwalk and all over the village .. well worth checking out and having a famous frozen banana on Main Street !,Tony F

30,"Sadly, the main street has changed drastically in the last few months","Have gone here for years and years--with family, friends, houseguests. After not being here for a few months I took a houseguest to have lunch and shop a bit. What a disappointment. In just a short time so many of the good places are gone--either replaced by businesses with junk, or ones you know won't be there by summer--or are just empty. Even trying to find a decent place to have lunch was a mistake. Most restaurants weren't open or were empty. Our choice of a place was sadly a mistake as well. And this was a Saturday. I'll skip the once favored little street with the next houseguest.",JoaninFrance
50,Quaint shopping/dining with a board walk and the best ice cream bar I’ve ever had!,"Went with my family early evening in January. Bring a sweatshirt, enjoy a stroll among quaint shops and restaurants, beautiful boats and homes, and be prepared for the best chocolate-dipped ice cream bar you’ll ever have (the Balboa Bar!). If you are feeling adventurous, you can take the public ferry across to the peninsula (not very far).",Taylor A
50,A charming little island with 3-4 streets crammed with attractions,"Right on the water, separated from the open Pacific by a thin peninsula, this small island can be accessed by a single bridge. Its 3-4 streets are crammed by shops, small stores, restaurants, bars, museums , a couple of chapels, etc. The best way to see it is on foot, wandering around while enjoying an ice cream and settling down for snacks or a full meal. Several excellent restaurants call the island home.",Gabriel H

There was a lot of things to do activities shopping and many good restaurants. You can have the option of taking the the ferry over by walking or driving your car. We went by car and paid parking at the Beach area. I will definitely go again for another day trip even if we don't do whale watching we'll go in the summertime and enjoy the beach.",lindadY4789VA

50,Nice Island!,What a nice little island with it's own charm. This island is definitely worth checking out. Plan to walk around since traffic getting here is a not great.We came during Christmas. We unfortunately missed the Christmas Boat Parade (which is the highlight of holiday season)..but we were able to walk around and see all of the beautiful houses who went all out on decorating. Apparently that is one of the big attractions for the island. They even have boat tours to see all of the decorations on the houses.The main road on the island is where all of the shops and restaurants are. It's not huge and each place has it's own appeal.We stayed at the Balboa Bay Resort two miles away and just walked here. Its a 40 minute hike but doable and worth it if it is a nice day outside.This place is a must see if coming to Newport! We will definitely be back,PennStateShah

50,Charming village in the middle of Newport Harbor,"A wonderful place to stroll, shop and eat ... whether it's a full meal or just a frozen banana. Unique among the islands, Balboa Island offers strollers a pedestrian walkway that circles both the big and little islands. The walkway, about 2.8 miles in total, comes with lots of benches where you can watch the boats or simply sip a cup of coffee. Marine Ave is the heart of the shopping and eating area, with the charming chapel at St John Vianney. But much of the joy of Balboa Island is to be found by walking the residential streets and experiencing the sense of welcoming calm that seems to radiate from the homes and cottages. Narrow streets, but that adds to the sense of village charm.",Bill M
50,A Throw Back To Gentle Times!,"Balboa Island is one of my favorite places! I lived a few blocks away snd walked the two islands daily! At the crack of dawn you can sometimes see and hear the sea lions greeting the day with joy and in Spring discover little brown bunnies hopping between the perfectly manicured gardens surrounding the charming and eclectic showcase inspired homes! The fragrance of roses blooming and the hummingbirds busily drinking nectar and dew is a feast for the senes... wether i walk alone or with my young granddaughter ... she loves to play in the sand- its a treat! Fresh coffee at Starbucks and yummy donuts at Dad’s Original Frozen Banana are great ways to start the day! And do not firget the famous Hippo Cookies! DELICIOUS! Ypu can have a huge breakfast at Wilma’s Patio too! And light a candle at St. John Vianny.. or just get a good workout! That’s all before lunch! Rent a Duffy and see the island from the water is great fun too! Or stroll down Marine Ave. and shop in the wonderful shops! I love so many of them! Its a great way to find little treasures for gifts, hime and clothing too! I love Magnolia Charlie for kids clothes ! So many Lunch options- the Village Inn is great... for happy hour too!

If you take the ferry, right as you get off, there’s a chocolate strawberry stand. Those are literally the best strawberries I have ever had, make sure you try them!! We enjoy walking through the neighborhoods and looking at houses and vegetation (probably because we live in the desert and it’s mesmerizing to us). Support small businesses and enjoy!!",Mayra D
40,Fun place to see boats,"Small place but nice to visit. Lots of boats to look at. The small streets are busy with traffic, but we readily found a space to park when we visited on a week day.

50,Hints for Balboa Island.,"Since parking on the island is tough, consider parking on Bayside and walking over the bridge. It's about 2 miles around the big island and a mile to circle the little island. Stopping at ""Dad's"" or ""Sugar and Spice"" for a frozen banana or a Balboa Bar and riding the ferry are absolute Must do's. There are several places on the island to eat a meal and they are all good.",Mike
40,Not much to look at but great for a safe walk,"We visited during an evening so everything was pretty dead, but we enjoyed walking along the waterfront and peeking into the beautiful homes nearby. We made our way into the seemingly center of town where there were restaurants, shops, and balboa bar shops! It was a really low-key way to hangout with friends. It may be different during the day, but I liked visiting in the evening so we could enjoy the streets to ourselves.",imskimmy
40,Nice beach,We thought the ocean side of the island was beautiful. Great parking availability and clean restroom facilities. The harbor side of the island is cheap looking and feels seedy.

It is all very charming.However, this is not Disneyland. It is a residential neighborhood. There are people who live there need to get off the Island for work in the mornings and to get home in the evenings. Please be considerate of those needs when you visit.",dhacker2018

50,Balboa Island,"Balboa IslandNewport BeachBalboa Island...Ahhhhh so relaxing!We stumbled onto Balboa Island years ago after a trip to Newport Beach. This is just one of the coolest places we've ever been to. Balboa Island, which celebrated it's centennial in 2016, is a man made island that is full of little cottages and magnificent water front homes.Unless you have a lot of money, it's likely you'll be like us and only wish you can live here. I doubt you could buy anything for less then $2,000,000. Balboa Island is one of the most expensive real estate markets in North America outside of Lower Manhattan. A two-bedroom house with a water view from the living room can cost about $3 million.The perimeter of the island along the Bayfront is dotted with piers for the homeowners' boats. Interior new construction sells for 4 million. Bay fronts range from 3.5 million - 9 million.But definitely go visit! The main street is Marine Ave. Marine is dotted with little shops and restaurants. Have a frozen banana at one of 2 shops that have been there for generations. The walk around the island in about 2.5 miles. Its a great stroll which we find very relaxing and very enjoyable.Thee are 2 ways to get on the island. There is a small bridge or...our favorite is the ferry! I've written about the ferry before.Be sure to catch the car show at the Fun Zone every Sunday morning!",367Advisor
50,"It May Be Small, But It's Full of Life","Balboa Island is a well-known place in Newport Beach for a reason. It contains multi-million dollar waterfront homes and private piers. The streets are lined with shops and cafes. On the water, you can see people doing paddle board or riding their boats. There are homes that are for rent if you want to spend your summer here and decompress. The only big problem when it comes to Balboa is the parking situation! Don't forget to try the frozen banana, as it's a famous snack here. During Christmas, the island is even prettier since people decorate their houses in colorful lights. In fact, there is even a harbor cruise that you can pay to ride on to explore the homes with decorations.",Miranda C

50,Expect Nothing and Get Into the Atmosphere,"Balboa island is packed with expensive houses, boats in your liquid back yard, fun, if not great restaurants, shopping, and very contented locals. Driving downtown is not difficult. Finding a place to park is very challenging. The town, most of the time, is busy by 10 AM. There are a few residential streets that have parking. However, that can mean a long walk to downtown. A shopping center, across from the main entrance to a Balboa Island has signs warning you about the possibility of your car disappearing. If able, consider using bicycles. There are a few parking spots outside Balboa Island and a few more located in the residential areas of the island. Have the right attitude, find a place to park, and likely, this will be a very nice experience for you. Expect mall style parking, exotic restaurants, and you will be disappointed.",998sunshine

Shop the cute stores, Eat, especially Dad's Balboa Bar, a Must! Good doughnuts there, too. Walk all over the main island and cross over the bridge canal to the smaller part. Have fun on the beach, any beach. They are open to all. Rent a standup paddleboard or a kayak. Go to the little museum and learn how the island was created. Rent bikes. On the peninsula side take a boat for the day to Catalina. Take a narrated boat tour of the bay. Rent a Duffy boat or a speedboat or a jetski. Take a dinner cruise. Eat at the Crab Cooker. Eat at the Pavilion and learn its history. Eat appetizers at Newport Landing. Take a gondola ride. Go deep sea fishing. Go boogie boarding in the ocean.

The shops are amazing and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. The ice cream and chocolate covered bananas seemed to be a favorite to everyone although, I did not try them. Overall, this is a cute little shopping and dining spot, not much for kids to do, but recommend you try it. On the way back, the kids were able to ride the Ferris wheel and rock climbing wall up a palm tree. This is definitely a must try.

Walking is the best way to visit the place (or Uber) because there is little parking in the summer. We had a nice breakfast and a pleasant walk around the area. There are some nice, if expensive shops. It is much quieter here now than when I was a teenager when it was wild! We noticed a few things that they need to work on..a couple of striped rusty bikes we partially blocking the sidewalk. The city needs to cut them off and toss them before someone trips on them. Nice place to spend a day..or less.",Cynthia A
50,Quaint Little Island!,"We enjoyed an entire day here during a trip to the Newport Beach area and were so impressed! This little scenic hamlet offers excellent dining and shopping and some amazing views! The dining options range from Mexican to seafood to Italian to burgers to hot dogs, etc. The shops are all locally owned, NO CHAINS! You will find some really high quality merchandise instead of the usual cheap souvenirs. Marine Avenue is the main drag with all these awesome things to see and do. If you are adventurous, try the “frozen bananas” available at several of the stands along the way. Be aware that parking can be challenging, so arrive as early as possible to get the best location.",Jay B
50,Great Family Visit,"The island is a great place for a family to visit. Definitely not a nightlife scene if that's what you're looking for, however if you have little ones, a day trip is great! If you're staying longer, there are hardly any better places you can go to have a relaxing stay than Balboa Island.",AZdesertdingos

50,Balboa Island,Balboa Island is a real nice area for family or couples. We came here a couple of times. Walking through the streets where are the shops are is great. We had breakfast here one morning at Wilma's Patio ( a little overpriced) and my family did some shopping in the little boutiques which were very reasonably priced. The Balboa Candy store was GREAT and there's also a Starbucks and a Frozen Banana place. Many stores to shop at. Across the bay by ferry is a small amusement park with a small boardwalk and more of the similar shops. We ate dinner here one night at the Harborside Restaurant. We were there a little early for the summer season but most places were open. There's also a pier and a large beach with several bars and shops. It kind of reminded me of the villages along the Jersey Shore. Good place to visit.,Terry F
50,Fun fun fun!,Lots to see and do here and cute restaurants as well. A must is to get a frozen banana with chocolate and almonds!,HappyLife
50,Prettiest island ever,Would highly recommend this island to all. The walk down the street savoring the frozen banana and Balboa icecream bar is amazing. The street is full of pretty stores. Further down the walk to the ferry you will come across the prettiest houses ever. The ferry itself is a short one. Across the ferry there is a fun zone and also the beach. All in all a perfect day is garanteed.,Saumya M

40,Great walk around the island,"Cute island that you can walk around and look at all of the interesting houses and boats. There is a main street with shops and restaurants. You can take the ferry over from Balboa, I would recommend this on the weekend because parking on the island is very limited. There ferry is just a short ride and runs constantly.",debrick79
50,Feels like You're In A Magical Place!,"Take the 10 minute ferry ride, it's fun! If it's a weekday, drive your car onto the ferry, it's almost as cheap as walking, and you'll have plenty of parking on Balboa Island. Also, it's a LONG walk from the ferry to the shopping/restaurant district. The architecture is quaint and there's a definite laid back vibe.",Vacationers62

We lived taking the ferry to the island. Just $4. A quick trip, but fun. The little stores around the island are so cute and not too expensive. People here are warm and friendly. The various out door cafes are cute and have plenty of delicious options for anyone. The pier and the beach was not crowded at all . We loved it.",Susie M

50,"Any time of the year, a walk here is always delightful.","We can usually walk the perimeter of both Islands in about an hour. We are here for the several restaurants we favor, a long walk, a more modest one if time is a factor. Several times over the years when we have a remodel or washing machine problems, we come to use the laundromat on Agate, near the ferry. Shops on Marine offer many items, and at Christmas it is always a stop for Newport themed T-shirts for the last minute gift, someone you did not expect is coming, and while they may not have anything for us, we will have something for them. I have purchased several paintings from the few remaining art galleries on the Island. They adorn my walls and guests seem to enjoy their beauty. Balboa Bars always are a treat, do you favor one shop over the other? Is it just who has the shortest line, or is loyalty to one? With really no difference between the products, whom do you choose. I always like to watch the several letter carriers roaming about, I used to be one, and door slots and steps up, small mailboxes and turnover of residents, makes me admire them. I know what a difficult job they do. We have friends who used to live on Carnation, what a pleasure to have parking during the Boat Parade at Christmas. Or know the bartenders at The Village Inn. Continue to enjoy this always, parking is getting a rougher these days as others discover the island charm.",James Weaver
50,Love this place!,"Love Balboa Island! Great shops, restaurants, etc. Rent a bike and ride around at your leisure! We'll definitely go back to this place. Would love ot rent a little house over there and stay for a week!",kas9898

50,TOOK THE FAIRY BOAT ACROSS TO BALBOA,"My mom, myself, my son and daughter just decided to get out of the house and take a drive a month or so ago. I remembered Baloboa Island down in Newport Beach and had not been there in many years. So, that's where we went. You follow the signs down the residential little street, and you will see the entrance to the fairy boat straight ahead of you. Pull up to the stopping point, (be prepaired to hand them the $5.00 cash) for getting you to the other side lol. When it is time for you to load- you will simply pull your vehicle forward onto the actual fairy boat until they tell you to stop. Place your vehicle in Park (you can turn the car off, or just simply place it in the park position, leave it running if you 'd rather, and enjoy the simple, short, but very pleasant smoothe ride across to the other side. There is a parking lot right there as you exit and they have the instructions for paying the parking fee on the light pole. You will need to either call or doownload an App on your phone first. Once that's done, you will be able to choose your length of time and options as well as paying options. The App will even keep track of time for you and alert you via your phone .Everything is pretty much closing around 9:00pm (even though the bars are open of course). But there are places to sit and just enjoy the views. Smaller places with a variety of snacks and drinks and such. We actually had a simple, but relaxing and enjoyable evening and got out of the house for a bit. I recommend it for all ages.",surfsideseohb

We left from the RV park at the Back Bay and walked over the bridge to Balboa Island in a group of about 23 people. we stopped and snapped pictures,as we entered the island,of the lovely boats and houses.We enjoyed peeking in the windows of the businesses along the main street and proceeded to the end of that main street. We turned right and viewed all the beautiful Bayside houses with their colorful flowers. After eight blocks we took the ferry over to the peninsula and enjoyed the long walk towards the wedge to view the surfers. Don’t miss this in the fall or winter. I suspect during the summer there’s hardly room for anyone to walk on the sidewalks. Not to be missed.",mariposa67

50,Beautiful Island,"Balboa Island is a beautiful, relaxing, fun, active place to visit. Finding the island was very easy and parking was no big deal either. A cute place with lots to do like shopping, or picking your favorite restaurant to eat at. There are coastal tours where you can go out on a boat looking for whales and dolphins, piers to go out on and you can even ride a ferry across the peninsula. ( whether you just sit and ride, take your automobiles, or bikes across) The cost for my husband and I to take our vehicle across was only $3 so very reasonable. It was a wonderful place to spend the day!",Diane F
50,Beautiful!,"This was our second visit here in twelve months: the weather, first time, was damp and pretty miserable but we couldn’t fail to see how gorgeous it would be in the sunshine and, in the recent heatwave, it sure was!!Pedal bikes for rent and (the reason we were there) a good choice of seagoing activities. Plenty of parking.There is a nice selection of gift shops, restaurants and bars and the whole area was spotlessly clean. It has a really chilled, laidback vibe about it though I’m guessing that midsummer is probably a different story.Well worth a visit . . we’ll certainly be back when next in LA!",Westwick

We’ve been to the beautiful cliffs overlooking the ocean and those were awesome as well, but some of the other Southern California sand beaches have been less than the best. We are from Florida, so our standards are pretty high.We found it to be clean and beautiful. It wasn’t overly crowded on a weekday and parking was easy to access. We crossed over to it in our Jeep on the Balboa ferry which as quick and easy.Dogs were welcome throughout the island and also on the beach during specific hours.Plenty of restaurants and shopping within an easy walking distance if you’re in the village shopping district.

After visiting Balboa Island I'm not quite sure that it compares to our beach town because there is no beach. It does have a shopping street that is very charming and reminds me somewhat of a beach shopping area on the east coast. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit Balboa Island if you're just a visitor to the area, I think it's a local thing.",Morris
40,Check out the real area,"This is where the term ""Beach House"" came from. Although very pricey, the main street is fun to walk through, funky little touristy shops, bars. Parking is hard but use it as an excuse to tour the neighborhoods. It only takes an hour or so and after that, you will be ready to leave but a fun experience. I lived here when I was going to college, only rode a bike around. You will find the climate very low key and fun. Do just that!!",david k

Grab a sundae or shake and take a leisurely stroll , checking out the quaint waterfront (holiday rental) homes. The small sandy beaches are ideal for water traffic watching or catch the rowers training. Make sure you head back over to the fun park at the wharf and ride the Ferris wheel at sunset. View from the top is a winner; off to the right is the ocean to the left to Balboa Is.The waters took on a soft salmon colour, pink hues of the sun dropping and the telling of a bumper day coming tomorrow.Enjoy!",MC M

50,Holiday Lights on the Water,"I was really impressed with the organization of Davey’s Locker harbor cruises to see the holiday lights. It is a well run operation and the staff, crew and vessels are all top notch.I appreciated their advice via my email confirmation regarding parking. We parked at the Edgewater Garage which has valet and is covered. I was worried they would be full by our late afternoon arrival, but they weren’t. They are very close to Davey’s Locker and were very helpful in telling me how to get there. So thanks to Davey’s Locker for that small tidbit of advice, as it made our visit much easier.Our cruise was on the Ocean Explorer and the max amount of guests per cruise is 102 for that vessel per a crew member I asked. It’s a big boat and had a comfortable crowd. We met both really nice people and people who need lessons in politeness during our cruise. The crew was great at all times...I’m referring to my fellow passengers. Some were out and out rude. Really, no one is more entitled than any one else, but some people sure acted like it.The only suggestion I would have for Davey’s is a new playlist of Christmas songs that plays as you cruise. It’s a nice idea and one I wasn’t expecting, but includes way too many Country selections and some songs that were downright sad and close to depressing. With all the Christmas music out there I think they should revamp it a bit.Overall this was a fun experience and one I would do again snd encourage others to experience. If you go, the best views will be on the right side facing the front of the boat. You are free to move around during the cruise, but I noticed this side seemed to have the best views throughout. Also, don’t forget to put money in their tip bowl as you disembark!",Elizabeth W

40,Step back in time,"Took the ferry from Newport Beach to Balboa with our cruisers. Super quaint main shopping and food strip next to the bridge over to the mainland. It felt like we stepped back in time. Although there was one coffee chain there, most of the boutiques and food/restaurant offerings were unique and local. Definitely an older crowd on this island. Cruised around on our cruisers. Architecture is very different than that of Newport Beach. A different world altogether. No other people on bicycles but lots of cars with older drivers. We would probably just take the ferry next time and walk around the island. A lovely way to spend a few hours.",whistler4me

50,Most Beautiful area in the OC,"Balboa Island is one of my favorite places in all of Orange County! The boardwalk is the perfect walk for young ones (it’s about 1.5 miles from start to finish) and has so much natural beauty. You may see seals perched on a boat sunning their brown bodies and different wildlife in the sea. There are an abundance of shops and restaurants on the Main Street for all ages. Take the ferry across to the Balboa Fun Zone or even one of the many restaurants. Great Mex has some of the BEST Mexican in the area too! The beaches on balboa aren’t as expansive as across the ferry, but Ruby beach is the place to be if you have small children!",NauticalNewporter
50,Always enjoy a walk around Balboa Island,"Balboa Island is unique as there is a sidewalk that goes all of the way around the island so you can see boats, docks, water, beach and friendly people walking with you. It’s about a mile to walk around Balboa Island. And it’s always enjoyable to be accompanied by a Frozen Banana dipped in chocolate and nuts! It can be purchased on Main Street!",ohpatti
50,A Charming and Amazing Place to visit!,"This island and part of LA is absolutely amazing and charming. We were in the area to go whale watching and got here early to explore and also head across the ferry to go to the beach. The Balboa Island area is just great! The style of the housing and shops just look fantastic and being waterside is great too! Plenty to see and do! You are just minutes from the beach and there are plenty of nice restaurants and shops to visit and eat/shop at. Walking around here is just peaceful and relaxing too! This is probably one of my favorite places I have ever visited as a community goes. Newport Coastal Adventures which is located on the island is fantastic for a good whale watching and boating experience. The ferry which only cost 1 dollar to ride will get you to the other side of the harbor and within walking distance of the beach in addition to more shops and eating options. The only thing to keep in mind is parking can be a bit problematic so keep that in mind and get there early just in case you have to hunt for a spot to park. Once you get parked though, everything can be done on foot including making your way to the beach or any of the area attractions for that matter. Overall, will definitely visit again and highly recommend this nice area!",Brady K
50,Strolling Balboa Island is Heavenly,"We were staying nearby and walked to Balboa Island to stroll around after dinner. It was quiet and gorgeous. Walking the boardwalk in the evening was relaxing and a pleasant way to extend our day. A few shops were open for snacks, wine, mementoes. We saw many beautiful and exotic dogs strolling with their owners! We enjoyed it so much we came back in the morning to tour again. Much more crowded but still lovely.

You also have the beach, the pier, and the Wedge, so you can't go wrong. I also went to Davey's Locker and did a whale watching tour, so there is plenty to do on Balboa Island. The beach is clean, there are plenty of bathrooms, and overall the people you encounter are friendly. I didn't drive in, but took a tour, but I can see that it is very, very crowded and parking can be crazy tough. I did see a lot of people on bikes and that seems to be the way to go since it's a popular place. I really enjoyed the island and just wish I would've had more time to explore it more than I actually did.",jbrenz

50,Balboa island,"Lovely island to visit for a wander round, look at the shops, grab a coffee or have lunch. Nice walk along the water with beautiful beach houses and yachts/boats parked. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Parking a little difficult on busy days.",pitsonair

20,No where to park!,We drove around and around with no luck finding a parking space for our car. As a resultWe weren't able to try any of their restaurants! We saw very few shops and decided to go drive our car onto the ferry and go over to the peninsula. I won't be back. Parking is too big a hassle.,LovemyAcura🌵

50,Really cool island. Great way to spend the day!,"We stumbled across the ferry and were surprised we could jump on it with our car! Really fun! We spent $3.50 total each way. We asked a city employee about parking. There are 2 big lots. One is $18 a day. The other is $20 a day. We were heading to the cheaper one and saw a sign in a bar parking lot for $10 a day. Don't know if that's a regular thing, probably not, it was pretty quiet on the island. So we found a bargain for parking😆😆😆We rented bikes and had an attachment for our 6 year old. We ate pizza and Mexican food and ride the bikes all the way to the edge I believe it's called. A beautiful lookout spot over an inlet and the ocean. We rode through the beautiful neighborhoods with the story book houses. It's a very charming place.We went to the beach for an hour and played in the sand and waves. The waves here are huge! Fun to watch! Serious under toe though!Lastly, we rode the ferris wheel! There is a lot to do here. Lots of different little rides for the kids, boat rentals and boat excursions. Lots of food and shops. We loved it. It was the perfect spot for the last day of our trip!",Scubaloversaz

50,Wonderful site to visit,"My wife and I visited Balboa Island..came over on the 2 minute ferry rid and went home by the bridge. We met friends, had an ice cream and then dinner.

30,Not much there except restaurants,We didn't see a lot of shops on the island. The only thing was restaurants. We ate in the area twice and they were both good. We had a difficult time finding it at first because we were told to different directions. Newport Blvd seem to be the n quicker way.,Peg B
40,Quaint and fun,"Balboa Island, which is about a 5 minute drive off the coastal highway in Newport Beach, is a quaint, man-made island with some fun shops and attractions. Stroll the island to view the pretty and well-maintained homes while enjoying local treats like the Balboa bar. Check out the shops on Balboa's main street for some cute vacation swag. Don't forget to enjoy the waterfront attractions! Parking is on-street, the only real detraction from driving to the island, but you can always park on the peninsula and take the ferry as well.",ELinsky2015

50,Great Place to Walk Around,A walk around Balboa Island is great fun and great exercise. The people watching and seeing the homes and boats is really a fantastic experience.,rv92625
50,Shops and food and sights,We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach which was in walking distance to Balboa Island. There are many shops and restaurants. We ate at Wilmas patio twice. Multimillion dollar homes. Clean streets. A must see. And during Christmas time you can walk along the water and watch the yachts go by with their decorations or see the houses lit up with lights. Take the short ride ferry to the other side for more sights and carnival rides.,madaboutvegas
40,Take a short stroll,Small Seaside Island with a main street that has shops and restaurants. The shops are standard seaside fair. It is pretty to walk down the main drag. I would not plan to spend too much time here. Maybe grab a bite and head to the beach.,catchyginger
50,Balboa Island - Fun Destination,Balboa Island is always a fun place to visit with fun shops & restaurants and just strolling around the Island by foot or on bicycle. There is a bridge to cross over or a ferry to take you across to the Newport peninsula. A fun experience to enjoy !,Cathie P
50,A wonderful and fun filled place,"I had a chance to visit Balboa Islands with few friends. It is just a Ferry Ride away from the mainland Newport Beach city,Southern California, in the Pacific Ocean. On a sunny afternoon, we drove down about ten miles from our hotel and reached the FERRY. I have earlier experienced drive-thru restaurant, drive-thru car wash, but here was a DRIVE-THRU FERRY. It can ferry three cars at a time covering a short distance of about a mile or so.The island has a beautiful Beach with a Fishing Pier. Most of the adventurous young were enjoying swimming, surfing, challenging the gusty sea waves. Few people were strolling along the beach and still many more seated far away from the lashing waves on a beach chair gazing at the wild sea, lost in their own world. One can find little ones busy making sand castles with their own play way tools.At a short distance was a Fishing Pier.It is basically a long wooden platform jutting into the sea. There are many joints,shops, restaurants,bars all around.The sea was boisterous, huge waves were hitting the shore, may be because of high tide.All of a sudden a SEAL appeared along with the waves.It remained on the shore, for a short while, too perplexed to watch so many human beings, none resembling creatures of its own sea world. It gave a photogenic pose to many peoples delight and vanished in the sea along with the receding waves.For me it was once in a lifetime, memorable experience, watching a SEAL in its natural habitat.All in all this place is a best way to spend an afternoon if you are around New Port Beach,CA.",Sudhir B
50,Create unique shops and food.,We come here every trip to California. We have to get a Balboa bar and we also like to eat at the Italian restaurant Ciao's. There are candy shops and unique little stores as well as real estate offices that show you how much everything is around this awesome Island.,Ron S
40,Cool place to walk around,Good place to visit when in Newport Beach. Marine Avenue has some nice shops and the frozen bananas are well worth trying.Well worth taking time to walk on the boardwalk as the views are great and we also saw sea lions which was good.My son and I rented a double kayak and paddled round the islands which was really good fun,David J

40,Fabulous homes,Once you find a parking spot this is a great place to walk around. The sidewalk between the spectacular houses and beaches is perfect for a leisurely stroll on a nice day,williephips
50,CHARMING,"The Island is charming and quaint. It has a lovely walking path around the perimeter of the island. We ate frozen bananas there and they were delicious! Just a relaxing, sweet place to visit surrounded by the calm bay waters. Delightful!",Delicia M
40,Fun afternoon day trip,"Unique homes along the bay and a fun downtown walk for food, clothes and whatnots. Cute children's book store, Island Tales Bookshop tucked up along the Main Street.",nshoemaker2
50,Fantastic place to relax,"We loved this island. We got an Airbnb and it was perfect. I like to vacation without feeling like I'm right in the middle of a tourist zone. The only tourist area is the main street - Marine Street but it's a short walk to see everything so it wasn't overly crowded like the pier. This island was quiet, charming, and perfect for a getaway for my husband and myself. Walking away from the main street you get to see all the cute houses and it's got such a peaceful feeling. Exactly what you want when you go away. Probably what you'd want even living there full time.",ijchow
50,I would love to stay there in winter!,"If I owned a property here, I think that I'd stay for most of the year - the houses are pretty, the walk around the island is always interesting and the views are great from many of the homes. However, I would certainly clear out in summer and probably rent out the house as the island gets really overrun with tourist and holiday renters.But for a short visit, you can drive on, catch the car ferry with your car, or park on the peninsula and just see it on foot. We drove on and found a parking spot straight away, but I think that we were very lucky to do so. If we have time there again we'll definitely go over by ferry and just walk around the island.We didn't check out the shops as we really just went over to see the homes, the boats and the view. We grabbed an overpriced but tasty ice cream and did a circuit of the island. With lots of stops and photo taking, we were on and off the island in less than two hours.When we're in the area again we'll undoubtedly return, and I'll be looking into holiday letting, but in the winter months.",Dromomaniac

50,Nice old town,"The island frequently gets mentioned in national rankings for being quaint.The area still has a small town feel except for it being very crowded in the summer. City gets 100,000 visitors a day in summer so this place gets crowded.Lots of boutique stores, local artists, and the best frozen bananas on earth.You can drive down or ride the ferry for a $1 per person from balboa penninsula.enjoy the fancy homes. John wayne lived here before he died.No real beach but great views",rcaldin
40,"Very Pleasant for a Walk, Don't Go if you Like Diversity","We live on the Peninsula, and travel by ferry to the Island occasionally, but had never walked around the whole island, although we had kayaked around it. A pamphlet we came across listed the X number of things one must do in Balboa, and a 2.6 mile walk around the island was included. We went on 4th of July weekend, and it was very patriotic. Many houses were decorated. One house even has a permanent bust of Ronald Reagan in the front yard. Walking on the boardwalk is very nice, and going by all the bay front houses is an experience. Is there a flower competition going on? Almost every house had beautiful flowers in front. It's better than going to Descanso Gardens. The Island is almost all residential, but there is one business street, where all the restaurants, art galleries, bakeries and stores are. Be sure to stop at Dad's, the home of the Original Frozen Banana, or is it the place half a block down that also claims to be the home of the Original Frozen Banana? If you like diversity, this is not the place. In the hour we were there, we did not see one non-Caucasian face.",Julie S
40,Sad News Just Released,"The 70-year-old Bay Arcade lost its lease & is closing on August 20. Locals are very upset over the change. The building has a new owner. The space will be converted into a Cafe & Doughnut Shop.The Fun Zone is an old-fashioned Amusement Park dating from 1936 with Ferris Wheel & Kiddie Rides. The experience wouldn't be complete without Corn Dogs, Cotton Candy, Chocolate-covered Banana Bars, Funnel Cakes, Fried Twinkies.I enjoyed walking around Balboa Island & admiring the Architecture in this quaint town that has a long & storied 101-year history. The population doubles during the Summer months as thousands of Renters arrive. This is the best all-around beach venue in the area, IMO.- [ ]",ChanEvan

The island is small and the parking is tight but there is a yearly Christmas eve (I think) Santa motorcycle parade.

You can even use the ferry with your car to another part of the island.,readerlady

To the point of frustration.The pros: It is very charming and sweet. You are sure to get in the holiday spirit all year long.Love it!",Darese S

50,TAKE A STROLL,"Walk around the entire island, not only the main shopping street. The entire walk is very easy, with benches along the way. Takes about an hour of casual walking.

As a native in orange county, and living in the Newport area for the last 25 years, even I will jump on the ferry once a month or so if I am already on the island and needing to get to the peninsula to go home, or vice versa if I just want to go for fun ferry ride across the harbor. If you're visiting as a tourist, the ferry ride is a must and a short five minute ride an opportunity to view Newport Harbor!

40,Balboa,"Balboa lost its zip code and was placed under the wing of Newport Beach. Not enough residence to support a continued zip code of its own, the little hamlet of Balboa, including the island, still holds its individuality. Its neighboring community to the north whose zip code it shares … 92662, has not gobbled it up … though is a draw for locals and tourists, alike.Balboa in December was a bit cold due to the Santa Anna’s that blew in our first night. They blew in and we blew out the power, though that is another story. Luckily, my friend’s relative lived close (just 20 minutes away) and we moved in with her for our weeklong stay in the area. This made it easy to return to Balboa.We spent two separate days in the Balboa area. One day we took a walk along the ocean side of the area – Newport Beach. Being December, there were no crowds. Several bicyclists and other walkers enjoying the area. There were surfers, as well, waiting for a wave, which were few and far between. To my surprise, my friend who has had access to a beach house in this area all of her life never had ventured over to the ocean side. This made it more enjoyable to see her reactions along our walk.It isn’t that I had never seen the ocean before; I have touched my toe in several. Simply, I enjoy experiencing new areas. This stretch of beach had several high chair units for lifeguards (none during this time of year). In addition, of course, there is the Newport Beach Pier. Balboa has that charm of old, being a small beach community. There are several condominiums for rent along this stretch of beach, which I imagine enjoy some fabulous sunsets facing west to the Pacific. A bit pricey though could be worth it.Our second day in Balboa concentrated on the island. We took a ferry over, enjoyed a lunch, and walked the circumference. The ferry costs only $1, holds a few cars and passengers, and comes often. Another evening, we returned to see the Christmas lights. Being December, again, there were no crowds, except the locals. This community pulls all the plugs for their decorations. There may be a competition for all the displays, for all I know. It was well worth the second trip over to the island.According to my friend, summer is an entirely different story – LOTS of people. I think I prefer December.",dianeh-10

I am so glad I decided to finally go. We parked at the Balboa Pier (only $1.20/hr.) and took the ferry across for $1. It took about 2 min. to cross. There are clean restrooms available as soon as you exit the ferry. We walked to the main street with the shops and restaurants. Being January, I had expected the streets to be empty, but it was a nice sunny day and there were plenty of people. The shops are quaint, as are the restaurants. The Island is very dog friendly and I will be taking mine with me the next time I visit. We spent about 4 hours there, but could have easily spent 6 if we looked in all the shops. Its an excellent place to take a leisurely walk and breathe in the sea air.",Val F
50,Balboa Island--one of a kind-- picturesque and charming,Balboa Island--one of a kind-- picturesque and charming. Look for the “dutch” doors. Spend a couple of hours walking through the mini-downtown and around the island. Great on a sunny day and not too bad on a rainy day.,Robert D
50,Love the island,"When in Newport , one must stop at Balboa Island. It is so lovely. The Main Street is full of lovely little shops , restaurants and rather old fashioned in a nice way. The frozen banana and ice cream parlour is a must. All the streets are lined by very cute and beautiful beach homes. There is 'must do' walk path all around the island which is well worth doing for beautiful views of the bay and the various inlets of water and all the boats anchored and also all the activity on the water . Then take the cute three car ferry across to the Peninsula. The fun zone will be good for kids and from there walk across the huge beach on the Balboa Peninsula. Rent a bicycle and follow the bicycle trail along the sand all the way to Newport pier. A great day out !",vmdUk

40,Poetic and charming Island: quintessential American charm,"Balboa Island is one of my favorite places to visit. The walk around the island offers the most charming and poetic impressions of yachts, boats in the Marina while offering a perfect excercise. During holidays the residents of the island go all out in competing with each other in creating amazing seasonal displays. A peaceful, safe and most charming place to visit. I am lucky being able to visit several times a week, and it never ceases to impress me. Marine street is a charming Mainstreet with quantity small shops and restaurants. Small ferries can take you and your car across to Balboa Peninsula with endless long wide beaches. Balboa Island is famous for frozen bananas and Balboa Bars: a chocolate dipped ice cream",ZiaHansen
40,Very cute neighborhoods and shops,"Balboa Island is certainly unlike many neighborhoods! As you enter the island, you will immediately be plunged into crowded streets with shops on both sides. I recently visited to buy a chocolate dipped banana- a Balboa Island tradition. As I parked on a narrow street of neighborhood. A five minute walk through the island landed me on the Main Street. As the sun set, the mood turned pleasant and the light grew dim as many of the streets were only lit by small lamps on the sidewalks. Overall, Balboa island offers a fun, but quick sightseeing opportunity. Rated four stars because of difficult parking and limited dining/shopping options.",lil_drummer_boy5

40,Loved this place in the past,"Visited with my almost 9 year old son. I had told him about Balboa Bars to get him psyched up to want to visit. We parked and walked around, he did get his Balboa bar, which he did enjoy, but it didn't seem to have the same charm this time as it did before. Quite possibly it is because my mom and I loved visiting here and she wasn't with me and that made the difference - she now has dementia and wouldn't remember anything about it, so I couldn't share with her that I had gone back and taken my son. Anyway, some of the stores are different that we went to before and it was just a different vibe. Still a quaint little place with beautiful houses on streets named after gem stones. Haven't eaten on the island, but there are a couple of restaurants that I think would be really good.",Tonya
40,Kitsch but Cool!,"You can take your car over to Balboa Island on a very interesting, small ferry. You can also drive there from a different direction, but be forewarned that parking is hard to come by. The island itself is packed full of picturesque cottages and carefully maintained landscaping, even on the streets. The main street is full of cute, unusual shops. Local small business abound, restaurants can either be tourist traps or very good places that the locals have frequented for years. At holiday time, the lights and decorations can be over the top! Best way to come here is on a bike. Have the obligatory frozen banana on a stick!",SunshineCheyenne

40,"Great for a one-time experience, but getting too tourist-y","Bring sunblock, good walking shoes and as another reviewer suggested --- a lot of patience. I wonder how residents of this admittedly gorgeous area feel about complete strangers who invade their community to gawk at their homes, clutter their main street and clog their public parking. We were a group of about 8 active 60+ and two nephews who wanted to get of sunshine and exercise, plus try the Frozen Banana. After seeing what the Frozen Banana was, we didn't bother. There should be more benches placed around the public areas for seniors and tired tourists. That said, Balboa Island is a great place to visit for the sunshine and the gorgeous residences and boats. The shops were quite expensive and boutique-y. We ate in Newport Beach (at a very good Irish pub) so came here for dessert. We ended up in Starbucks, go figure... All told, happy we visited Balboa as tourists but will go visit another community for our next SoCal trip.",Chet S

We walked around the island and wished we were wealthy like a lot of folks that live on the island. There are many shops and restaurants. Also, because of their harbor, activities are abundant. Visitors can choose aquatic adventures from cruises to wine tastings, or just simply walking around the island is entertaining. Newport Beach is a wonderful place to visit.

We have gone to a garage sale there (Amazing!) and have shopped and eaten on the island in the past. On this trip we scoped out the ferry and docks as well as stopping to eat.

50,Your first time to Balboa Island,"Neat area. We had better luck parking about 3 to 4 block away from the beach--too crazy to find a parking place, unless you arrive about 7am-8am in morning and remain parked. There are plenty of food and drink shops, but is a bit pricey. So, I would bring your own packed food and beverage--you can save some money. Coffee is reasonable at the shops around, and the weekend we were there (Aug.1st), there was a small farmers market with fresh produce near the Newport Pier--it was quaint but nice. I was suggest in renting a bike at the local bike rental shop near the pier (around $27.00/2 hours). It was fun and well worth it. My son and I biked up and down from the bike shop about 1.5 mi in both directions and took about an hour. It wasn't overly crowded, but did have a lot of families out and about. So, was pleasantly busy with people having fun. The beach wasn't crowded and plenty of space for some mild surfing. We stayed 4 days and was perfect to get to know the area. Also, plan on walking--so, wear some soft comfort slidders or tennis shoes. Walking was THE best way to really experience this area and look around in the shops off the beach. Oh, and rent a car and drive up and down the Oceanic Highway. Was gorgeous and a wonderful experience for us!",Lance H

40,Nice Little Village,"Balboa Island is a nice little unique neighborhood where you can walk around and enjoy the small village ambiance but with tons of tourists and tons of slow, slow moving traffic. If you can find a place to park, there are nice little shops and a walk around the island is nice too. Take the ferry across the bay - a 5 minute 'cruise' - to the Fun Zone on Balboa Peninsula. You can walk down to the end of the Peninsula to the famous 'jetty' where the waves can sometimes be literally killing. Nice views of Corona del Mar beach there. You can spend the whole afternoon going from the island to the peninsula, and have dinner, probably on the island.",205sr
50,"""Bay Island Fun Zone - Balboa Island - Fun Family Outing""","You can make a day of it but you should plan out. There are free parking spaces on the street near the houses (need patience though). Also, there is a parking structure near Newport Landing. There is a lot to do for small kids, teens can rent many types of fun things like segways, electric bikes, scooters, boats, etc. There is an arcade and other rides for small kids. There are so many fun little restaurants and bars nearby. Also, the beach has a parking lot where you can stroll along the boardwalk, then head over to the restaurants, take one of the boat rides, take the ferry to stroll around the island. The boat to Catalina is also there! Lots to do and lots of fun if you plan well!",HBLIVING

40,Balboa Island: Very pretty upscale island,"We drove to a parking lot in Newport Beach and then crossed the bridge to Balboa Island. Balboa Island has many, many pretty homes. Although they are closely spaced, the are clearly very lovely and upscale. We enjoyed walking along the water and seeing a regatta in progress.Balboa Island is very definitely less ""upscale"". There is a small amusement part area and if you walk across the peninsula, you arrive at the beach and parking lot. There is nothing picturesque about this area but it is a typical run of the mill beach area. However, we had a wonderful dinner at the Harborside Restaurant on the peninsula. We would absolutely recommend this restaurant. But in terms of walking around, Balboa Island wins .",Mary H
40,Lovely surprise,"Must have driven pass it about 10 times in as many years. This year we visited it and a lovely surprise it is. Nice beachfront, with shops and restaurants. Nice for a walk next to the water. Parking is a nightmare, we got lucky twice, otherwise circle and circle around.",Marc D
30,No big deal for older adults.,"We went to the Island to hop on to the sightseeing boat which cruises the harbor. We walked around a bit but wasn't impressed. There were rides for young children, but that was about all that we observed. We walked several blocks after the cruise and finally decided to return to our car and leave. Been there / done that.",Robert G
40,Fun Shops and Restaurants,"We didn't really know what to expect on Balboa Island. Most of the island is covered with very close homes, but the stroll along Marine Avenue is worth the trip. There are many fun shops and great place to grab a cold drink or a bite to eat.",leonardh737

50,The perfect family vacation,"We rented a home and brought our family down for a week. This included young adult, married kids and grandchildren - toddlers. The fun thing about Balboa Island is, it can be a fun one day visit too.Driving cars onto the island on the weekend can be quite a line up, but once you park, even if several blocks from Marine (Main Street) and the shops, you will enjoy the walk. Just head to either North or South Bayfront to walk along the bay and its views.There are definitely some things that must be done when enjoying Balboa Island with kids:Enjoy the Beach & Bay,1. Look for crabs, little fish, sea anemone, clams and small shells.2. Make a Sandcastle (toy store on Marine has supplies).3. Make some cookies and lemonade and let the kiddos sell him on the boardwalk.4. Buy some larger shells at a craft store ahead of time (kinda expensive in the island shops) and allow the kids to paint...set up shop on the boardwalk to see their creations.5. If you can afford it - rent a kayak, paddle board or borrow one...its an adventure to go around the entire island. Fun for teens.6. Take a ride on the Ferry to the fun zone. It is cheap and fun!.7. Fun Zone Arcades - Some of the arcades are aging, but kids eyes light up when the prize tickets spit out of the game and they redeem for trinket prizes.8. Take a ride on the Ferris Wheel while there -'it is nice and long and you can see across the bay.9. Walk the perimeter of the island, look at boats, other people's sand castles, and find the big green dinosaur on North Bayfront (it's there) and the Teddy Bear House on South Bayfront. You can't miss them!10. A sweet family of ducks on North Bayfront beach, usually under the docks, near the bridge area within a few blocks. In some seasons you see them with their ducklings.On Marine Street:Sweets & Treats!1. Enjoy a Dads old-fashioned chocolate dipped ice cream bar or frozen banana. It's tradition. You can't miss the large blue billboard with banana and rectangle ice team bars! Or if you prefer, buy yours at Sugar & Spice two doors down. Maybe stage a taste test between the two!2. If it is morning, enjoy a luscious cinnamon roll from Blue Chair Bakery.. the best!3. The Balboa Candy Store...many fun vintage candies from YOUR childhood, andEvery flavor of fresh taffy you can imagine.4. Take them to Our Gangs General Store - it is a tradition. My own littles have such fond memories picking out a small item or two from there. Have them ride the mechanical horse out front for a quarter.5. Visit the new children's Book Store, Island Tales, owned by two retired Kindergarten teachers - it's awesome!6. Walk the island with your family at sunset - maybe eating your Balboa Bars, it is beautiful and lovely and a perfect way to close a great day!This is only a starter list...!",LuluGrace8

50,"Great shopping, darling houses. Go early to find street parking!","My two sisters and I just revisited Balboa Island on a summer Sunday morning -- arrived at 10:00 via east land bridge (west siders take ferry). We reminded ourselves to go early, hoping to secure a parking place anywhere on the island.Luckily we did find parking! Balboa Island's main road, Marine Avenue, is a super fun shopping stroll. Probably 5 blocks long, it contains restaurants, retail, realtors and even a Catholic Church! It also still is the home of the frozen banana and the Balboa Island bar -- great frozen treats from yesteryear.Other strolling draw is the gorgeously decorated island cottages that pack the island. Residents as well as vacationeers make the most of their homes, tastefully decorating their dwellings for the holidays and always maintaing floral perfection. Try to count the dutch doors on the homes. So charming!A great place to visit for a little while. Just hold your breath while trying to find parking.

If you go, you must try the Frozen Banana or Balboa Bar, both of which they are famous for.

Yes, surroundings are beautiful, water and boats, but that's it. Main strip is limited, random boutiques and shops selling desserts, bikinis, stand ups, and rolex's all out of the same store front. And the food options to dine are weak. Stay away from Wilma's - unless you want an overpriced standard diner experience. No thanks, I'm out.",kkathrynfay

A day on Balboa Island is a treat.",bmsj4
50,Good old main street,"The reason I love going down to the Island whenever I can is the local shopping. You can find anything here even things you thought you didn't need...there's a jewelry shop down there named after the owner called Laura Matthews Designs, she hand makes all of her jewelry. It's unique and you can't find anything like it anywhere. When I'm in need of a gift-either for a friend or myself :) I stop in and see what's new. There's also the balboa bar...or the frozen banana that you really can't get anywhere else. Lots of other shops & restaurants too. Worth the trip, but parking is a pain so either ride you bike or take the ferry over from the peninsula. It's fun and an easy walk.",Jenn92663

40,Cute place to visit in Newport Beach,Balboa Island is quite an attraction for people who loves boats and enjoy the view of the most expensive houses in Newport. It has a nice atmosphere and the main street is full of cute shops and restaurants. One of the best way to get in is to use the ferry only because is part of the all experience and it is fun to get across the canal with your car or bicycle on a boat.We like to cycle there and it's probably the best because parking is very difficult to find unless you like to walk and chose to park the car outside the island.,Francesca A

There is one main street that has little shops and restaurants, and it doesn't take much time to walk both sides of the streets. The shops all appear to be from the 50s and 60s era, which is very charming and pleasant. The houses on the nearby streets are mostly Cape Cod style, also very charming, although they were pretty densely packed together.

50,"Do you enjoy walking, boats, looking in well tended homes and patios?","Great circular walk of several miles around a sand island completely covered with small beach houses. The perimeter sidewalk passes between the shoreline and docks and the homes with front windows 10-15' inland. Lots to see on both sides along this enclave of exclusive real estate. On the west side, the historic small Balboa Island ferries shuttle back and forth to the peninsula with 3 cars and 25 people. Fare is $1 per person, $2 for car. It's an easy walk from the ferry landing across the peninsula to the Balboa Pier.Good destination for unique walking outing.",dickanddoug
50,Quaint and great for walking or jogging,We stayed a week on the island and enjoyed the neighborhood. The houses are all unique and make for great scenery for an early morning walk. Enough restaurants and shops to cover all you would need. Very safe and pedestrian friendly.,TravelingMom8066

50,Great little Island,"I have been going to this Island since I was a kid. I would go there for Frozen Bananas or the famous Balboa Bars!!! As I have gotten older I know go there for the restaurants and for drinks. One of my favorite spots is the Village Inn. They usually have a great band playing, great drink specials, and the food is not bad at all. Also if you are in the move to exercise there is nothing better than going for a walk or run around the sidewalk that surrounds the island.",Ted C
50,Great little island,"This is a great little place to walk around, shop, eat, get balboa bars, and do many other things. Going to ""Little Island"" is also fun; walking over the canals, ""hunting"" for crabs, etc.. Also, take the Ferry while here.",Adam K
40,An easy walk with Harbor Views is an easy free way to see Balboa Island,"A great way to enjoy Balboa Island is just walking it. Drive across the (only) bridge to it from Jamboree Blvd or, better yet take the Ferry from the Newport Peninsula. Park on any of its one-way streets and just start walking.While you can park on ""the main drag"" that is the extension of Jamboree, get off that beaten path and walk the ""bay fronts"". It can even get crowded on them especially on weekends and during the summer. So go during a weekday if you can. And marvel at a place so close to everything but far away from it all.If there is one thing I would suggest is to get on a bay front walk and keep the water immediately off one shoulder and walk! If it takes you over the bridge to ""the little island"", do it. You can't get lost and it should take you no more than an hour to an hour and a half to see the island and the extravagance of Newport Beach.Extravagance? Look at all of the incredible, and varied, architectural styles. Take in the eclectic selection of dingys, boats, and yachts. Enjoy watching kids of all ages at play on the beach, the ever-present boat / home / yard maintenance and painting / polishing / and just plain enjoying life. Life in a location where even the most run down home in the least desirable location on the island is worth over a million dollars.Before you leave, take a stroll down the main drag. Get a ""Balboa Bar"" at Dad's. But take your time.Balboa Island is a fun diversion from the otherwise frenetic speed of Southern California life.",help32250
50,Pretty Much the Same as Always!,"We love Balboa Island and used to live in the area years ago. We started coming in 1978. We moved out of the area and visited the island with friends last week.

It's so fun to park and walk down the main street, or the strip along the bay or just looking at houses.",slwsweet
50,Love the paved trail around the whole island!,"When in the area we always visit Balboa Island. Some fun stores to shop in, great places to eat and you can't miss the Balboa Bars (ice cream)! We love to get on the paved trail that goes all the way around the island and walk along looking at all the neat houses and boats. The ferry over to Balboa Beach is only $1 each way and you pay in cash when you get on the ferry. You do not need a ticket or advance booking for the ferry.

Being a world traveler, I feel that I am qualified to say that this place is like no other.Cross the tiny bridge and transcend into a different time and place. Behold the south bay front and witness beauty beyond compare. Walk around the big and small island and observe homes and gardens of every variety. Take the small ferry boat ride that takes 3 cars and passengers to the Balboa peninsula.Dine and shop on Marine avenue. Yes it is crowded especially in summer months but if you are lucky enough to find a place to park you will be in for a delightful experience.For 5 days before Christmas you can witness the amazing boat parade where over 100 decorated boats are a joy to behold.",diana k

50,SoCal culture,"If you have any doubts there is such a thing as Southern California culture you won't after a trip to Balboa. A laid back mix of wealth and beach casual, the people who live here wouldn't trade for anything.

Winter is definitely the time to ""do"" island, and on a warm January afternoon, it was the perfect way to walk-off a bit of lunch. The traffic on the island in summer can be daunting. It's a lovely visit to a lovely island. When you go, we sure to make room for a frozen banana or ice cream. You can't miss the signs!",Sheryl D
50,Little piece of fun,"We went to Balboa Island and peninsula because of reviews here. We are so glad we did and now have fallen in love with this vibe and feel of the entire area. It is dotted with unique restaurants, shopping and lots of outdoor activities. Make sure to rent a bike at any of the bike rental areas. We liked it so much that we are renting a house this summer for a week to really be able to enjoy it. If you can, give yourself a few hours if not overnight to take in the flavor. Just walking by the houses on the boardwalk is entertainment in itself due to the fact that all houses are different in their architecture and style. Christmas is amazing as homeowners go all out decorating. It is also so close to Newport Beach shopping and Laguna.",faceitann
40,OMBeach,"Amazing views, homes, stores, and cars. Hard to find parking, but is incredibly easy to walk around. Find a nice piece of beach and let the kiddos touch the water and play in the sand. Watch the boats and listen to the seals. Just a great time for everyone.",css1983

50,"Love the island, great location","The island is mostly houses crammed in, however many of them are nice to stroll by and look at. The main street is where the small shops and few restaurants. It is very quaint as many have said. The ""beach part is really just a small section of wet sand along the edges. Don't think of it as lots of beach to spread out on. If you go to the sand, you will be right outside someones porch. It is a great spot with more of a actual beach just across the water way. The island is calmer living then a party beach town or high end. Disneyland is also less than 30 minutes away. We stayed on the island even though we were going to Disney 3 days. If you want to just go to the island, parking is difficult. Just walk the shops and drive around and see some of the unique houses.",Michael H
40,Quaint little place,"We went on a bank holiday so busy . It has some nice little shops and it lovely to take a stroll around . We bought a sandwich and a coffee from a place near the ferry and sat and watched the world go by ,very enjoyable .

50,Harbor Tour of Christmas Lights,"The boat tour around the harbor to see all the lovely houses lavishly decorated with lights, trees and wreaths, ribbons and bows, even a yard full of Christmas penguins, viewed from the water on a cold, crisp night just sang of the holiday spirit. The evening was rounded off with a delicious seafood meal at Harborside Restaurant.We returned to Balboa Island in the daytime after Christmas and walked the perimeter to see how much time and effort had gone into those decorations.

50,Delightful place to explore by walking,Spent the whole afternoon and evening exploring both the islands and peninsula. Great place to walk. Lovely homes and great shops and restaurants.

We had a knowledgeable guide on the boat with interesting stories about the history.,butterfly62799
30,Nice but...,"We actually enjoyed strolling around the small area on the coast side of the Island (Marine road and the waterfront houses) leading to the ferry, more than the Island itself. Marine road, which is the main road leading to the ferry when you come from the inland (Newport beach). is full with small local boutiques, restaurants and welcoming atmosphere, and the house on the walkway at the end of Marine road, leading to the ferry if you are walking, are magnificent and worth strolling in front of (well, during Christmas nights, with the lights it is all together ""something else"", but even in normal days they worth it).Balboa Island itself did not excite us too much, too commercial / touristy, nice to walk around but in our view, the inland beach front locations such as Newport beach and more so Laguna beach are more diverse, interesting and exiting...",gilan7
30,"No Parking, but quaint shops and houses","We came here so that I could see the Newport Beach Boat Parade. I thought you had to go by ferry. So you don't have to go across to the island on the ferry. There is a bridge that goes into Balboa Island, but expect traffic going in. We drove around trying to find parking multiple times before giving up. Once you can find parking, it looks like a nice area for walking around to look at houses and go shopping.",Catherine D
50,Wonderful time!,Rent a bike! Take a ride arou d the island / peninsula withe the kids! You will not be disappointed by the wide beautiful beach and the array of wonderful homes that dot the shoreline. We rented a bike for about 10 per bike for a couple of hours.

40,December is a great time to visit!,"We've been in the summer where the small island can have a crushing amount of tourists. This trip in December we drove right onto the island, found a parking spot and leisurely walked through the stores on the main drag. We also enjoyed seeing the unique, historical homes on the island. A fun place to spend a sunny afternoon and pick up some unique gifts. Several good lunch options or just grabbing a frozen yogurt or banana. Will return!",SandJbusytravelers
50,Fun place to experience,What a fun place to visit. There were lots of things to see and do. Nice places to eat and the Balboa ice cream bars were to die for. We ended up having a great meal at the Spaghetti Factory with my whole family. The little stores were nice for shopping for beach items such as sunglasses and flip flops. It was interesting to see the houses and imagine renting or buying one of them. Of course the pier and beach were fun as well. We enjoyed watching the bird man with his parrots and got some nice pictures.,GayleModesto
30,Cool place,This is a tiny island in Newport. An inner coastal island that is very small. We went during December so it was quiet. Parking is limited I am sure during busy times.

On Marine Ave are little shops, have a world-famous frozen banana, breakfast at Wilma's (or lunch). It's fun to walk around the island along with local residents. Can you find the Teddy Bear house? Residents decorate their homes beautifully for major holidays, lots of local pride. Follow signs to the Bslboa Ferry, ride the Ferry to the Balboa Peninsula. Nice way to see the local side of Balboa.",VVRTustin
30,Cute Seaside town,I drove from Newport Beach for 15 minutes to this cute town. The stores are not all in one spot so that you can shop easily. The town was very clean and people I met were friendly. There are plenty of nautical type shops here. You can also go on a fishing boat or go whale watching.,FreeAsABird3
50,Inspires a Desire to Sell Your House and Move to the Beach,"For her whole life my mother has lived within 2 miles of Balboa Island. Never once during this time has she not wanted to sell her house and move to ""the island"". The appeal of the place is undeniable.Depending on your preferences what you can do on ""the island"" boils down to this:* You can sunbathe and swim. This is a perfect activity for families with small children. The Newport Bay is calm and the sand is lovely, perfect for building sand castles.* You can go for a walk around the flat, fully paved island perimeter. If you have the time and energy don't forget to cross the bridge to Little Balboa Island. A perimeter walk is a perfect opportunity to drink in the beautiful water/boat views as well as check out the variety of beautiful homes (many of which are available for short-term summer rental).* You can shop on the main street (Marine Avenue) where there are cute boutiques and restaurants. This is a good thing to do when you're through with your walk or beach day. Tradition demands that you stop for, at least, a classic Frozen Banana or iconic Balboa Bar.* You can walk on (or drive on; though I prefer walking) to the Balboa Island Ferry, taking a jaunt over to the Balboa Peninsula. For a very tiny monetary investment you'll be rewarded with a great photo opportunity. On the Balboa Peninsula side you'll get to check out the Fun Zone or walk straight off the ferry and head directly to the ocean. Just keep walking; it's only a few short blocks.My family and I have been coming to Balboa Island for a lifetime. If you're coming to sun and swim, plan to stay for the day. For other activities, a few hours should suffice.Other stuff:* If someone in your party is in a wheelchair, the perimeter path is fine. It is totally flat and unobstructed.* Parking on the island can be challenging during summer months. The further you are from the main street the more likely you are to find parking. Be observant of the street cleaning signs.* The island sparkles in the evenings during the holidays when residents decorate elaborately for Halloween and/or Christmas. A visit during these times is also special.* The island is very safe. You will not feel uncomfortable at any time of day or night. As always, lock things up and keep your valuables close, but this is not a place in which you will feel out of place or endangered.",redtayres
40,Enjoy the stroll,"Definitely take the time to walk up and down Marine street and visit with the friendly merchants while you peruse their unique offerings.

Had a lot of fun, touristy, but clever shops and food. the food was good, not too overpriced for a tourist area. The shops had the normal tourist stuff and we had fun shopping there. The beach on the Pacific side is really nice and free. The whale watching from here was awesome!

40,FUN FUNKY CROWDED but a MUST DO at least once!,"It's a quirky little town with lots of boutiques and atmosphere Just walking through the back streets admiring all the cottages (well over $2million now) and enjoying the people is a fun day. We often take the ferry over just for the experience! The restaurants, although expensive, are not spectacular but combined with a whole day outing, they suffice. There's another ""food court"" that the young adults love because cheap prices, pizza, etc And for young kids, I find they love the special area with games, etc. Check out the map to get a feel for the geography of the Island so if you want to swim, you'll know what options you have",Lynn Williams P
40,Ferry to the island,"The first time we ever went to Balboa Island I thought the only way to get there was the ferry boat. Later I found that you can actually drive there too. You can park in town and take the ferry or drive your car onto the ferry. I believe it's $1/person but don't recall what it is for the car. Plenty to do on the island - stroll to shops, restaurants or even a few amusement rides. Also attractions there are boat rentals, whale watch boat trips and fishing boat excursions. Something for everyone!",lkstumm

40,"Cute, but touristy","This place has changed a lot since I lived there 20 years ago. It still retains much of it's charm, but it gets very crowded and some of the shops have changed to tacky tshirt/souvenirs shops instead of the quaint boutique style shops.Worth a visit just to see the charm. Little ""downtown"" strip with shops & restaurants, and the famous frozen bananas. Be sure to walk, drive, or bike through the residential area also...the cutest ""gingerbread cottages""...like a fairy tale.",Hotelsnobb

50,"Balboa Island, a pretty little gem","I love this place, it is like a secret little escape from reality. PRETTY is the best way I can describe it. It is small enough to easily walk around and wind through the streets of the fascinating houses. Anywhere along the waters edge is just divine and will leave you smiling. You instantly feel like you are on holidays as soon as you drive over the pretty bridge into Balboa Island. The location is great as you are close to everything when not on the island. The only grocery store on the island leaves a lot to be desired, but you are not left solely relying on this as you have the mainland right there. The Village Inn is great with live music every night. 'Crocker's' on the Island was the food venue with the best service as far as we were concerned. Small but pleasurable. The shops are great to browse through. 'Art for the Soul' is now our favourite shop in California (including the one at Laguna Beach). There is just enough shops for the size of the island. Prices are quite high to rent a house but you can be guaranteed you will relax and smile.",ozeire
50,Neat little Place,We mainly walked down Marine Avenue and enjoyed the cleanliness and shops. We also walked around the marina and saw lovely homes and the canal.

30,Shopping just ok,We were disappointed in what we found on Balboa Island. We visited here on our last day of vacation hoping for neat shops and restaurants. Maybe they were on a different part of the island. We drove in on the main part of the island and many shops had the same types of clothes and souvenirs and we didn't find any restaurants or bars worth stopping at.,ntaulbee

50,Day out with Family,This is a must go place if your in Newport Beach! We live about 30 miles away and have been coming here for about 20 years. During Christmas time they have a boat show. All the boats are decorated with lights. Lots of fun!,Marisalovestraveling
50,A quick Island Tour,"California has all the hidden treasures that you can do on a weekend trip. We took a drive along PCH and stopped by Newport Beach pier,another quaint spot. We had dinner at Ol Spaghetti Factory and drinks and walked the beach...then off to Balboa Island, which you can actually drive to go around by main street. But if you prefer to take the ferry boat, it was only $2.00 per car or you can walk on $1.00 and it ferries you apx ,1000 feet to other peninsula. The ""island"" doesn't really have any thing much to do there, but it is an attraction with beautiful homes lining the waters like an English. fishing town. We walked and enjoyed the the scenery, makes it seems like you're not in California. BTW when you return to the ""main"" island there are things to do with the kids, Balboa Fun Zone, rides, bumper cars and carnival games. Plenty of restaurants and bars in this part of Newport Beach.

Seals on docks and even some brave folks swimming. Easy walk to food or ferry. We enjoyed ourselves, no doubt about it.I grew up near Atlantic City before gambling. Boardwalk overrun with tourist shops vying for dollars. Somehow had similar feeling in shopping area on Balboa Island.

40,Great way to get exercise and spend soem time relaxing.,"Mostly clothing shops and restaurants. Parking can be a bear but the island is very walker friendly. Ciao is an awesome restaurant to stop and have some great food brought to you by fantastic friendly staff. A couple of stores have clothing for one price, ie all clothing is 15 bucks at one store. I was not impressed with one clothing store I entered, called Crush. the women surely would not have spoken with such vulgarity if they had known there was another customer in the store after the elderly lady had left. I have worked retail and I was not impressed with their behavior. The ferry ride is cheap and fast to get there from Balboa Blvd or you can get to it from the PCH I believe.

40,"Balboa Island and Surrounding Area, So. California","Balboa Island and the Balboa Peninsula, although not connected by land, are often considered as a ""single location."" The only connection is the Balboa Ferry between the two spots. The Ferry is a fun ride all in itself. Some come down just to cross from one site to the other via Newport Bay.For some, a couple hours on Balboa is all they need. Others can spend half a day. Tons of specialty shops and plenty of restaurants can offer lots of window shopping and munching on goodies or full meals.Probably the most famous of the 'munching', like in desert items, is the Balboa Frozen Banana. It is a MUST have when visiting - frozen banana on a stick, dipped in warm chocolate and coated with a choice of neat things. For me, it has to be some type of chopped nuts. I've been eating those things since 1955.On the Peninsula side you'll find more shops, beach dress oriented, restaurants and a fun zone for the kids. This area is the 'hot spot' for ocean fishing. With Newport Landing and Dave'y Locker ready to meet your needs with 1/4, 1/2, Full and Overnight trips available. Some boats fish locally while others venture to Catalina Island or further to find the catch.Oh, don't forget the whale watching. When in the right season that can be a treat for the entire family.Here's my concept of visiting the Balboa area: Relax, don't rush. Walk slowly. Take a seat once in a while and watch the world go by. Hurry and fast are not terms associated with this area. Walk off the beaten path a bit to see some of the really neat homes on this tiny island. It's a different way of life. Crowded? Oh yes. Traffic, you bet. Amazing? Absolutely.Bet you come back again...",HubieB
30,Interesting for a couple of hours but probably won't come again,"I've never been, and it seemed like people loved this place. I actually didn't have that hard a time finding parking, and I just spent the day walking around the whole island and looking at the multi-million dollar homes. It was quiet and charming. Got one of those delicious frozen bananas on main street and strolled down there and looked at the few shops there.... and that's it. There really isn't a beach to hang out on (because it's a man-made island), so besides walking around, I'm not sure what else there is to do.It's a cute place, and I'm glad I visited. However, I think one time is enough; I don't think I'll go again.",lulumoomoo
50,Great excursion,"This is a great half day adventure. The ferry is only $1 each way, and very efficient. I strolled the pier, walked the waterfront looking at fantastic homes, and stopped in some pretty touristy but nice shops. Great people watching!

50,A great summer place,"Balboa is a small island with multi-million dollar homes, one main street with shops and restaurants (Marine Avenue), a Catholic church, fire house, real estate agents, post office, two small grocery stores and a ferry that takes you to and from the island and peninsula. Kids can play on the small beaches on the bay or you can rent paddle boards, kayaks or bikes that you can ride on the street, but it's congested and you want to ride off-island. Rentals aren't cheap here, but come in all sizes, so, you can split the cost with family members or friends. Houses are built close together, so, be prepared to get friendly. A great 4th of July place for kids with fireworks over the water and decorations on every house and flags up and down streets.",Donna C

50,The Perfect Family Christmas Vacation on Balboa Island,"My family rented a vacation home here for the Christmas holidays and we all loved it so much (the house and the island)! The island is super tiny (you could walk around it) and has a really safe, cozy, quaint feel. Everyone is very friendly here and things just seem to move at a much slower pace (""island time"").It's very festive during the holidays and probably has the best Christmas lights in Orange County. Almost everyone decorates their homes with full holiday light displays and a couple of homes even have very elaborate Christmas light shows every 15 minutes (526 S. Bay Front and 327 Sapphire Ave.) where the lights are coordinated with music.The main street (Marine Ave.) with all the shops and restaurants tends to get really backed up with traffic, especially during the week of the Newport Beach Christmas Boat Parade where it gets backed up hours before and after the parade. (It took over 45 minutes to get off the island one night after the boat parade!)I highly recommend checking out Balboa Island if you haven't been before because it's very cute and unique. Stroll down the main street to check out the cute boutique shops and have a frozen banana (signature island treat), go for a walk around the island to see some of the beautiful bay-front homes, or just take the really cute, little ferry across Newport Harbor to enjoy the beautiful view!",Crystal Warner
50,Cute Seaside Getaway,We enjoyed walking around the entire island during an afternoon looking at beach cottages and unique shops. Bikes rentals are available. Be sure to take the ferry from the Fun Zone on the Peninsula. It adds to the Island charm.,suegernaey

40,Always fun.,"Not my first time to what I consider a charming little island, but I can see where some people might find it a bit claustrophobic. I find that quaintness to be part of the appeal. Parking is a nightmare and the one way streets can be trying, but again, part of the appeal to me. This trip was just a quick in and out, but it was refreshing to see that it has not changed much",Mermaidk
50,Scenic walking area and lots of shops,"Great little island that is connected by a bridge to the mainland and the ferry is the other access to this delightful little village. It is a man made island and has pleanty of charm. The main street has lots of little shops and restaurants for your enjoyment. However, if you feel like a walk just head toward the beach. There is a walkway all around the area before you get in the sand. This is an art interested area and sometimes on the weekend you will see art displays all along the sidewalk for sale.

We did not stop to eat nor did we attempt to continue on to explore the other islands past Balboa Island.The area is beautiful.

50,Step Back In Time on Balboa Island,"Two ways to get onto BI, take Jamboree off the 73 or 405, use the 73 option and follow it all the way to the island. Option two is come in on the Newport Coast and come across the Ferry. As you drive over the bridge you go back in time on this little island in the OC. Things to do, the island has one main street with shops, you can stroll both sides in less than an hour if you stop at each shop. While on main street, you can stop at Dad's or Sugar and Spice for a famous Balboa Bar or Frozen Banana. There are other fun shops that have been there for years and a few great restaurants for good food. If you feel like walking more get to the boardwalk(cement) and walk the island, you can also walk the ""Little Island"" and can cover both in about an hour. Enjoy the views of the water and the homes that front the water. People are friendly and this is a very pedestrian area. If you want to really experience BI, get out on the water, there are many way you can do this, rent a SUP or rent a Duffy. Either of these options will give you a different perspective of the ""island life"" and get you away from the hustle and bustle of BI. There are many islands to explore when you are out on the water and a great history behind this little gem in OC, get out and enjoy the place. There are 4 Public Piers on the island for fishing and a ""kids swim beach"" on North Bay Front near Ruby. Public restrooms are in town at the fire station and at the Ferry. Whether you are on the sand or walking the island this is a fun place to explore for a day or a few days, go and enjoy.",randys101

IT was very hot so the kids loved to play in the sand and we even saw a few seals swim quite close to shore. We rented bikes and rode around the island to see the multimillion dollar homes that are breathtaking. Lots of fun for kids and adults!,citygal2004

There were many pretty homes with well tended yards to gaze at and it was fun to just wander into the little shops to browse their wares and stop off for an ice cream cone. The highlight of the day for me was seeing a cottage that I swear was identical to Snow White's Cottage! I did hear that the woman who was the voice of Snow White in the animated film lived somewhere in the area. This made me wonder if she perhaps lived in this charming cottage! If anyone knows the answer, I'd love to hear from you!",traveltoforeignlands

There are restaurants and small shops with the majority of them being clothing for size 4 and smaller women and lots and lots of jewelry. Some restaurants had high prices while others were more reasonable with their numbers somewhat limited, yet a good variety. All in all, a nice place to visit on a cool afternoon with the only downfall if you don't have a car; you need to walk about a mile through Balboa Village to get to the ferry.",TraveLotsnLots

Take the ferry (short ride, pretty cool) to the peninsula to get to the real beach. Rental house are usually older, sometimes small and close together. People tend to sit in the area in the front of houses. Parking is a problem so the main source of transportation is bikes. Lots of beach cruisers. We were there for a week, parked the car in the garage and never took it out until it was time to leave. Everything you need is within walking or biking distances. We will definitely go back.",Terry M

50,Great family destination for an evening,Love to come here via Newport Beach - we park there and then rollerblade down the beach to the ferry and take that over to Balboa Island. Unfortunately roller blades are no longer allowed on the island so from there were have to walk. Otherwise bikes are an option. Then we go to main street and get a Frozen Banana from Dad's after Mexican at Picante Martin's. Best family date ever!,Roscam474
50,Great day at the beach,"We went to a couple beaches as we were in the area with our SB team for a week. This was by far the best we visited. People were courteous and it was nice to have access to stores and restaurants at the beach. It really breaks up the day trip. Beach, shop, and eat throughout the day. Alcohol not allowed on the beach. No worries as great drinks and beer just a block off the beach. It's just a really a neat place. Some of our kids rented bikes to enhance the experience. We set up camp by the Balboa Pier. This puts you right next to showers and restrooms. I will warn that we visited in late July and the tides can be very dangerous for little ones. $4 for ferry ride over for cars and $2 for pedestrians. Just a fun place for families.",tgray67
50,Dig into Balboa Island for a Summeriffic Time at the Beach,"Our family tries to come here when we're in the area because we love the great restaurants, fun snack shacks (you'd be amazed how good a frozen banana with the works can be on a summer day) and cute shops to check out. Also, for a pampering time, try Cozy Toes for a pedi or mani with your daughter, Mom or friend: pink rules & its tons of girly fun! Into water sports? Rent a paddle board or take lessons on the bay. We enjoy just walking around the island looking at all the adorable vacation homes families can rent, and there's beach access to the bay, too. Little kids love to dig, dig, dig all day with beach toys; just don't forget the beach hats & sunscreen! The ferry is a great option for getting across the bay without having to move your car, it's dirt cheap & you can walk or drive on.",3NWnatives

My step-daughter and I spent the afternoon on the beach reading and napping while listening to the waves and the screams and giggles of people in the water. The beach wasn't overly crowded, and if you are hungry or thirsty, there is a Ruby's on the pier nearby, and lots of places to get a snack, ice cream or a meal just a short walk away.

50,Great place to spend a day with the family,"We had a great time visiting Balboa Island. Our family of 4 (kids ages 9 and 11) enjoyed a family fun day here and the peninsula. We parked in the pavillions parking lot and walked down the main area visiting various stores. We took the 10-12 block walk along the boardwalk to the ferry and then crossed into balboa peninsula. After hitting the ferris wheel, we reserved a boat for after lunch. We had lunch around the corner and came back to drive our own boat around the islands and peninsula there. We then rented bikes and went along the newport beach boardwalk and grabbed some ice cream along the way!",mamaarora
40,"Great area to walk, fun themed homes during holidays, don't miss the bear house","We did a nice 4 mile walk around balboa island in July. Many fun houses decorated for Fourth of July.

50,I LOVE BALBOA ISLAND!!,I absolutely loved Balboa Island! It is an adorable/quaint little island and I can't say enough about my time there.We parked at that the Pavilions parking lot before the bridge that takes you to the island. This was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and I highly suggest you do the same. Parking on Balboa Island is extremely difficult. If you park at Pavilions it is just a short walk across the bridge to the main street on the island. On the main street there are tons of shops & restaurants. We enjoyed walking walking up and down the main street on this laid-back island.From there we walked back across the bridge to our car and drove onto the island to catch the ferry to go to Balboa Peninsula. This was a fun way to get from the island to the peninsula.,HavePillowWillTravel

50,"Quiet, Adorable Little Island","We happened to be here during the week of July 4th and how could you not fall in love. It was decorated to the 9s for the 4th of July!! The banners, the flowers, Americana patriotism everywhere. The homes and landscaping were immaculate, the boat docks bustling with little boys fishing, children on paddle boards and adults relaxing. They had the cutest little shops and a variety of restaurants with surprisingly good prices. I'm already planning a trip back to this little gem for some r&r!",Williamsland
50,Need to Visit More Often!!,"My teenage daughters wanted to go to Balboa Island to take pictures, walk the puppy and eat ice-cream. I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to do that! Luckily for us, our visit was right before the 4th of July, so all of the houses had patriotic decor, the shops are fun to walk around in, and the dog was so darn happy! I live close-by, but as I was driving away, I thought to myself that I had better have this simple day of walking around in a beautiful location more often.",Fieldtravels
40,Balboa is Cute and Beachy,"Balboa is a little island with a little bridge you driver over to get to. My advice is park BEFORE the bridge at the Pavillions parking lot because parking on Balboa itself can be VERY difficult especially on a summer weekend. It's a short walk over the bridge to Balboa. Once there, there is one main drag with little beach shops and a few restaurants. One tradition is the open window old fashioned ice cream shops where you order at the window. People order frozen bananas dipped in various toppings. It's my favorite place for frozen yogurt because it's the old fashioned soft serve kind not all that modern Pinkberry stuff. It's nice to walk around the perimeter of Balboa or the little side streets. Balboa is very laid back, kind of old fashioned, and low scale. I wish they had some more upscale home decor shops but it's more laid back than that. If this is your first time in the Newport area, worth a little walk over the bridge.",Marge C
50,Quaint Commercial Center!,Balboa Island is always an enjoyable time. You have to walk along the inland shore along the bayside homes. The strip that brings you into Balboa has a lot of quaint shops and restaurants. You have to go at least once if you are in Newport Beach.,Beemer87

Happy hour specials at both fine seafood places at either end of the midway.",9whaledaker

50,Fun beachy little part of town....,Balboa island is like visiting a small beachy town with little shops and restaurants. It's all cute and you can ride the ferry back and forth to get to it. Just lots of little things to do and don't forget to get the famed chocolate covered frozen banana as there is always at least a few in line for one. There is a Starbucks but most stores and restaurants are little self owned shops and not chains it seems albeit Amelia's Italian has a couple locations.Just a fun low key way to spend a day!,HappyLife

Starting with a brisk walk to view all the quaint homes, look at the boats and maybe even take the 3 car fairy over to Balboa Pennisula to visit the beach or the fun zone. I recently spent a day walking the main street of Balboa with my sister and we had so much fun shopping all the quaint boutiques! From inexpensive to one of a kind clothing, to art or olive oil...Balboa has it all. coffee, restaurants, etc. also available and don't miss the Balboa bars! To add adventure rent Pedego bikes and ride down to the Wedge, or take a ride on a Duffy boat to explore Newport Harbor by water. So much to do...you'll need several trips!",TayaLeReve
50,Quaint Island Charm-Go Before it Disappears,"Balboa Island is a quaint, artsy island off Newport Beach where the temperature is almost always near a perfect 72 degrees fahrenheit. You can get there over a two lane bridge or by a car ferry. I highly recommend the latter at sunset.I always dreamed of wintering there in one of the quaint, historical, yet somehow trendy, houses where I would write the great American novel. That hasn't happened yet, but I highly recommend visiting, as I have many times.Spend your day walking or biking along the boardwalks and visiting the little local shops. Boating is available and the people watching is world class. There are many food options from basic burgers to Madarin, Mexican and Italian.Balboa is steeped in interesting history but go soon because like all quaint places, modernity is catching up with it and local shops and restaurants are disappearing each year.Don't forget to catch a sunset that will surely be...unforgettable.",Mary T
50,"Fun place for breakfast, coffee, stroll and shopping","This has to be one of the cutest islands on the west coast. Depending on the time you have available I suggest either grabbing a cup of coffee, better yet breakfast at Wilma's. Wilma's is a little mom & pop local breakfast spot. Our favorites were the Light breakfast or Eggs Benedict with coffee of their famous Bloody Mary. The staff is great and the Hawaiian shirts ad to the flare of the place. After walk off breakfast with a walk around the Island which is a bit over a mile. If you have the time, take the ferry over to the Peninsula walk around and play some games at the Fun Zone and then grab lunch.",Gisela - life w/ boys
50,Always a pleasure to visit this place!,If you can find parking! Make sure you wear comfortable shoes. The shops are really quaint and a delight to just browse or shop.

There are several that are available for rent as well.,valuemytime
40,Fun for families and singles alike,"Balboa Island is a tiny place at the very end of the Newport Peninsula with all kinds of attractions for all types of people. There is a Ferris Wheel and gravity machine, carousel and lots of video game arcades. The choice of restaurants varies from casual, outdoor picnic style to nicer high end restaurants. The bar scene is also lively with lots of choices from the very loud Cabo Cantina to the more old-school Balboa Saloon with pool tables and games.You can get on the ferry to go across to the main Newport Beach side with the famous chocolate covered banana bars and cute little shops and get to Fashion Island in less than 1/2 mile.",ms_webcasa
50,So charming!,"I have been coming to Balboa Island for more than 50 years. Although it is way more expensive than it was 50 years ago, it is still a charming spot to visit and to stay, a great place for a chocolate covered frozen banana (a must), a perfect location for a stroll around the island to see the beautiful flowers and the wonderful cottages and big and small residences. An inexpensice ferry can carry you and your car over the the ocean side for the big waves or you can stay on the island and go to a small calm beach by the bay.",gail g

Great place to walk the 3 mile loop over the main Balboa Island & Little Balboa Island. Crockers is a little hole in the wall & delicious for a quick sandwich. Everyone in the shops is very friendly - special here must be a frozen banana although haven't tried it yet. Hope to experience the ferry to/from Newport Beach before we leave. Be patient, there is a lot of traffic but so worth it.",DDDFJD
50,"If you've never had a Balboa Bar and you are within 20 miles, it is worth the drive to have one.","Balboa Island has more that just Balboa Bars but first I, and then my sons,were hooked on them so whenever my sons are in town we take a drive there just for the bars. The bar consists of about a 4"" by 4"" by 1/2"" vanilla icecream bar with a stick in it that is first dipped in chocolate syrup and then into crushed nuts of all kinds. I prefer walnuts. There are all kinds of other toppings as well. This is not to leave out the rest of why Balboa Island is worth visiting as there are lots of restaurants on both sides of the main street and a walk around the larger island is a good workout, at least for an old man like me, and a walk around the small island which is bridge connected, is an easy and fun walk for me.",Al E

We didnt think we would spend much time here, as unless you get the ferry to the village, there is only one street,How wrong we were. The street is just full of little individual shops, all selling different , and yet affordable things.The best part of all was the welcome and friendliness we had from each of the shop owners. We laughed and talked and it was like meeting old friends. We talked more than we shopped.I believe they have a market there at the weekend too",sallySomerset

40,Fun Couple of Hours,"Balboa Island is a refreshing throwback to the past. It is a great place to walk around safely while browsing through the shops.

There are a number of nice restaurants as well as some decent quick food establishments here as well...and don't forget to get a frozen banana or balboa bar while walking around.

30,"Touristy, but has a nice perimeter walk","First off, go on a weekday if you possibly can. Weekends are hectic even before school lets out. On a weekday in April, we were able to find a place to park on the street. From then on, it’s easy to walk the town and it’s countless shops and restaurant. Rather than having one of the ubiquitous frozen bananas, go for the classic Balboa Bar from Dad’s Donuts.Our favorite part of the island is the perimeter walk. Good, but not outstanding as beach boardwalks go. On the down side, the walk is somewhat noisy with construction sounds and planes overhead. It also has some unusual smells, but they’re not that strong. One can’t go out on the piers, as they’re all private. On the plus side, the boardwalk is paved and wide and clean. Bikes aren’t allowed. That’s a downside if you want to bike, but a real plus if you’re a walker. You’ll find benches and the occasional drinking fountain. It’s 1.7 miles around. You might get a close up look, as we did at a great blue heron and a snowy egret. If you’re in Newport Beach, see it, just for the experience.",artandroxanne
50,Brisk Balboa Island walk to start you day,"Walking around the big and little island is one of life's pleasures. Do it early to avoid the crowds. You wil have the best sightings of an active harbor view, fresh air, lovely cottages and as much exercise as you would like. You will certainly see friends along your way. Special times to visit are all holidays when the generous Balboa Islanders lavishly decorate their homes. Several houses go over the top. But no matter when you take your walk, or stroll , dine, shop on Marine Avenue or take the ferry you will fall in love with Balboa Island. I should know we use to go to the Jolly Roger now Wilma's as a teen.",Hyflyingbee
50,Balboa Island life is for me!,My husband and I spent a morning walking along the path on the island perimeter. It is beautiful all the way around. What a wonderful way to experience this island and its carefree lifestyle. We watched the boats and the seals and the ferry. Later we walked down the shopping street and visited the interesting shops. We purchased fine olive oil and vinegar that is going to make wonderful salad dressings and help us to remember our trip. Finally we bought a postcard and wrote the note while we ate lunch at a sidewalk table. When lunch was over we walked across the street to the post office and mailed the keepsake to my mother. What a wonderful way to experience California life. What a wonderful morning for a couple or small group of friends. Highly recommend.,Ruth A
50,Charming island with friendly folks,"There is a charm to this island that is hard to describe until you see it in person. Marine road is full of restaurants and souvenir shops and makes for a fun and relaxing walk.We entered the island using a shuttle our hotel provided and the goal was to cut across the island in order to take the ferry across to Newport beach. The first day we walked across via Park Ave, and it was quiet beautiful walk with great houses and neighbourhoods to appreciate.However, the following day we had the same goal but instead we cut across the island via the path that hugs the water front. This path can be accessed via ""South Bay Front"" road (and really you can go the southern extremity of any neighbourhood street to find an access point). The waterfront properties are gorgeous and can't help but make you dream to live in a wonderful place like Balboa island.Overall, we had a great time visiting balboa island, and adding it to our walking itinerary of Newport beach.",Sarthak M

50,charming little town...,"Feels like the east coast somewhere as this little town on the island had cute shops, restaurants and simply a great walking island. There is a large side and a small side that you can walk the strand and loop both islands. The small side is purely residential and much quieter but it's a great walk, especially if you enjoy looking at homes. One is cuter than the next. The larger side has homes around the outer edges that are mainly summer rentals so most are in vacation mode and can be quite active and fun, especially in the summer. I used to live a couple blocks across the bridge and would come here daily to do the island loop with my dog. A great walk and the view can't be beat. Christmas and Halloween are a must see as most the parameter homes get really in to decorating. Seeing the perspective from a boat is even better. Take the time and take a visit!! Oh and stop at one of the 2 places claiming to be world famous frozen chocolate dipped bananas! I tried them both and it's a tie. hahaha",kelley c

Most of these shops only last a few years and then get replaced by something else. One of the oldest shops though, Dad's Donuts, has been here for ever and is a must stop place. Wilma's Patio is another place to eat, they took over the spot of the old Jolly Rodger a few years back and have really good food.",Troy-Wo

50,Great strolling for all ages.,"Balboa is a small, flat island with little beach houses dating to the early 20th century plus palaces built where these were torn out. It's a fun place to walk, especially the perimeter path with zero traffic. Charming homes with elegant mini-gardens look out on the water, private docks, a friendly protected beach and gorgeous boats of all sorts. Locals and visitors meet, a little girl has a cookie stand, old folks take in the sun, babies toddle on the sand and joggers brush by in hot gear and headsets. If you just like to admire patio decor and well-designed plantings don't miss it. If you're an armchair critic of architecture or one who drools over yachts, it's a pretty good place. Interior lanes away from shopping usually offer a few parking spots even on weekends, and more tiny lots with wonderful places on them.",Barbshawtravels

The Main Street is beautiful with a classic Californian feel, it's almost like stepping back in time.The houses on the island are worth the trip, they all have distinct styles and you can't help but be envious of the lucky people who get to call this place home.

We had ice cream at one of the many shops which sell frozen bananas. It was a long walk to the ferry to go to the Balboa Island but the long walk was made interesting by the small little houses with beautiful gardens and lovely architecture. Ferry runs continuously and carries both passengers and cars for a nominal charge. Visitors to Balboa Island should visit Balboa Village with lots of fun activities for family.,A103V
50,Fantastic homes,Beautiful homes on the island with a nice array of quirky shops and lovely restaurants. Ciao is a must for a visit...very dog friendly too on the island with lots of puppies!!,Victoria E
50,Nice shopping and ferry ride,There was a nice variety of shops on the island. The ferry ride was inexpensive and a nice experience.,Corwinss
50,Buy a Balboa Bar,"Nice village feel on this upmarket island. Relaxing walk around the water front, friendly shops and locals. Definitely get a Balboa Bar, you won't be sorry!",kathyoung
40,Great for a Stroll,"Balboa Island main street is great for eating, shopping, strolling. A really nice walk is on the sidewalk that circles the island. Take you time, great people watching and views of the homes that face the water.",Tipton H
40,Small town feel,Balboa island is a very nice place to have lunch or dinner or just walk around. There are plenty of shops on the main street and places to enjoy a coffee or ice cream. I enjoy walking around the waterfront and seeing the island homes and just enjoy the marine activity and all the other people walking the island are doing the same. A very pleasant way to exercise.,Priscilla G
50,Great spot,"Balboa Island is a cute little area, with shops and restaurants, and pleasant walking. At the end is the water, with a lovely walking path that stretches for what seems like miles. There are pretty homes along the way and every street is jewel named - Onyx, emerald, etc. A ferry leaves from the island and goes to the peninsula, which is about a 5 minute trip. Lovely place.",shirleygFoxboro_Ma
40,"Wonderful place to stroll, eat and shop!","Just in walking distance from our daughters home in Corona Del Mar is the lovely Balboa Island. Filled with so many unique homes, old, new, modern, eclectic, with some of the most beautiful flowers and landscaping around. The main street offers a variety of specialty shops, restaurants, ice cream (frozen banana dipped in chocolate), and a ferry that can take you across the bay. It's great to stroll along the seawall, look at the boats, homes and people watch. Dog walking is very popular too. On the weekends it does get rather crowded and parking can be an issue. The fire department building has a public restroom.",Karen W
50,So much fun!,"I went with my mother and 2 young children. We had a blast playing on the pier, the beach, and eating frozen bananas!",TiffanyLVill
50,How to drive on water without actually...driving.,"Wile you could drive all the way around to get to Balboa Island, it's easier and funner to just stay seated and enjoy the water...from your CAR! If you have kids, then it's a real goof...once on the other side, plenty of parking and eateries and attractions are available. It's a great way to spend an awesome day with anyone.",louiefrias
50,Frozen Bananas!!!,We came here because of the Arrested Development connection. The place is gorgeous!!! Lots of shopping and places to visit AND frozen Bananas!,J C
50,Good shopping!,"I walked from the island hotel. It was a nice walk . The bay was beautiful with many boats. I walked up and down and shopped at several boutiques. Nice brands ( wild fox , sanctuary, Ella moss) but some shops were lower priced( everything $16). It was a nice experience! Very friendly people . Loved Mode ology!",Lou Ann L
50,Worth a visit,Fallible island is now quite developed with many cute houses and an interesting boating area. There are many cute shops along the main street as well as little ice cream stores which sell one of the things they're famous for the frozen banana. I like Dads. Parking on the side streets are available when the main area is difficult.,Jeremy T
50,Fun place to spend the afternoon,Quaint little island full of cafes and shops! Loved the outlet stores especially Crush! Lots of places to eat their signature frozen bananas. The drawback is lack of parking.,LisaBirkman
50,Beautiful,"Scrolling around on the Island is a must, I'm so glad I did it and found this excellent small Island where this small nice, very expensive houses are located. wish I had one as well..",Pschon
40,Beautiful charming community.,"Balboa is a nice place to visit if you enjoy shopping, dining and great views. It has a small town feel. Walking around is a special treat.",bllinder
50,"This island is just splendid, a must see on any visit to California","Nice houses, boats, ferries, a great bay and beach. Boat rentals available. Good food everywhere, the beaches are nice, but head a short distance to the east side of the Island to watch the incredible surf at the Wedge.",Mike C
20,Kind of boring,It is okay for a day.It has a couple of cute shops.Parking is awful. The ferry ride is not worth it!,Carol S
40,Fun place,"We live 2 miles away and gone often since our girl was a baby; as a teen we go less but it's still on the top 10 outing list.The island itself is mainly about the high end tourist shops and restaurants. We have a few favorites, and a few we know to stay clear of; but mostly the former.Its surrounded by a sidewalk along the harbor and inlets and many multi-million dollar homes. It's quite the zoo at XMAS and Halloween. The XMAS boat parades that are must-see, but arrive 2 or 3 hours early.About a 1 mile walk (or short drive) is the ferry to the Peninsula. That has a Ferris wheel, boating rentals and adventures, more restaurants and beach walks, although it's perhaps a couple notches down below the island in consistency. That said, the Peninsula has 2 of our favorite restaurant destinations - BJs Pizza and a large seafood restaurant with great happy hour orderves overlooking the harbor and it's sites. The Pizza place next to the ferry is also really good. Some of the snack shops range from ""eeeh"" to ""yikes!"".Back to the Island. I think we mainly like it because after we catch a bite; we really enjoy walking the neighborhood and admiring what the multi-millionaires have done with their places (ie: envy walk). The sidewalk that skirts the whole island along the water is also a very pleasant after-dinner walk.Parking can be insane on a busy weekend.",Brad L
30,Balboa Island,"Balboa Island is a nice place to visit, but it not a must see if your looking for things to do. There is practically no parking on the island, and taking the ferry over from the peninsula leaves you a good distance from the Marine Avenue which is where all the things to see are. Once you get there however there are some nice shops, you should probably stop at Sugar n' Spice for some ice cream, and if your looking for something more substantial then there are Amelia's Seafood & Italian, Ciao - New York style restaurant and Wilma's Patio just to name a few. Be sure to call ahead as they these places run on ""Island Time.""",Reid F. K
50,Love this island,"I grew up in Newport Beach and spent endless amounts of time on Balboa Island and the Balboa Pennisula. Everytime we visit the area this is one of my first stops. It is still so quant and relaxing. It is a beautiful little island, lots of really fun shops and restaurants. Must go, you will not be sorry.",SGEverettWA
50,"It's a ""Fun Zone!""","Where the Ferry crosses the bay on Balboa Island is a wonderful ""Fun Zone"" for the kids! There are several big boats or little boats to take out and cruise the bay! Lots of delicious restaurants (cotton candy to Lobster!) to choose from and bay front stores to shop for souvenirs! Or just take a nice STROLL along the Docks!",Nan2cute4u
50,Love walking around here!,Such a fun little place to stroll around. There are lots of little shops and places to eat. You can walk around the entire island in about 30 minutes or go have coffee and hang out for hours. Don't forget to ride the ferry!,Helix88
50,Gotta try the frozen banana.,Such a cute little town to wander around at night! The banana was tasty but not something that I need on a regular basis.,Paul J
50,Time stands still,"Just as we re remembered from a prior visit in 2012. A few names changed on the charming local store fronts, but the circle-the-island stroll was as bucolic as ever, save perhaps for way too many USC Trojan flags hanging from porches.",1West
50,Great little town! Fun shopping and eating!,"Really enjoyed exploring this little town. The shops are fun and have prices that suit everyone. Some fun restaurants. The Village looks boring from the outside, but has GREAT food and service!",katdod50
50,A haven for looy-loos.,"We took the ferry over for $1 and circumnavigated the island - enjoying all the multi-million dollar houses packed in like sardines in a can. Each home is unique and well cared for. I loved seeing each home and their small, lovely gardens. Tucked between massive mansions (for the lot size) were cottages built decades ago. Such an interesting reflection on property values, life styles, choices. Don't forget to get a frozen banana at Dad's on the main street. A real throw back to the 1950s.",Ann60878
50,A nice day at the beach.,Balboa Island has been a special place since high school days. The grand kids love the beach and the frozen bananas. It was a warm sunny day in January and a nice way to relax after 2 days at Disneyland and a day at Knott's Berry Farm.,LeonNoel7
50,Magical Island,"This little island is really like a film set. The houses along the water's edge were so quaint and obviously a lot if money. The main street had shops and restaurants with every being so polite and friendly, even Starbucks. Magical place reached by the bridge from the main highway.",Robert T
30,Charming spot,"This is a lovely place to spend an afternoon strolling thrôugh the shops and walking along the waterfront to see not only the beautiful views, but to check out the charming homes on the water and the side streets.",Lee F
50,Timeless,"The main street is full of little shops and boutiques,cafes and you could be back in the twentieth century. Lovely little houses line the little streets. Real estate from $1 million dollars plus!! Take the ferry over to Balboa/Newport Beach for beautiful views of the biggest marina in the USA. It takes three cars at a timeand costs $2.00. The place is so lovely we return year after year!!",BRUCE P
50,Pleasant little island,This little island is accessible by ferry or bridge and an enjoyable place to spend a day. A shopping area for local crafts and artists products is available on the bayside.,A Tripadvisor Member
50,A world away just minutes away,"Balboa Island has retained its unique feel over the 40 years that I've been visiting. Crossing the bridge from Pacific Coast Highway is all it takes for me to feel like I'm on vacation. It's crowded on weekends, but still offers a nice option in Newport Beach for a stroll, a snack, a meal, boutique shopping and such.",Miggy747
50,Loved the Visit,Loved the shopping downtown and walking around the neighborhood seeing all the beautiful houses. It was a beautiful day. Don't miss the Balboa Canals - didn't even know they were there until I was looking at things to do in Balboa. Not to miss when in Newport Beach.,retiree508
50,Balboa Christmas boat parade,This boat parade is once a year for 5 days. You can get on a boat that's in the parade as we did. You can also watch the shoreline. We enjoyed going on the boat and being in the parade. You see many lovely houses all decorated and some of the home owners are at home and will wave back at you. Most people on the boat will yell back Merry Christmas! Its about a hour and a half on the boat riding around to see the lights. All boats are decorated and lighted. If you are disabled there is some steps to climb into the boat and out. Seating not sure we were out on the bow no seating. Its a lot of fun but be aware there is a check in and a long line to wait in before getting on the boat. Parking is very hard to find and is not free. Arrive early to be on time. Boats leave at certain times for this. We took a cab from our hotel so we wouldn't have the parking issue problem. Staff was very nice. You can see the homes from the boat real easy and they have their boats that are moored to their dock lite up with Christmas lights also sometimes besides their houses. You can see the other boats in the parade going ahead of you or behind the boat you are on. Its just a fun thing to do at Christmas time. Dress in layers for it can get cold at night and windy and you are on the water in a boat. Bring a coat or jacket in case.,gardentogarden
10,Not a bicycle friendly place,"A couple of bicycle rides recommended on the internet for the Newport Beach area include passage through Balboa Island. It is best to put the bikes in a car or truck for the passage.This island community apparently does not want bicycles. Every decent path is marked ""no bicycles"". The roads are narrow with no bike lanes. They don't even have bike racks in the village area (i.e., no stopping for shops and restaurants).",fnewton2
50,Visiting old neighborhood,"I lived on the island while going to school so am a bit partial. Still has the quaint charm as I remember but many of the little 'cottage type"" houses have been remodeled into much larger ""manses""! It was time for Circle of Light so we were able to enjoy all the decorated homes in the area.",Karen H
50,Always a visit to Dad's and the VI,You have to have a Balboa Bar while you walk the island. And the Village Inn for music on Friday's and Saturday's is always fun if you are visiting the area.,Travlin_7
50,Fun place,"The shops are great for picking up trinkets to bring back to the kids (actually, they aren't kids any more). The local food concessions and the ferry ride across the bay make for a really nice time. We make it a point of spending lots of time on Balboa Island",Alan B
40,Great Place for Lunch,Balboa Island was such a cute place to visit. We went to about three restaurants on the island. We just loved the place and had such great fund.,Marie Harper
40,A must see,"precious island community , watch the Christmas lights in their yard as you watch the famous boat parade",austin_TexasLkd
40,Great Christmas Lights,During the Christmas season many houses on Balboa Island are decorated. You can do a walking tour. It is easy to take the Ferry over to the Island.,53rb53
50,most delightful little island in California,"I grew up on this island - so quaint and adorable, from the beach cottages to the walk around the island to the shopping.",Annie13035
40,Nice Town to Stroll and Shop,The island is a great place to stroll through since there are variety of shops and dining outlets to give it a welcoming tourist town. Each of the small shop was generally manned by single individual and can be quite occupied. However they were helpful if asked for assistance or direction. Take sometime in enjoying the town and if possible include a ferry ride crossing with your car.,Charn P
50,Favorite hangout,"I lived on Balboa Island for many years and loved every bit of it... ok maybe not the traffic, but all of the rest. I still go to walk and shop or dine a few times every month and I find it very relaxing and home like.",Monica S
50,Balboa Island,"Balboa Island is a do not miss place. Darling shops. You can get there from the Ferry .... which takes a short time ... from Balboa Fun Zone. Nothing dull about the Island. Great shops, beautiful homes, wonderful to just walk around. You may see someone famous.",SusieRussell
50,Gorgeous!!!,"Visited Balboa island and Balboa village in September 2014, wow, what a stunning place, we loved it, it's quaint, beautiful, I didn't realise such beautiful places existed......we will be returning to Balboa one day.",Craig N R
50,Good Day Trip...rent a Duffy Boat,We were in LA area to visit friends...they recommended Balboa for a day trip/evening which ended up being great. We took the car ferry across and walked the area with the kids. Plenty to do. We did not spot any sea lions but am told they are about. We rented Duffy boats at night and cruised around the island to catch the holiday lights on the waterfront homes. Definitely would do it again. Very easy and fun for all ages.,David W
50,Xmas Wonderland,We really enjoyed driving through this island at night and observing the awesome Xmas displays! You can tell the residents value their island and take enormous pride in their surroundings. Made me want to move there!!!,Gwen M
50,Adorable upscale village,We loved driving around this cute village...the restaurants were fun and the homes were beautiful. We took the whale watching trip and we were able to see the homes from the harbor side. Everything on this island was clean and felt very safe.,LLPProsper_Tx
50,Always a Pleasure,Balboa Island is a perfect place to spend a few hours browsing and shopping. All the shops offer tasteful and creative merchandise. And I love strolling along the water front streets sneaking peeks into the houses along the way.,47Juicyfruitgirl
50,I live here and love it,"My great grandfather moved our house here, on a barge, in 1937. Actually there are two Balboa Islands: a ""big"" one and a ""little"" one. They are the only islands in Newport Beach you can walk around. Come on down, grab a frozen banana, and walk it off by going around both islands. You can marvel at the zillion dollar houses, that you can look straight into, and contemplate the fact that all this is built totally on sand dredged out of the bay. I think Amelia's is the best restaurant but if noise does not bother you, you'll like Chao. Restrooms are available at the fire station.",Mike
50,Fun Times,Lots of shops and eating places. Very nice fun area to just wander around in. Lots to see. Real cute little cottages right along the beach. Very fun little town with lots to see. Fun to walk out on the pier but watch out for the birds. :) We were here in November so not real crowded. Cant wait for our next visit to spend more time in this area.,Bonnie C
50,Take the time for a side trip just off 101,"If driving up the coastal highway take the time to stop, walk around on the boardwalk etc. Nice little cottages right on the water -- (all very expensive) incredible boats everywhere. At nights they have a boat parade - especially at Christmas time -- a great sight. Lots of shops and restaurants to visit..",Jeff T
40,Newport at it's most quaint!,"Some really terrific shops to explore, among now too many tee-shirt shops, but don't be discouraged by that. Fun places to check out: CandleEssence (made right there, wonderful and unique scents), and Art for the Soul (lots of unique stuff, great place to shop for gifts) are my favorites. Just plain good food: Wilma's Patio and Amelia's. The only problem with the Island is parking. Always a bit of a hassle. You just have to keep prowling the side streets off Marine Avenue, and enjoy whatever walk you might have to make to get to the main drag, Marine Avenue. Also very enjoyable to stroll around the Island on the promenade that surrounds the entire island! Sea air, quaint ""cottages"" and lots of boats! A few ducks, now and then too! Great for families! Very popular spot. Go off season if possible.",Marie G
50,quaint but crowded,We drove to Balboa Island Sunday afternoon and spent a couple hours strolling there. The homes are so quaint and lovely and the main shopping street offered a variety of fun shops and nice restaurants.

30,Balboa Island,"Great place to go for a stroll along Main st. Interesting curio shops, clothing, restaurants and great frozen babanas. Great to walk around the island espacially at night where you can look inside peoples homes. Also, not to be missed is before big holidays like Easter, Halloween and especially Christmas (at night!). Good for solo,couples and families.",Captain_Leo
40,"You are in Newport Beach, why not a visit here?","Whether coming from Fashion Island shopping or taking the ferry from the Fun Zone, this is a must see in Orange county.This little Island probably contains the highest priced real estate per square foot of any place in Southern California. Park the car and walk the village or drive the tiny streets of the Island to see unassuming multi-million dollar homes.At Christmas, this is a must see for the over-the-top Holiday decorations or watching the nightly boat parade.",jroger69
40,"Nice, quiet place to walk around, eat, and go to the beach.","This was a fun excursion--we went over to look around and eat a casual lunch. A great way to spend a few hours. You can also take your car on the ferry and park--good if you're going to go to the beach and have gear, etc.",keut
40,Fabulous Halloween decorations!,This was my second visit to Balboa Island and I was just looking for a nice solitary stroll with lunch and some shopping. It just so happened that it was 2 weeks before Halloween and a lot of the residents of the island really go all out for holiday. I had a blast walking around and enjoying people's very elaborate decorations. Then I went to the commercial area and went shopping and had lunch. It was really a lovely day for a woman having a day on her own.,Pamela P
40,OC beach fun,"This is a great little island to walk. Rides for kids, bars and restaurants for adults and family. Only 3-4 blocks wide from ferry to beach it is so easy to get around. Make sure you eat a frozen banana to help keep cool from one of the historic retailers close to the ferry dock. The berms on the beach are quite high right now so the view isn't near as beautiful until you walk over them to the water side.",Boomersig
30,Semi Tourist Trap,the restaurants and stores all seem to feed on tourists. Over pay for not a lot. Did get a decent frozen banana there! Probably would not come back her on our next visit to Newport.,Tony A

50,Love this area!,ahh the beach! The smell of the salt sun and fun! This is a quaint lil spot down by the end of the peninsula. It is always a pleasure to visit and you will feel a million miles away! There are a lot of attraction for young and old alike! This a a bit of a more ritzy area with old charm.,Dee
50,"A great any time of the year experience for vacation, a couple of days or weekly!","I have a friend who has a family house on the island...since the 20s.Such a great beachy atmosphere.It is not inexpensive, so if you are looking for a cheap place to stay, this is probably not the place to go.10 minutes from John Wayne airport.List of rental houses, just a fun area of California.",Julie M
50,Lovely change of scenery,"We were visiting LA for a couple of days and decided to hire a driver for the day so that we weren't hassled with a rental car to visit a few spots along the coast. We drove down to Laguna beach and then made our way up to Newport Beach and on to Balboa Island before finishing up in Long Beach. It was midweek, so beautifully quiet and we just had a very chilled couple of hours walking around Balboa Island admiring the quaint properties and all the mixture of boats on their moorings whilst enjoying an ice-cream.Just a pleasant chilled afternoon.",Dime26

40,"Balboa is a quiet, residential area with a picturesque harbor","It is an area of Newport Beach, actually comprising three modified or artificial islands in Newport Harbour: Balboa Isle, the largest; the smaller Little Balboa Isle to the east of Balboa Isle, joined by a two-lane bridge; and the smallest Collins Isle to the northwest of Balboa Isle, joined by a one-lane bridge. The Balboa Isle community is joined to the mainland by a short two-lane bridge on the northeast of Balboa Isle, and a privately operated fleet of three, three car ferryboats (Balboa Island Ferry) which provide access across the harbour to the Balboa Peninsula which lies to the south.The ferry to the peninsula is a super-short ride -- walk, bike, or bring your car. It costs a few bucks to take the ferry. Only 3 cars fit on it, so prepare to wait during the summer if you have your car with you.Parking isn't as bad. Just park a few blocks off of Marine Avenue. There's always someone leaving. Also you can drive down alleyways to avoid traffic to get across island.They say that winter is the BEST time on island. It's quiet, there's way less traffic, and it’s easier to park and is more enjoyable.Balboa Island is an excellent place to visit and discover, Charming cottages and cute stores and restaurants sets it all apart from the rest of Newport Beach.Charming houses line the little streets and each shop had local goods-the specialty in the area seems to be frozen chocolate covered bananas-with multiple locations claiming to have ""the best. I may not though agree with it as I did not enjoy it as much",sorabh

50,Just a beautiful day at the beach,This was such a relaxing way to spend a day. Ou are able to park in a parking lot right at the beach so not a lot of walking to he there.It is clean and had a lot of waves if your into surf riding or some form of riding.There is lifeguards present. The beach is patrolled also.Highly recomend,Summersnuggles
40,Shopping. Dining. Beach!,Great place to hangout for the afternoon and one of my favs. There are boats that leave from here for whale watching and for Catalina Island.,SuziReckless
40,You've gotta go at least once,"We didn't stay on balboa island, but you ca go for a day and get your fill. Maybe even a half day. We took the ferry over, drove the tiny streets with the cute houses. Walked around to see all the little shops. Got taffy, ate a corn dog, and then we still had a little over two hours on our parking meter. It was just my husband and me though. I'm sure with families it might take a little longer. Ideally, you could then spend some time on the beach. Then head over to the crab cooker for dinner. :) (that place is so good!) We didn't plan it out that well, but if you aren't staying on the island that is what I recommend. Just be prepared to pay to park. If you luck in to an open spot without having to pay at a meter or pay station. PARK! That doesn't happen often.",Elizabeth A
50,Short and sweet,"Me and my son visited here and was truly amazed about everything.From the beach ,the views,the shops and all the other things that you can do like biking,whale/ dolphin watching ,ferry ride,arcades,etc,etc.We will definitely come back,and next time we'll come early so will have enough time to bike around and go whale watching which was for 2 1/2 hours.We ate at Ruby's Diner located at the end of the pier.Best burger and flavored fries we've ever had for a very reasonable price.Then had frozen bananas for dessert.We had a wonderful day and will return for more!",19871991
30,"Balboa Island darling, not a good fit for families w teenagers","Just returned from a week on Balboa Island w my 16 YO daughter and a bunch of her girlfriends - two moms and two older girls supervised. The girls had fun biking around the island - ferried over to the peninsula every day to see friends, eat pizza, play in the ocean, etc. The problem came at night - the houses on the island are built very closely together, and most rentals do not have air conditioning (at least ours did not). curfew is 10pm. Never mind how hot it is inside your very expensive rental - you must keep all windows closed after 10 or else face the wrath of the elderly residents. The girls had a wonderful time singing, watching TV, laughing together and just being teenaged girls - the neighbors were very unhappy with our noise and complained to us and the rental company every day. I don't blame them exactly - but it was an impossible situation. One of the teenagers was actually threatened by the neighbor for parking against the garage ""only residents are allowed to do that! i'll call the police on you!"" Next time i will look into renting on the water on the peninsula or in Newport, maybe oceanside someplace. Balboa island is best left to families with small children or older adults -",LeiRow

50,Summer on Balboa Island,"We have been coming to Balbao Island for over 20 years! It is consistently a great visit because of the quality of the location's beauty, the weather, the lovely people we have met over this period & the beachy shops/restaurants that populate Marine Avenue (the Main Street).It is a great place to sit on various 'Bay Front' beaches while watching power & sail boats pass by. Too, it is a safe place for everyone (especially children). And finally, a terrific place to stroll around on either or both of the Big & Little Islands. The wide sidewalks allow you to view the many lovely homes, boats & people enjoying the ambience the Island(s) provide!Things to see/visit include: the Balboa Ferry - to the Peninsula & the Fun Zone, the Balboa History Museum, myriad shops, Amelia's & Wilma's restaurants,etc.Balboa Island is a real jewel!!",Ironmansteele

50,Incredibly cute island,"I was extremely surprised by this cute little island, almost thought I was somewhere on the east coast. There are some shops and restaurants along with a ton of homes. We only drove through the island but I can see getting out for a quick tour of the shops on the Main Street. For sure worth a stop if you have time. Giving it 5 stars for being a great little island, but not sure I would recommend going for very long.",App19
40,Always a treat!,"It's packed in Summer as well as around the Holidays when each house competes for the best Christmas lights and decorations but it's a fun place to go.

30,A little cheesy,Walked down to Balboa from Newport on the boardwalk. I thought Balboa was a little run down and had kind of a greasy carnival feel. Wouldn't spend more than an hour here. It worth seeing once but don't know that I would go out of my way to make it here again.,Carid W
40,Excersize !,"The best start of the day, walk or run around the island. surrounded by multi million dollar homes at the water is a paved walk way. watch out for the dogs.

10,"Lovely, but people seeking quiet beware...","Balboa is a charming, old fashioned island with a great main street (Marine Ave.) and just a ferry ride away to the ocean beaches of Newport. There are some very pricey homes on the island, some quite stunning. It's loads of fun walking around the island and enjoying the festive atmosphere. However, if you are planning on staying overnight, be aware that 1) the John Wayne airport flight pattern is right over the island, and at exactly 7 am most mornings, you will be greeted by the sound of low flying planes taking off one after the other. Also, 2) there is a very good chance there will be construction going on in close proximity to your house, since houses are all very close to one another and there is lots of renovation going on. They start at a 7 am as well. Aside from those two major drawbacks if you like to sleep late while on vacation, there is the typical dog barking and neighbors chatting, etc. that could likely wake you in the morning or keep you awake at night, since many homes do not have air conditioning and therefore rely on open windows for ventilation. Wish we had known this, as we do like to sleep a little later than 7 am while vacationing.",Runaroundsue2
50,"Laid back, quiet, beautiful...","A beautiful island with beautiful cartoon-like houses, nice little shops selling t-shirts, hats, flip flops, bags, souvenirs, etc. Lots of small restaurants and cafes. Frozen bananas are a must-try. You can take the ferry by car or on foot for a couple of bucks and reach the peninsula. Have a walk on the beach and the beautiful pier and talk to the friendly residents.You can also book a whale watching boat trip at Newport Landing. It's located on the right a few meters after you come off the ferry on the peninsula side. You'll see lots of sea lions, dolphins and whales if you're lucky.",Ahmed D
50,LOVE this little place.,"We took a hop on/hop off tour of the beaches from Anaheim and this was the second stop. We spent about an hour just hanging out on the pier. We took the ferry over to the other side, grabbed a hot dog and watched the sailboats, then ferried back for just $1 each way.This is just such a laid back, pleasant place to wander. Cute ferris wheel, lots of little shops. We signed up for the shorter harbor tour that took us out to visit the sea lions, and I was delighted to catch a great view of Corona del Mar and Pirate's Cove ... I'm a 'Gilligan's Island' fan and was whistling the theme song as we buzzed along the rock wall toward the ocean. :)",scipwraec

40,Charming Bayside Village,"My husband and I were visiting Newport Beach and decided to check out Balboa Island. We were staying at the Hyatt, and they offered a free shuttle that drops you off across the street from the island. After crossing over the bridge, there's a sidewalk that winds around the perimeter of the island so you can see all of the charming bayside homes and boats. It's a very pleasant walk, and the houses are beautifully landscaped with flowers, reminiscent of Nantucket. Marine Ave. is the main street with little restaurants and shops. It's a very nice way to spend an afternoon and have dinner.",sc1009

40,Good combination of Pleasantville & play.,"What a cute place to visit!! We only had one day so couldn't do much but we walked around with our 2 year old, had a frozen banana (not all that exciting), walked on the pier and played in the sand. Surprisingly we saw a whale just off shore at the main beach and a sea lion in the marina sunning himself on a dock!! Parking was easy as there's a large lot at the public beach but we were there on a Tuesday in early May. Adorable residences, many shops and lots of greet landscaping makes this area so cute and quaint. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you have the opportunity!",Amy D
40,Frozen Bananas: A Must Sample Treat,"Since the frozen banana was allegedly original to Balboa Island it is a must sample item when visiting this delightful spot.

My goal is to spend 3-4 months starting in San Diego and driving to Canada",Sightsee291704
50,Small and quirky,"Great place for a trip on the bikes we had hired. The shops on the main street are a bit different. The main problem is the lack of a dedicated bike path, the tiny island has a lot of cars and also not many places to park up bikes. Experienced the delights of frozen bananas(who knew!) and Balboa bars - both on sticks then dipped in chocolate and covered in a toping of your choice - yummy.",Maggie F
50,A must,We took the ferry in and walked towards the Wedge and then back to the other end of the island. Had dinner and took a taxi back to our hotel. The walk was nice but next time will rent bikes or the 4 passenger bikes for a more relaxing time.,Bill&Jackie
50,Great place for a one or two day visit,"If you are heading to so cal you should def. make a point to visit balboa. Here are some things you can do here.( Hang out on a great beach, walking distance to everything fun. Park by the playground and bathrooms off Astrel street. ) rent bikes, two places that i know of. Just yelp them. Rollerblade( if you can) go on the ferry by foot if you don't mind a great walk into the little town and get yourself a famous frozen banana and saunter through the little shops. (You can drive over as well but parking is scarce) take a walk on the pier and have lunch or a shake at rubys, ride the Ferris wheel or play in the arcade, ride the bull shark or check out the water exploration exhibit, rent a little boat and check out the gorgeous homes in the bay( bring snacks and drinks) so much more! I promise there is something for everyone.",boots279
40,Fun way to spend a relaxing day,"Balboa Island is a cute place to walk or ride a bike. A small strip of stores on Marine offers good restaurants and fun shopping. A walk around the island (particularly at Christmas) provides diverse views of elegant homes and tiny beach cottages, as well as a wide variety of boats in one of the largest small boat harbors in the US. The ferry is a fun way to get there.For a great bike ride, leave your car near PCH, bike down Balboa Blvd to the end of the Peninsula, then back to the ferry. Take the ferry to the island and bike across and down to Marine where you'll find a bridge back to PCH, where you can loop back to your car.",Janae L

50,just plain fun,"just a great place to walk around. shops are adorable and owners are wonderful to talk with, don't just walk the main street, but going to the end gets you on a sidewalk where you can walk around the island and see the water, and waterfront homes (lovely!!)",Leigh A
30,Could Be a Nice Respite For A Mid-Week Lunch or Sunset Dinner.,"Pretty much a residential island off of the PCH with a main street shopping and restaurant area, and beautiful bay front views. There's a paved pathway around the island and, along it, you can catch the 3-car ferry across to the peninsula and beach area. There's 2-hour parking near the shops with longer term street parking on the residential streets. But watch out for the street cleaning signs. I don't think they'll tow you but you might get a ticket.",Zoom_Gotti

40,fun day out walking along the water,"Balboa Island is a fun day out.My partner and I went here for a few hours when we were visiting Newport Beach, and overall, there's some good shopping and walking to do here, but not really much else.At the end of the day, Balboa Island is a residential area, so it's not like there are 1,000 activities to do here. We parked along the main shopping and eating street, and grabbed a quick bite for breakfast. We ultimately walked across most of the island along the beach. It's a good 1-2 mile walk, but we passed a lot of nice houses and it's just some good exercise. We saw plenty of people running and families walking together. It actually was a good loop to do, because we were also able to see all the shops along the main drag.I felt Balboa Island was like an upscale Key West, because most people there are renting for the summer and are on vacation. Fun day out.",Flyer
50,GREAT LITTLE TRIP,"We took the small ferry over and drove to the main street, can't remember it's name.

50,Stroll along South Bayfront and Marine Ave,"Visited Balboa Island in March. Enjoyed strolling along Marine Ave and dining at Wilma's Patio. After lunch, we wandered along South Bayfront-admiring the architecture along the water. There were so many different homes to look at. Stopped to chat with a gentleman who had spent summers on the island with his grandparents- he had great memories to share. Watched the ferry come and go. Stayed until sunset along the Bayfront. Missed browsing through the stores on Marine Ave because, by then, they were all closed. Grabbed refreshment at Starbucks and then window shopped. Will have to return to see more of the area.",Travel-lady03

Upon arrival though, it looked to be just a bit of a tourist trap...until I warmed up to it.We spent a little while walking around the amusement rides, and bought some souvenirs at the little shops around. We had to get a classic frozen banana from Balboa Island, way good! The churros were also a big hit with my wife!!On the other side of the ""island"" (it's just a peninsula!) is a large, beautiful park with lots of grass and beautiful palm trees. There's also a great pier, where we took lots of great pictures.",TheSaent

The pier is nice, and there's a number of places you can get ice cream. And palms, a lot of palms.If you think you can be into it, it makes a good weekend afternoon stroll.",A_Ciri
50,Nice place to spend a few hours,"You can browse the shops on Marine Avenue, walk around the perimeter of the island on the walkway, enjoy the sights of the harbor, have dinner (none of the restaurants are outstanding but Amelia's is a decent choice--relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff), take the ferry across to the peninsula to see the beach and watch the sun set, come back and hang out with the locals at the Village Inn (not the chain pancake house, it's a local bar). The scale of the place is very small and it's somewhat densely packed, meaning small streets and houses on small lots, but that's what makes it quaint and pleasant for walking. Parking is almost impossible on weekends so you'd do better to visit on a weekday. There are public restrooms by the ferry launch and on Park Avenue near the Grand Canal, which is a nice thing if you're going to be walking around a long time.",JFawl

The map they gave me noted the 100 year old homes on the island. Off I went in search of those homes and on a delightful walk around the island. Many homes were decorated for Halloween. There was a sand sculpture artist working and folks strolling about. The weather was picture perfect. Love the way so many homeowners have created enchanting gardens with sculptures and cozy places for reading or sipping wine outside. Visited the shops for some fun momentos and munched on some tasty snacks from a few different places during the day. This is my third trip to Balboa Island, but it won't be my last.",Year_of_Tiger

The homes are so beautiful and it was fun to walk by and imagine who lives in each one.During Christmas time, the owners go all out in decorating their homes and porches. It was great!",Renee S
10,Man Card Violation,"this place is a man card violation. All this place has is lame, stupid boutiques, and junk gift shops for tourists. There's no parking, it's crowded. Many people are snobby. The Starbucks here is even sub par. The only redeeming factor of this city is gone now, there used to be excellent cinnamon rolls, but they've changed ownership so now that's gone. Also there is a bridge to enter the Island on one side, but no bridge from the island to the peninsula. This means you have to take the ferry. Which is a pain. This island needs another bridge to the Peninsula, so I can access the beach quicker, until then it's just in the way, offering nothing but lame businesses. I think Elton John is the mayor here too.",Baldono
50,It's all there !!!,It's the greatest small island on the planet. You can eat at Wilma's (the local diner that's amazing) ; Buy some yummy Fro-Yo on Main Street: Find a Summer program or Boarding School at Arlen Global Advisors; or buy some Amazing art at Debra Huse Gallery,AlohaScubaguy
50,Great Place,Went across on the ferry and had a good walk around. Lots of little shops and restaurants to visit and lovely houses to look at. Well worth a visit.,Matthew Pink
40,Small town feel in beautiful location,"We've been many times. The best time to visit is Christmas, as the competition for best decorated has led to outstanding decorations. Taking the Ferry from the Peninsula and walking is best, as bikes, skateboards, etc, aren't allowed on the main walkway. & there's no better place to get a Balboa Bar for dessert than on the island.",cleanfunseeker
50,Best location for a memorable stroll in Newport Beach,"There are several islands in Newport Beach but only one has a public sidewalk all the way around it. The ""Big Island"" is a tad short of two miles, and the ""Little Island"" is about a mile. Walk them both and you will have earned the right to buy a world famous frozen banana, or ""Balboa Bar,"" on main street. The best part of the walk is looking at the houses and pondering why people pay millions of dollars to live on 30x90 foot, sand filled lots, subject to earthquakes and rising sea levels, and very limited parking.",Mike

40,Walk in the Fog,"We took a walk and took a lot of pictures by the liittle boats and talked to locals. There is a little coffee shop where you can get a cup of coffee and have long walk around the island. There are however many others all around, not so much the quietest place.",GNZ_M
50,"Spend the day, park your car and WALK!","My wife and I have been visiting Balboa Island together for about 20 years. We now try to make the pilgrimage from Las Vegas at least 3 times a year, with our daughters (5yrs and 2 yrs).When arriving onto the Island, your best best is to make a right off of Marine Ave and find a spot to park in front of one of the beach houses on the first few streets. Parking is free, but on Marine Ave there is a time limit. The streets are mostly ""one way"" on the island.Start your morning at Wilma's Patio. Try one of their bloody Maries. If you're visiting in the fall months, the pumpkin pancakes are a must. I'm not big on pancakes but theirs arereally good.Kitty-corner to Wilma's Patio is the NBFD Station. On most days you can take a peak into the vehicle bay and browse the many framed pictures on the wall. It's a museum initself. My daughters love to sit in the fire engine for a quick photo opp. They also have a restored fire truck from the 1930s(?).Spend the next hour or two browsing the shops on Marine Avenue. Most are privately owned and managed, which has a nice sense of community and a laid-back feel. Yes, most shops are a little pricey, but we always find a few bargains when we go. (mostly clothes for my wife. go figure)Lunch is usually done on the run, though you can easily find plenty of places on Marine Ave to sit down and take a break from the shops. My favorite place for a sit-down lunch is the Park Avenue Cafe, which is down the street from the Balboa Island Ferry. About a 10-minute walk from Marine Avenue.A stroll around the bigger island takes about 45 minutes. The homes are spectacular and many of the home owners proudly display their living areas via large fold-away windows, allowing passersby to take a peak inside, from the walking path. Most of the island residents are friendly enough, offering a greeting and a smile as you stroll by.Most weekends offer ""Open House"" events for realestate sales. It's fun to peak inside of the homes and compare. Some of the homes have been restored to their original 1920s condition, while others are ultra-modern and truly amazing to walk through.Take the Balboa Island Ferry and head to the peninsula for a walk through the Balboa Fun Zone. You can head to the Balboa Pier and have a shake at the original Ruby's Diner. Best milkshakes on the planet, in my opinion.Take the ferry back to the island and walk toward Marine Avenue to get your name in for dinner. Our favorites are Wilma's Patio (Great clam chowder), Amelia's (great pasta), and Ciao (Italian fare).Finish off the day with another stroll around Marine Ave. Get a ""World Famous"" Balboa Bar from either of the walk-up icecream shops, then stroll around a bit more. The Island feels very different at night. The beach houses seem to transform and look fantastic.Last advice: COMFORTABLE SHOES!!!!",Cube44

50,A very fun destination for all,Balboa Island is basically a shopping oasis close to Newport Beach. We spent an afternoon there walking along looking at all the shops and enjoying wonderful food and desserts. Parking was very difficult but eventually we found a place. It was extremely crowded but I can see why since it was so popular. My family had a great time and it is a must see when we return to the Newport Beach area.,stepford wife
50,"Charming spot, worth a visit","Balboa Island is full of eclectic shops, cafes and restaurants and well worth a stop.

40,A Must See At Newport Beach,"If you are in the Newport Beach area - Costa Mesa CA - You have to visit Balboa Island - The main street area has your trendy 'more expensive' shops but if you hop on the 'Balboa Ferry' it will take you across to the Balboa Fun Zone whether you are walking, riding a bike or in a car. There are amusement rides for the kids, arcades, souvenir shops and lots of places to grab a bite to eat or rent a bike for the hour or the day to get around or even a segway. It's a fun area and a must see. Prices are much friendlier in this area. You can walk along the beach, have a swim or walk out on the pier and even go to Ruby's Diner at the end of the pier.",Shirley L

40,Fun to walk around the island,"Balboa Island is a nice place to go for a walk if you're in the area - it's a cute little beach town with tiny little homes from the 1920s mixed with brand-new homes,some of which are gigantic. Parking is crazy so it's easier to park on the peninsula and take the ferry over or park at Fashion Island and walk across the bridge - you might get lucky and find a space to park on the island but not during any of the busy times. Most of the locals don't every try and just ride a bike around town.There are a lot of shops and restaurants along the main street after you enter the island from PCH and food choices range from a multicourse meal to a Balboa Bar or Frozen banana, popular treats in this area. The dress code is strictly 'beach wear' - shorts, casual shirts, sandals - or maybe a sweatshirt in the cooler evenings. Overall it's a fun place to walk around, especially during the Christmas or other holiday seasons when many of the houses and boats are decorated.",Lynda A
40,Cute Place to Spend Two Hours,"Good place to spend a couple of hours in LA. My husband and I had the day to waste before a late night flight. We had read in reviews in a travel book that most stores were very well priced. However, we found about half of the stores to be reasonable priced and the other half to be very overpriced. There was a good selection of restaurants and easy street parking. There were lots of cute houses on the side streets. We had Balboa Bars at one of the shops and that was a nice treat. We also had a very good lunch at Ciao Italian.",Kayla

30,A Pretty Island enclave,Balboa island is a typical beach and port enclave located in Newport Beach with all the usual beachside homes and shops. The easiest way to get there is to travel toward the ocean on Jamboree Road and just go across PCH to Balboa Island. Parking there is worse than tough so I'd recommend that you go into the shopping centers on Jamboree and park. Then you can walk across the small bridge to Balboa. First you'll see many clothing and souvenir shops. There are also a bevy of some very good restaurants (mostly seafood) of various types. You can find anything from coffee shops and snacks to sandwiches and gourmet dinners. At the end of that main street you can make left and look out on the canal leading to the ocean or make a right and walk along the myriad homes lining the shore. It is a beautiful and scenic walk with the smell of the ocean adding to the ambience. There are some small marinas along the way which adds to the nautical and beachy feel. You can view Catalina from anywhere along that shore and the sunsets are magnificent. You can swim in the ocean for the day or fish off the pier or just enjoy a relaxing day and top it off with a tasty dinner. There is no cost to enter Balboa but the shops can be pricey.,Ann B

50,A great place to spend a couple of hours,"Most people confuse the Newport Peninsula (the place where the Ferris Wheel is) with Balboa Island. It doesn't help that the signs when you get off the Ferry say ""Welcome to Balboa Island"" on both the Peninsula and the Island sides. So, take a moment to ask a local because when you are in the car looking at all of the beautiful sites, you don't even notice that you are going over a bridge onto the Island! The differences are immense. They are both nice to visit and I will be writing a review on the Peninsula when I finish this review.Balbo Island is essentially a collection of quaint boutiques (where some wonderful deals can be found) along Marine Avenue. Dotted here and there between the shops are restaurants, coffee shops, candy shops, ice bream stands where you can get the Chocolate Covered Banana or the Balboa Ice Cream Bar that they are famous for.Take the time to stroll off Marine Avenue and walk through some of the side streets toward the water.

There seemed to be many people happily enjoying white whine on their patios while watching the bay. There's not really a lot to DO though.

40,There is always money in the banana stand.,"I'm a huge fan of the television show 'Arrested Development.' To celebrate the arrival of a new episodes on Netflix, I invited some friends to join me on a trek to Newport Beach and Balboa Island. I made it our mission to find the Bluth Frozen Banana Stand.To get to Balboa Island, we drove to Newport Beach and parked at the municipal lot on Palm Ave. You could park at a meter, but those spots have a 2 hour limit and only take coins. A parknig ticket in Newport Beach costs $58. All day parking at the lot on Palm Ave is $15 on a normal day, $25 on holidays.From there, we walked a few hundred meters to the Balboa Island Ferry gate. Could I have driven right onto the island? Yes. But would it have been nearly as much fun as riding the ferry? No. Could I have brought my car on the ferry? Yes. Would I have found a place to park my car on the island? No. The ferry fare is $1 for adults, $2 for a car. It's a very short ride, but it's ridiculously amusing.The ferry docks on the western end of Balboa Island. To reach the shops and restaurants, you have to walk about 1km along South Bay Front and up Marine Ave. This is pretty much the whole island. Marine Ave is the main drag, where most of the restaurants and shops are. This is where we would find the legendary Bluth banana stand.Is the Bluth Banana Stand real? No (except for the one they built to promote the new series, but that's not what I'm talking about). Is the banana stand based on a real banana stand? Yes. It's based on Sugar n Spice (310 Marine Ave.). They sell frozen bananas and Balboa bars, which are vanilla ice cream bars dipped in chocolate and your choice of toppings. Did I buy any of these from Sugar n Spice? No. Instead, I went to Dad's Donuts a few doors down (318 Marine Ave.) and bought a Balboa bar (topped with rainbow sprinkles and butter brickle bits) there. It was good, but ultimately, there is little reason to differentiate between the bars as they are all similar in quality. Next time, I'll go to Sugar n Spice to try their Balboa bar.You must have a Balboa bar if you're visiting Balboa Island. This is imperative.After gorging ourselves on ice cream, we went to The Village Inn for lunch. It was Memorial Day, and they had a bottomless mimosa special -- all you can drink for 2 hours, $9. I had the chicken pesto sandwich, and it was delicious. It was served with thick wedge fries. The only problem was the service was slow and the wait staff, though nice folks, appeared to be inexperienced.After lunch, we walked back along South Bay Front and boarded the ferry back to (the rest of) Newport Beach. It was fun overall. Balboa Island can be throughly explored in about 3 hours (including a slow lunch). I will definitely be returning soon.",GumdropGirl
50,Fun for the whole family,"I visited here as part of a private party but even so, I could tell it would be a great sport for an evening out with the family or a romantic date.The island (which has a great variety of adorable beach houses) includes a number of great attractions: ferris wheel, mechanical shark, nautical museum (which was surprisingly interesting), and bay tours as well as others. The cruise on the bay was fantastic - with great scenery and bits of trivia about the ridiculously expensive (and celebrity owned) houses on the water.All in all it's a great destination.",Wildiris117
50,a pleasant walk,"Balboa Island is a man-made island in the middle of Newport Beach Harbor that is accessed by a small bridge from the mainland or the ferry from the peninsula. There is a single main st about 5 blocks long (including a couple of ""original banana stands"" for you Arrested Development fans). The rest of the island is surrounded by concrete boardwalk with private piers and public beach areas inbetween. It is a great place for an easy stroll. Adjoining the boardwalk on the land side are highly upgraded ""beach"" cottages. While walking around, you are literally feet away from the residents livingrooms and kitchens.Park near the main street, shop or window shop, then walk around either the entire island or just cut across a side for a shorter walk. If you want a different view, rent a kayak or an electric boat at the fun zone and see it all from the water.",ljsamson
50,Best place to stroll in Newport Beach,"There are several islands in Newport Beach but only one has a public sidewalk all the way around it. The ""Big Island"" is a tad short of two miles, and the ""Little Island"" is about a mile. Walk them both and you will have earned the right to buy a world famous frozen banana or ""Balboa Bar"" on main street. The best part of the walk is looking at the houses and pondering why people pay millions of dollars to live on 30x90 foot, sand filled lots, subject to earthquakes and rising sea levels, and very limited parking.",Mike
50,A full day packed on a tiny island,"There is so much to do on Balboa Island. No empty store fronts here. Lots of little boutiques with cute clothes and household things. Big price range too, $15 store to the outrageous! Every scope of dining too. The local Market has a great $1 cup of coffee. Wilma's Patio is a casual favorite. Make sure to leave room for the famous Balboa frozen banana! Walk the perimeter of the island, catch a ride on the ferry (check out the Balboa Fun Zone), and enjoy snooping at the charming (million dollar) bungalows!",norcalhummingbirds
50,Flash back to the simpler times.,"This charming little Island offers vistors and residents alike the feeling of times that were simpler and maybe even kinder.

Beaches, boating and paddle boarding, people watching and beautiful and charming homes, great place to spend a day, a week or even your lifetime.",shirley t
50,Great day excursion,"Balboa island is very charming island. Very easy to get to with a five minute ferry ride that runs constantly. The shopping is quaint and despite the property values there the shopping is moderately priced. Lots of good restaurants to go to on the main strip. Riding bike is not recommended, everything is very close together and bikes don't fit well on the sidewalks. Also recommend wearing walking shoes or good sandals as the main shopping and restaurants is about 1/2 mile from the ferry. Overall balboa island is worth the time if in the Newport beach area. We loved it so much we went back a second time during our trip for lunch.",Megan C
30,Balboa Island is Unique and Crowded,Balboa Island is a fun little area of town that you can get to via the ferry or by roads. There are a lot of one way streets and on the weekends it's pretty crowded. That being said its a fun little place to hang out and visit the shops/ restaurants.,Casey M
40,Take ferry or drive over the bridge!,Somehow we missed the fact that you don't have to take just the ferry to get to this island! There is a bridge you can drive over and drive around! Parking was full everywhere and streets are very busy with people. It was a great place to watch people and families having fun. Shopping looked like fun too. If we had had the time to walk around it would have been worth the time!,Beehappee
50,Beautiful Balboa,"This is such a pretty place to visit. The streets are so clean, the beach so gorgeous. Really quant. You may need lots of quarters for the parking machines if you intend to pay by cash, as once you are there you will want to stay a while. It's lovely just strolling around. Take a look in the shops, we spent loads of time and $! You could have a characture done. My husband did, said he'd always wanted one, so he went for it! Some of the homes along by the beach and out towards the open sea are to die for!",Trumpster175
50,Favorite beach in the newport area,We have spent many days here. It is a cute little island. There are tons of sea shells and the waves get big enough for my 9 an 7 year old to ride in. There are lots of birds so make sure your food is well contained because they will go after it. There is a nice lard walk that had some pretty good for options. There are bathrooms with outdoor showers for getting all the sand off of yourself. Fun days!,vacanut_8
50,"Great Place For a Day, a Week or a Month","Balboa Island is one of the gems of Newport Beach. For the day visitor it has quaint shops, restaurants and the Balboa Ferry to take you to the Balboa Peninsula.For the vacationer it is a throw back to small town America. It is a place where the kids can ride their bikes all over the island and you never have to worry about them. It is close to all the attractions and shopping that Orange County is famous for, but is a quiet cocoon to wrap yourself in at night.Year round residents are used to short term visitors and treat strangers like old friends.",scottca075

50,BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GEM,"We had one day left in california and nothing to do, someone at our hotel had recommended we go to balboa island. We packed up our food and drove 30 minutes from our hotel to this little gem. SOOOO GLAD WE CAME. Beautiful just beautiful, the atmosphere here is soooo different than LA and Anaheim, its so relaxing and you no noise, you can hear birds chirping everywhere. Just beautiful. We paid $2 for the car, $1 each adult and 0.50 for kids 5+ to take the 2 min ferry ride across, beautiful. Once on the island, we found 2 hour free street parking and walked by the beach and gawked at the million dollar beach front homes, beautiful just beautiful, bring the family, and have a picnic,",Lisa K
50,"Such a fun, quaint, little secret","Beautiful beach and nice shops. I am a shopper and a sun worshipper, Balboa Island offers the best of both. Unusual shops with unique items that you will not see everyone at home wearing the same things you have found on Balboa Island",Jo S

50,What a find!,"Leaving Anaheim for a day to site see, we decided upon Newport Beach Ca. We arrived with no expectations and no idea where to go. We made a turn off the main road and landed ourselves at Inspiration Point-Costa Del Mar beach area of Newport. Amazing views. A beautiful walkway led us to the beach below where we saw beautiful rock formations, a warm sea and beautiful sand, edged my our mansion when we win the lottery! From there, we drove along the coastal highway, going to no where in particular and came upon Balboa Island! What a treasure! Adorable bistros, shops and more. Shops that carry the different and quaint. Loved it.",djdebbc

40,Worth a visit,"We took the ferry across to the island and had bikes, so it was easy to get around. If walking, i would say you wouldn't be able to explore and be so nosey looking at all the lovely properties! It is quite a compact island, being mostly residential.

50,Good for half a day,"Island is mostly homes except for the small main street. Take your bike as it would be quite a walk from ferry to the main street. We walked our bikes on main street, looked in the shops, and had a sandwich made at the local supermarket. Was yummy good. There are some outdoor restaurants that looked very good. We were on the island about 3 to 4 hours. It was very nice to see.",travelinmen

50,"Quaint, Quirky, Interesting","We got lost on the way to our hotel and ended up on Balboa Island. So happy we did too, because we got to spend the day exploring. It is beautiful, with a good sized, bustling downtown area chock full of interesting shops, good places to eat, and a lot of outdoor seating. There seemed to be fresh flowers growing everywhere. It looked like it was ready for a festival. You have to drive over a short bridge to access the island, or take the ferry from the Newport Beach Peninsula. The streets are narrow and the houses are very close together. Not a surprise on such a small island. We left with a strong desire to stay on the island next time we visit CA.",Sherri L

The kids especially enjoyed playing in the water on the beach, watching the dolphins, and then getting candy at the candy store near the boardwalk by the ferris wheel.We took the ferry over then took the long way back out of the island.We were able to park easily on a Sunday morning/ afternoon.",DavidHitchcock33
50,A nice place to visit and you will kill to live there,"For the visitor, BI is mostly about Marine Avenue, where the shops are. The bridge is accessible from the corner of Bayside Dr. and Jamboree Road, just South of PCH. There is other access by the Balboa Ferry, and that drops you at the other end of the island so you get a lovely walk along the bayfront to Marine Avenue. If you arrive that way, it does not matter which way you go, the bayfront circles the island and you will end up at Marine Ave. The shops are an eclectic mix, with only a Starbucks chain store. Everything else is mom and pop owned, and most have been family run for over 50 years. There is a great Chinese restaurant on Marine and Balboa Avenues, been there for over 50 years, and no they don't serve duck that they catch in the bay. (or cats either-urban legends) For shopping, there are lots of cut price offerings and the winter months are off season for the best bargains. This is really where to go for a great experience instead of Fashion Island, where you pay $$$$. Other than the shopping, the island is ringed with bay beaches. You are inside the harbor, so don't expect any waves, but for small kids, this is the great place to go, play in the sand without any danger of surfboards, waves or any of the problems from an ocean beach. Float on an inner tube or pool raft if you want. One of the best beaches is located North Bayfront, at Collins Ave. The best viewing beaches are on South Bayfront as they face the main channel with the greatest amount of boat traffic. Other attractions include the fire station (Marine and Park), the Post Office (it says Balboa Island PO above it but the USPS denominates it as Newport Beach!) and the Auto Ferry (S. Bayfront and Agate). Most of the streets are named after gemstones. BTW- there are actually 3 islands that make up ""Balboa Island"" and you can walk the bayfront on 2 of them. Oh, yes, parking, well, there is limited space, the residents mostly park on the street, and if you need to park right in front of the store you want to visit, you will be disappointed. Weekends after 10, holidays like July 4, Labor Day, can be impossible. Be flexible, go early, park a few streets away from Marine, and take a walk on the bayfront, breathe the sea air and relax. After all, that is what life there is all about.",LeBeauxVoyager
40,Cute shops,"I was visiting Newport Beach and decided to make a side trip over to the island. I paid for parking at a lot nearby and walked to the little car/ pedestrian ferry. For a dollar each way, the ferry was a great way to get there. I enjoyed walking along the shoreline, looking at all the quaint homes on the island as I made my way to the main shopping area of the island. It was about a 10 minute walk or less. Very quaint stores. I found deals on cute fashions for myself and my daughter. One store had very cute items for $15 for anything in the store! I saw many tempting restaurants but most were not open for lunch. Wish I had arranged to spend more time here.",aimbame79
50,Quaint,"I love Balboa Island, the shops are cool, and we always find something cool to buy there. It isn't too expensive considering the price of real estate in the hood and the people are friendly (unlike a lotta places in so-cal). It is nice to take a walk down the streets as you will find some architectural gems in the area and then sit at the water's edge and watch the yachts go by. very nice piece of California history is this island.",christopherdb
50,You should not miss it if you visit Orange County,"The pretty houses, the boat, the waterfront and just the peacefulness would make you really happy.

It is a fun little experience for you and friends or as a family. The Newport Island is so very quaint. Enjoy!",EscapehomeArtist

50,Great to Take Out-of-Towners,"When we lived in the San Fernando Valley, as kids, it was a real treat to rent a house on the Bay for a week during the summer. When we moved to Orange County, this became the place that we took our kids at all times of the year. And, it's a wonderful place to walk around with our guests from out of town. During the winter holidays, the homes along the bay fronts are decorated and, as always, it's great to walk around the water front and see the beautiful homes. The Xmas boat parade is wonderful. Balboa Island feels like a step back in time. It's warm, friendly and inviting.",OuddaHere

50,A little treasure,Balboa Island is a little treasure that can only be reached by ferry or one bridge. It is a fascinating little place to visit full of character and charm. The well maintained water front houses and mini gardens are a pleasure to stroll past and the water views with all manner of boating a dream. We enjoyed a great late breakfast whilst visiting and found some great little shops as well. A very relaxing and enjoyable experience.,Ingrid4711
40,Fun place to walk around,Used to live on the Island in the 70's. It is one of many in the Newport Harbor and the one that is the Island for the tourists. While in the 70's houses were porportunate to the plot of land there are now many oversized buildings too bad. Lots of tourists during the summer whith many of the homes for rent by the week and 9 month renatals duirng the school year. The Island is 2 1/2 miles in circumfrance so good for a morning run and checking out the homes on the bay front. People are used to lots of people visiting so very friendly. The stores on the Island I think need to be updated not very upscale and nothing for those who live on the Island. Just lots of kitch and tourist shops which seem to change often. Hard to survive in retail on the Island.,Byron R
40,DON'T GO ON THE WEEK END....,"You'll be able to enjoy Balboa Island without the crowds and traffic. Remember to take a book to read after you check out the great shops, places to eat and your long walk around and up and down the streets exploring all of the cute beach houses.

We can rent a beach cottage for a week, park our car, and enjoy the amenities of a small town with everything in walking distance. It is a beach destination for all ages. The bay is a water sport paradise with paddle boards, kayaks, and small sailboats for rent. Small children will enjoy the calm beaches of the bay, while the thrill seekers can ride the ferry to the ocean side of the penninsula to enjoy the surf and thrill of the large strand of beach and parkland.Disneyland is 20 minutes from the island.

The Island is full of small condominium type homes the streets are lined with a manner of flowers and plants. The people of Balboa Island take pride in their garden like yards and homes. The walk is such a pleasant one. People do not mind if you stop and have your picture taken in front of their house. There are several little stores that dot the island as well. Very quaint and alluring they promise a fantastical escape from the ordinary shoppers destination. There are sandwich shops, coffee shops, bike shops, and clothing. You can rent a bike and take a spin around the Island or you can walk it. Its so relaxing you don't even realize you are exercising. I recommend you take a respite from your usual jaunt and take a stroll on Balboa Island. You won't regret it.",Sherry P

50,Fantastic hidden jem of a place,"From the moment you cross the bridge onto the first Balboa Island you'll get a great laid back feeling that defines both Islands. Neat little shops & restaurants adorn the 1st block or so of the main island.The real feature of the islands, at least in my opinon, is the world-class walking paths they have that run around the perimeter of each Island. Walking around the Islands is a supremely relaxing / enjoyable experience. The scenery is fantastic, the people you meet are great, and looking at (and inside) all of the beach houses is cool as well. Most property owners on the Islands leave their window shades open and lights on 24-7 so you really can soak in the great diversity this mini beach community has to offer.As a bonus, you should take the ferry (either as a walk-on or drive-on customer) over the peninsula & soak up it's offerings as well.Oh, almost forgot.... you must grab a ""Balboa Bar"" at one of the donut/ice cream shops.Balboa is a great great place, simple one of the best little beach town areas I've ever been around.",Rich807

The Balboa Ferry will take you to the Balboa Peninsula, which the locals simply referr to as ""the Peninsula"".

50,Balboa Island Rental,The whole family goes to the Island every year. This year we had 4 houses.....All the kids love it and now it is tradition as we all meet there from different parts of the US. More traffic to get there but the island really doesn't change....Just bigger houses,ES1012
50,Beautiful weather? Take a walk aroung Balboa Island.,Unique area with homes of all types decorated whimsically. Sidewalks along the inlet and canals. Several tourist-type boats looked like fun - maybe next time. Shops great for browsing and restaurants with good food. Great way to spend a few hours on a weekend.,prettywoman65
50,Little Paradise.,"To live there you'd have to be pretty well off, but visiting there is delightful. Just walking around the island is a treat, but it has a little strip (Marine Ave) of shops and eateries and some shopping/eating right near the ferry. It's unique, and is the best Califormia has to offer.",not2old4me
30,Cute beach town,"Balboa Island was a very charming little beach town. We had a nice time walking along the coast and looking at the beautiful beach houses. While it was nice to walk around, I would recommend going early in the day because most of the shops were closed when we were there around 7pm. Restaurants were open, but it seemed like there wasn't that much of a variety. There were more options on the Newport side. It was cute to stroll around and have a drink, but not necessarily some place that you need to go more than once.It's very walkable, as it's not that large, so I would highly recommend taking the ferry and doing it on foot. It looked like parking could be a hassle.",vix814
30,Surprising and charming,I tried to imagine why people would want to live or visit this tiny island. Jam packed and hectic with some fun but pricey shops. The overall character is charming though. Nice try.,travelingwurd

If you park along the side streets, parking is free. We parked the car, grabbed our cameras and were off to explore. The island has a nice walkway circling the entire island. You'd think that the bay would offer the best photos, but that's not the case. Each and every island home was unique and exquisite. The gardens, the architecture, is a must see if you're staying anywhere near.Yes the island is picturesque, but the islanders were all so nice and welcoming. Several stopped and offered to take photos of us. WOW, we thought that was so nice. Especially since we were tromping past their beautiful homes.If you're up for nice, approximately two hour walk Balboa Island is a must.",AZcartrip
40,Slow and Easy,We had never been to Balboa Island and decided to try it with our son and his family. First was a short cruise around the island with the captain telling us about all the rich and famous and their homes. The short ferry ride over from the Newport peninsula was $1 for adults but lots of fun for children. We walked and had a great time window shopping after lunch. Next time I will definitely have the signature item of the frozen banana.,johnlaquinta
40,A Delightful Little Town,"This is a pretty and delightful little island which can be explored in less than half a day. The main street, which you can't miss since you drive onto it while entering the island, is the big highlight and can be walked on roundtrip and in its entirety in 30 minutes if you don't stop in the shops. The real charm of it, though, is to stop by shops that interest you despite few chances that you'll actually buy something since everything is so well overpriced.We went on Sunday morning and the beach was rather unclean. We also didn't notice several dozen small crabs in the sand at first, but thankfully did before taking off our shoes! (See picture attached to this review.)The rest of the island is standard fodder -- houses, houses, and more...well...houses. The Balboa Island Ferry is a big enough highlight to where it'll take you about an hour to hop on board for a 10-minute ride, and we didn't bother with that although we would love to on a day when it's less packed -- looked promising.Also, if you enjoy boating, I'm sure you'll enjoy Balboa Island, although the bigger Balboa Peninsula nearby appears to be the hub for that.All in all, a cute little town that can be explored in a couple hours or half a day at the most, depending on what you want to do here.",inavigator
40,Fun Day Trip,Fun place to go to walk around for a day. Many little shops and restaurants along the main street. Parking is hard to find if you plan on parking and taking the ferry so pay the extra to take your car and park on the island. Much easier!,BWK59

50,Ferry Ride and Frozen Bananas,"Quaint Balboa Island is worth the side trip from the Pacific Coast Highway. Stop on the main street to try a frozen banana. They take a frozen banana, dip it in chocolate and then roll it in your choice of toppings from candies to nuts. It's a tradition on the island that you must sample. Then follow the signs to the auto ferry. It's only a couple of dollars to ride across Newport Bay to the Peninsula. Turn right on the main road and you'll re-connect with the Pacific Coast Highway. Stop at the Crab Cooker for a delicious seafood meal. It will be on your right as you travel north. My grandparents lived on the island from the 1950s through the 1990s. Not much has changed over the years. Enjoy!",Bob836

There is an old fashion candy store with colorful barrels of salt water taffy, 2 places offering the ""Original Balboa Bar"" and ""Original Frozen Banana"" almost next to each other. We also walked the whole perimeter of the island, following South and North Bayside St and checked out the very expensive beach property. There are benches along the way to sit and people or boat watch. You can also catch the Balboa Ferry for $1.25 pp for the very short ride to the peninsula for the Fun Zone, beach and more restaurants. It was altogether a fun way to spend a day for very little money (if you don't buy too much).",grmmybtty

We then walked to the ferry and took it over to the Balboa Peninsula area of Newport Beach. It cost $1. per person. Then we went to a cute little bike shop called Balboa Bikes and rented some nice cruiser bikes for $10.00 per person for the whole day. The people there are very friendly and have nice bikes. Their address is 601 E. Balboa Blvd. We headed north along the beach and ended up in Huntington Beach.

Liked walking around the perimeter walkway, driving the car on the small ferry over to Balboa and for sure renting a dingy boat. We also used the opportunity to act like a local and go shopping and nature park walking around Newport and the other surrounding areas. Crystal Cove state park is awesome and worth a drive or bike ride over to basically every morning. We saw the same locals (most looked like retirees) that must live close by and walk down to the state park every morning for their morning stroll.

Also, Willma's Patio has a large menu with great breakfasts all day and everythig else. Inxpensive, friendly, attentive, simple but good food.

50,LOVED every minute of it....,"Can't say enough good things about this fun little place! So clean and charming! We had a great time walking around admiring all the houses! Oh, and you have to walk along the main strip where you can browse all the little shops and enjoy one of those wonderful frozen bananas!!",1kidandpoodle
50,It's always a pleasure to visit Balboa Island!,I love the shopping there! The stores are so reasonable and you HAVE TO stop at Dad's for a Balboa Bar or a Frozen Banana!!! There are lots of dog walkers around and most of the owners are very courteous and friendly and will allow you to pet their animals so our two year old was in heaven! We love driving around and looking at the homes and I could literally stay there all day shopping! Did I mention I love shopping there????,Mrstywiltbank
50,A beautiful place to spend an afternoon,"Balboa Island is a quaint, peaceful area with small boutique shops, fine restaurants, and lovely homes to spectate. In the vicinity are Fashion Island, Newport Beach, and John Wayne Airport, to name just a few peripheral attractions. There's a ferry that transports people and cars form the island to the mainland, and back. The ride is only about 8 minutes long, but the area is so picturesque that you'll want to take the ferry several times. I believe a car costs around $1.50, and one person taking the ferry costs .50 cents. Cheap. You can walk along the boardwalk and see beautiful homes, and a mini Statue of Liberty. You can take a harbor dinner cruise, or rent your own watercraft and take your own tour of the area. There's also a fun zone at the mainland ferry stop. Have a frozen banana at one of the two competing shops, buy some candy, or have a gourmet meal at one of the upscale eateries on the main street. Spend some time and money here and you'll really enjoy it!",herrlava
50,Adorable island!,"My husband and I spent a few hours here while vacationing in Newport Beach, and the island is so adorable. We walked along the boardwalk and saw all the cute beach houses, then walked along the main drag and had a frozen banana and got some candy from Balboa Candy Shop, which was so cute! Such a nice, relaxing way to spend the afternoon. Just drive to the ferry on the Balboa Peninsula, pay $1/person (each way) for a super quick ferry ride to the island. (Parking on the island can be hard to come by.)",TravelingKatie11
50,"Must see, what a vacation should be","This is a spot that everyone should visit for a vacation. The restaurants are great, people are friendly and the shops are perfect. This is a must and we plan on going back as soon as possible",Green1234567890
40,"Ferry to a Boat ride from Fun Zone, Balboa Island thru Newport Beach Bay area.","Ride the Three Car Ferry across to Balboa Island Fun Zone with many attractions for the younger people and children to go for a Boat ride for us older people like Seniors through Newport Beach Bay area sight seeing the beautiful homes and boats and what the ocean has in store for us. Saw the seals sunning themselves on a buoy. Then back on the Ferry to Balboa Island to the variety of store looking and maybe shopping but had to have the Almond Chocolate covered frozen Banana as our treat for the day...then back to Laguna Beach, California where we were staying...something different!",Duchesselle
50,Balboa Island has something for everyone,"We spent 4 days on Balboa Island and were lucky enough to stay with family in their vacation home. The beach is a very short (5 minute) ferry ride to Balboa and you can walk on to the ferry for $1. The main street of Balboa Island has great restaurants, high end shopping, and of course the famous Balboa Bar ice cream bars. The frozen bananas are tasty also! Bike riding, body surfing, shopping, dining, walking around looking at all the adorable beach homes, and just enjoying the relaxed atmosphere made for a great weekend.",Whiteners
50,Www.ilovebalboa.com,Great time for families and friends. Best italian restaurant is Sabatinos. Love it!,jon4mercedes
40,Great Frozen Bananas,"The main road onto the Island is ""Marine Ave"". It's were all the shops and dining is located. Weekends are a pain to find parking. Weekdays are no problem. You have to try the frozen bananas. They are sooo good! Go to Sugar and Spice or Dads. Either one, u can't go wrong. I recommend taking a 15min. walk to ferry along the outside of island. The homes are spectacular and people very friendly.",WinnDixie62
40,Fun place to scope out,"My wife and I got ice cream at a quaint little shop near the entrance to the island. There is a nice walking path around the island, and it's fun to look at all the houses and their respective boats as you stroll along. If you want to enjoy a quiet, coastal neighborhood then Balboa Island will be very enjoyable.",rdiddy1234
30,Balboa Island Shopping.,A nice relaxing area for unique shopping and restaurants. The shopping area is about 2-3 blocks long with a view of the marina at one end. It was a good place to relax and enjoy the weather for a afternoon. It is a short $20. limo ride from Orange County Airport/Irvine hotel area.,Richard J
10,Newport Boat Show,"Stay away from the Newport Boat Show--it is a complete ripoff. I have never so much regretted spending 12 lousy bucks! While I did get some good information on new carpeting for my own boat (could have gotten that for free), most of the yachts I wanted to see were impossible to visit; ""We have an opening at 3:30."" (This was at 12:30).",LBGrandBanks
40,Hire a bike to visit Balboa Island - the only way to travel,"We collected our bikes from the shop on the corner near the pier. You can't miss it. They cost us about $18 each for a few hours. We rode them along the path behind the beach in the direction of Balboa Island. Totally awesome, wide beach and peaceful path. It was like cycling through a picture postcard. Then on to the ferry with our bikes, costing next to nothing. We felt like we were 'travelling', reminding us of the carefree times in our youth visiting India and feeling free. Back on the bikes around Balboa Island. We didn't think there was a great deal to see, so it took us only about an hour including a snack. But some of the areas there are surprising - like venice! Such lovely homes. Then back on the bikes on the ferry again. All in all about 3 hours.",Jo I
50,Gorgeous!,"Lovely place, hope to visit again.It was great for people watching and for admiring fabulous homes!Plenty of variety for food and souvenirs and the beach was beautiful.",k44durham
50,Great During Christmas for a Day,"This place is great for the holidays if you go right before Christmas you can catch the boat show, the locals decorate their boats elaborately with lights, dancers music, giant snowmen.The boat show is free and last for about 1-2 hours. After that take the ferry (1-2 per person can't remember exactly) grab a cup of coffee and walk around balboa island to look at the elaborately decorated houses and enjoy the crowd.Good for an evening, but if you are not traveling as a family balboa may be boring as a week long stay sort of thing.there are alot better beaches down pch, some private hidden, huntington beach pier is not bad if you would like to enjoy some beach volleyball and row of stores.",hpitrvlr
50,Balboa Fun Zone,"We went to Balboa Fun Zone in Aug. 2005, and it was great.It was only a 15 min. drive from Disneyland. We parked in the community parking lot $8 and had a picnic dinner on the beach, then after watching my daughter splash around in the ocean waves, we walked the two blocks to Balboa Fun Zone. The town was so cute, there was even a store that rented bicycles and alot of people were on rented bikes.The kiddie rides were nothing to brag about, but for about a dollar a ride it was worth it for the kids especially the younger ones.One of the shopkeepers told my youngest daughter not to touch anything so we found another place to spend our money.We went on a harbour cruise, the sunset cruise, it was less than $30 for the four of us and was excellent! The boat was nothing to brag about, but the driver narrated the cruise and he was wonderful. He pointed out all the famous people living on the harbour and how much the homes and yachts cost. We saw sea lions, jellyfish, and a wonderful sunset that we will never forget!The ferry to the man-made island will only carry two cars at a time, but the wait is short for the next ferry.I will definitely go back to Balboa Island and Newport Beach, I would even like to rent a place there. This was a wonderful way to start our vacation and I would be happy if that was all we went to California for.",keena2000
