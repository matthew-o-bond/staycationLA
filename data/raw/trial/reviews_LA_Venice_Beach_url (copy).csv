40,Fun From A Tourist's Point of View,"You can certainly find some interesting characters here so I could understand the hesitancy of some locals going to this beach continuously but for a tourist I feel like the beach is perfectly fine. The skateboarding ramps near the area are pretty neat and it's fun to see people utilizing them. We found a decent pizza place, hung out by the beach, and were completely unbothered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spoopty
10,smelled like sewer!,"been going to Venice Beach for many years, at times it was unpleasant. Yesterday it was horrible! We walked from Santa Monica pier (it was closed) down to Venice, upon arriving at the beginning of the north walkway it smelled like an open sewer! fecal matter, and urine stains throughout the sidewalk. Homeless people in tents, with all their junk half a block long. If I were a local taxpayer (home or business owner)I would be so angry with the local politicians letting this happen. what a shame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmL8676KH
10,Stay away!,"Venice Beach is touted as a great tourist destination. It is not. Rather it is full of druggies spaced out, homeless and beggars. Beach itself was disappointing. Cannot take pictures of some stuff as people ask for money. One of my friends almost mugged in public restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparky59canberra
10,Homeless Camp,Don’t worry about getting the ‘rona here - it’s like the 10th scariest things about this place. Angry vagrants and drug addicted beggars live at the beach. They’re occasionally violent but always scary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuniorBruin
30,Interesting walk and place to see,"Venice Beach is well known and offers plenty of beach with interesting shops. I visited during the middle of the day on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded. It can get busy quick not just the shops, but also just the general walking crowd. There are plenty of places to walk around, as well as activities on the beach, not to mention was eclectic stores to pop in and out of. It's worth a visit to say that you have walked Venice Beach. I'd plan to spend about a half day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bx2L
30,Interesting walk,Interesting walk along the promenade seeing the eclectic shops and residents. A LOT of homeless people though and smells bad but personally didn’t feel unsafe. Not quite what you would expect though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
10,Unsafe for foreigners,"Aside from homeless and smell, did not feel safe walking with my young family. The locals are rude and do not like foreigners. We were followed, called names yelled to go back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravRunner2016
50,Worth a Look,"Worth the walk. Bars, entertainment as well as locals make this for a very diverse and interesting stroll down by the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/784granth
40,Delightful visit!,"Enjoyed a Sunday afternoon strolling the boardwalk, pier, and nearby eateries. Finding parking can be difficult and expensive, but still nice for beach therapy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saxy15
20,Wow what a difference a season makes,"We have visited before when the beach was packed and all of the stores were opened. We came here during the winter season and most shops are closed and the beach is populated by mostly homeless people. Many are aggressive and one even threatened my son.As positives, there is a skate park, muscle beach which was closed, basketball courts and a decent boardwalk which is mostly closed. Come during the warmer months or pick another beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norjeff2
30,Brilliant beach but lots of homeless people,This is about a 25 min beach walk from Santa Monica pier. It’s a beautiful beach with small pier and plenty of beach shops. We hired bikes for an hour which cost $10 which was good fun. However the number of homeless people spoilt it as it didn’t feel safe. Recommended but be careful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnclarkson
30,Not a safe place,"Well it’s loads of homeless people, people who are high and somehow doesn’t give you the impression of a safe place. Yes it’s ok during the day and you get loads of people around but wouldn’t go by myself at night..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martab_daphne
20,"Nice Beach, little else","The beach itself is pretty nice. Only downside for the beach itself is that it is having to walk through 50 yards of soft sand to get to the water! There was also a lot of homeless on the beach and crazies. Saw a guy in his red dress literally screaming at everyone that rode by on a bike. Walking the boardwalk got approached 10 times by someone wanting to ""give away"" their CD. Most the shops were nasty, junkie and just simply not appealing. So simply compared to many other beaches, that I have seen, around the country overall this one just isnt anything special",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speedracer61
40,Love the vibe!,"Venice Beach is fun, quirky and creative. We enjoyed the beach which is wide and beautiful. The walk and markets were touristy and fun. We walked around the neighbor hood with the canals, very beautiful houses, a stark contrast to the homelessness. If homeless people bother you then this isn't the place for you. The housing crisis in the US and Cali have created a huge amount of homeless people, there seems to be some invisible infrastructure that supports them here in Venice Beach. The big street a couple of blocks down from our Air B&B was lined with tents every night. People would show up around sunset, set up their tents, get inside and stay inside. I never felt unsafe but I did feel very sad and it made me reflect on the state of our country. The level of income inequality is so crazy. Children go hungry and people who are working full time have to sleep on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizalou1975
40,Relaxing,"Great beach, don t think of going for a swin in march... Very quiet during the day for walking, and biking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G170BUcarold
20,Worth seeing once. Maybe.,"Visited Venice beach on the last day of LA trip. Beautiful beach, peir, long walkway and adjacent bike path, plenty of food and souvenir outlets. Also recreational areas for skate boarding, basketball, gym and beach volleyball. Canals also nearby. Unfortunately the whole place is overrun by a huge homeless population which spoils the otherwise beautiful location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7227FIjg
40,Nice,Such a amazing place to visit beach lovers will enjoy this place must visit this place once just love it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keshashah
30,You have to see it,"Great Beach, Boardwalk was a bit seedy/carnival like. Tons of people walking around forcing CD's on you and the shops didn't seem very appealing to stop and even take a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMAC2828
10,No thanks.,"Between the homeless and the smell of skunk weed everywhere, not at all appealing. Each to their own I suppose, but this was not the beach vibe I was looking for. Newport Beach is much better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisasinpa
50,Venice beach muscle beach,"Worth a walk to or from santa Monica to see the shops etc, muscle beach, skate boarders, ball courts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
40,Full of life,"Loved it! You can walk around, buy different things, eat, and watch people do crazy things. A bit dirty, but other than that it was a good experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/world_travellers15
50,Its all here,"We enjoyed a walk down to Venice from Santa Monica on a beautiful sunny day and everything feels fine. There is a different world to see here along the Venice Boardwalk. It has become a large community of folks living and sleeping rough, many of who turn thier talents to entertaing the many tourists as well as selling some unusual art alongside the usual souvenier shops. Almost everone seems happy to be here. In the mix are various people just passing through, exercising, socialising - often there to be seen - so a great place to sit back and watch the world go by in one of the many bars or restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normannorma1
40,Nice place to stroll and enjoy,Boardwalk is really nice place to just walk and enjoy ice cream. Really chill place but when going with children You really need to explain the smell as the weed´s smell is everywhere. Also sad to see all these homeless people living there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simothehill
30,Disappointing,"Too much of a hippy vibe for me. It was very busy as Presidents day but that aside was the only place of our holiday I felt a bit uneasy.Parking wasn't easy but we managed to park for free off of Buccaneer st near the front and by one of the not so nice canals, was near a manned pay car park if you prefer.We walked to front and up pier and a short walk around the nicer canals but moved on fairly quickly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengel-IoW
10,So so sad!,"Honestly I think this place could be amazing... or... was amazing at one point? It is set up to be this great spot, unfortunately the homeless people have honestly taken over the entire city. The amount of people living on the sidewalks and on the beach truly takes awY from the experience and it’s hard to feel safe while walking around. Parking is reasonable but I spent most of my day worried that someone was going to break into my car instead of relaxing and enjoying. There has to be an answer for these people. Perhaps building small homes for the homeless or something would give the area more appeal and remove the tents, trash, blankets and sleeping bags that lay everywhere. It hurt my heart so much and at one point my eyes as I saw an elderlyady showering naked near one of the bathrooms. Locals just seem to ignore he homeless instead of helping and you can forget cops being seen around the area either! So so sad... I hope someone can help these people get back on their feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyf795
30,Venice Beach,"The Venice Beach is a buzzing beach town with a bohemian spirit; and commercial and residential pockets. The beach has funky shops, street performers and colorful murals. There’s also a skate park and Muscle Beach outdoor gym.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
30,Needs to be cleaned up,"Found it to be a rather disappointing experience because of the massive amount of homeless that have taken it over. There are definitely some really cool and totally unique aspects, but I was too overwhelmed by the dirt, sad homeless people, foul smell, and somewhat sketchy characters to really enjoy it for what it could be. Loved checking out the skate park, killer graffiti, and muscle beach. Excellent path all along the beach with skateboarders, bikers and runners. I’d say there are definitely a million other beaches in the area that would be a way better experience and despite the fact that it is rough around the edges, it is still one of those places you should maybe see once. There is so much to do and see, and it has so much potential if they would just put some effort into cleaning it up a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CASeven
40,I found it more enjoyable than Santa Monica,"We decided to park at Venice Beach and progress up the coast for the day, and I have to say from the Canals, to the murals, to the different sporting events going on, to street sellers, it had a good vibe (Cannabis smells aside). We enjoyed watching some events and played some games on the beach, which was vast and clean, Parking was cheapest right on the beach front at $9 for the day so we had plenty of time to play and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhys_H24
50,One of My Favorites spots,"While visiting LA we had our first encounter with Venice Beach and it did not disappoint. There is so much going on and so much to see with vendors, skating, grafitti artist, muscle beach, and more! I loved every bit of my time at Venice Beach. The waters were calm in late February. The weather cooler, the sand soft and the sun shining. It was absolutely perfect. Traveling from Florida it's so amazing to see the stark differences from the pacific and the Atlantic. It was all very moviesk and though it may not be the Venice of the 80s/90s that locals rave about. I enjoyed every moment at Venice Beach and would not hesitate to cone back.Advisory : everything is extremely expensive on the Venice boardwalk! Pack your lunch and have a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawyerBaeRenee
40,Over the top!,"This is the place to observe the far-out and the far-fetched! Lots of exposed flesh, and enhanced muscles! Lots of ""medicinal"" marijuana shops. Some great restaurants, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professional-Pilgrim
30,Venice beach has lost its charm,"Having visited Venice Beach and the broadway for many years, during my last visit it seemed sad, dirt, and much less fun. Maybe, the homeless people are too sad and the stalls do not seem as exotic. The beach and ocean are beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazjhb2016
30,Its colder than it looks on the movies,"This was a nice beach and even though it was summer, it was really, really, really cold. We could only get in up to our knees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CR141
50,Quintessential LA beach life,"Our first morning in LA we took an early bus from Downtown to this emblematic locale and had a marvellous few hours there.All the images we had from movies, TV and media were there aplenty. Fitness and well-being pursued with early surfers and a few on Muscle Beach.The skate park was tremendous and the sheer skill and exhilaration of the skaters most impressive. Much public art is to be seen, that includes the fine Declaration Sculpture.Entertainers were fun to stop and engage with. We were particularly taken with a chap tuning-up a grand piano at the beach edge, evidently after towing it there and readying for a recital.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,"This place is a ""people's watcher"" dream",Venice is iconic and weird a the same time. Always something to see and do on the beach and boardwalk. Street performers are present all the time and artists present their wares. Rent a bicycle and follow the winding path north to Santa Monica Pier or head south for a more quiet experience. Work out on Muscle Beach which has just been remodeled and updated recently. The fee is about $12 bucks for a day pass. Overall an attraction that is purely Venice so go see it a few days to get the full view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3854JXmikes
20,Homeless population simply too much,It use to be and still is such a cool place. Honestly though I will not go back until CA LA and Venice addresses the homeless problem. It in my opinion has simply ruined this very cool setting. It is everything along the beach and just isn’t pleasant TRULY SAD,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Departure758858
30,Loosing its appeal,"Venice Beach has always been the funky cool “different” beach experience, but our last trip was a little disappointing. The shops and the sidewalk vendors are still there, but the homeless have taken over and like everywhere else in LA and the liberal state of California, they go unchecked by anyone and everyone. There are homeless tent encampments in between buildings, on the edges of the oceanfront boardwalk and in the sand. The public restrooms have become their personal bathrooms and are disgusting. There are SUV’s and broken down vans and campers parked on the streets and in the beach parking lots that are clearly being lived in. One Suburban was piled with trash and had 2 flat tires, someone was living in it in the public (pay) parking lot and it was parked in a handicap parking stall... obviously LAPD has been told to leave them all alone. Most of course are mentally ill so it was no surprise to hear one ranting at the top of his lungs about no one paying him to wear his glasses while another was screaming about her vagina not being for sale. Muscle beach is fenced off with signs saying LA parks is bringing in all new fences, equipment and flooring in spring 2019.... our visit was in Feb of 2020... too bad, I don’t think we’ll be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabell760
40,Gotta be there....,"Venice. Iconic LA beach. One time home of one Jim Morrison. It is all on show here. A pretty nice beach hides behind all the stuff we know haunts Venice. You gotta see it at least once. Past the tac, you can find some good food further along the beach front. Rollers skate, jog, stroll along with an ice cream cone. It is all about as good as it can get. Muscle beach, half court tennis, catch a few waves. Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdNoble58
50,One of a kind iconic,Down to Earth wackiness. It’s a great place to walk and see and smell. The beach and vendors and bike paths and food. Memorable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkus1968
30,Amazing sunsets are giving it a better rating than it deserves,"Lively and vibrant place, many things to do, the skate park is fabulous, there are so many great bars and restaurants, coffee places, but also lots of trashy souvenir shops and many homeless people. In the afternoons and weekends, it is packed with people. But, you can get a nice stroll on the working days. It is not very safe from pickpocketers, so be aware of your belongings. Otherwise, an amazing sunset spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva
40,Golden Sand,"Venice Beach, a place to find the interesting and the different. The beach itself is vast with fishing piers and plenty of lifeguard station, although not all open this time of year. On this sunny it was a lovely walk. You should arrive early. It’s $9 to park next to the beach. But arrive later, parking is a problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BT3rd
20,There are much nicer places,"Venice Beach Broadwalk from Santa Monica is full of homeless people, trashy shops tacky stalls selling tat and down market cafes. Need I say more. We walked by beautiful sandy beaches and the walk takes about an hour . If you are a tourist give it a miss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsmon2016
30,Not what I’ve expected it..,"Lots of homeless people everywhere , the whole place stinking pot. There is not pier as Santa Monica. Been there, ticked the box . Wont come back .

Plenty of T-shirt stalls, market stands. I think Santa Monica only Short walk away is nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carmic01
50,Great People Watching,"Venice Beach is a quintessential LA experience. From the open air gym, to street performers, little shops to explore, cute dogs being walked, there is always something interesting to watch or see. Plus you have your opportunity to stick your toes in the pacific ocean or go for a swim if you are up for it. There are changing rooms, showers and restrooms. And there are parking lots right off the beach. If you are going for a swim you could spend 2-3 hours here. You can also walk up to the Santa Monica Pier from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccarthk2018
30,Average beach.,"Just an average beach, with sticky sand and without a Pier (unlike santa monica beach). Would choose Miami beach over any of these beaches anyday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polarbear559
50,Endless Sand And Surf,"In the AM this time of year the beach is almost deserted, except for the dog walkers and the surfers, bobbing in the water, waiting for a decent wave. The beach is miles long, so if you're a sand runner or walker it's near perfect and the long pier is a people watching treat. There's a good public rest room building, which understandably attracts the homeless, but they don't bother anybody other than requesting spare change. The blocks leading to the beach are filled with souvenir and surf shops and restaurants of varied ilk and quality. All in all a good place for contemplation or exercise or to have a meal by the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88AVANTI
30,Always an experience!,"Any visit to Venice Beach must include the boardwalk. The beach is an average nice beach, but the boardwalk is the experience not to be missed or forgotten! Lived here in 1972-73 and visited from time to time since there. It has not changed much just more of it and even some of the characters are still there just older!! The place is an experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonNoel7

40,Amazing place for people watching!,There is no where else like Venice beachThe eclectic mix of people and the shops and restaurants make for an amazing place to walk and hang out.A must visit when in California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
30,Interesting experience,"We went in the winter, so probably not the best time but nonetheless it was interesting. There are lots of vendors, street performers, cafes and souvenir shops along the boardwalk, but we found very limited food choices - at least decent food choices. It’s a great place to people watch and I can imagine in the summer it is even better. Some areas can be very grungy and dirty, and you have to be careful because it is very crowded, but there is lots of police presence - in fact, there was a police helicopter hovering above the whole time we were there. And if you try to park in the big city parking lots on the beach, good luck - the ticket machines are ALL broken, the attendant doesn’t know what he’s doing and you risk getting a parking ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Astrobeemer
20,3rd World in America,"First five minutes is interesting simply because of the novelty of how different this place is. Then the sad reality of it sets in. This is a spectacle of mental illness and of those whom society has left behind. For me it wasn’t the free spirit, hippy culture vibe I expected. It reeks of urine, pot smoke, and homelessness. If you are into weed culture this might be the place for you. I wouldn’t recommend bringing kids here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MtnFlier
50,Must Visit,"This is one of those must visit places when visiting southern California. It's such an iconic beach (also known as Muscle Beach), and it's great place to stroll through. You can also rent electric scooters and bikes to ride around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark42139
50,Beautiful and Fun!,It had exactly what I need for fun. It was filled with multiple things to do. There's a guy there that makes a fruit cup with various fruits it was delicious and I love the hot dogs there. A dispensary is also located there on the strip for those who likes to try out LA legal perks!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mstweet23
40,I would rate good but there isn’t that option,"Venice beach is funky, full of colour and buzzy with lots and lots of souvenir and nicknack shops of all sorts and lots of skaters and “alternative” people. There is also a section called muscle beach where lots of people work their (in most cases) impressive muscles. The beach itself is really lovely and away from the “promenade” where all the activity takes place. There are several places where one can grab a bite, nothing fancy, nothing to write home about. You’ll find several parking lots nearby but I imagine it’ll be hard to find a spot during high season. All in all an interesting experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurydice2017
40,Venice beach,"Heard so much about this place, I visited it and found it to be just as I imagined, people doing gym workouts, skaters on Ramps, vendors selling everything, eateries and tons of people walking along enjoying everything. I recommend you visit the beach and experience everything around it has to offer. The beaches are beautiful and people were enjoying the scenery. Go and have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jkalss
10,Not what we pictured,"The movies don’t prepare you for the smell of urine or the pushy street folk selling everything from marijuana to lewd paintings along the boardwalk.

40,Finally there,"This place is very iconic for one of my favorite bands, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, so getting here a big thing for me and my wife.It is a very nice loking beach where you can walk and do a little shopping and get some nice souvenirs.

50,Afternoon at Venice Beach,"After my trip to Disneyland I was fortunate enough to visit some family in Santa Monica. We spent the afternoon at Venice Beach and, man, what a treat. First we had lunch at the Venice Beach Ale House which was an absolute delight. The we walked the beach and watched boarders at the skate park and even threw up some hoops at the courts. It was an amazing day and I highly recommend a visit to Venice Beach if on vacay in LA>",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdpalmer70

40,Fun From A Tourist's Point of View,"You can certainly find some interesting characters here so I could understand the hesitancy of some locals going to this beach continuously but for a tourist I feel like the beach is perfectly fine. The skateboarding ramps near the area are pretty neat and it's fun to see people utilizing them. We found a decent pizza place, hung out by the beach, and were completely unbothered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spoopty
10,smelled like sewer!,"been going to Venice Beach for many years, at times it was unpleasant. Yesterday it was horrible!

30,Interesting walk and place to see,"Venice Beach is well known and offers plenty of beach with interesting shops. I visited during the middle of the day on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded. It can get busy quick not just the shops, but also just the general walking crowd. There are plenty of places to walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bx2L
30,Good people watching but probably wouldn’t return,"Venice is interesting with lots to see and good people watching. The vendors are selling mostly low quality stuff that didn’t seem worth the prices. There were some good looking restaurants in the neighborhood near the beach, we went to Great White and it was very tasty but you pay more because of the location. The beach was a bit grungy, I didn’t feel comfortable letting my kids take their shoes off because I was worried about drug paraphernalia in the sand. It was an interesting visit but I don’t know if I’d ever be that inclined to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joliew102
40,Cool,"Some cool sights to take in were the skate park, the muscle beach gym area and the shops along the boardwalk.

40,An Eyeful & Fun,"In many ways Venice Beach is overrated, but even a skeptic can't help but enjoy the various sights before your eyes. It's a place for people of almost all walks of life, which is why it is so popular. The central section is where you experience the quintessential Venice Beach, but if you go to the south or north ends, you will find quieter and relaxing areas to enjoy.The beach itself is broad, and blends into Santa Monica to the north. At the south, if you go past the Venice Beach pier, you will find yourself in a much more isolated and peaceful area.My favorite way to experience Venice Beach is from the rooftop bar/lounge of the Hotel Erwin, in the heart of the action, and you can see it all from above with a tasty beverage. You also get expansive city and Santa Monica mountain views. Make a reservation for the sunset...it's gorgeous, I think the best in LA.Nearby is the famous Abbot Kinney Boulevard, easy walk from the beach itself, and full of boutiques and great dining. I recommend it, but do advise it's not my cup of tea...seems a bit pretentious for my taste, but you need to experience it if you're visiting.Finally, please note the dedicated bike path....please don't stroll or stand in the middle of it, as most tourists seem to do. It's extremely busy all days, and especially the weekends, and people can get hurt by not being aware of the bike traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigh732LosAngeles
50,Just go .....,Not sure what to say : ......So many iconic places :skate park.Basketball courts.Beach volleyball courts.Muscle pen.Life guard huts.People.Weird people.People with dogs.Sponsored graffiti.Golds gym building.The vibe of the area.JUST GOFor UK people - it’s like Brighton but a million times better and on weed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andygR9400XH
50,Full of Great Vibes - An LA Must See,"Absolutely my most favourite part of L.A. and the Venice area! The atmosphere is amazing - it’s got a chill, ‘everyone is welcome/accepted’ and overall fun loving vibe. Everyone is happy and friendly, it’s intoxicating! Boardwalk stalls and stores offer a large variety of great food, art, souvenirs and clothing, all at affordable prices.There is a population of homeless people and obviously a strong smell of marijuana but it adds to its charm. If you’re seeking a pristine, boujee place then Venice isn’t for you. The beach/sand itself is well kept and safe and is swept each evening by the city council.It’s a must see if you’re visiting LA and I highly recommend spending a few days exploring all the neighbourhood has to offer! Not to mention the sunsets are absolutely gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiaSZ
10,Didn't even stop. Just drove by.,"We were on a private tour and as a group, we chose to not stop and get out. This place was filthy and very run down. Our guide even warned us to stay on the sidewalk and not get in the sand due to drug needles. We didn't even get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnottingham
40,Lovely beach to stroll long,We thought it was wonderful on a sunny day to stroll from Venice up to Santa Monica.Paths along the beach are well organised with separate paths for bikes and people with directions for going each way too.Loads of stalls along the broadwalks if you are looking a souvenir t-shirts etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2322BMjamess
10,Depressing sesspool,"Absolute sesspool... if you want to see endless lines of homeless camped on the beachside or be bathed in matijuana smoke or be scammed by some sidewalk hustler, then this is the place to visit... depressing and dirty... save your time and go to Long Beach instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davenoonan
50,Fun diverse beach,Very fun beach. There is art and structured graffiti art on the beach. The skate park is amazing. Even fairly little kids navigate the obstacles. Fun to watch and amazing talents. Muscle beach is here but they are doing renovations. Parking was free in a nearby garage for almost 2 hours. There are fun places to eat and of course there’s the boardwalk that seems to go forever. Nice ocean views and fun crowd. Very diverse crowd but we felt safe at all times. Worth about a half day visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610charj
40,"VIBRANT BEACH LOCATION, LIKE YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES!","Venice Beach is hands down one of our favourite places in the world. It's vibrant, full of life, colour and has some of the most beautiful, unique views you will ever come across.Overall the beach is clean and people respect the beach rules, it has cute shops and restaurants along the beach road and is frequented by some of the coolest, quirkiest people around.There are skate parks, basketball courts and of course, the world famous Muscle Beach for you to admire as you walk past. You can also find the famous ""Venice"" sign down one of the side-streets as you walk past.A lot of people rent bikes out for the day and cycle from Santa Monica/Venice and vice-a-versa. It is a beautiful, scenic little bike-ride that takes around 20 mins. There are plenty of places to leave your bike at the beach (as long as you've got a suitable lock which the bike companies usually provide you with upon hire).There are a lot of homeless people (most of whom are on drugs of some kind) that pretty much set themselves up at the beach or live there permanently. They use the showers/bathrooms as if they were their own and leave them in quite a mess. Overall it's not a problem – but where possible to try avoid them if you can as (if they are on something) you could end up putting yourself in true danger.The restaurants along the beach walk let us use their bathrooms whilst we was at the beach (I think they are used to this) so if you're desperate, speak with them.There are various people trying to sell you their music as you walk along, they will start by asking you to listen, then if you say you like it they try to sell you their CD for around $10, it then becomes very hard to try to walk away. Unless you're genuinely interested in buying a CD, I wouldn't bother listening in the first place just say ""no thank you"". The place is full of scammers but as long as you are aware of this, you shouldn't get affected.Overall Venice is beautiful in its own very unique way, but keep your wits about you when visiting.Instagram: @journeywithuss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/journeywithuss

30,Worth a look,"We were interested in seeing Muscle Beach which is why we visited Venice Beach. Be prepared for a lot of in your face street vendors, it can make a stroll along the beachside footpath a lot less enjoyable. The beach is lovely and clean but the surrounding streets are not. There are some great coffee spots a block or two back from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVB0404
50,Road trip,"I liked it here. We were prepared for it to be busy and to have a varied bunch of folks about! But we really liked it.

50,Past revisited,"This unique spot set in a once paradisal terrain, can be described as a place in a sunlit paradise.Filled with the shadows and echoes of a long ago summer place, where guget may at one time has her hideaway , now become another string of pearly beaches strung up and down the California coast, bejeweling the sinking sun, which crosses the young man's fancy along the east to west trespass up in the historic Route 66.Back in it""s heyday, it was a few hours away from the summer of love, 1969, populated by happy hippies, for whom the trip to Monterey,.Ghost like haunting melody, may still be heard in a new space and time, and open to reception for the acutely aware tourist, accidental or not.This description, fitting for the golden state, a state eternally positioned as that to which all young men seek a western travail, to seek the rush that gold sunshine elicits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamg36

20,C'mon.,"This beach has such potential to be great. However it is riddled in trash. I saw so much trash in the small amount of walking I did, kids playing by a tampon applicator. Human feces on the pier. The canals are full of trash and near by you can see the problem lies in the homeless issue. It's really sad. With all the tourism and people it's a shame they can't fix this.But if you can look past it, and you can. You can see where venice was once a really fun cool place. I hope to see that Venice one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711

10,Not worth visiting,"Venice beach is dirty, with garbage everywhere. It has tons of homeless and drug addicts leaving in tents on the beach and side walks. The shops sell very cheap and offensive phrases t-shirts as well weed that people consume freely on the boardwalk. Maybe Venice was a nice place in the 60s? I was very disappointed and don't recommend visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vvdantas
40,Not just sand and water,"Got a little taste of popular Venice Beach a couple of months ago. Because of time constraints, we were unable to get the full experience. From what we did see and do, my wife and I look forward to exploring Venice Beach further. Great artwork everywhere along with interesting people and shops. Venice Beach is definitely not all sand and water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpoNationals

We will be back very soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPCV
40,Venice Beach in December.,"Walked along the boardwalk second week in December. Not crowded at all, and the weather was a sunny upper 60’s. The beach was even less crowded. Perfect to sit, read, or just listen to the waves crashing along the shore. There were about twenty people that passed our area, making it seem as if we had the beach to ourselves. Not a lot of performers compared to the summer months, if you are into the entertainment. Too cold to go into the water. However, the water didn’t look clean enough to hang out in. Not trashy, just has a grayish brown hue you can see in the surf.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronicadavis7072
50,Long and beautiful,"Long and beautiful beach has plenty to see, buy and entertain yourself with. The wharf and its features Ferris wheel, Bubba Gump shrimp restaurant and the trade tents along the Venice beach make it a gathering place for all sorts of public. There are youth rollerblades and skating facilities by the palms with a heavy smell of canabis, next to it sports facilities with bodybuilders and yoga people, there are bike lanes and jogging groups, serfers, tourists, kids and selletof everything. There is something to do for everyone or just enjoy the historic Venice beach and its nature and clean sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viktoriyak912

50,Warm sea,"We arrived with the sky looking moody and ran down the sand to the sea to dip our toes - and it was warm! Fantastic! I think we were at the wrong end, so no shops or anything much, just lots of sand and warm sea. It was pretty rough and the rain was heading our way so we walked inland to Abbot Kinney Blvd which was a street of quirky shops and cafes. The heavens opened - honestly it was torrential - and we got entirely soaked. But we're Brits, so we just carried on. Walked back to the Rose café on Rose Avenue, where we had a trendy lunch among lots of people working on their laptops. One of our party was a bit bemused by finding peanut butter in his doughnut, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizzyloutoo
30,Nothing spectacular,"Venice Beach in Venice on the outskirts of LA is just like any other beach in the area. It’s boardwalk is the site of funky shops, street performers and colorful murals.

50,Energetic,"Venice beach is a place you wouldn’t want to miss. It’s alive and buzzing, we loved it. People of all ages were here having a great time. Good souvenirs and places to eat.

Definitely recommend this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad5522
20,Disappointed,"I recently travelled to the US and thought I must visit Venice Beach while in LA. I walked the beach strip from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier - around 50 minutes. Whilst I enjoyed S/M Pier, I though Venice Beach was a lowlight. A lot of unpleasant sites and average restaurants / pubs. At night, the police patrolled up and down the beach front for a reason - the overt use of drugs was astounding. The numbers of homeless individuals was also quite confronting. While it does have a layback feel to the place, I was disappointed and am unlikely to recommend it to anyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiningMan
10,Who cares,"This is a trilling spot to see people that desperately want to be seen , not for me .As a proud native of Los Angeles I avoid Venice beach at all costs , crowds of people with nothing to do but screem look at me . I know that it might be fun for out of towners to see every kind of random idiot on the planet but there is so much to see and do in LA why does anybody care ? This is not an accurate portrale of what LA is . In fact most people I know think it's a joke , even my friends that live right there .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pioneer736675

30,"Tacky, dirty and fascinating","If you're looking for a quaint, quiet beach neighborhood then you'd best avoid Venice Beach. The boardwalk (asphalt sidewalk) is crammed with cheesy souvenir stores and enough cannabis shops to keep Cheech and Chong happy for the rest of their lives. The only reason to come here is to people watch - the incredible diverse group of people wandering the boardwalk (great people watching!), the talented skateboarders showing off their stuff in the massive skateboard park and the steroided up bodybuilders at muscle beach. If you must come budget an hour - that's all you will need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb

A great feeling to have almost the whole beach to yourself walking up and down to Santa Monica :) But it is not only a beach with beautiful sunsets. It is the whole culture.

This is all great however its spoiled quite quickly by people demanding you buy their CDs, spare some change for the many homeless people sleeping rough along the walkways or worse demand you go to the ATM and withdraw cash to help some charity you've never heard of.The beach is nice, long sandy strips leading up to the Ocean with a great selection of little shops selling great T-Shirts and memorabilia but there is not much else to do.Walk to Santa Monica along the bike paths and spend your time there, it’s a much better beach and a lot less challenging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwanderaroundtown

I knew of roller blading beauties in bikinis, skateboard mama and the reputed urban edgy feel.What lies there now is a Mecca for homeless and crackheads.The retail units are ramshackle, reminiscent of squalid townships in South Africa. The food joints looked dirty and uninviting.The beach is nice enough. Good fine sand, plenty of lifeguard stations and not a bad break for surfing.The skate park is ok but the most disturbing thing was the graffiti over all the trees. Surely that’s sac religious.I had to see it but won’t go again. I certainly wouldn’t go there after dark and I’m a big lad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kentwoolgar
40,Beautiful view,It's worth a visit … filthy in some areas and the surrounding area is a bit run down so be alert and careful while visiting. Lots of things going on most of the time … can be lots of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mburbank2016
20,Very Dirty,"Movies and TV shows are misleading because I really wanted to visit until I got there. Do not come with younger children. The smell of Marijuana is strong all over, along with numerous individuals dressed very proactive. Everyone is trying to sell you something and there's numerous homeless people. Recommend head to Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C221DVcarlosa
20,Seedy area,"My least favourite spot we visited in this area. Lots of homeless living on the beach, extremely smelly in places (urine).

50,Another LA must visit,"This bohemian style beach area is on the LA must visit list. Street performers, skating, basket ball field etc - all the famous sites you probably have seen on TV. Parking can be nightmare- get there early to avoid it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C

30,"Its definitely a vibe, I would rather a quiet beach city to this ‘show’","Visitors always want to come to Venice Beach, I think with aspirations of beautiful beach (which from afar it will be okay for your IG shot, but Im not sure about sitting on that sand for fear of urine and needles) the boardwalk is truly a cast of characters. The week is quiet but the weekend is vibrant and full of all walks of life. If you are interested to people watch while walking boardwalk and then find a brunch spot this can be a chilled and entertaining couple of hours in the weekend. If you just want to walk by the ocean (I would pick another part of the coast) during the week might be nicer.Shopping, could take or leave more touristy stuff.If you are looking for beachside towns that are a little less touristy and also less of a honeless population, i would more recommend the South Bay, Hermosa, Redondo or Manhattan (or further South Huntington) for a slice of socal Beach life",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7430BYsarahh

40,One of the best beaches in LA area,"A visit to Califirnia is not complete without s trio to Venice Beach. We cycled from Santa Monica along the boardwalk at the back of the beach. Oceanfront walk is packed with bars and full of eccentric people and those who like to watch them.

20,Trash central!,"I went to the iconic Venice Beach to tick it off the bucket list. I walked from Santa Monica pier, which was around a 40 minute walk. It was great to see the beach itself, however the boardwalk is so trashy! It is full of stoners, homeless and mentally ill people, and horrid shops full of cheap and nasty souvenirs. You are constantly breathing in marijuana. There seems to be a few nice bars/restaurants but most look dodgy. I’m glad I went to see it but wouldn’t ever go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaB1192

50,cool funky beach walk with a bit of grunge,"We stayed in a Airbnb right near Venice beach and walked down the promenade a couple of times. Lots happening here with street music, entertainers, bars, food, artists and shopping. All lots of fun and lots of interesting people.Possibly wouldn’t take little kids here after dark as it certainly has an edge to it. Plenty of police around though...Great place to stay as everything is close and lots of nice shopping nearby too eg Abbot Kinney",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RossE865
20,Real life let down,"OK, so we decided to do a small walk down Venice Beach (on the promenade, not the actual beach) towards Muscle Beach along the shops. I didn't feel unsafe (as such) - but we were heckled a few times by some homeless people who were clearly off their heads (they were just aimlessly shouting abuse at everyone.... Or into the air if there wasn't anyone walking by). There was one particularly unpleasant occasion where a man literally screamed at me with a lot of profanity (""you stupid f****ing b***h) because I took a picture of a dog sunbathing--there is zero exaggeration in that story. The shops along the promenade all sell tatt, and the stalls along the other side are basically homeless people who create odd scenes using junk (not artistic, just weird). There were a few interesting things to look at, but not many. There are homeless people everywhere- asleep, smoking weed, off their heads etc. It's really sad to see. The general state of the sidewalk and surrounding area is shocking as well. Considering this is such a tourist hot spot, you would expect there to be some funds to throw at maintenance, but that seems to have been lost along the way. Muscle Beach is really odd as well, it's just an outside work out area - with rubbish everywhere, surrounded by what looks to be a poorly maintained jail fence. So bizarre.On a better note, the beach seemed nice, big and clean - again there were homeless people camped out along this, so I wouldn't trust walking along in bare feet, but it didn't feel crowded.Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I went, but it was just such a let down from what is depicted in media and films etc. If you do go, don't get your hopes up.... And keep your bag close!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hharris87
50,Nice way to spend a day,"I really enjoyed my day at Venice Beach. Save yourself the trouble with trying to find street parking and park in one of the lots average cost $10 for the day. So many street artist, shopping, good foods to try, and the beach. I can’t wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fpoblue2
20,Not for me,"Visited this place as part of a tour and glad I got to see the ‘famous Venice beach’ but it really wasn’t for me. Rows of shops selling tat with the constant smell of weed and just a run down look/feel overall. Didn’t spend longer than 20 minutes here, maximum, but that was enough for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynl1989
10,Really didn't like it,"Tacky shops, rubbish art, homeless, beggars and people trying to sell CD's, that's all I saw on my visit. If you are on the beach itself it may be better but then I would go to a different part of the beach, either towards Santa Monica or Marina del Rey. We visited as we see it on the tele but it's really not the same so I would advise anyone to avoid if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ali622
40,Different but fun,"Hired a bike from Santa Monica Pier and rode to Venice Beach Boardwalk. Certainly not the 1 mile distance we were told. The ride was good however the bike path was crowded as it was a Sat. Lots of things to look at on the ride and we stopped for a drink along the way. Venice Beach Boardwalk is a totally different experience from what we are used to. There are a lot of souvenir shops selling the normal t-shirts and singlets. My partner saw a smoke shop and decided she needed to get some, oops, not that type of smoke shop. The smell of weed along the boardwalk was strong. Heaps of artists selling their goods and a lot of places to grab something to eat. We enjoyed the experience, the bike ride and the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teppy62

10,Would Rather Have Skipped This Area of LA,"A stop at Venice Beach was part of our LA tour while in the area for the day before we headed to LAX. Well, if we didn't see it, we may not have believed it. The canal area has some lovely homes; however, the beach area is not an area that I would choose to spend my time touring. After a few minutes walking around and taking some photos we turned around and headed for the bus. The public restrooms were not even lit. None of the stores looked worth going into. We did see a few talented skateboarders in the skate park. We were there in the morning and I was grateful for that because our guide told us that the area is even more ""colorful"" in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cac1234
50,One of the best beaches to be!,The beach is great. The walk is not as great as expected due to the heat and not from what you will meet as this is expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasilei0sf

40,Smokin good time,"Great while the sun is up but a little different once the lights go out. Harmless homeless move in, day time art is not that much more. Remove it’s like 4miles to Santa Monica and NO there are not beer stops all the way but there are some good places along the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spcvuandy
10,Worst part of LA tour,"We did a day tour of LA and Venice was our worst stop! It was pretty scummy. Alot of scammers and homeless people. Worst part was the smell of cannabis everywhere, couldnt escape it which is shocking considering its a beach with a sea breeze, i know its legal in this state but christ, the whole place stunk. We walked straight back to the tour bus and waited there. Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlys977
30,Interesting Location,I stopped off at Venice beach this afternoon after a visit to Santa Monica. I’d read some of the reviews on here before my visit and I was a little unsure on what to expect. There is a large homeless population living on Venice beach but they all seemed self contained/ harmless. There’s plenty of people trying to give you CDs but again these were all fairly friendly. The area is a bit run down but it’s certainly a place that is full of character and I would recommend a visit. The skate plaza is great and the beach itself seemed to be in good condition/ clean. Muscle beach was closed for renovation. Overall I would recommend a visit but I wouldn’t spend longer than half a day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakD8895ED
30,"Different, Interesting and a little scummy","Took this kids down here on the way back from a little vacation. Different type of activities seen on the beach (activities/events), fair type food and definitely interesting people. We in California are struggling with the homeless/mental health population. There are a lot of different homeless people, talking to themselves and just roaming around the vicinity. Fun for a day to go hang out and people watch but not sure it would be a vacation spot for my family and I.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevehG4787OA
40,Free time fun,I was in LA on business and decided to take a moment and catch a wave. I went to both Santa Monica Pier and Venice beach. I lived the vibe at Venice beach best. Totally chill and fun. The vendors and other activities are what makes this beach a go to. Chilled and fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271stacyv
50,Venice Beach is great,Venice beach is a place to see. There are all kinds of interesting people on the promenade. The canals are a great place to have a wander. The beach itself has a wide expanse of sand. Surf is not big. If you are a surfer you would probably go somewhere else.There are a lot of homeless people living on the beach. They do not bother you. It adds to the atmosphere of the place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lily2154
10,Venice Beach has become a skid row.,I’ve been on Venice Beach about 10 yrs back and had some nice memories so I wanted to revisit. What a disappointment. The beach has become an area of vagrants and drug addicts. People lying on the beach taking their shots is not so nice.

And doing Santa Monica instead",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiar251

It’s somewhere I’d actually go back to if I ever get back to Los Angeles again. It was action packed and had great people watching. The skatepark is situated so you can waste hours watching the skaters do their stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joo564
40,Good atmosphere,"Beach side is too crowded with homeless people that actually live there. Beach scene was great, everyone has a good time. My husband specially had a great time at the skate park. Can’t beat $2 fish tacos and all performances. Besides the hobos and the cold water it was a great place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3451QBjackyc
10,Awful place,I had visited Venice beach several years ago and really enjoyed its relaxed and hippy vibe.... visited it again today and I left feeling very sad for all those homeless people living along the boardwalk. The place was filthy and really smelled bad. The public toilets were the worst I had ever seen and I felt very unsafe the whole time we were there. I would not recommend it. Santa Monica is up the road a short journey and while there are homeless people there too. It is a far nicer and cleaner place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilliano279

When I read other reviews there was a lot of negativity concerning homeless people on the beach.Agreed there is homeless people due to the fact it isn’t illegal along the beach for homeless people to congregate.

Best to make Venice Beach a daytime experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenkS2925WQ
30,Blackpool with sunshine ....,Venice us a place that appears to have lost whatever charm it might ever have had. Its crowded a little dirty full of people trying to sell you extremely poor and tacky souvenirs and hangs on to its muscle beach status which is neither interesting nor in any way appealing. This might sound a very negative review but if you want to be inundated with tacky goods noise and smell of fried foods I am sure you will absolutely love it - for me no thanks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836

You will see plenty of them on Venice Beach just enjoying the gorgeous weather. There are many vendors along the beach and lots of people doing shows. Take a bike a ride to Santa Monica. The pier has so much to do. There are also many musicians who should probably be making more money than they do on the pier. We met some amazing ones who we would actually pay to hear them in concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jm1l771
20,Not worth a visit,Was not like I expected. A lot of people smoking weed the place stinks.

40,A good hangout for a spare afternoon,"There are many beaches with plenty of activity in and around Los Angeles, and if you happen to be near the Culver City area, the Venice beach is recommended for a late afternoon hangout on a pleasant day. There is plenty of action, with streetside performers, skateboard enthusiasts, sand sculptors, tattoo artists, peddlers of miscellaneous trinkets and artifacts, all doing their bit to keep the place lively. The sand stretch is vast, and you may want to rent a bike or a e-scooter and take things at your pace. If you are the adventurous type and are into surfing or skateboarding or skating, you will find plenty to do here— and even if you are not, there are others whose antics you can vicariously enjoy. On a holiday or a weekend, it may be a challenge threading your way through the throng, so be warned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aksuresh
30,Venice beach,Parts of the beach is beautiful but there's a lot of graffitti and run down parts needing a tidy up. Not sure there's a need for so much cannabis to be smoked and sold everywhere. Santa Monica has nicer restaurants and shops and easily reach via bike or scooter. Car parking everywhere is expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorrainelockley
40,Worth a visit,"Good beach and alternative boardwalk. The sand banks are very large and clean, there is a clear divison on the beach so surfers go in on side and you swim on the other.Is quiet enough so you can relax, the water is warm,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3093TXcarlas
50,fantastic,"Every time I come to LA, I visit Venice. The spirit is still the same. But besides the boulevard and all the fun, also the beaches are just very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denneman
30,What A Paradox,"For such a famous and hyped ""must visit"" place I have to say it is pretty unimpressive. I get that it is very Bohemian and alternate lifestyle but in reality the coveted main walk like the backstreets was grotty and dirty. My wife and I thought it was a dressed up urban slum/ghetto. That said it does leave a lasting impression.We stopped here as one of the attractions during a Day Tour of LA. Some of the street art and building paintings were great but tempered with awful Graffiti tags everywhere.Be prepared to walk, dodge skateboarders, scooters and bikes. You will see lots of weird and wonderful characters and street stalls with a myriad of interesting things and just plain crap. Also be prepared to get utterly stoned from all of the passive weed smoke wafting around. My wife said at one point that the whole place had been hijacked by Hippies. Go, look and make your own judgements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prw05
50,Great walking,Venice beach is a great spot for a walk & to do some shopping. You can grab a bite to eat or have a drink.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2127AFdonnah
20,.,"Filthy, eerie and not what I expected. A lot of homeless and drugs and as for shops, stock all looked like it had been pulled from the rubbish",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilhaydenb
30,Hip but “high”,Not for me. The smell of weed was everywhere and the stores are expensive. You can walk here from Santa Monica and that’s a nice thing to do.Worth a walk. Wear a peg. Enjoy the street entertainers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneycjd

30,American History X anyone,"I wanted to go to Venice Beach just to see the (supposedly) Basketball Court from “American History X”. During day-time it’s nice just strolling or renting a bike, looking at people or having something to eat and/or drink. It’s very easy to find parking either close-by or down at the actual beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fretel1891
40,Great Beach!,"Great beach, and fun shops along ""the walk"". Very crowded, but sometimes the people are fun to watch too. Very interesting crowd. Good restaurants too. Very fun place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Climber773426
10,A seedy location that needs urban renewal,"We visited as part of an LA tour and unfortunately this was on the itinerary. We'll be asking the tour company to consider removing it from their trip.If you like people watching, bear in mind that many of the people you're watching have mental issues, are homeless, or have drug or alcohol addictions. They need some kind of help, not to be part of a tourist attraction.On top of this, if petty crime is your thing, it's the right place to go. There's litter everywhere, graffiti, con artists trying to ""give"" you CDs, and open drug use.There is nothing redeeming about it - if you're looking for a beach, go down the road to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benhO8056YU
40,Muscle beach,"Stayed for 11 days 3 minutes walk from Muscle Beach, Venice. Loads of places to grab take away food to each on the beach (we had tacos mostly and sushi one day). Surf was perfect for body boarding and felt safe with the lifeguards on duty. Hired bikes one day which is great to cover Marina Del Rey, Venice and Santa Monica. Used Perry’s beach cafe for the bike hire (part of our LA Go Card), has lunch at Perry’s too but felt overpriced. Sad to see the volume of homeless mostly in Venice area and had a sense of feeling unsafe post 11pm but never saw any trouble. Would definitely recommend as a base but if staying in Venice and not venturing out, 4-5 days would be enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBItineraries
20,NOT California Dreamin’,The entire place smells like weed and it is filthy. It was fun to watch a tumbling show and the skaters at the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/therealbmayer
40,Great piece of the coast,Venice Beach is a must see whilst in LA its full of diversity & wonderful sights! Beach is clean & safe for swimmers with little waves for the surfers....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd231
20,Sleazy!,"Venice Beach is touristy, crowded and rather sleazy. There are a lot of souvenir and tourist shops in the area. There’s a parking lot on the beach which charges a flat rate for the whole day. None of us really liked it a lot. The area doesn’t look safe with a lot of hooligans around; I wouldn’t recommend going after sunset. Santa Monica beach is a better option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShoaibShawoo
40,Always something new to see,"Not a whole lot has changed over the years here, just not as crazy like back in the day but, if you’ve never been here it’s worth at least a visit / a partial day just to say, you’ve been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deed343
40,Interesting. Lots of beach stores,It certainly has a lot of people and the teenagers liked it. The boardwalk is full of pot smoking persons and street performers. The skating park was interesting to see. We did not stay on the beach so 2 hours was enough time to walk from one end to the other and back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveVirginia
50,Loved it!,We spent a day walking along Venice Beach and we had a great time! It's such a happy and colorful place with lots of high quality street performances and lots of sun. The kids were fascinated by the performances and overall was such a fun experience and a great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/964navaa
10,American trip 2019,We are a couple in our 20’s from Australia and I thought Venice beach was going to be nice and relaxing. I had these thoughts before coming here and I was soo wrong. The beach itself is nice but the shopfronts and boardwalk I would avoid. The smell of weed hits you straight away and the amount of people trying to sell you things is crazy. All the homeless people sleep on the side of the boardwalk in tents and i didn’t expect that. It was like a home area for the homeless people to camp. I felt so uncomfortable and wanted to get out of there straight away. It’s not what I thought it was going to be and I was disappointed. If I came back I would hire a bike and go straight past it and just stay at the beach between Santa Monica pier and Venice. Much nicer. (Photos are of beach I mentioned),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603marissam
40,Nice beach but touristic shops,"Venice Beach is worth going!It surely is more touristic than e.g. Santa Monica or Manhattan beach, but the overall atmosphere is nice! The beach is very big and. The options to eat and drink, to do sports or just chill and swim are outstanding. The shops are not necessarily a „must have“ but the variety of restaurants and overall offers is huge. I recommend to talk a walk down from Venice up to Santa Monica, which is easily doable and an interesting comparison. In Santa Monica the Pier is obviously to be visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Asgard_von_Skopje
40,People watching galore,"We walked the boardwalk on a Friday afternoon. Lots of shops and eateries. A great place to spend a couple hours. If you drive, we paid $15 for parking cash only so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canrubu
50,Quirky and cool,"Very cool place to go for a walk on the beach or last the shops, a must to in LA for its famous reputation! Fun activity for something casual to do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahsmc
50,Can’t miss!,My teen children and I spent two solid days exploring Venice Beach and Santa Monica. Parked for $10 indoors for the whole day and rented bikes. that allowed us to explore both beaches and the whole of the boardwalk in between. Paddle Tennis is a must. Best Açai in the City. Best people watching in the world. You absolutely must go. Don’t underestimate the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandering2urist
40,Good are for rollerblade,Went for rollerblade and rented scooter...quite easy path and some shops and restaurant on the side. Street parking was not easy to find and I think better to pay for private parking. We didn' t go down to the beach so cannot comment on the actual beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cidernet
40,"Sun, sand and skateboards","Take a stroll and marvel at the miles of sand...and remember those lifeguard stations? Yeah, the ones from Baywatch. Take a minute to watch the surfers. Also lots of action at the skateboard park. Palm trees are very colourful, the victims of graffiti artists. The paved path is divided for foot, bike and scooter traffic. Keep an eye out to avoid a collision. There are shops selling souvenirs, coffee and food. Artwork and sculptures abound. You can walk for miles, all the way to the Santa Monica Pier and there’s always something interesting to see or do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarFlungStarling
40,Walking and site seeing. A great place to shoot videos.,This place is very active. Lot’s of different people with same interest... to relax! You walk and shoot photos and videos. You can also check out different restaurants and souvenir shops. A great experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neiljaen7647
50,🏄‍♂️,"Lots to do and see at Venise beach. Put on your walking shoes and GO! My advice is to go and see the residentual area with the canals from where the beach holds it's name. It's a bit off the beaten track but WELL worth the detour. It's beautiful,immaculate and quiet and hardly a tourist in sight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyinparistimestwo
10,Beware the shop traders are scammers!!,"This was my 2nd visit to Venice Beach and will certainly be my last! The smell of weed hits and stays with you throughout your visit to what can only be described as a ‘seedy beachfront’. My 20 year old son and I were immediately surrounded by a friendly group of Rasta guys who attempted to ‘give’ us CDs for a donation but when we declined we immediately felt very intimidated as they huddled around us. We continued along the promenade to find a completely naked young guy, totally and utterly stoned wandering around whilst everyone watched and laughed at him. The final straw was entering a store to purchase an item of gimmicky underwear that was displayed on a stand outside the store. I of course couldn’t have that one and they instead quickly (albeit very friendly at this stage) whisked me to the printing counter (with my back to price list, although I had already seen that my item was $14.99 which was already expensive for what it was, but I thought it would be a ‘funny gift’. When it came to paying, they held the card machine over the counter but very high up so that I could only read the buttons to enter my PIN. On receipt of my item and receipt I queried the $97.30 I KID YOU NOT!!! for a novelty piece of underwear worth no more than $5.00 at best! They refused to consider that this was unacceptable, laughed at me, called me a “b***h” and ushered me out of the store. I felt absolutely violated and reported it to the police. They were empathetic and admitted they have up to 20 complaints a day of similar behaviour but they have no power/control over this. I would therefore advise prospective visitors to give Venice Beach a wide berth and instead to travel 10 mins further to Santa Monica, where the beach is equally beautiful but less seedy! To top it all the famous outside gym was closed for construction. All in all a very bad experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAfferGirl
50,Great beach to hire a bike.,Headed out on bikes towards Santa Monica. We stopped at Muscle Beach on the way up and at the graffiti wall on the way back. It was a great place to people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataleighs
20,Vacay 2019,"Haven’t been here in a while and I don’t think I’ll return anytime soon! Homeless on the beach, public washrooms disgusting and area was dirty. Never again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steelerman365
30,Walk,It was a nice place especially for the calisthenics and people who love sports. The view beach was all great. The surrounding area was cool too the shops and restaurants close to the beach area were better than the one on the beach .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amnahope_
50,Excellent walking area.,"The beach is so wide and certainly lots of space for everybody to use. There's a path for bikers and walkers alike. Lots of activities to watch as well. I wish I live this close to Venice Beach, hubby and I would be here everyday taking our morning exercise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimieW
30,Too high waves for me,Apparently good for surfing and long areas of the beach is reserved for this. The lifeguards were busy running around with their wisthles trying to keep others out from there. Not a place for leisure swimming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannaBragberg
50,Good Beach and Entertaining around,First of you are driving to Venice beach go towards the Boardwalk and City run parking lot ( on the beach ) is only $9 flat rate.The Boardwalk is a good.People are Fishing-off the boardwalk.Surrounding shops are good and Bike Rentals are $1.75 per 30 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuniorBakshi
50,"Fantastic beach, very wide with lots to do","We loved it and the kids loved it. Car parks along the beach around $10-15 a day. Can get busy so we got there early. We bought some body boards from the beach sellers 2 for $25/30 depending on bargaining skills! Waves are great for this, quite strong current and some big waves so be aware for youngsters. Toilets on the beach if needed. Perrys cafe for food or bike rentals. Santa Monica Pier. Muscle beach which is under construction so it was closed. Sad times!Gymnastic rings, shops, great atmosphere, graffiti trees for great photos. Skate park. Bohemian vibe. Nothing about it I didn’t love.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simmonsadventures

50,Vibrant and Eclectic,"Venice Beach is one of my favorite places; it is eclectic and full of surprises and unexpected situations (good situations, that is). There’s is a vibrant genuine energy that never ends; beautiful people, shows, and much more. I wouldn’t recommended by night tho.For the backpackers, Venice Beach is so much better than Khaosan Road up in Bangkok Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigator828459
50,Stimulating,"I loved Venice Beach. It was so full of life. After walking from Santa Monica Pier, Muscle Beach and then Venice Beach it was exciting to watch all the action of the boardwalk. There were musical performers, painters, a guy taking bets on how long someone could hold onto a pullup bar, shops, restaurants, bicylists, people riding scooters and Pedicabs which we needed after all that walking.There really was alot going on and you could spend a full day just people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AATrenton

You can walk on the footpath or along the beach, either way it is absolutely wonderful. I would like to come back here soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhaindoyle
30,Interesting characters,This place definitely has character. The skate park is so cool and draws a crowd. Very bohemian and laidback. The beach was gorgeous. My only complaint is the place reeks of weed smoke. I visited the beach in passing and it was worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurs411

Dont listen to the negative feedback you hear, go experience it for yourself.We were at Venice with two teenage boys and we all loved this place. Eclectic, entertaining and every bit as laidback as you'd imagine.The Boardwalk was so much fun, albeit a little rundown in places, with great tourist shops alongside cool cafes and shops such as SNS.The beach was great fun too - the waves were perfect to spend time splashing,surfing and lolling in. Plenty of shower and bathroom facilities are dotted along the edge of the beach too.We were warned about the homelessness but this was minimal and non-threatening- much worse in San Fransico.Just a perfect place to spend a few hours and soak up the Californian vibes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/69LisaRain
50,A Nice Hot Sunny Day!,My daughter and I enjoyed walking along the beach. It was sunny and hot. We enjoyed watching the performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer284545
20,Kind of seedy in parts,"To get to the beach, you walk past various shops, including one that was offering free cannabis-infused lemonade! Other shops were mainly selling souvenirs. Getting to the beach involved walking past strong smells of urine. There was a paved walkway but full of people biking, motor scootering etc, so walking along it wasn’t an option. The Muscle Beach gym associated with Stallone doesn’t seem to be a gym anymore, just a shop selling drinks and T-shirts. Not impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yss97
30,Stopped at Muscle Beach as part of AMG Tours,We stopped at Venice Beach also known as Muscle Beach for 40 minutes as part of our AMG Tours. It was very crowded indeed with many shops and stalls.

Plus lots of homeless people. Some restrooms are ok and other are yuck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755daliar

40,Santa Monica and Venice Beaches,It was perfect weather (sunny). Santa Monica had a boardwalk. There were street performers and artists. Saw police and was felt safe. We walked to Venice Beach about 30 minutes away. Along the way saw local artwork for sale. There were a variety of exercises that you can try. Definitely a place to get some exercise in while on vacation. Would love to visit again when the water is warmer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HyacinthR9
20,Venice the Menace of the Left Coast,"There is a concrete boardwalk that runs parallel to the beach where people ride scooters, walk dogs and ride bikes or scooters. There's a nice skate park which was full of action. Down to the nitty gritty...What's most disappointing about the area for the most part is it's hard to decipher if a vendor is legit or just one of the homeless tent people. Most of the shops close rather early (weeknights anyhow) and some of the Beach Tenants prepare for the overnight. There's alleys occupied of tents or beach umbrellas if the residents even decide to not sleep on the grass a few yards off the boardwalk. In the morning all of these same residents come out of their makeshift shelters to greet each other to begin another day. Not being much of a Left Coast guy I feel that Venice Beach could be so much more than it is. The closest comparison I could think of is Atlantic City in the Winter. The Beach itself seems well manicured as well as the grassy areas and the garbage pickup seems to be on point but it's the residents themselves that bring this place down. If I was the Mayor or Governor or some ranking official I would do something to curb this behavior and gets these people off the beach and allies into a Public shelter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iam5150ru
40,Nice,We visited this beach and Santa Monica beach on the same day. The teens loved both beaches and really liked the variety of things to do here. They felt it was the more lively and youthful location.There was no avalible public parking and getting in / out was difficult compared to Santa Monica beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt200
50,California Family Vacation 2019,"Went to Venice Beach with LaTour1 purchased through Viator as part of their Small Group Highlights Tour of Los Angeles. My family Loved Venice Beach!!

Our adult children went back the following day to spend a little more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitaJoMo
40,Must do!,"Before coming here I read a lot of reviews and most of them were bad. But we still decided to go as they say it’s a must do attraction when coming to LA. I am glad we did. We parked in the lot which was 9 for the day — not bad. Then we begin and walk the beach and decided to rent bikes. The regular bikes were $8.. although crowed it was smooth and fun. Riding allow us to get to one point and another with a breeze (literally) it was so relaxing. The weather was perfect. My boyfriend even joined into a one time basketball game with some locals. He loved it. We stopped and ate tacos and other small eats along the way. Saw some people put on shows and looked at the stop. Yes, per the other reviews there were trash and homeless people but it wasn’t enough to take away from having a good time. I wouldn’t say that I have to come back but I wouldn’t mind coming again. Also, I would recommend that everyone go to Venice beach at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRD1024

A small strip of shops and people selling bad art (and some things that I wouldn't consider art at all). I just really wasn't impressed at all. Not much to do there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reikalykos

10,Ghastly,"On a three week tour Of California this was the worst thing in the whole tour. The place reeked of dope and urine the homeless sat on the side of the road. The shops sold tourist tat. Chancers, the talentless, the opportunists sold very very poor art along one side. Muscle beach was being refurbished and all that was there were a few skinny Italians trying to do chin ups. Monumentally poor and only appealing if you’ve never actually been anywhere nice before and think this is",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dexterces
20,Iconic - but not for the right reasons,"Venice Beach. Anticipated a vibrant and energetic space with colourful shop fronts and athletes working out.Skateboarders and breakdancers aside - who were fab - you are left walking amongst a growing smell of cannabis, urine and faeces. ‘Stalls’ created by self described homeless selling photo opportunities to tourists of their belongings - like a souvenir memento. Not sure what to make of Venice beach, disappointed? Possibly...A strange place, can’t quite describe it but I wouldn’t recommend going with younger children and I am by no means adverse to exploring new experiences as a family - so for me what we saw was a real shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500kerryr

40,Lovely,Venice Beach was lovely. Sand soft and beautifully clean. The old lifeguard stations are stunning and it is picture postcard perfect. Shops on the boardwalk a wee bit cheap and tacky but hey its the seaside!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feebee283
20,What happened to Muscle Beach?,Where have all the boys gone? They must have split and are doing P90X or F45 or something else. The muscles are gone... For now. Save the trip if this is what you were wanting to see.Plenty of opportunities for a contact-high and the mediocre food that satisfies.Crappy yet memorable souvenirs.More room than the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubten
40,"Beautiful beach, trashy boardwalk","The beach is vast and beautiful.The boardwalk is full of things to see and an interesting place to people watch.There is a skateboard park, muscle beach, basketball courts and further north are paddle tennis courts.Watch out for guys trying to stuff CDs into your bags or pockets, they will ask money for them.The street artists/sellers are interesting to watch, the fashion is eclectic and the whole scene is something that needs to be seen to be believed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Netster11

30,A weird vibe,"The beach itself is beautiful! Soft sand, big waves, lifeguards and a view of the Santa Monica Pier. The boardwalk however was a long stretch of tourist shops and homeless people. Parking near the beach is reasonably priced and many people are offering surf lessons.

50,Iconic Venice...,"Whether you are looking to people watch and enjoy a plethora of locals showcasing their talent, souvenir shopping, the possibility of a small festival scene, or a day lounging in the southern parts of Venice, you are surely to enjoy a memorable day. There are many restaurants to choose from and rental bike, scooters, surf board, etc. Great option for a spontaneous day to fit in at your leisure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/choiceonela
30,Could be so much better,"Parking was terrible! $25-$45 for parking near the beach, so drive a couple of blocks for $15 parking ($20 for oversized trucks). Once you get past the parking, please don't have to use the bathrooms as they were horrible! Even as a man, I couldn't get past the smell, so I decided I'd wait. Now that we're past the bad, there's a lot of good worth visiting. The people watching cannot be beat at any other location I visited in the LA area, there is shopping is plentiful, and there are a variety of restaurants options for all taste buds. Legalize marijuana is also an option, but I did not partake so I cannot provide a recommendation on which shop to visit and buy from. The best part of my visit was the Venice Beach Basketball League as there was a lot of talent on display.To avoid the disappoint my wife received (I chuckle), the muscle beach gym seems to be upgrading so ""good things are coming"" as the sign said.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/only1cochisebrown

Really dirty shops boarded up did not feel safe . Just don't go .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plattydix
10,Large volume of homeless,"I was recently in the LA area on business. On the morning of my returning flight, I asked the staff at my hotel for brunch recommendations, particularly near water. One of the employees recommended a place on Venice beach. It was close to the airport, and I hadn’t been to Venice yet, so I figured I’d give it a go. Long story short, I never made it to the cafe. I was harassed by so many homeless people within a block of the restaurant I turned around, got back in my car, and drove north. This was at 8:30am, so I can just imagine what it’s like at night. Trash everywhere and an absurd amount of homeless really makes this location undesirable. Do yourself a favor and drive a couple miles north to Santa Monica. It’s much safer, cleaner, and all around nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tlorisko
50,The beach,"Venice Beach was awesome. Although the day started out cloudy it ended up amazing. The beach is huge and long. It could hold many, many people although I imagine parking would be extremely tough. We got in early and grabbed parking for $9 all day. The best part of Venice Beach was walking the boardwalk area and people watching. They also had tons of shops and places to eat. What a fun time. We were there to about 3:00, but I imagine it must be even better during the evening and night. Overall we had lots of fun, just bring plenty of sunscreen, you will need it. It does get hot. Oh and stay hydrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andres72423
40,"Venice Beach, CA","Venice Beach is like stepping back into the 60's. Very diverse and eclectic. There is a Speakeasy on the main street where The Doors played and Jim Morrison Apartments behind the Sidewalk Cafe. You can watch artists paint, enjoy a drum circle on Sunday, skateboarding at the skate park, weightlifting at Muscle Beach or just enjoy the miles of beach, shopping and food. Watch out for the iron on t-shirt shops though. We were charged $226 for 4 shirts! We love Venice Beach and have been going there for 30 years but this year there were many more homeless people living on the sidewalks than ever before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U7753RAmaryb
50,This is a must do,"I'd been told about the famous Venice Beach so I took an afternoon trip there. It really is amazing to just sit and people watch!There wasn't a dull moment from seeing the guys playing basketball, the skater park right up to sunset with a huge drumming circle on the beach.In someways I wish I'd gone back for a 2nd visit but in other ways, I'm really happy to have the memories as they are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mashlie

40,"Nice sandy beach, good waves to play in, lots to see",We didn’t go for long and didn’t swim but it was a nice looking beach to do so. Waves were fair size and I wanted to body surf but we weren’t prepared for all that. The girls walked around the water a bit and then we strolled down the street for something to eat. Lots to see scrolling down the street there. I’d like to go back one day and play in the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenMClark

Walk the strand and you can buy just about anything....anything. Next if you go on the weekend there will be dozens of street performers, artists, magic acts.... anything goes. They have some amazing acts performing for tips, incredible artist, muscle beach and just some really weird people. Very Bohemian and chill with plenty of great places to eat and grab a drink and watch the world go buy. If you looking for upscale shopping and high end fashion this is not your place but if you like the circus side shows this is a must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dadruntrack52

50,Beautiful waterways but beach loos are vile,"We came to the each to see the muscle on display but the gym area is currently being renovated so this is closed until summer 2019, that is the only date they advise. The toilets on the beach leave a lot to be desired. Disgusting is the only way I can describe them so be warned.We decided to take a look around the Canals in the residential area after the beach which are very well maintained and pretty, I feel sorry for residents in the area as their privacy must be disturbed but it is quite delightful to walk around the canals and pretty bridges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petti120
40,Must rent a bike and cruise next to beach,"Today i rent a bike in santa monica and went to venice beach by bike. Check the right place for renting a bike most of them are expensive hour rate should be 7 $ and all day pass 20 $. The ride from santa monica to venice and back took 1,5 hours. We stopped in venice and watched the dance shows. Venice is a must see but you can not do so much things there. The homeless people destroying the atmosphere there. But they are everywhere, so dont care.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasemin2323
50,An interesting day out!,We visited Venice beach for the day and we had a great day. It is a fantastic place to sit and people watch either by the boardwalk or on the beach. Only downside is there isn’t many restaurants on the beach front so it can be quite crammed to find somewhere for a spot of lunch - you need to ideally go to the main road however this isn’t far.Be careful re parking!!!! One car park was charging a flat rate for $25 however we had already seen another one for $10 all day!!! Scam from the first parking! Our car was safe all day in the $10 car park. There is also a car park on the beach for $9 all day however was often quite full and a long wait to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaireL89x
30,Looked out there but didn’t seem safe,Pot stores everywhere. Hence the green building meant hash for sale. Didn’t seem safe overall feel. Lots of building murals that were neat. Another place checked off the bucket list. Been there done that!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baybug2012
50,"The Grand, The Gritty, and The Gnarly","Venice is not to be missed by native or local. This strand by the sand is grand in scale, give yourself about two hours for sheer bewilderment. The clan and kin range from merchants, both bona fide and not so much, to performers, try to see the street group called the Calypso Tumblers, for both their physical feats and cutting social commentary, there are plenty of things to do and places to eat or just rest at a shady spot. (I mean no sun:) Look for the fruit sellers, chilled, fresh mango, pineapple, melon, etc., enough for two for $5. Unfortunately for us Muscle Beach was under restoration, and we were denied the flesh fiesta, oh well, you can't have everything. You will see kite surfers, sun bathers, and there will be the homeless and assorted panhandlers, if offered a CD by anyone don't accept it, these guys have revived an old as the hills gypsy gimmick, you take the free CD and before you can leave they will start negotiating what the price for their 'recording' is fair. Run away! NOTE! Venice was originally designed to incorporate canals, just like that other Venice, you can walk through the actual canal neighborhood, located about six blocks from the cavernous parking lot ($9 all day) at 2100 Ocean Front Walk. Go and get some stories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces591872
30,GREAT TIME,"I grew up in California, but have been gone for years and it was a great time to experience Venice Beach once again.

10,Stay away tourists,"I’ve been to some dumps in the world but they had some cultural charm . We hired some bikes and did Santa Monica to Venice . The beach was nice but everything touristy was over priced . Shady retailers ready rip you off and thugury. The food so poor and over priced and the rubbish and dirt. The public toilets were filthy. I’m not one to knock the homeless but they are the weirdest I’ve seen anywhere . I’m a big street smart guy but even for me this place was shady as hell . My question to LA IS , don’t you like tourists ?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402nicholasr
30,"Enjoyed walking on the beach in the morning, but by the afternoon not a place for me","The beach is huge, there is plenty of sand for everyone to spread out. We stayed about a ten minute walk to the beach in Marina Del Rey. We would grab a coffee and walk the boardwalk every morning and it was pretty quiet but there were definitely lots of homeless people. We came back several afternoons and it was an interesting crowd. The small of pot in LA is everywhere but here it was overwhelming. My 12 year old looked at me at one point and started crying that she wanted to leave because she couldn't handle the smell any more. There are souvenir shops selling overpriced junk and prices very from one to another. There are places to eat/snack but it's all over priced. It's a fun place to people watch, watch the skaters or take in a pick up game of basketball. Sadly muscle beach was closed when we were there so we didn't get to see much but there were some buff people working out on the rings and ropes during some of our trips. I'm glad we experienced Venice but it's not on my long list of places to return to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrie9678

But if you go down the street where parking is provided - don't feel obligated to take the first people directing you in! We ended up doing that, not knowing that we had a choice. The very next parking lot (right next to the one we ended up in) was much cheaper that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBTraveler2go
40,Interesting place...,"We’ve all heard of Venice Beach so we had to check it out. It is an experience and worth visiting, especially if you enjoy people watching.

50,Venice Beach CA,Venice Beach CA is a very unique beach. Do you have the boardwalk with people doing crazy performances and you can buy legal marijuana if you want to. Lots of T-shirt shops and souvenirs shops. There are plenty of restaurants and walk up windows to order great food and coffee. You can rent bicycles and scooters. It is a good swimming beach. There is a parking lot right on the beach by the boardwalk. I live very close to it and go there quite often just to people watch. You should have your phones and money in a secure place. I have many people that come and stay with me and they always tell me Venice Beach is an amazing place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700terriel

20,Once Great Beach has Become Preferred Home for the Homeless,"I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life and have watched Venice Beach (the town...and the beach) change dramatically over the years. When I was a kid in the 70s, Venice was populated by lots of hippies and drug dealers, and was considered unsafe at night. By the 80s, it was a strange mix of new bohemian rich folk looking for beach properties, living alongside the gang members and junkies who still lived a couple blocks inland, in the little bungalows.Then the bungalows started to get torn down and re-done. Gourmet restaurants and hipster hangouts starting popping up all along Main Street and Abbot Kinney, with 3 story palaces of glass and steel popping up along the boardwalk. And new beach view restaurants to go along with all the fancy homes and cars.BUT in the last couple of years, the homeless population has gotten truly out of control. At night, the beach front cafes shut down way earlier than usually, and the tourists disappear completely, as the ""Sand-ominiums,"" (slang name for the homeless tents) pop up all along the beach. There are WAY more homeless than restaurant diners and clubbers at night. And the boardwalk is deserted, except for homeless at night. It's so sad that this has become the new normal for Venice.While Main Street still has some wonderful restaurants and fun bars, one block east of Main, behind those buildings, is lined with homeless tents...so don't park back there. And the beach is so packed with homeless every night, that I would never walk barefoot on Venice Beach in the day any more. It's too gross. If you want to go down to Venice Boardwalk during the day to check out all the craziness that humanity has to offer, it's certainly worth a look for out of towners, but plan to get out of there before dark. A few blocks East, on Abbot Kinney, you can still check out all the beautiful people, in their amazing outfits and cars, but stay away from the beach at night. And perhaps donate some money to homeless services, because it's really sad how bad that problem has become in LA...and Venice Beach has been hit really hard by this crisis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpH381RS
30,Uncrowded beach,"Even on July 4th this beach is large enough to give everyone space. Miles of golden sands, lots of dining on the boardwalk, showers, lots of attendants. If you walk down from Venice itself you will have to pass through some pockets of hapless homeless, who are vocal but mostly harmless. The walk or cycle up to Santa Monica is quite nice - about 2 miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB01

50,Big beach!,"Wow, the beach seemed to never end! It was great for walking and saw plenty of lifeguards on duty as well. We did not realize how many homeless people there were.

30,Checking out iconic VB,I was in LA for a short stay and didn’t have time to do much. But I was staying in Marina del Ray which is a close drive down to Venice Beach so I decided to check it out. It was really crowded as you would expect & very lively. Perfect weather to just walk along the strip or bike up the beach. People were playing basketball and tennis just like you see in the movies. I liked the authenticity of the place. There are tons of souvenir shops and food options to choose from. It’s a total cliche tourist trap but cool place to check out. I’d recommend finding yourself a nice spot on one one the grassy knolls overlooking the beach and having a nice picnic before dipping into the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niavm2017

30,Such a contradiction,"I don't know the history of Venice Beach, so I don't understand how the town can allow so many homeless to camp out in front of what is certainly multi-million dollar property. We rode the bike path down from Santa Monica into Venice Beach, and we passed many, many tents and gatherings of homeless. They never bothered us, but wow it's a lot to take in. We did ride into town to Abbott-Kinney, and it was nicer inland. We were traveling with teenagers, so they were able to handle it, but I would not recommend going there with small children.

We went on a Saturday Afternoon, and were lucky enough to snag a parking meter on the street (otherwise parking ranged from $20-$40). We were there an hour, which was plenty of time to get an overview and walk from one end to the other. There are public bathrooms, but they are pretty nasty. The Muscle Beach part was being remodeled during our visit, so that was a disappointment. The skateboard area is cool to see. There are people of all stripes to be seen, and that is part of the attraction. Avoid after dark, unless you are a thrill seeker.

The city certainly has its own laid back vibe that you can tap into. So get your walking shoes and head out. It’s a jaunt you won’t forget.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArkansasAmtraker
30,Venice Beach stopover,"Stopped over here enroute from the US to Australia.Full of great street art, but also some very ordinary street vendors,artists,many homeless.The actual beach is maintained very well in a daily basis.There’s a few casual eateries/bars and great walking,running,cycling paths.Good for people watching and for walking to Santa Monica.Walking distance to Abbott Kinney Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquiS310
40,"Dirty and sketchy, but great restaurants",Some of the best Mexican food anywhere. But maybe all of our good food and service was because we were traveling with celebrities!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb887
20,Venice Beach- disappointed,"I'm sure it used to be nice. Very large homeless population- lots of tents along the walking path. Just a really sad place. Big police presence,so it didn't feel too unsafe. Bathroom facilities horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellem813
50,"Love, love, loovveee!!!!","First off, I have always loved Venice, but it’s different when you go with your spouse. It’s BETTER!!!! We have literally too much fun. They have these little electric bikes and scooters that you can go everywhere on. Plus, Santa Monica is so close you can zip there in like 5 mins. Anyways Venice Beach has so much going on it’s amazing. It’s city life at the beach. There are every type of person there. Families, couples, friends, performers and everything in between.Yes, there are some weird things and probably not child appropriate things going on, but it is California. We stayed in an Airbnb 2 blocks from the beach, and honestly after about 10pm you wouldn’t believe how quite it gets and peaceful. There’s tons of restaurants and shopping around so if you don’t have a car it’s ok, just BRINF YOUR WALLET! All in all. I love Venice Beach! plus I got to pet a sea lion ❤️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikirock777

30,Homelessness shocking,"It was the top of my hubby’s bucket list to come to Venice Beach. Disappointingly Muscle beach had just closed for refurbishment the week before, so there were no muscle men training outdoors. It’s not expected to reopen for a few more weeks yet. Also, we were stunned by the levels of homelessness on/around the boardwalk- with garbage waste all around you. It’s not a place I’d want to bring a young family- with significant numbers of individuals with evident mental health issues in abundance. It could potentially be quite intimidating, but it didn’t stop us from feeling able to explore by foot.There are lots of shops selling identical holiday souvenirs, but you can save a bit by shopping around and bartering. It’s the usual holiday merchandise- with prices fairly high for the offerings, taking advantage of happy go lucky tourists.The smell of marijuana is all around you on Venice Beach boardwalk, but for some this is the drawer for coming here, though it certainly wasn’t ours. If you want a classier, cleaner and more family friendly stay Santa Monica would potentially be a better option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/positivepants
10,Sad,It's odd because it's all kinds of people; from the homeless to the elite. Watching the well-off eat at the too expensive restaurants directly across from people sleeping on the ground. It was an uncomfortable situation to witness. And you wouldn't expect such expensive restaurants on such a downtrodden beach.A lot of bikes and scooters. Billows of marijuana. Arts and crafts and souvenirs.Just a weird mixture of everything.And BEWARE of the restrooms! Filthy dirty with doors that don't lock and transients willing to let it all hang out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/durangoaqua

50,Quintessential slice of LA,"This is a vibrant neighborhood of beach bungalows leading to a boardwalk full of life fronting a wide swath of sand facing the ocean. Bring a blanket and a picnic basket and enjoy an sunny afternoon on the sand, watching the surf. There are many food, drinks and souvenir shops lining the boardwalk, should you need anything. Street parking is challenging in the area but possible with some patience. If you have a long layover, LAX is only 15-20 minutes away by car, so come check out Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brooklynite_Abroad

40,Lots of history about the original canals & nice enough.,"LA is crazy busy and Santa Monica was a bit of distance from our hotel so the Lyft ride was more expensive than normal.

20,There's SO Many Better Beaches Nearby,"I've tried to let Venice Beach vindicate itself in my mind. When I first visited years ago I was quite disappointed by the unkempt, dusty, and messy boardwalk area filled with tourists and homeless people in equal numbers. Recently it's been cleaner and the skate park gets to be more and more of an exciting destination, but overall Venice just doesn't compare well to other Beaches and destinations in Los AngelesSanta Monica has more to see, and has much better facilities and shops. Manhattan Beach is cleaner and more calm, and just a few miles up the Pacific Coast Highway is Surfrider Beach in Malibu. That Beach is incredible and much better crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain

40,Hmmmmmm?,"This is not a pretty beach, but we did enjoy ourselves. One daughter was looking forward to Muscle Beach, but it was closed for renovations. There are many homeless on the boardwalk, but they were not bothersome. We paid for very expensive parking in Venice, and then drove to Santa Monica to pay for parking again. Little did we know you can easily rent bikes and ride between the two. I highly recommend. It is a beautiful ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbeckyj

I wanted to see it in person and get it off my very long bucket list, and don't think I'll ever go back. The skate park is super cool and reminds me of my high school years hanging out with skate boarder friends and graffiti artists. The beach itself is pretty dirty... All kinds of trash can be found in the sand, so walking barefoot was scary. I found pieces of glass and broken bottle every few feet, then wondered if there might be needles (didn't see any, but I'm sure there are.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikkiEsan
20,No Thanks,"I have always heard good things about Venice Beach...unique people and art, fun shops and vendors, and beautiful beach areas.NopeWhat you will find is a lot of street crime, cheap and awful sidewalk sales pitches selling crummy items, lots of alcohol and drug use/abuse, and a sub-standard beach. The vibe is edgy, and that probably appeals to some. i would not recommend taking kids of any age here. i can't really recommend a visit here unless you like drugs and street crime in you vacation plans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillK427

50,Funky beach walks,"Venice beach has something for everyone. During the morning it’s full of fitness, lunch is tourist time and the evening is when some of the local homeless population come to rest in their tents.

20,Good Marketing,"It is amazing how loved this place is in urban myth. It is supposed to be where the artists hang out and art all around you, when in reality its just a bunch of junkies selling of substandard stuff they are creating as art and then you find the hustlers trying to sell stuff. What is always sad is to see the piss drunk homeless just lying around. The skaters park is a good place to take photos. But as someone has already mentioned, the broadwalk has a negative vibe. Do visit but not for a long period of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umayrmasud
20,A must to avoid..,"I hate to be negative about any place, and I know this is a “must see“, but it’s also a “must move on very quickly“ sort of place… The whole Venice beach boardwalk area is extremely tacky, with many undesirables especially after dark, and muscle beach is in a particularly bad state of repair. To make things worse, at the time of our visit it was just covered in homeless people living in tents all along the boardwalk… Very sorry, but I can’t recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d08scl
10,What a dump!,"We stayed at Ellison Suites because the pictures showed what looked like an older hotel with beautiful art and updated facilities. What we found was porn stars taking photos in the alley outside our bedroom window, drug paraphernalia (used needles) and human feces in the alleys around us, homeless EVERYWHERE, public bathrooms disgusting to the point of unusable, boarded up shops covered in graffiti, drunk fights in the alley behind us all night long, dirty surfaces and floors in our room, a radiant heating system leaking for so long the floorboards had warped and a bucket was placed under it to catch the water, which alternately loudly dripped or loudly hissed from an obviously badly in need of repair pressure valve all night long. I got tired of emptying the bucket every 8 hours, and it had a towel in it to dampen the noise from the last guests, not to mention the mildew and humidity from the heat coming from it. Look, room 11 should be uninhabitable and they charged us $134 for a Thursday night, and $175 for a Friday. This is, at best, $85 a night fully repaired and cleaned. The only saving grace was the incredibly comfortable bed, but it was so hot from the leaking heater, and loud from the bum fights, we still didn't get much sleep. So the price doesn't fit, the 3 star rating is generous to a fault, and you can't feel safe here no matter how hard you try. My wife called it ""Bohemian."" I called it ghetto.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jneith
30,Boardwalk Not what it used to be,Sadly the city of Los Angeles is doing it disservice to what was once a fun and funky beach boardwalk. Now it’s just funky and not in a good way. It is overrun with drug users and some of the thousands of homeless citizens of Los Angeles.Abbott Kinney is very nice during the day with lots of high end boutiques. But the actual beach and Boardwalk are a hard pass. If you’re looking for beach and boardwalk fun go next-door to the city of Santa Monica who have a lovely boardwalk and bike path and easily accessible public beaches,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanas1

We liked to see all the experienced skaters and their tricks in the Skatepark at the beach, performers at the Ocean Front Walk, people doing their work out in an open air gym or playing tennis or basket ball, etc. Lots of places to eat or have a drink. Relaxed atmosphere where you can easily spend a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicabH5954MF

10,Scary and Drug Infested,"I was expecting a bohemian vibe, what I got was scary and grubby.After having a CD shoved in my face I gave the gentleman a polite “no thank you, sir,” so he shoved it at me again. When I said “no thank you” a second time he got in my face(and I mean IN MY FACE) and said “you’ve said that twice, but I ain’t asked you nothing yet.” Does intimidation really help sell more CD’s?Dirt, grime, and homelessness so bad that you can’t see the beach for the homeless encampments in some places. I saw a used hypodermic needle, and used condoms in a couple of locations. Scenic!There is some nice graffiti and the people watching is great, you can also find some unique art for sale.It’s iconic, but I’d skip it, particularly if you have children with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/462deannab

Go to pay once his name is put on the back and now it’s $54. WHAT!! Turns out $4.99 a letter then tax. Thank god his name only has 3 letters. At no time prior to printing did they say it was extra. Completely ripped off and if my husband was there he would of told them to keep the jumper and hope they found someone with the same name.

All the way we were haggled by street sellers trying to make a conversation with us, complementing on our shoes, cap and what not! All with the purpose of supporting their music in exchange for money!!

50,Gotta go to Venice,"Such a fun place to visit for the day. Awesome beach, great walk/bike/run/scooter options, superb crazy stuff to look at, and if you’re looking to buy something there are plenty of options - a few good cafes too. Get there late morning/early afternoon and the place comes more to life. If you go behind the beach you’ll find the lovely canals too. If you’re in LA you have to visit Venice:",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeHulbert
10,Smelly Scary Crime Infested Dump,"WOW!!! The homeless issue and lack of police intervention has absolutely ruined this beach and community! It's appalling really! It smells like a sewer with pot smoke mixed in. Human feces, urine, dirty needles from drugs, assault as you walk by these camps from residents for money, crime infestation and sad sad sad dead souls litter this once eclectic and fun beach. You can actually feel the disease in the air here as you walk down the streets or boardwalk. This city has been COMPLETELY ruined!!! It's SO unsafe and dirty!!! Save your health, sanity and money and STAY AWAY!!! SO SAD!!! We used to come here for vacation years ago and came back expecting a fun and adventurous trip but no! We will never be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventure695597

40,Tourist Attraction,"As a native of Los Angeles I don’t visit visit Venice beach often due to overcrowding and price gouging for parking but when it comes to parking you don’t really have a choice. If you aren’t crazy about crowds, I suggest to take your chance on the boardwalk during the Spring and Fall seasons, you’ll encounter less people and during the summer you’ll have and endless amount or people and characters to watch. If you want to relax and dust the sand off of your feet, walk over to Tocaya Organica and then make a trip over to the canals it’s not Venice, Italy but it’s still a great place for pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisasV9923CR

30,Interesting place but nothing out of the ordinary,"We went to Venice Beach as a must-see location when in LA.

So we weren't disappointed but not thrilled either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelBG

10,Seriously Weird in a Nasty Way,"I can find nothing positive about Venice Beach. The actual beach is OK. The boardwalk is dirty and ugly. The shops are ugly. The locals are ugly.

Did not see any police.My advice, STAY AWAY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roamingwulff2016
10,Extreme doesn't even begin to describe the weirdness,"How this place is a tourist destination is beyond me! There are too many street performers and not even good ones!

This is the place where you see the massive difference between rich and Wealthy America and the downside in this country. Sometimes you feel you are walking in a gangster movie, or at the seen of a reggae concert. Here you smell more marihuana than in the most coffeeshops of Amsterdam. Walking from here to Santa Monica the difference can’t be bigger. Nice to take those rent a steps by Lime, to explore the bike lanes close to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JankeesR

50,Cast of characters,"Venice Beach is so close to Santa Monica Pier that you’d think the vibe would be the same.

The boardwalk is usually filled with street artists and performers and always something to check out and see!

Respectful bathrooms throughout and random paid parking as well. If you're lucky, you might find free parking sorta near the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessbefree

30,Venice Beach has changed..... not for the good,"It has been many years since I went to Venice Beach - it has changed. There were hardly any street performers (someone told us that the city changed the law and the performers have to pay to perform), it has always been a colorful place but the many things had graffiti over the nicer ""art"" painted, lots of boarded up area. The drum circle is still going on the weekends which was fun. We used the electric scooters to get around. It was great people watching. Would not go out late at night and early morning there were a lot of homeless people all up and down the beach. Probably will not visit, definitely won't stay in the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mageeclan
50,Electric Scooters are the way to see this beach,We rented the electric scooters on Venice beach and rode along the beach and walkways all afternoon and evening.

40,True Southern California Beach Experience,"A mixture of the rich, poor and middle class living all in a Southern California beach experience! You have scenic coastal beach views that stretch for miles. There you find the original Gold's gym along with the newer modern version.

There is also Main Street with its upscale eateries and boutiques!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redese2018

10,Couldn’t leave fast enough,"Took my teenage daughter and her 2 bf’s down there for some fun, got there about 3 pm via Uber. It’s been several years since I’ve been there and I received a total shock! The boardwalk that has the stores, places to eat and sidewalk vendors was dirty, had a sewer smell and just littered with homeless people. The street entertainers were completely missing, graffiti on buildings (not the tasteful type either), and just an overall distasteful atmosphere. Walked for 20 minutes and promptly requested Uber to pick us up. Not sure what happened at Venice beach, it use to be a fun family place with great food smells, sights and sounds...now it’s overran with homeless and some shadier looking crowds. Felt very unsafe there. Back to Santa Monica beach we went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimAndRobby
50,I could spend a few days here,"Was a little apprehensive about going as we had heard some dodgy things but omg its an amazing place.the beaches are fantastic, the whole vibe of the place is really laid back. Lots to see on the main walk along the beach ,fantastic shops if you like a bit different. Lots of poor homeless people there but they kept themselves to themselves and we never got asked for money .was asked if i would sell a cigarette by a few people. Lots of people entertaining the crowds .went on a bus tour where we had half hour there but went back and spent a day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coops41
10,You'd Rather Be in Philadelphia,"On his deathbed, W.C. Fields said, ""On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia."" (Probably apocryphal, like Oscar Wilde's ""either this wallpaper goes or I do"" last words.) Being in Philadelphia may be preferable to dying, but not so being in Venice Beach these days. And such a shame. Venice Beach, aka Venice Boardwalk, was quirky, great fun in the late 20th Century, but it's a filthy, stinking, ugly, blaring, diseased, unsafe, foul assault on your person today. Tent encampments. Aggressive panhandlers. Counterfeit merchandise. Vile peddlers of contraband, hard drugs, hardcore porn, if-its-criminal-you'll-find-it-here. Urine. Vomit. Feces. Vermin. People driving electric scooters, electric bikes, Segways FAST through crowds of tourists, while screaming at the poor buggers to clear off the pedestrian walkway where wheeled vehicles are prohibited. Evidence of how well-policed is Venice Beach. Surely not safe from violent crime after dark, but not safe from confrontation with the underbelly of American society all day and all night. If you want to dedicate yourself to healing the gut-wrenching, revolting wounds, then a visit to Venice Beach is for you. Otherwise, head for Philly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RThyme
20,"OK, But Not Safe After Dark","Venice Beach is an ""ok"" place to visit. (as they say in America)It was a bit dirty and unkept and definitely felt unsafe after it was dark.We are glad we visited because it was something to see, but would not go back.Definitely not for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayShn
50,Beautifully Odd,"Venice Beach is an Eclectic scene of nature and human oddities. It is always a good day to stroll down the avenue looking in the shops, watch the muscle men working out, checking out the art, and jewelry on display, or just people watching... from the freak show to the roller skating guitar player. happy travels",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BjD38
30,You know what to expect,"So Venice Beach is interesting but it is like any other overly touristy, dirty, crowded beach front place that attracts a lot of people just to people watch, buy cheap garbage and eat subpar food. If you have to, go and see it, but don't spend too much time here....not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374barbh
50,Beautiful,One of the nicest beach. Must see if in the area. Walk along North takes you to Santa Monica Pier. Best advise to park before the main parade and walk down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahteshamm2016
50,Venice beach 12 min drive from LAX,"We had a hotel at LAX and a few hours to visit LA. Took an UBERX for $15 to Venice Beach at the end of our cruise. The sand is fine and the iconic pier had a lot of people fishing. Lots of surfers but the beach was not busy at 9am. The boardwalk was an interesting walk to Santa Monica Beach (north) with food, shops and buskers. That leisurely walk took us 1 1/2 hr but you can pick up many bikes or scooters (some electric) signing up with apps (by time) or renting locally and there is a separate path for those. More people were on the beach close to Santa Monica Beach and the historic pier/amusement park was interesting. You can get seafood and typical fairground fast food. Muscle beach is between the two beaches for those that want to flaunt their exercise routine as well as gymnastics rings and monkey bars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ebbj

50,"Sad, tired and dated","We had a fantastic morning in Abbot Kinney, browsing the shops and eating from lovely little places along the way.From there we walked down to Venice Beach and I have to say I was saddened at what I saw.Lots of homelessness and people trying to sell there wares on the sidewalk. Nothing like what I saw from the movies. We did walk down and saw muscle beach, where everyone works out, but it was old and tired.The air was strong with the smell of cannabis.I had high expectations maybe to too big. 😪Some of the shop owners were lovely and took time to chat which was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinesh510
40,Worth a visit for surr,"We came here exploring both Santa Monica and Venice Beach and it was a stark contrast.Venice beach is more eclectic, countercultural, and even a little jarring for the various pockets of differing cultures slammed side-by-side of one another.While the beach (and specifically Muscle Beach) is iconic (I watched Pumping Iron when it was first released) and both meets and lives up to its hype, more pleasant and surprising are the canals just a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyWanderer

30,Gritty and Over-hyped,"Just like nearby Santa Monica Beach, Venice Beach is mainly for tourists. Locals go to other beaches unless you're a skateboarder or you want to work out at the free facilities on Venice Beach. It's over-hyped and over-rated. But if you just want to go to check it off a list, by all means go. Just do so with the understanding that within Los Angeles county alone there are at least 10 other beaches that will give you a better experience. And when you factor in Ventura and Orange County beaches - there are probably 30 other beaches total that will give you a better experience that Venice. If you do go, pack layers. It can get very cold on the beach once the sun goes down or on a day where there's a fair amount of wind. Which is more days than not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana

What can I say about Venice Beach? Whatever wacky thing you’ve heard is true, multiplied by four. The sights, the sounds, the people, the pervasive aroma of weed, all awaits you. Sometimes there are skateboarding competitions in the skate park located on the beach, and body-builders are always doing their thing. There is food, shopping, fun, live music, sand, sun, and surf.

50,The place that never gets old!,"When you visit Venice beach it will not disappoint... enjoy the sight seeing, the people watching, the endless options of things to do. Hop on a bike, watch the skaters, watch the dancers and enjoy the shops ! My personal favorite thing is the electric scooters available to rent (but I love this about anywhere that has them) it gives the great ability to travel long distances without the price of switching where you are parked.

Noone causes any problems, noone really begs but I found it quite hard to see. It's busy lots of action, skateboarderS, live music, quirkiness, I love grafitti and there's lots to see around this area.If you don't mind the homeless aspect it's a cool place to visit, maybe more so for the younger generation...

20,An experience to be missed,"Staying with friends in Manhattan Beach we traveled the beaches from Santa Monica to Redondo, and there is no a lot to say for Venice Beach other than it's notoriety, Muscle Beach, and the roller skating guitar player is there, but that is it. It is a sleazy experience and not a place I'd recommend if you have teenage daughters. There are disused needles lying around, the smell of dope in the air, and not exactly the greatest collection of locals hanging around.For a much more pleasant Beach experience hit Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach, much nicer places to hang out, and Santa Monica pier is worth a visit, along with Santa Monica itself.As for Venice Beach, just to say you've been there and that is about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/649eugeneh

50,Lively At Weekends,"There is a huge shortage of parking at the beach and what there is costs a lot. That said, it is a lovely place to walk or sit and there are lots of things going on to watch. It’s a great place to people watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robin_Knowles
30,Sad and run down,"We found this a sad and somewhat desperate place, so may homeless people and so many lost and lonely souls.Quite aggressive touting of wares. The beach is beautiful and because it’s exposed it’s very windy. The muscle beach part has only one person there. The skateboard park was the best place for people watching",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kate5757
40,Crazy place but fun,Venice is very unique place to visit. It has all the best and worst of America right in front of you homeless people sleeping on the streets and lots of wealth all together. It is a fun and exciting place to visit with loads of shopping and street vendors and artists. And although there are a lot of homeless people it still feels very safe.A must see in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simongU9953ML
40,Fun adventure,"Venice Beach was awesome! There are tons of street performers, lots of food stands, and tons of energy. We sat and watched a basketball game. It was interesting watching people workout at muscle beach. It was everything we expected and more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexiaripa
50,What a beach!,Enjoyed lunch of Venice beach and could of sat there all day just people watching.So much going on and such a good atmosphere down there.I can imagine the summer months are insane.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgilly1980
10,A grim shanty town,The good vibe reviews on here must be kidding. This place was grim ! A beautiful sandy beach along from nice Santa Monica is ruined by loads of homeless people occupying every park bench and shanty town shops. Worse were the countless junkies often being aggressive to eachother screaming obscene language and generally kicking off. We couldn't believe this was in a modern wealthy city. Camden market in London is a palace compared with the eyesore of Venice. The real Venice should sue for defamation! Avoid. Ugh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karen7
40,Must See,"Vibrant colourful area, with lots to see and do. Street vendors, singers, acrobats, volley ball, basketball, skateboarding and of course the famous bodybuilding, made famous by the like of Arnold Swartzeneggar. A must place to spend some time wandering and taking in the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SagaloutsTour
30,"Lots of Sand, nice pier","Lots of shops, restaurants and things to do and see. be ready for strolling along the beach, getting food from windows or sit down locations, and just seeing an interesting dichotomy of people. Beach parking areas are less expensive than the on street options, some meters are 2 hours or less. It was a fun day with friends and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeromeo259
50,Great people watching BUT the canals are a must,"I love Venice Beach, the people watching can’t be beat and it’s great to grab food and relax on the beach. There’s always live music by buskers and all sorts of weird and wonderful sites walking or rolling by. Check out the gym on the beach ... even go in if you’re game! There’s loads of other sporting activities too which is fun. To get away from it all I really like to head to the back streets and walk around the pretty canals behind the main drag. It’s quiet and great photo ops and if you’re into houses, you’ll enjoy the mix of new and old. You get that artist vibe which is cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bd3Melbourne
10,The Pits,I came from Australia to stay at Venice beach as I heard great reviews . What a disappointment it has been . It’s either full of homeless people/crazies everywhere or pretentious hipsters trying to sell you their “ original stuff “ or “ awesome vegan food” lol! Def most overrated and rundown place . Smells like urine everywhere too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biancar256

30,Venice ins and outs,"On the beach:This is an attraction to see a lot of sidewalk vendors, surfing, and strange sights. On Sundays there is a drum circle with a lot of pot smoking if that's your thing. I lived here for a few years, and I learned to stay in a group or have a buddy at night when walking around the walk streets and beach.Abbot Kinney: First Fridays is a packed time on Abbott Kinney on the first Friday of each month. It can be fun and is also very crowded. Recommend not driving.If youre planning a trip ahead of time get Rez at Restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lattejr

50,Day at the Beach,"Venice is never short of amusing things to see and do. Head out for a day of unusual sites and sounds on the main boardwalk. It’s usually filled with people selling things, performing, or just having fun. Add sun and sand and your in for a fun filled day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewoodsmall
40,Artsy atmosphere,"I really enjoy Venice Beach, its full of people enjoying life. I love the artwork being displayed. Muscle beach is also nice if you want to work out. They charge 10$ whi h is a shock to.me, i figured it would be free. The basketball and tennis courts are a nice bonus if you want to burn some calories. I'm not into skateboarding but they have a very nice skate park as well. Santa monica beach is very close as well, if your more into a family vibe, they have several rides for the kids enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delv0ns
20,Not one of LA best,Venice beach aka Muscle Beach needs a lot of work to clean up. This beach is full of old shacks that are run down and need some “muscle” to repair.The beach itself was nice for a walk but some street vendors were pushy trying to sell their goods.The weight area was not what I expected a little run down and needed the graffiti removed.I prefer Huntington Beach or other beaches for safety reasons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samksandhu
40,breath taking,"the shops were great lots to eat drink and do in Venice beach, there are lots of street performers my favorite were the dancers ant there is a store with transformers made from junk metals that was very artistic.

50,Beware of electric scooters,Love Venice Beach vibe. Saw lots of people on scooters so we hired some. Had great fun until mine hit some sand and I went flying. Really hurt myself.

50,Unique,"Great beach, impressive and unique boardwalk. Easy to spend a day wandering around. Lots of things to do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanfacundob2016
40,So Much to See,"This is a great place to visit. Not only to take in the beautiful views of the beach and the ocean but all of the artists, shops and food spots. The boardwalk is really long. We only walked it for 1 hour because that is all the time we had on the parking meter. I feel like we could have easily spent a couple hours or more there.We were there during lunchtime on a week day and it was really busy, can't imagine what it is like on a weekend! We had just purchased a small wooden surfboard (to hang on a wall) on Balboa Island and then saw the same thing on Venice Beach $10 cheaper :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMEO
10,Not nice,We walked here from Santa Monica pier. There are a lot of homeless tents which made the site terrible. You can take a bike or scooter to roam but avoid this at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2475CSdanielleb
40,Beautiful Beach,Very Nice to Walk on whether you walk in the water or on the sand. So many sea shells to pick from. Wasn't very crowded in January either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klarratta
50,Great People Watching and Fun Boutiques,"We walked over to Venice Beach after brunch at Kreation. While the weather was a little chilly for sunbathing, we loved walking along the boardwalk visiting all of the fun shops and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spanishteach910
40,Lively area,There was a lot of one of a kind shops and peddlers with all kinds of things for sale. Art engraving and music are all an extra experience.The CD guys are irritating. Ignore them and walk past as they only want money if you touch their stuff.Quite a few homeless people in the area and it felt a little run down although safe. Police were patrolling the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/922kristian
30,An experience,The graffiti is cool. Watching the skating was cool. Finding parking wasn’t fun. The pan handlers need to get to leave people alone. I for one cut our time short there. I don’t want beggars messing with me and my kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onlyonemaggie
30,disappointing,not sure if it is because it is only february but we were disappointed in venice beach and the muscle gym. only one person training in what can only be described as a very tatty gym. lots of tramps about and setting up home along the front. we can say we have done it but wouldn't rush back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevchezza
40,Bike ride along beach,"We paid for bikes to ride along to Venice beach, $40 for two tandems which were rusty but still a nice ride along the coast line. We went to see muscle beach but again old and rusty and not what we expected.Beaches are beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsvikki23
40,Afternoon outing,"Venice is always an interesting day! Someone street performers to entertain you and so many incredible talented artists displaying there work for sale and any type of food across the boardwalk. We love best to rent bikes at Venice and ride to Santa Monica pier and return. Gets very crowded during summer and some restaurants are expensive but some are very affordable, great experience for couples and families",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106deannay
30,Don't come here for the day...,"We had a 60 minute stop here as part of a day tour around LA. Trust me, 60 minutes is all you need...other than Muscle Beach and some cool murals, there isn't really much to see. The area is so run down and there are homeless people everywhere. The beach was dirty and full of litter. Go, get a few pictures and then move on...there are nicer beaches to go to for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catp79
10,Shocking,"We came here yesterday as we had a layover in LA before heading home. We watched the sunrise on the pier which was lovely but the rest of the morning it was awful. We walked the entire length of the beach and it was nothing but grubby. It was saddening with tons of homeless people lining the street which made us feel a little uneasy so early in the morning. I was surprised at how unclean it was and grotty, very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sjabena
50,Beautiful beach,We all loved Venice Beach. Gorgeous at sunset. It’s HUGE. Since we were here in December and it was only 55 beach wasn’t crowded but I imagine in July it’s packed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summertimefun1234
40,Venice Beach,A great range of shops that have well priced items and lots of eating places as well. It is a lovely walk down the Esplanade and over to the skate park to see the boarders doing their tricks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorHeadrick
20,"Grotty, Grungy and Unpleasant","We were expecting some level of back to basics at Venice Beach but were unprepared for the generally unsavoury feeling of the area. Instead of an outdoorsy, health conscious, love life approach, we found Venice Beach to be full of homeless people who were obvious by the odour, unsavoury characters (during broad day light so definitely wouldn't visit after dark) and downtrodden stalls. It was almost as if this area has withdrawn from normal societyOur teenage daughter was also disappointed with reality vs the Venice Beach shown in movies and TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddtrippas
50,The Hippie culture survives here,"We enjoyed strolling along the beach front and being entertained by street musicians,artists etc etc. We then headed over to the canal district to take in all the homes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpS4312GB
50,Fun people watching,"Cafes, restaurants, muscle beach, artists, people roller skating, drum circles. The boardwalk can be crowded in summer but still so fun and you can just step off onto the beach and find a nice place to relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schisti
40,A must see,This place is busy vibrant cheap and vast. The beach alone is fantastic but with added shops food muscle beach and strange individuals its great. Don't Drive if u can as cocktails and happy hours in abundance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479karine
30,Overrated,"How you react depends on what you are looking for. It seems to be the top thing to do, if you are young, to want to visit Venice Beach when in LA. We live about 4 blocks from the place and wouldn't go there if you paid me to go. The sand is not the best it is teaming with people not only walking and roller skating and biking but now there are scooters to contend with and these people are the worst. they just don't care about being cautious around huge numbers of people who are walking.The center of Venice itself is quite run down and seedy and along the main driving artery from Venice to Santa Monica street parking is hard to find due to the fact there is very little parking available even for the residents many of which have to park their cars on the street and the hours and locations are strictly monitored. Park further inland and then walk or catch a local bus. There are a few parking lots close to the beach and there is usually someone making themselves quite visible as a parking attendant.If you want an eclectic experience then this is for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483juned
50,Fun place,"I love Venice beach, this place is always fun and there is a lots of activity around tans you will never be bored in this area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amanuel_hailu
40,A must visit while in Los Angeles,"If you're visiting LA, you MUST visit Venice Beach. There is so much to see from the street performers to the shopping. Venice has an eclectic mix of high end shops and tourist attractions as well as affordable shops with little nik-naks for our home or souveniers for friends. Lots of original art available as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugfromBHca
20,Beautiful Beach,"Bikers were extremely rude, not everyone on the beach is from CA! We were walking close to bike path and several people yelled obscenities at us. We had small children with us and we were just trying to cross over to the beach and walked across the bike path. We loved the beauty of your beaches but didn't care for the attitudes of the locals toward tourists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/REW135
40,Interesting day out,If you are into people watching then Venice Beach is for you. There are so many tourist down on the boardwalk and so many other interesting people that frequent that location you are sure to have a very interesting afternoon of people watching. There are a lot of touristy shops to stop at and shop as well as restaurants and tattoos. Each time I go to Venice I have a tendency to actually park in Santa Monica and then walk to Venice beach boardwalk. It's just a nice afternoon in the Sun enjoying the ocean and the ocean breeze,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalguy7979
50,Venice CALIFORNIA,"Venice Beach 🏖 is a must for anyone visiting Southern California for the first or 20th time. With so many activities, such as biking, scating, swimming or just walking, people watching is my favorite. I rent a bike from Santa Monica & ride the strand all the way to Manhsttan Beach trough Venice. It’s a blast & I never get tired of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalya24
30,A nice walk with restaurants all over the place.,"Taking a walk on Abbott Kinney Blvd., you'll find all sorts of restaurants and shops; a beautiful place to have a weekend brunch, leisurely lunch, or dinner; but it's almost always over crowded. Doesn't justify its reputation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeznikk
30,Not what I expected,"The beach is nice, but some of the shops look run down. Most of the people we came across were nice. Many street sellers with handmade gifts and pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sukhjiwanh
40,Bohemia on the Beach!,"Best known for its Bohemian buzz, Venice (originally called Venice of America), a beachfront resort town, was founded in 1905 by eccentric tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney.Kinney recreated his favourite Italian city with piazzas and canals - not to forget the gondolas and gondoliers imported from Venice! The canals are still here, part of Venice Historic District.Kinney’s original vision of creating a cultural mecca was soon set aside and Venice Beach became an egalitarian public space. An independent city until 1926, it thereafter merged with Los Angeles.Continued neglect led to high crime rates but gentrification over the last decade has raised real estate prices hugely, created upscale commercial and residential space, displaced original inhabitants and also reduced gang activity here.The Venice Ocean Front Walk aka Venice Beach Boardwalk, is the most crowded section of Venice Beach and that’s because all the action is here. About 2 miles long, along the sands of the Pacific Ocean, it is a key part of what makes this place unique.Funky shops, street vendors, fortune tellers, mimes, mystics, musicians, jugglers, street performers, tattoo artists, souvenir sellers, T-shirt hawkers, skate and surf shops, cafes, public art murals, break dancers, broken-glass walkers, the list is endless.You can buy unique pieces of art and craft, paintings, photos, sunglasses, swim wear, shoes, sculptures – it’s a crazy mix of diversity in retail that rivals anywhere else in the world. As far as people watching is concerned, the boardwalk is in a league of its own.While the boardwalk here does upstage the Pacific Ocean, people also go here to catch some afternoon sunshine on the Venice Beach sands. The Venice Breakwater built by Abbot Kinney to protect his amusement pier, is a favourite surf spot.On Saturdays and Sundays, the Venice Beach Drum Circle meets around noon (where Brooks Avenue meets Ocean Front Walk). An improvised jam session where scores of people from across the world play their drums, shakers, congas even as others chant and dance, the Drum Circle lasts until sunset. The event is free and open to all.When the Venice Beach Skatepark built at a cost of $2 million opened in 2009, it instantly became a hot spot. The 16,000 square foot facility has a variety of skateboarding elements. With its photogenic palm trees and location near the beach shore, it has gone on to become a favourite skateboarding spot. The facility is free and open 9am to sunset. Safety gear is compulsory. Just standing by, watching the young daredevils do their stunts on the skating ramps gets the heart pounding.The Venice Beach Recreation Center has tennis, volleyball, basketball and handball courts, children’s play areas with gym apparatus. The outdoor basketball courts here are where some of the best street ballers train as shown in the film White Men Can’t Jump. Apparently, many NBA players also developed their game on these courts before being spotted and recruited by talent scouts.Muscle Beach outdoor gym where body builders work out is a renowned part of Venice Beach. Arnold Schwarzenegger worked out on Muscle Beach and made Gold’s Gym famous. For those who are not into bodybuilding, it is a voyeuristic place to watch the chiseled body builders strutting their stuff.The concrete Venice Beach Bike Path, that runs between the boardwalk and the sand is a very popular place for biking, roller skating, even Segway riding! Make sure to not get in their way because they aren’t stopping even if it means that they and you end up sprawled on the concrete. Bike and skate rentals are available at Venice Beach.Venice beach is a gastronomical adventure too – nonconformist with a dash of flair. Mexican, Asian-fusion, all-day breakfasts, gourmet ice cream, there’s something for everyone.Abbot Kinney Blvd is a short stretch for some of LA’s trendiest shopping – unconventional clothes from stylish independent boutiques and gifts. It also has an eclectic mix of popular foodie joints, coffee bars, restaurants, juice spots, bars, night spots.So there you have it – possibly the most interesting beach in the US – artsy, edgy and oftentimes odd – this is Bohemia on the Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
10,"A Truly Horrible Walk of Garbage, Filth and Body Odour",".Venice Beach used to be a fun walk. Always a few crazies and wackos. But now it's overrun by filth, really dirty smelly homeless people who are living in debris and filth, the severely mentally disturbed, and utter garbage and tat for sale. It's like walking through Skid Row in Hell. I am amazed the The California Office of Tourism board allow this to exist...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serial_Traveller

30,A Bit Edgy,Maybe I should have done some research but I expected this to be all swish and chi chi like Santa Monica.What struck me most was the number of homeless people there.The shops are a little bit tatty and there are one or two hostels.Maybe it's ok for young 20somethings but not for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vonireland
10,Not Santa Monica,"I walked from Santa Monica pier along to Venice beach. The walk, in the Santa Monica section, was beautiful and chilled and I absolutely loved it. Venice beach was the polar opposite. From the minute I got into the vicinity all I could smell was stale urine. There seemed to be homeless people camped all along the board walk, many of whom seemed to be battling mental health issues and, in all honesty, were very intimidating. The vendors seemed cool and I would have liked to have checked some out but I just felt so uncomfortable (granted I was on my own) also some creepy guys about trying to give out cds...I didn’t wait to find out what that was all about...I assume some sort of scam as not many people buy cds any more let alone fake ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilly_bean_1981

20,Not what you expect,"After seeing Venice beach portrayed as a wonderful beach with surfies, muscle bound jocks and scantilly clad babes on roller blades. This beach was a real let down. The actual sand beach near the surf and the jetty was OK. But the beach pavement and promenades were lined with beggars, druggies and homeless for about a km along from the wharf. Feel a bit sorry for owners who have paid mega millions for beachfront - to have this sought of riff raff in front of their houses.The place has a real smell of marijuana all along. Big dissapointment for us both- at least Santa beach end is still OK. Would not recommend to Vemice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccdzyne
10,"Boardwalk, yes...Beach, no....","Venice Beach is known for its cast of characters, shops and Muscle Beach. With a surge in the number of homeless people in the area, the beach has succumb to the negative affects of drugs and homelessness. The beach, especially near the lifeguard towers, is littered with needles, crack pipes and small plastic baggies that are reflective of pills and crack cocaine use. To be clear, the boardwalk is fun and entertaining for all. But, you must remain cognizant of the panhandlers and homeless that dominate the area. If you want the freedom to roam the beach safely, drive two miles north to the Malibu beaches where it is much cleaner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7534DZjamesw

50,Nice place to walk,"Nice place to walk through the beach!You have so many places you can go, eat, drink, just relax. Very cool to hang out.Record location to where you parked! Is very easy to get lost!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nemelek13
50,beautiful beach,venice beach is really a very nice place there is alot to see and do the views are great and the place is vibey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2flyy
50,Happy Times,"This is a fun place to walk and talk and shop and relax. Watch your wallet or purse. The people watching is some of the best in the world. It compares to everywhere. You can bargain like in Europe or China and remember to always be nice and mind your manners. This wins everywhere you go. We compared it to Key West in Florida, the beaches in Barcelona and Italy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3941cb
20,"Dirty, Grubby, Grungy - Popular","We took a tour of Venice Beach following our disembarkation from a cruise. I was very disappointed, it was nothing like I expected. The area is very dirty with shops on the boardwalk selling every conceivable touristy trinkets. The beach was nice (not as good as Australian beaches). There were homeless and mentally ill people on the streets (like any large city). We then went to see the canals, which were pretty in pictures, however, the water was disgustingly dirty. If you want to go to the toilet when in Venice Beach, be prepared to buy a meal to be able to use a restroom. I would head to Abbott Kinney Street where the galleries, restaurants and cafes are, which is supposed to be a lovely area. It’s supposed to be the electic, artist and architecturally diverse area, however, its not somewhere I will rush back to. Overrated by a long shot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisemD2482OD
30,Anyways interesting,The beach. The bikes. Muscle beach. Street performers. Artists. Sunshine. These remain the same. The overwhelming pot smoke and 420 shops are new.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfA9218TX
50,Falling and Falling in love...,"This unique beach is so special in many aspects. The multicultural vibe puts anyone at ease just to be yourself. people, activities, shops, restaurants everything gives this place a unique colorful feeling. A must visit beach by any traveller who seeks adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EPabalu
40,Cray Cray... a lot crazy creative energy & general craziness!!,"People-watching extraordinaire! You can sit and watch or bike... go on scooters or skateboards.... walk along or run.... stay away from the gzillion kiosks of t-shirts and cannabis goods or take a look at everything...It’s total beach vibes from the skateboard park to the velvet paintings of Elvis and Jimi Hendrix. You can buy t-shirts or tattoos; henna tattoos or true ink; ice cream or bobo; pastry or vegan macarons; matcha or tacos... it’s all there.We went on a Friday morning and it was already filled with people.... I think it would be over the top for me to go on a weekend... but, perhaps weekends are just another day at Venice Beach, only on steroids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000
50,Cool place on the tour!,"We stopped here first on the tour-neat area-check out muscle beach!! Lots of neat shops, skateboarders, etc. Definitely a neat little beach bordwalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelswithdanielle
20,Better for people watching than waves,"Why do people congregate here? Only reason I can think of is to people-watch. Lots of strange people. Also a craft fair - flea market type of environment. Food booths. Plenty of street musicians/artists. Playground, pickle ball courts, outdoor weight gym that appears to be old, rusty, and no longer used much. Bathrooms are atrocious- only use them if you are desperate. A bike path runs through the beach and extends up to the Santa Monica pier-about 2.5 miles north.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E-Lynn-Br
40,A melting pot of people,"Great to see the world renowned Venice beach.A real mix of people, from the homeless, to buskers, body builders, skaters and scammers trying to sell you CDs. WARNING do not give them your name or touch the CD, otherwise they will intimidate you to buy their CD and they operate in gangs.We did not get sucked in, but noticed a lot of people who did.Other than that it was an intriguing walk along the board walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZ_Rick_n_Kay
50,So romantic love it,"This is the place to be if you’re looking for romance. It’s the place to be if you have kids. It’s the place to be if you just want to wAtch life go by sitting solo. It’s just the place to be. Except the restrooms are dirty and have a queue and that sucks, but then it’s a beach not heaven as it appears outside be loo :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redhooloovoo
50,Venice Beach Bliss by Darren Chaker,"By Darren Chaker - Few words can describe Venice Beach other than gorgeous, hip, cultured, and spectacular. Venice Beach maybe located only a thirty minute drive from downtown Los Angeles, but is in a different world distanced from stress and judgment.The board walk is packed during the summer with tourists but always has skate boarders, musical enthusiasts, and a sidewalk market place with goods you'd only find on the boardwalk. Restraurants, bars, and beautiful rock and gem stores line the boardwalk along with the typical tourist shoes. Santa Monica is only a thirty minute walk along the boardwalk.The people who make up Venice Beach has given way to some of the more upscale millennial residents who want to walk to the main office of SnapChat located on the boardwalk. That has increased rent a lot, but Venice Beach continues to maintain its culture.Regardless when you expect to visit Venice Beach, you will find plenty of entertainment, good food, and of course priceless sunsets. Happy travels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenChaker_CA
50,Awesome beach!!,We love coming to this beach when we are in the area!! It has cheap parking and is right off the boardwalk!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraycieB
20,Sketchy,"I would only visit this area during the daylight hours; I definitely did not feel safe in the dark. I enjoyed watching the kids skate at the skate park, muscle beach was meh, lots of people watching to be done here. There are sooooo many homeless people in the area and lots of questionable activities going on so beware. Visiting once was enough for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kims2529
10,Disgusting,Cheap souvenirs shops and homeless people galore. The smell of urine and marijuana is inescapable. The unisex bathrooms are literally the grossest thing I have ever encountered. There is nothing redeeming about this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwat70
40,Quirky and different,"Some people think it is tacky but I just think it is quirky and different - certainly different to most CBD's with high rise and modern buildings. just love the beach and its activities, buskers, variety of people - so different to downtown and the gridlock on LA's freeways just driving aimlessly for hours which is what happens on freeways.As a tourist, rather just get lost here and enjoy the alternatives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
40,Evening Stroll,Worth a trip here. Be careful with children as there are some inappropriate items in the area. Certainly fun to see some local flavor!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edwellons
50,Venice,"It was cool seeing the basketball courts, and skating area since they have been viewed in movies before. Beautiful sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellenrE2619VL
40,Quirky Beach,"We enjoyed our walk down from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach. It's a very quirky area, good for just leisurely walking and looking around the stalls. However, it would have been nice to have some better restaurants on the beach front to sit in and enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809CE
30,Not LAs best,"The beach itself is great, but all the other activities make it somewhat tacky. Maybe stop by for a quick look at all the going’s on. The shops sell typical seaside stuff like sun glasses, buckets and spades etc. quite something to see all the musclemen working out at the outdoor gym area. Certainly an eye opening experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kolletjie
50,Don't miss this walk of life,"Venice Beach works well in December. Crisp clear blue skies and temperatures just hitting 20def Celsius invite for long strolls on the beach or the boardwalk with lots of photo opportunities ranging from the weird to the wonderful. I prefer the early mornings when only an eclectic mix of dog walkers, street cleaners, homeless people and the odd fitness freak are around.Get here after 1pm and it’s a walk of life in all its forms. If you enjoy people watching there are some fascinating people to watch! Pink hair, blue faces and elf costumes ranked amongst the ‘normal’.Entertainment varies every 100 metres from the grand piano via percussion performers to the rapper accompanied by his boom box. Graffiti, shop fronts and artisans’ displays are as original as they are colourful.Hungry? Try the Sidewalk Cafe for burgers or a healthy Cobb salad. At the North end of Venice Beach the Venice Whaler is also a good choice. Their rooftop bar is sheltered to give some respite if there is one of the occasional fierce winds blowing. They had delicious brusselsprout salad on offer last time I popped in.Parking for the day from 6am till midnight is only 4$ at North Venice close to Paddle Tennis & Muscle Beach, same price at Rose Ave. It’s 6$ if you get there after 9am on Mon-Fri or 8am on Sat-Sun - early bird special! Don’t be confused by the signs. One says 6am till 10pm the other says till midnight. It just means last entry is before 10pm. It’s a dollar more at the Santa Monica end. Go figure.If you are too tired after walking the roughly 5km from Venice Pier towards Santa Monica Pier to make it all the way back then there are at least 4 different options for one-way transportation along the beach: pick up one of the electric scooters from Lime-S or Jump (they are left all over the place) or hire one of the Metro bikes (they are more orderly stores at a number of hire stations) or a Jump bike. Just do everybody a favour and stick to the Marvin Braude bike trail please if you are using one of those. Also try to wander only on the clearly labelled Ocean Front Walk reserved for pedestrians. The Los Angeles counties have done a good job at keeping pedestrians and cyclists on separate tracks to avoid incidents, now it’s just up to people to follow the simple rules.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntalabany
40,Walk the board walk,"We walked along the board walk to Santa monica it was a sight to behold, even though there is homeless everywhere in tents the beach itself is still beautiful. There is plenty of shops cafes bars etc along the board walk to stop off at, most of the trinket shops sell the same tatt the usual tshirts, magnets etc, but it is still fun to go there and fun to people watch, plus the famous muscle beach is just off the board walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe15
10,Perhaps I missed something,"Didn't like this place at all. My daughter wanted to go so I went with her and glad I did as I wouldn't want her going there on her own. I didn't know what to expect but she was looking forward to it and was really disappointed by the seedy and dirty environment. Horses for courses I suppose. but it's difficult to see what the attraction is of this place. Continually hassled by pedlars of a variety of types. No pleasure whatsoever. If this is what you're looking for then fine, but not for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WednesburyRoad
30,Famous but now somewhat seedy,"I usually travel through Venice Beach on the bicycle path. It is a pleasant cycle. However, the entire area has become inundated with homeless individuals and homeless encampments. The ocean is still beautiful to behold but there can be the question that Venice itself along the oceanfront largely consists of small shops selling cheap clothing and trinkets. And do not forget about the drug paraphernalia and tattoos. All in all a seedy scene but if that rocks your boat, so be it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
50,Most beautiful sunset,If there is one thing you should do in LA it is to be on Venice Beach while the sun is setting. Most of the merchants close up shop after the sun sets so go a bit earlier if you want to view them. The area is extremely safe and you can find free 2 hour street parking just two blocks away so you don’t have to spend $9 flat fee to park if you only plan to be there a couple of hours. LA also has Uber electronic scooters and they are all along the walkway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljd4
10,Did not feel safe,"I’m sorry but I just didn’t feel safe here. We visited just before sunrise to experience the sunrise andWe ended up leaving before the sun came up. There were homeless people everywhere. And as much as I sympathise, the mess they had made was disgusting. I’m not sure about the American laws and this is an issue I have in the uk too. If I dropped a sweet wrapper in the uk I would be fined. So how is a homeless person allowed to call a place that looks like 4 bins tipped over the floor with a sleeping bag in the middle, home! In the middle of a public place? I’m sorry but I wouldn’t visit this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakej4k3
50,Food and service,"Stopped in at the downstairs restaurant and Erwins hotel and had a great meal with excellent service from Norma. Great experience, will return for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eld0nd
50,Where the beautiful people come,This is the place to be seen on a Saturday afternoon. My tip is to hire some roller skates. Nothing like feeling the wind in your hair passing by the beautiful people. This is living......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgesalmond
50,Deep and clean beach of white sand with a non-ending show of people and activities in the background,"Beautiful ocean, part of the Santa Monica Bay; between the Venice Pier and the famous Santa Monica Pier, with the also famous and always entertaining Venice Boardwalk in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/js0rel
20,Go just to saY you went,"Large population on homeless, pot smoking & crazy scooter/bike traffic, no good spot to eat by the beach, and dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimmvel
40,It's sandy,"It is what it is, a sandy beach with a bit of muscle. A gentle walk can be had, but look out for the growing population of scooters! The beach is well kept and the shops along it are fun and sell all sorts of stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckofcorby
40,Diverse....,Took 2 teens here for Spring Break. Lot of pot smoking... Nice souvenir shops lined up but be prepared for people trying to sell you stuff. Beach is super clean with amazing views. Parking wasnt too bad but the people who handle it were rude. Lots of places to eat. We watched the skateboarders which was super cool. Muscle beach was a bit disappointing but still neat to see. Lots of restrooms so that was nice. Overall a very cool vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959tashaf
50,Summer all year long Venice Beach California,The most fun relaxing day out enjoying fresh sea breeze and the interesting eclectic bohemian free spirit energy of the beautiful Venice Beach California Coast ! -minus the hoity-toity wannabe upper class judging snobbery of say A little bit further up or down the California coast. Venice Beach is down to earth hippie fun vibe great food great street performers relaxing energy great day out with teenage kids and dogs -Think Xanadu (80s roller skating movie) vegan Yogi muscle Beach incense burning market shopping cozy comfortable stylish grunge with a fun great music fashion Laid-back California vibe ♥️A Must visit whenever you’re close to LA LA LAND !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmarQ2878SK
10,Camden Market on Sea,"If you are from London you will understand this comparison, Venice Beach is like Camden Market. It's extremely busy and full of people trying to sell you their homemade CDs, people posing as charity workers to try and get your money, weird T shirts and other junk being sold from stools. We walked onto it and walked straight back off as we couldn't stop being pestered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814victoriac
50,So many things to look at,Perfect place for people watching and taking in the sights. Use the scooters. Go to the parks. Join in the games. Relax and soak in the sun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/telpage
50,Rollerskating,We did the cheesy thing - yes roller skating along Venice beach. Just be careful not to bump into any tourists or run into the professional skaters and I’ll be ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulHutchings36
30,"Interesting, but sketchy","Venice beach is worth seeing. But be aware that it is a but sketchy. Folks will try to give you things (like CDs), presumably wanting you to buy them also, the smell of weed is pretty prevalent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tri2RumMore
30,An interesting place,"This was an interesting place, that has loads of character. Sadly it also has a homeless problem, that is very unusual in how it is handled and how large it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donaldtrout
30,Worth a quick visit but not for long.,"The stroll along the boardwalk was marred by the number of homeless, I felt uncomfortable around either the mentally disturbed or drug addicted people shouting and carrying on around and about me, that said we did purchase a pizza and give it to one of the homeless they do appreciate any help you can give them.We did not stay long.Its is either your thing or not, Santa Monica is more my thing nowadays.If you are in LA its worth a short visit but don't plan your whole trip around Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PHunter17
30,"Great beach, annoying artists & marred by pot heads","This is a great place to visit and the stores and vendors are epic. Muscle beach was in recovery or leg day with only a few blokes out.I’m not a pot smoker so continually getting wafted with cannabis was annoying, although legal.I made the mistake of trying to go the public toilet near the homeless people, and I can never I see that atrocity. The city can do better in maintaining that.There were a number of Artists who continually were giving away their music and then demanding money. When I said no I was accused of being racist until my African American wife and I walked off. He accuses me of being a racist and then married me off in less than 30 sec marring a greatly anticipated beach walk.Piano player was a standout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/211jamieb
50,Its charm simply gets better with time,"I have always loved Venice. I used to live near by in Marina del Rey until I moved abroad. What was my wonderful surprise to visit Venice this summer having lunch right by the board walk, to find it as wild as ever yet more civilized, with more charm and wonderful alternatives to enjoy the seashore and all of its uniqueness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValerieBottazzi
50,Vibrant Venice Beach,"My husband and I stayed at a small boutique hotel, right on the beach. It is such a vibrant, eclectic community! Very ‘Bohemian chic’ with lots to see and do and great stores in the downtown area. The food was good (although a bit pricey, but it was beachfront!). It’s not far from Santa Monica, another great beach town. It’s great for people watching, swimming, buskers, arts and crafts and general relaxation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary_LuK_12
50,Venice Beach and Boardwalk,"The famous muscle beach is here, Gold's Gym where Arnold Schwarzenegger trained is here at Venice Beach. Miles of beach where you can rent a bicycle and ride along the ocean.... walk the boardwalk and shop, eat and explore! Cool place to check out, you will see all sorts of people on the boardwalk, artists displaying their work, creative people dancing, singing, acting .... you will see it all! Just a fun place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellevlavianos
40,Great,Intending to simply go to Santa Monica this was recommended by many a Uber driver. I am so glad (despite the prevailing cannabis smells too often) that we did.It is packed with street performers and some amazing cheap and cheerful food outlets. It really is full of life.The beach is immaculately clean with some great graffiti artists and the whole place feels safe and welcoming. The only real downside is the shock at the amount of homelessness which can be hard to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdeWotton
30,Crazy place,It's all going on at Venice Beach. Every character in the world is there....fun to people watch. A lot of homeless people on the side streets and on the beach at night...I feel bad for them. Quite the sideshow overall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minna4201
50,Peaceful,"Once you leave the Venice boardwalk and enter the beach and the Pier you will find the peaceful sound of the sea and miles of beach. It’s absolutely wonderful. Come here for the sun, the people watching or whatever, and leave with a rested mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsOzz
30,Could be so much more,"Venice Beach could be Awsum but the homeless/ drugged or mental health issues are everywhere. The smell in places is really bad. Walking there in the day was bad, I definitely wouldn’t go there at night. I can’t believe the price that people pay to have a home there to look at this. Seriously use some of the tourism money to support these people, it’s not right in this day and age for people to live like this!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracey30B
40,Really tranquil and nice vibe,"I went on a Sunday morning around 9am and it was perfect. I took a walk towards the shops and there were a few guys touting their wares but still felt pretty safe. Shops were overpriced though, as everything else in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hypnogal
50,Muscle beach,Great place to visit. Crazy people walking around lots of tourists and oddballs. Lots of shops to visit The original world gym where Arnold used to train.Good hotel next door w bar and Restau on roof. Lots of fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/endosimon
40,Venice beach,"The walk from Santa Monica pier to the bustling Venice beach California is a must, it’s 2 miles approximately and very enjoyable (or you can grab a peddle car) From muscle beach, the buskers to the food and drink it’s is an amazing place with so many different people... a must see when in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcox1975
10,Horrible beach scene,"We made a special trip over to Venice, as it is such a famous place, but really wasn't worth it. The canals look nice and make a good photo, but that is it!The seafront at Venice is full of homeless and drugs are clearly being done on the street as you can smell it talking around. This is the only place we felt a bit uncomfortable the entire holiday.There are some shops and bars/restaurants along the front, but nothing special and all quite pricey. I think you can enjoy the California coastline in much more salubrious surroundings almost anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisj92
10,Filled with homeless and stench of weed filled the air,"We walked from Santa Monica pier and we had to be more alert as we approached Venice Beach. The right side of the pathway was filled with countless homeless and there was constant stench of weed in the air. After the sun set, we had to hurry to Uber back hotel as the souvenir stores start to close and the place turned into another atmosphere. If not for Venice Canals, we wouldn’t go to this place at all. I couldn’t take much photos because we felt unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salseralovesg
40,Venice is a cultural experience,"I lived in Venice for many years. Recently I took my kids for a bike ride on the bike path. They love to watch the skaters & roller bladers at the skate park. Marajuana wafts through the air near any 'medical' shop...be prepared to answer questions. there are dozens of shops to buy t-shirts and trinkets, plenty of outdoor acts and more homeless people than you've probably ever seen in one spot (unless you've been to skid row in downtown LA). I do love Venice, it's a colorful place and quite a cross-section of southern california life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OakSpringFarm
20,Cheap and nasty,If you rate the beach by itself it gets a 5. Nice sand and the beach looks good. Unfortunately to get to the beach you may have to walk past the dreadful souvenir or tee shirt shops and dilapidated buildings which stretch for quite a distance along the main walkway. In addition there are multiple unfortunate homeless folk with their scattered possessions and the unmistakable smell of urine.This may have been a very different tourist attraction in the past but today you would only come once to experience the place or perhaps return to eat in the excellent Sidewalk Cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT652
50,Jump on a scooter and ride up and down the beach!,Despite there being more and more homeless people and addicts in and around the beach it’s still a cool place to visit. Jump on a scooter or bicycle and ride up and down the coast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrDalvin
50,A great slice of California,Perfect spot for a short trip to soak up what it is to be in California. Venice has Abbott Kinney Blvd which is perfect for wandering down and sampling LA coffee. Desserts and fashion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahe981

40,Nice Beach,Visited here on a Friday morning before heading to LAX. The beach is nice but there were an abundance of homeless people hanging out near the pier. Got to see a lot of surfers while there. Santa Monica beach is a lot nicer but Venice Beach is worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DouglasH779
40,Entertaining,Funny place to walk around and experience. Lots of street performers and stalls alongside all the eateries and shops. The beach itself is nice and well facilitated with plenty of space to sit and have a picnic. Clear paths to walk of bike your way along.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elaineGbarnes
40,Chill place to forget about the outside world,"Sitting on the sand or by the bike path is extremely relaxing. Away from all the LA noise. As the sun set, you see plenty of local. I love that Venice Beach is a good spot to relax away from the noise of traffic and all the cars. Parking is available too if you're an out of towner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadiaLikesToExplore
40,Famous Venice Beach!,"Before going to LA we were planning to go two places the most. Venice and Santa Monica. I guess Santa Monica was way better than Venice Beach, but both has their own vibes.

40,Nice beach,"The area from the boardwalk to the water is nice. It was mostly clean the days we were there.

Overall, an ok Beach to visit for a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bashfulliz
30,Meh..,"Visited in oct 2018, walked down from santa monica peir. About 20-30min walk. The area itself is rough, in my eyes nothing special, a lot of husslers and homeless.

30,Not as nice as Santa Monica,"We walked from Santa Monica down to Venice (about 20-25 mins) the walk was nice but once in Venice the atmosphere really changes its much more noisy, hustle and dirtier than Santa Monica which is very beautiful. Cool to see but you’ll want to eat and relax on Santa Monica pier instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessPanoullie
50,Great time. Lots to see,Venice beach is a great place to go to the beach. There are so many things to do see and eat is increible. Lots of vendors of all kinds as you take a walk along the beach walk. Also see many of the locals working out at the beach. Lots of places to eat with different types of foods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnybaca02
50,Enjoy a day at the (Venice) Beach,"Venice Beach is a great place to stroll around and relax. Walk the boardwalk to people watch and observe interesting characters. And there is great beachfront dining. The Sidewalk Cafe is my favorite. Enjoy the sun,the people, and the beach. And there is no cost for this fun day,other than eating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulLA2013
50,As pending a day at Venice beach,"Venice Beach is one of the best sightseeings,among many other places,in Los Angeles .You can spend at least one full day watching events or enjoy swimming in the ocean.Walking along Venice Canal is recommended and put in your schedule not to miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9ig2
40,"Eclectic and ""out there"" vibe","Venice Beach is fun. The vendors who sell trinkets appeal to tourists, similar to the Walk of Fame. Muscle Beach weightlifters, tennis courts, restaurants, bars, the bike and roller blade paths, people watching are all great. Don't try to go on a holiday weekend though, as parking costs get ridiculously jacked up on those weekends. You might consider using Uber or Lyft if you are from out of town rather than fight it, again, like Hollywood Blvd. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peoplehavetherights
20,What a wild place!!,"The area is nice, but unfortunately, there are a lot of medicine shops...and you know what that means and not everyone will show respect. It was really bad!! So if the smell of stink weed bothers you, then it is the wrong place to be. There are also a lot of homeless people and many blessings to them. My daughter asks...why is this a tourist spot. The area does not seem bad, nice beach...but people do have their preferences, and I really can't see anyone bringing children into this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielleD357

50,Sunset and Beach,"Amazing sunset, good music, and spiritful people in Venice Beach. It is good to visit with anyone you want to share those valuable memories. Venice Beach is very big, so even though there are lots of visitors, it is not too much crowded. I went to Venice Beach about five and saw sunsets. Not only the beach is beautiful but also there are lots of stores to visit. It sells lots of souvenirs. It is good to walk along the beach and during summer, you can actually go into the water and swim or do surfing. Also, you can enjoy skateboarding at the side of the beach.Some points you should be aware are: as many visitors visit Venice Beach, some people sell the same price of souveniers way more expensive than usual. Also, you should not stay at the beach night long because some people might ask you for money and buy goods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennychajoohyun

The boardwalk was not my favorite, as it was overrun with homeless people & shops with vulgar language displayed on clothing- not ideal for kids. The Venice canals were awesome & the food was good. Very easy to get around on foot or bike. Took Uber to Santa Monica, Malibu, Hollywood, Beverly Hills. Overall very nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonf992

10,Bit disappointed,We were lucky enough to have been shown this area by a local who told us to keep our wits about us .

There are touts trying to sell all sorts of junk in quite a pushy way. We didn’t feel very comfortable and I can see why people suggest not going there after dark.There are some good parts, such as watching the skateboarding tricks and other performers, but overall it wasn’t for us.

50,Beautiful beach!,"First visit! Was on a tour of Santa Monica Beach and Pier. There are many places to shop and eat along the boardwalk. During this visit, a movie was being made, and I saw where Baywatch was filmed. Beautiful beach for walking, biking, and people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossgool
20,Ups and downs,"We went to the portion of Venice Beach off Washington Ave. Our first impression of the beach was good. The more time we spent there, the more we realized it was not for young children. The first day we visited, the smell of pot was so incredibly strong that we had to move. On our walk back, a pedestrian was hit by a vehicle. It seems that people here think that the faster you drive with people around, the cooler you are. The second day, we saw a man urinating on the sidewalk, fully exposed to the kids. Then when we got to the beach, a man had an overdose on the beach and the lifeguards had to assist. Glutton for punishment, we ventured one more time to the beach. I spotted a terrible rip current and warned the kids not to go near it. 5 minutes later, a group of 5 guys decided it would be cool to swim in it (it was obviously a rip current). We got to see another rescue. There are some near restaurants on Washington. Other than that, I will never return to a California beach after having a very similar experience at Santa Monica Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/804michaelr804
30,Worth it for the photos but overall average,"Venice beach was nice and worth visiting as a tourist. However I didn't feel that safe here and thought it was a bit too ""trendy"" for me (I'm 30!). Probably wouldn't go here again unless visiting LA again with someone who hasn't been before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missmilly_traveller
40,Fun but weird,"Venice Beach is fun and entertaining just because it's so weird and eclectic. If you love people watching, this is the place to do it in L.A. But most of the people who hang out at Venice Beach or live in the area are not truly representative of So Cal residents.Parking is a pain and can be expensive. Watch the meter time if you park on the streets since L.A. parking enforcement is not forgiving and fines can be steep. Put any valuables in the trunk and out of sight when you park. There are a lot of homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
10,If i die and wake up in hell this is what I expect to find,"Venice Beach Boardwalk is both horrible and terrifying, a vision of a society on the point of collapse. On one side shops selling pizza, tat and pornographic underwear. On the other side miles of dirt, clouds of weed and the ill, homeless and stoned living in abject poverty. One is both saddened and angry. My advice would be to avoid it, particularly if you have children.The beach is amazing but again you would need to be careful about where you go. Surely someone has the resource and resolve to sort this area out?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252stewartg

40,Venice anyone?!,"So beautiful, eclectic, vibrant, legendary. Stroll along the boardwalk, stop along the way to enjoy the various street performers.

50,Where the world connects,"I have been to Venice Beach nearly every time fly through LAX, and I recommend it to my friends and clients, a great cross section of Southern California wildlife, muscle builders, tourists, fortune tellers, barkers, roller skaters, bikes and bars, all on the ocean's shore. You can take a bus from close to the airport which is a great way to see the city between the airport and the beach. Good for families, couples, tourists, everybody and anybody. Lots of uninteresting tattoos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baware96
10,"Run Down, Dirty and Sleazy. Not for Kids!","I had not been here in years. What a disappointment. The cute little beach side shops now consist of pot shops and really disgusting underwear shops. The underwear on display have sayings on them that are so inappropriate. They are right on the street so anyone walking by with children can't even avoid them. The street performers are fun but much more aggressive about collecting money than they used to. The smell of pot smoke is everywhere and there are a lot of transients around. So sad to see this delightful, quirky place turn into a dump. If you want to go to a beautiful beach - try Playa Del Rey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrib541

30,An Eclectic part of town...,"You'll love the gorgeous beach front along the Venice Boardwalk, but the smell of ""piss & pot"" can linger inconsistently (no joke :). It's a very transient part of the city and home to most of the ""artistic types"" along the Westside of Los Angeles. The coastal path is great for bike riding via the dedicated Bike Path and walking/strolling along the 1-2 mile boardwalk is certainly great for People Watching. You'll see all types here - ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". Note to the Ladies - stay out of the alleys after sundown, the later it gets the more freaky it becomes. There are some fabulous restaurants up along Abbott Kinney Blvd., which is accessible from the foot of Brooks Ave from the beach. They tend to be pretty pricey considering the ""eclectic nature"" of the neighborhood, but definitely some great eats. It's like the ""Haight Ashbury"" district of LA. Just know what to expect and you'll have a blast :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OGTracyW

20,Touring California Beaches,The smell is horrendous! Homeless people everywhere. Actually living and have made hits on the beach and all around. The stores are junky and seem shady. Peddlers everywhere. Least favorite beach on our California beach list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimDegler
40,Cool place to hang out,"This area stands in such contrast to the rest of Los Angeles and is really laid back. People here are really chilled and dressed only in bikinis or shorts.

40,Beach For Young People,This beach is fun with lots of activities. I love the boardwalk. The only bad thing is the young people that flood in at night to smoke and skateboard and smoke some more. I advise leaving before nightfall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katherinejade07
40,Muscle bound,Some of the shine has gone since I first visited here...back in 1973! Still a few six-packs but mostly pedallers and pedlars - selling tacky wares. Sand could be better groomed too. But still an experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanedwin
30,Venice Beach is a unique place,"I finally got to visit the famous Venice Beach October 4th and was somewhat disappointed with the environment. There's way too many homeless people living in tents and folks who ""seemed"" to be on drugs. Outside of this, it's a great place to take a stroll and people watch. There are some very interesting creative types showcasing their talents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhondaInDallas

30,Still some fun left,I was talked into going to Venice beach by my friends. It has been a few years since I last visited this beach. It's definitely seedy and thoroughly touristy yet we still had fun. I felt like I needed hand sanitizer once we left here. It's NOT a clean beach but people flock to it because they've heard so much about it over the years. Watch out for the rental app scooters on the bike path. They're everywhere and many riders are busier looking at their phones than watching what's in front of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity

50,Must See,"Venice is a quintessential Los Angeles destination.

20,Dirty/Disappointed,"I have visited Venice Beach a few times in years past & it has never left such a negative impression on me. I was surprised with the amount of garbage laying on the ground. The odor was overwhelming & disgusting. I'm not sure if it was a result of the vendors/homeless (?) on the boardwalk. That brings up another issue, the amount of homeless individuals. I hope the city can do something to support the individuals in getting on their feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KtGirl1
40,Still a great place to people watch,I visited the beach this morning at about 10 which is right when everyone is setting up. The area is not yet crowded and walking is still easy. By about 12 the place was starting to come alive. I really like the earlier part. There are quite a few homeless but they never bothered me at all. There were a few people trying to hand me CDs but that was only a short area. The walk is a little long but I made it. The big thing now is electric scooters which are everywhere but the bikes and scooters have a separate path they are supposed to stay on. Still a great place to watch surfers and if you desire they offer lessons. If you i LA you have to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoTraveler2go

40,No holds bared beach!,"Unlike most beach destinations, Venice Beach is a no holds bared kind of place. Nothing here is sanitized, it's gritty, gorgeous, very large, and is the best place on earth for people watching.It attracts a lot of interesting ""characters"" as I would say. Yes there are lots of homeless, and with that comes the pungent smells that are rampant mostly off the boardwalk once you get off it. I would not suggest you walk around here in barefoot even though it is a beach. Stroll down the boardwalk, enjoy volleyball, street vendors, random musicians, as much patchouli and herbs as you want.The street performers are entertaining to a degree, some are better than others. There's T shirt traps, over priced places to eat, but stroll a block or 2 even further and great to good food is easily had.Art is everywhere, the place explodes in vibrant color in great sunshine, adding much color to the already existing colorful characters that you will run into. Volleyball, cycling, a killer skate park with little tykes doing things real impressively, crashing waves over large rocks. It's got a lot to enjoy.Absolutely best people watching spot on the planet.This is not a sanitized place, if anything it's genuine, it's real and authentic and creates a great amount of character for the area you wont find anywhere else. The beach is also just wonderful for some sun, and all things considered, it is VERY clean considering it's surroundings.Better during the sun than the night I would say too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VADCMDtonian
50,Boardwalk!,Venice beach is famous for its boardwalk. You can rent a bicycle or walk to the beach. The view is spectacular. There are fast food restaurants around. The area is usually crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coolapara
10,Bring disinfectant wipes,"Unfortunately the peace loving surfer culture at Venice Beach is a thing of the past. The boardwalk is now populated with an assortment of crack addicts and homeless. The smell of BO and urine stay with you even after you leave. The shops are mostly overpriced t-shirts and handmade trinkets and food vendors that I don’t think the Health Department has ever visited. The beach itself is nice if you can navigate around the homeless that have camped out, and the people trying to peddle their CDs.Tips:-Tell the people that walk up to you trying to sell you a CD or anything else that you’re a local resident and they will leave you alone.-Go 10 minuets up the road to Santa Monica Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/594stevev
50,Great tips for enjoying Venice Beach,"When most people think about visiting Venice Beach they think about going to a really cool place that is filled with weirdos. While that's true - there is much more to Venice Beach then watching unusual people on the Board Walk - which alone is weird because the Board Walk is made out of concrete and there are no boards in sight - there is also a magnificent beach. Below are my tips for enjoying the day.Parking - while there is parking areas in and around Venice Beach, I prefer to park on the south end of Santa Monica and then walk down a half mile to the start of the action on Venice Beach.Walking around the happening places on Venice Beach. There are two areas where it appears you can walk - the Board Walk and the bike bath. Big tip - do not walk on the bike path as it's dangerous to walkers as the bike path is filled with zillions of people riding their bikes, skateboarders and people on roller blades.When to go - while it's less crowded to walk or park in Venice Beach on the weekdays, it's not as much fun as there are more ""street performers"" on the weekend and more people set up their little shops on the weekends. If you want the true Venice Beach experience - go on the weekends.What time to arrive and what to do: If all you want to do is walk around and enjoy the real Venice Beach - arrive between 10 and 11 AM - where you can more easily find parking.What to do - start on the north end of the happening area - and you will know it as soon as you get there - and walk south all the way to and past Muscle Beach. Don't be in a hurry - enjoy the street performers - enjoy people playing volleyball on the sand, enjoy the real shops and the temporary ones which young merchants set up on tables.Street Performers - if you want to watch the street performers - and there are lots of good ones - bring dollar bills so that you can reward their efforts with a tip.Dining - or just plain eating - there are plenty of places to go - but if you want good food - walk north towards Santa Monica and you will find great restaurants. Shutters has a really great place for lunch.The Beach - there are no services on the beach but there are nice restrooms near the Board Walk. The ocean is pretty calm but pay attention to the life guards because you don't want to go swimming when there is a rip tide.Safety - while Venice Beach is considered safe, it's best to put your wallet and cell phones in your front pockets because when it gets crowded - you never know if your belongings will be there at the end of the day.If you have time - walk north to Santa Monica and visit their famous pier - as it's really cool.Pictures - take plenty of them to take home to show your family and friends.Enjoy your day in Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardt707
50,Our newfound spiritual home.,"There is something magical about Venice.Yes, there are a lot of homeless people around, theres no escaping that. However, they are not threatening or intrusive and add to the atmosphere of Venice, including local restaurants that come out each night to ensure they have food. That to me, is the spirit of Venice.It is so eclectic and accepting, you get all sorts of characters down the boardwalk. Though you do get a lot of singers/artists who will try and sell you their music and if you entertain them at all you will end up buying their CDs, so just say no and walk by they will leave you alone.The beach itself is beautiful, and brings with it an immense sense of freedom. The smell of cannabis isn't half as frequent as some are making out and it's not in any way repulsive. But as people who enjoy cannabis it is a freedom we very much enjoy.There is a shop on the boardwalk that sells plain hooded tops and t shirts that you can choose a decal to have printed on. These are pretty cool but be warned - nothing has a price on and we ended up spending $120 on 2 without realising what they came to! They are cool but just be aware of the cost before you head into the shop.Overall, VB is well worth the visit, we'd have spent a week there had we have known how much we'd love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKS85

10,Not impressed,Started our beach day at Venice beach before traveling to Santa Monica & Malibu. I was highly disappointed with the atmosphere at Venice Beach. It is definitely not somewhere to take a 6 & 9 year old. Venice was dirty & it smelled & I didn’t feel secure. Please save your time and go elsewhere. Santa Monica & Malibu were amazing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebeasley2018
50,What a freak show this is,"When you go to Venice Beach don't look expensive and don't be caught by people asking where you're from but take in the sights and side shows and you'll have a ball. There's lots to see and do even getting a temporary tatt if that moves you .. not me. The place is such a contrast, it's clearly thriving and packed with locals and visitors but there are tent people and stray bodies on the beach at the other end of the spectrum. Don't miss it, just enjoy it's diversity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reubenm97
20,Wow...was not expecting this...,"During our L.A. vacation we spent a day visiting both Venice Beach and Santa Monica. While we really enjoyed SM, we were left with a very poor image of Venice Beach.We were there mid morning on a weekday ( that could have played a part in this review ). We had heard VB was a real up and coming neighbourhood. What we found was a veritable homeless shelter on the beach and promenade. It was dirty and frankly a little scary.I might be naive to the area but one would think that such prime waterfront/beach area would be a tourist goldmine if kept clean and free of the homeless that far outnumbered the tourists.I know there is a bigger social commentary to talk about here, but I'm just saying if you want the tourist dollars to go elsewhere, just keep doing what you are doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobbert63
40,Eclectic,"You have to visit this place just for the experience.

50,Sunny Day in LA by the Beach,"The beach was awesome ❤️. Love take a walk in the morning & sunset at the Venice beach. Can have picnic for lunch or dinner there too. Have so many restaurant in Venice beach to pick from. Good beach for work out 🏋️‍♀️ outsides, walking, running else 👍👍👍👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueBirdjourney
30,Crazy but an eye opener,"We walked here from Santa monica pier and it was surreal. People selling all kinds of ""art"" and homeless folk in tents etc. A guy playing a grand piano and folk dancing in the street. Just nuts but something you have to see as there is something for everyone in entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaz3004
40,Love it my kind of place,Definitely my kind of place. Very sunny and beautiful day. Lots of Palm trees and lots of interesting people out and about enjoying the day and living. Lots to to see. We spent a day here. One of our favorite parts of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adrimatthews
30,Strolling on Venus Beach,It was different but very expensive the shops. I found the streets kind of dirty if it wasn't for the entertainment would have left earlier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babybubba
10,A real disappointment,"This is a dirty drug ridden beach and full of homeless people, with rubbish, tarps old mattresses etc strewn along the path of the beach front. The public toilets and showers on the beach have soiled underwear and stink of old urine absolutely disgusting. Not safe to take children there I would be very concerned of getting a needle stick injury.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8250YJchristineg
30,Busy and unique,"There are a lot of homeless folks living here. A little scary to walk around, but that’s my opinion, I have friends who don’t care and love the place. A lot of vendors lining the walkways, bikes everywhere, food and drink places too. The beach it’s self is nice, sea is warm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukmattyc
50,DIFFERENT ITEMS,This place is great to see. The stores are different and have unusual fun items. The beach is right there and fun to walk and see the sights as well as free entertainment from the street people. Don't miss,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2912QHjamesp
10,"Dirty, and very transient",I was actually a little scared to walk around in this area and I go everywhere.Public restrooms were atrocious.This is definitely not a place you would want to bring your kids.It was so dirty I would never even dream of eating it any place in this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108beckys
10,Horrible,I use to many things but seeing a homeless people everywhere sleeping in tent with small children its horrible and smoking weed. WTF is wrong with you all.Makes me sick. Dirty and not good place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoffySig73
40,Smell the ocean :D,"Loved the short trip to Venice beach. The wind was a bit rougher as we came later in the day, when the sun was also not so hot. The only thing I didn't like is the boards saying dogs are not alowed on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhabica
50,Such a cool place to visit the counterculture!!,"A very artistic area for the beach, sidewalk performers, skateboarders, music, etc. Some of the shops & restaurants we're like shanties. But, there are nice shops & restaurants. If you walk the entirety, you will arrive at Santa Monica Pier!! Wish we had more time!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebiMemphis
20,I wouldn’t go there again,"Visited Venice thinking it’s one of the best beaches but that was a definite mistake. The quality of the restaurants and shops are crappy, the smell is nasty and nauseating. Sitting on the beach and looking into the distance is nice but you can get that at any other beach to be honest. And you can’t go in the water to swim because of obvious dangers of the ocean water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/743ebrus
40,Lovely beach,Came to visit this beach has my son wanted to see the body builders & the gyms. Nice pleasant walk along the beach & the souvenir shops. Weather was perfect. Some fantastic houses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hitch1971
40,Very special,If you are into alternative arts and living then go to Venice Beach.It is the place for people watching,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TroelsJ61
20,Over rated,"I was very disappointed by Venice beach and the surrounding area. I’ve seen pictures and scenes from TV/Movies and the place looks glamourize, but it is opposite.First off it smells like urine ever where. Secondly, there are a lot of homeless people - something needs to be done about that. Finally, average food in the area and dishes are all dirty.If you go here, rent a bicycle to ride to surrounding areas, bring gloves as most bikes are old and dirty. The pier is a place to visit too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/553sameers
10,Going downhill,I have visited Venice a number of times in my life and I can honestly say that the decline of this place is real. It’s a different area to show the kids but the smell of ‘medical’ cannibas is the air was apparent the whole time we were there.Next time I will avoid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O5948IAstuarth
50,Be an ARTIST in VENICE!,"My friend found on on Airbnb ""Be an ARTIST in VENICE!"" where you could spend 2 hours taking an art class in an apartment on Venice Beach that faced the Pacific Ocean. We were in a class with two other person doing art projects. It was fun and relaxing making a couple of painting type projects that we got to take home with us. A fun way to spend some time at Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochump
20,Beaches of SoCal,Of all the beaches we have seen this one is the least favorite. It’s a very active area but not as nice as some of the other beaches. Tons of little shops on the strand though and a must to see if you’re crossing off a list,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelle5363
30,Problematic Venice,"I’ve been going to Venice since I was a child. I only went to Venice on 9/21/18 bc my friend had never been to CA and Venice was on her bucket list. Insert eye roll!!!You have to pay for parking. We found a lot that was $10 for 3hrs. I wanted to be in an open, security monitored lot being that our luggage was still in the rental car.Venice is not what it used to be. It is NOT family-friendly. It was very crowded for a Friday at 11am. There are so many street vendors and a lot of shops for “made in China” souvenirs. There are also a lot of restaurants. Now that marijuana is legal in CA, I smelled it at Venice with every step that I took. It was a very strong smell and it did not dissipate at all, even when we went close to the water. Because of the overwhelming smell of marijuana, we did not get to take in a lot of the beautiful artwork by the street vendors. There are a lot of panhandlers and if you’re not smelling marijuana, you will be smelling bodily fluids. Eeeewwwwww!!!We saw a lot of graphic, inappropriate souvenirs, t-shirts, and people who were dressed in R rated clothing. My friend was ready to go within an hour, which was fine by me.I can honestly say, I will never go back. I liken Venice to the French Quarters in NOLA. It’s not family friendly so please do not take your kids, especially if they can read because they will be asking you the meaning of all of the graphic t-shirts and souvenirs. Insert eye roll!!!The picture I uploaded is the only one I could find in my camera roll from Venice that is appropriate for Trip Advisor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmJoans
50,Merrymaking by the Beach,"What a great beach with its wide swath of sand and expanse of ocean alongside all the marvelous, silly and crazy Venice local antics as well as art, tchotchkes and some typical beach gear...a very fun, interesting scene to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
20,Don’t bother!,Great beach is all I can say. Would not want to stay here. Was so looking forward to visiting here but so disappointed. Huge amount of homeless begging for money. You can smell cannabis everywhere. Drive a further 3 miles down road to Santa Monica so much nicer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynep387
10,Beyond terrible,"I've been to a number of beautiful beaches but never the famous Venice Beach. I went and will never go back. It is dirty, rampant open air drug use of all kinds going on, homeless camps all over filled with drug users, mentally ill and those down and out. Buildings in the area are boarded up and empty. Very few options to eat and grab a drink. The public restrooms have been taken over by the homeless so they aren't even accessible unless you are willing to fight someone. Paid 20 bucks to park and left in about 30 minutes. Nothing but tshirts and drugs for salem Not a police officer to be seen. At times I didn't feel safe and I've lived in major cities. I have pretty good sense of places to avoid and this is surely one of them. Santa Monica is about 2 miles away and very clean, safe and a world of difference. I do hope improvement efforts are made to the area but until then avoid Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaunP372
10,Ghetto by the beach,"Get me out of here as quickly as possible. My kids didn’t feel safe which made me feel as though I should be aware of pending danger. Turns out someone got clobbered in the head with a baseball bat just hours earlier, so this might explain our uneasy feeling.We got away from the drug addicts and homeless people to Santa Monica which is ok. Don’t waste your time here, go to the tar pits and farmers markets instead, you’ll have a more enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinmN4230ZE
10,Very disappointing,"You hear about this place all over the world and I was looking forward to visiting. We paid 10$ to park right next to the beach for all day . The parking was the best bit ! The walkway is full of homeless people who seem to camp all along the front, very sad to see. The shops on the front are worse looking than in Blackpool. I certainly wouldn’t visit in the evening and won’t be visiting again such a shame! 😓",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shifty8934
10,Sad,"I lived near Venice beach over 20 years ago. It was always eclectic, artistic and rough around the edges.. Always a great place to wander, eat and drink. I always took out of town visitors to visit. On seeing it today it was very sad.. All the stalls full of tat, eateries that have been there for years looked tired. You used to sit with a view to the ocean, now its homeless townships. The whole area looked grubby. Worst were the homeless people who seem to have taken over there. It's very sad. Can't see it improving soon.I used to have nostalgic memories of Venice Beach, now I wouldnt care if I never returned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295tillym
40,Lively beach,"was a lively place to visit with more younger people, lots of eating places and shops. Beach was lovely and very entertaining place, would definitely recommend visiting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjitS454
40,Sister's trip,I saw views of venice beach in the brunch cruise I attended. Venice beach was very beautiful and had nice scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharnise006
10,Disappointing,"My wife and I went there last week and was totally disappointed. The beach is full of homeless people who pile their trash all over the beach and park benches.After a long drive there to visit the area, my wife had to use the public restrooms which ended up being a horrible place to have to go. The restrooms were shelters for the homeless, looked liked they had never been cleaned and as we are standing there, a homeless lady hikes her leg up into the sink where you wash your hands so she could wash her lady parts and didn't care what she was showing to the world. All in all this place isn't what is probably use to be and needs a major overhaul to be the tourist attraction it once was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codys241
30,Toddler and teen,Parking: about 2 blocks away there are parkings for 1 dlls per hour. Careful it doesn’t give change. Don’t park trunk first you can get a ticket.To see: the canals and beautiful houses.The beach was clean and my baby loved it. There was a kids park very cool.Food: nah!What to see? Lots of artists. Lots and lots of homeless and free marihuana. Everyone smoking it. So not to much kids friendly. I will not return to take a walk maybe to the beach. There are cool murals for pics. The beach is nice but cold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroToFlo4
10,Disappointing,"Always wanted to see Venice Beach. My GF and I went there last week. It was dirty, full of homeless people who pile their belongings on the beach and other areas. We didn't even stop to get something to eat as most of the places didn't look very clean. Lots of tee shirt shops and panhandlers looking for handouts. Quite simply, it's a ghetto by the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnP268
30,Nice vibe in the day...,"But early morning and throughout you get a really good picture of homelessness in LA. Surprising as Santa Monica is 10min walk up and is quite clean, still, if you’re a skate buff it’s a place to come see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vladivanovic
40,Comfortable for beach activities,"It's a convenient location if you want to go for a beach. A relaxing beach with reasonable parking fee, but the bathroom is not so clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huichenk2016

50,The. Bomb.,"For some reason, I fell in love here! I love skate culture, always have. I'm terribly sad that I did not get to see Venice Beach when Todd Ray had his Freakshow here, that would have been one of my dreams come true! So that was pretty disappointing. But there was a silent disco, ice cream and crappy macarons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4904VQkatiew
20,Hold onto your valuables,"Venice Beach was full of... oddballs. Quite a high homeless population, lots of very eccentric art stalls. Most of the shops on the beachfront were tattoo parlours and tshirt shops, not many places to eat. The beach is beautiful but the street front was not the nicest place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganstericker
30,Nice California beach,If you just hang out on the beach - enjoy the ocean - this is a really nice place. Walking the boardwalk is not very nice. Homelessness people and very dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Altius10
40,Lovely but littering is out of control,Lovely holiday earlier this year however felt the need to write this review after finally getting round to it - believe that this could be a better place could it be looked after a bit more by tourists.Litter everywhere!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kensington43
10,Another California beach filled with homeless people,"Time to clean up this area, it’s dangerous and filthy. Get some help for the mentally ill that live there in their boxes and other bizarre shelters. I took a group of friends here and wish I hadn’t.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie1fan
30,It's an iconic area.... But it's seedy,Not great for young families.... Gets very seedy the further south you head.Santa Monica is nice and we'll worth the effort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818andrewj
40,NICE BEACHBY PUBLIC TRANSPORT,"We were in Los Angeles and planned to see Venice Beach. We used Expo line Metro to come to culver city terminus. After that we came out to catch 33 bus to Venice Beach. It took 1.25hrs to reach the stop Sunset from Hollywood.Venice beach was 15 mins walking from the Sunst bustop and we reached there about 10am. The sea was very rough and big waves were coming at that time. Only a handful of people were there and thus we enjoyed the sea for quite some time. The sand was fine and soft. I tried to swim in the sea but it seemed dangerous and thus abstained from it.On the return, we used another bus for going to Santa Monica beach which was not far away and took 30 mins or so to reach there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DPMALLIC
30,Beautiful beach,"The Venice beach area has some beautiful coastal beaches and nice stores and restaurants. Lots to see and do in the Venice area. The Venice beach walk is fairly seedy and sorry to say, but not the best quality of people on the strip. Between the smoke shops and trash, it definitely does not represent the best of Venice. Stay on the main strip or take a bike ride along the beach and you'll enjoy Venice. Better yet, go up to Santa Monica where it is much cleaner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcorbin560
30,Beautiful sightseeing,"Cannot be described, has to be seen. The view of the ocean is spectacular. Some people are using their skateboards, some people are skating. The beach is quite clean and there are many shops for those who want to shop. The only negative point is the outrageous number of homeless people asking for money or food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gincar2016
50,Awesome views!,This place was amazing. Got to ride the electric scooters to get around the beach quicker and just enjoy the atmosphere there. It was a whole gym outside with a bunch of weights for those who wana show off their strength. Got to watch a bunch of people there play basketball as well as check out there little stores they had around there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_basementboy
10,Grungy Smelly Weed and Urine Bath,"Venice is one of the most overrated trash heaps on Southern California. Having lived in LA county for over 25 years I can only say this is a place to avoid. It consists of a Boardwalk and some overpriced t shirt shops. Various degrees of clothed and unclothed homeless street performers (most of which are high on meth or weed) will accost you for money. In addition, if you are female be prepared to be leered at. This place smells like weed and really is only suitable for potheads and nightcrawlers. I've visited a few times with out of state visitors who I warned that the area is nasty, and invariably they agree. On one occasion I saw an adult man face the boardwalk drop his pants until he was nude and pee on himself like a sad zoo animal. Avoid at all costs. Go visit Long Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd
10,Don't even try to convince yourself that what you are seeing is right,"Yes- this review is harsh. I'll preface my review- I'm not a yokel country girl. I realize what comes with crowds and big city living. SO What used to be a cool, eclectic and artsy kind of area has turned into the worse of california beaches. The perpectual smell of pot in the area, the number of people shooting drugs in public view and what seems to be an unreal amount of runaways begging for money has pushed this beach down to my rating- ""AVOID"". It's not worth it. The beach is beautiful but what you have to walk through to get to the beach is eye opening. And after seeing a bunch of teenagers (yes shooting up) you have to wonder if the beach itself is all that safe. Muscle beach is a ragtag collection of rusty old equipment sitting in the sun. The shops were all the same- over and over and over again. If you go- get out of there before the sun goes completely down- it changes over completely. Frankly- don't go. Go to a different beach for the california experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinkykitty
30,Always Unique,Probably the best way to describe Venice Beach is “eclectic”. Want to express yourself? Go there. Want to buy souvenirs? Go there. Want to see the iconic Muscle Beach? Go there. Want to visit Dr. Green? Go there. It’s pretty much all amount of tastelessness you could ask for! 🙌🏼,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854billk
40,Interesting and Lively,what an iconic place - absolutely buzzing with people. The public loos left a lot to be desired but the beach itself is clean and vast and served by lifeguards. Some interesting shops and attractions nearby and plenty of places to eat. A short stop as part of our LA City tour but well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyNottag
20,Nothing much to see,Homeless people everywhere due to the all year round hot weather. Nothing to see really. Much nicer beaches further north of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrysean
40,Good Beach,I went on a day that was a bit cloudy and cold but it was still nice. It is definitely a must go to when you come to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttill243
50,Highly recommend a stop here!,"I’d read a lot about people watching & it’s all true!We parked two blocks away from the beach ($20 all day). We got there early so nothing on the boardwalk was open yet but a cafe was so we had breakfast & watched the locals & large volume of homeless start going about their day.We then walked to Muscle Beach to take some vanity shots (everybody with muscles does it). Walked on past volleyball nets, cafes to Santa Monica Pier & back via the famous Golds Gym (a few blocks back). Bikes & scooters for hire.Boardwalk is an array of souvenir shops really but buskers & eccentric locals are very entertaining.Public restrooms are hit & miss due to the large homeless population but no one bothers you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivLetLiv2012
40,Summer holiday trip,"The beach was clean but public restrooms was very poor and not so many. We found only one place where we were able to buy towels so remember take your own with you. I also hope that there would be more services at the beach, for example small kiosk where you could buy some refreshment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hennakin
50,Beautiful Beach,"My family and I visited the last week in August which was perfect timing. The Beach was less crowded. We parked near the free Pier, however parking did cost $9. The water was a little chilly at 1st, but after a few seconds it felt great. The Beach is clean & beautiful with clear waters. Can't wait to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderLust23434
30,Expensive,Very busy and very expensive. The beach is lovely though and I thought it was quite quaint. Parking is expensive though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliew868

50,Love Love Love,"What can I say Venice Beach is beautiful large beach area so you’re not sitting on top of anybody lots of room on beach and a hop skip and a jump to restaurants, shops & restrooms.A must to go and spend the day if you are in the Los Angeles area.(or in my case - went back later in the week too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cswiston
40,Nice place to hang out even in hot summers during summer,"Great place to walk around, cycle around or even use your skateboards in the sidewalks.Only negative is there are lot of smoky spell and will be bad in some places if you dont vape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pratikfarmers
40,cool cibe,"Very cool place, full of interesting people however watch out when it gets dark as it can get quite rough. Lots of homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marts0424
10,More than disappointing,"It has been twenty years since I visited Venice beach and I was looking forward to showing my children. What a disappointment, it was 50% homeless and the shops and walkways filthy, quite upsetting really.The golden beach was still beautiful but you would be to frightened to get there.The only highlight was the skate park which had several great boarder's doing amazing tricksSadly we won't be back and I suggest anyone thinking of going to head to Huntington Beach or Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveles07
20,tacky and run down major disappointment,"Have not been back here for many years, and to be honest wish we had not. All things change but what was in my recollection a unique colourful quirky eclectic place now just seemed tawdry and edgy, and this was only early afternoon. Our 8 yr old granddaughter wanted to leave almost as soon as we were parked up. Shame, sometimes you should not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripeagle
50,Great beach,"Venice Beach is Great! Even on busy sunny Labor Day weekend it was not too crowded. Parking is a pain but we used bikes and Birds to get to the beach. Some crazy people at ocean walk but no stress, noise or violence. We enjoyed our time here and will definitely come back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristoferER
40,Great Place to Sightsee,"Unless you've visited Venice Beach, you can't describe it. The sights and sounds on the boardwalk are definitely worth a casual stroll. I enjoyed watching the skaters in the skate park, and was amazed at the various level of skills shown by the skaters. We walked back to our car along the scenic bike path. Needless to say, Venice Beach includes great ocean views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurer1234
10,Would never go here again!!,I was very surprised at just how run down and dirty this place is!! Homeless people and aggressive sellers make it a horrible place! Would definitely avoid this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjofcov
10,"OK during the day, but a bit hairy at night","Enjoyed Venice Beach for what it is, A boardwalk of shops and bars with a great beach and a nice walk. Yet even at 11am the amount of homeless people and those off their head on drugs is a disturbing site. Personally I wouldn't want to be there after 5pm hence the 1 star. This is representative of a bigger social problem in the US I know. Worth visiting the canals and attractive houses less than 10 minutes walk from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phileasfoggtmc
50,Once of the largest public beaches in the world,"This is a picturesque beach and is totally safe, with regard to your person.I'd still be careful of your belongings, however.Plenty of lifeguard stands along the way.So much real estate that it is never crowded, no matter how many people are there.THINGS TO ENJOY: The local boardwalk, naps, hotels & restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4288XBdavep
30,Beach life,Beach is clean and there are many vendors and shops to choose from. The only negative was the enourmus amount of home less people. Some areas smelled like urine and several people hit ne up for Money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthapM8364QB
50,Beautiful dayout,"Lovely walk on the promenade. Lots of cafes and shops. Performers too along the way, I was lucky with the weather. Broadwalk in the sun and people are friendly. Skate park and Muscle gym were some spots to watch. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joey85244
20,Smoggy,"I actually did not like the Venice Beach too much at the time of our visit. We were there for less than an hour, and we might linger longer if it were not for the bad air, smog or some other form of pollution evident. Othervwise it might be nice: there were people jogging, cycling, walking along the beach, but they might be used to this kind of pollution. We just came from a long trip visiting national parks of USA and Canada and this was a shock to our cleansed lungs, lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421ulat
40,Some pretty good street performers!,"Souvenir/beach shops, street vendors, street performers and an overall collection of interesting individuals. By no means calm – a lot to see and hear. The street performers are actually quite good. We stopped to watch a group of dance performers near one end of Venice Beach who were as funny as they were talented. I think I laughed through most of their performance, when I wasn’t in awe of the flips and dance moves. Bring cash for tipping! Then on to muscle beach to see, well, the muscles! You can also watch some basketball and tennis racket games. The beach itself is very long and wide and so you can just go to the beach and avoid the ‘Venice Beach’ craziness…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
50,Summer in LA!,A lovely beach. Food stalls and clothing along the promenade are really an atmosphere of freedom. Expensive parking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/759oferm

40,Truly a place after my own heart,"I stayed in Venice in August 2018 and spent a lot of time at Venice Beach as I love being by the ocean. I absolutely loved it here and it will stay with me for a long time.The views out across the Pacific are stunning, it's lovely just to walk along the sand or paddle at the edge of the ocean. There are interesting shells at some times of the day by the shoreline.It's a very busy beach though plenty of space for people to spread out so I was able to sit quietly and read a book which is something I love to do.I also enjoyed walking out on the pier. There is not really anything on the pier at Venice Beach but the views are fantastic and I enjoyed sitting up there watching the surfers.Many surfers and swimmers use the beach and there are plenty of lifeguards.There are many facilities and amenities close by. The only reason I have given four stars instead of five is that the toilet facilities, even though there are facilities at good intervals all the way down the expansive beach, are often overcrowded and less than hygienic. However there are many places where this is the case by the sea. I like the fact that many of these bathroom buildings are decorated with interesting and inspirational quotes and they have clearly tried to make them nice but the amount of visitors overwhelms the facilities at times.There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in easy reach and a large car park close to the pier.One of the nicest things is the fact that you can walk or cycle the whole way between Venice Beach and Santa Monica beach, which is a lovely thing to do, and I did do that walk on my first day in Los Angeles. There are plenty of cycle hire places if you prefer.There is also the famous ""Muscle Beach"" where there is outdoor gym equipment and also small but lovely play areas for children.It is an absolute sun-trap and you do need to be careful especially if you're not used to the California sun, ie drinking plenty of water, covering up, using sun-screen, going indoors into the shops or cafes to get some shade. The bottom half of my legs got extremely burnt one day just sitting on the beach that bit too long wearing three quarter length leggings!I really loved the feel of the place which is hard to capture in words, and it captured my heart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyvalkyrie22
10,Dirty,"The Venice scene is filthy with homeless, feces and crime. Not worth the visit. Go to a place with better conditions....like Florida.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandydogsdad
40,Love it here!!,"We visited here for the day at the end of July 2018. It was busy, hot, there was a basketball tournament on, there were queues for the public toilets, parking was tricky (and a little on the expensive side) but the atmosphere was great!We had some food from one of the food trucks that were by the beach - plenty of options to choose from and all reasonably priced. We sat on the grass and had it picnic style.The skateboard park was a revelation! Men, women and children of all ages, showing off their skate boarding skills! I was in awe! I could have stood there all day watching them!The basketball tournament made the place quite busy but it added a nice vibe to the day and the atmosphere of the place. Muscle Beach was funny! Full of show offs pumping iron, doing handstands, posing for photos with tourists, but it was all good fun.The beach is huge, so there was no problem getting somewhere to sit and sunbathe. It was clean and there lifeguards on duty the whole time which was reassuring. The sea wasn’t as warm as I expected it to be, but it was nice enough to have a little paddle - there were people much braver than me swimming out quite far.The town was lovely too, and we called in at a local bar for some drinks which were good. I would definitely return to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3269CEsarahb
30,OK not Great,"Huge sandy beach.There are many vendors at the beaches edge selling the usual tourist items, art, henna tattoo's etc.Cool boardwalk and skate park.Muscle Beach was disappointing - not sure what we expected but it's a lot smaller than imagined.The whole area seems worn and tired, maybe it's intentional but we didn't get a good vibe :o(Its definitely something to say you've done but not somewhere to be rushing back to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAL69
40,Cool beach near LA!,Went to check out this beach for an hour as part of organized LA highlight trip. Many shops that sell t-shirts and souvenirs. The beach and sand looked clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asiana747
40,Well worth the long walk,"Before leaving for the north via Highway 1, we had to stop there and dip our feet in the ocean, then walk along the path towards the marina. Long walk (especially on a hot summer day) but fun and original. Would definitely recommend. Had great hot dog and espresso on the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erictabet
30,Be aware,"Very interesting we thought because of all of the clothes stalls it was like Camden in London but with a beach. Quite a few homeless people on the beach and beware we were accosted by a group of 4 Jamaican men that were very friendly but tried to sell music CD's very forceful and intimidating.This happened twice, clearly targeting tourists as we were taking photos. It was still safe but preferred the other end with the Oier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3610DQdeborahs

30,Very commercialized,First visit here.. Legendary as the place is from reputation and movies.. It is very taken over with illegal vendors and homeless.. Was not as clean on the boardwalk as it could be.. Beach was gorgeous for relaxing and swimming but the boardwalk is to touristy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5533HZchristophers
10,Dont go here!!,"My wife and i flew into LA and decided to stay 2 nights of our holiday near the beach.We booked 5 rose avenue room 17 which had a great sea view.It also had a massive homeless community which was far less attractive.I know I should be ashamed of this but if you travel half way round the world on a holiday I don't want to see spaced out junkies every 5 yardsI found the place uncomfortable and to be honest a tad threatingBelieve it or not it was also expensive.Sorry to all the business on the beach but this place is a s.... hole and should be avoided,especially if you have kids ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H2178DSpauls
50,One of a kind,Loved our trip to Venice. Completely one of a kind. Lots going in and loads of character. Never been to a beach where there are more people on the boardwalk than in the water. The beach itself is beautiful and clean. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robwoolford

40,Shangri La USA,"Timeless and eclectic. This is what i feel the Woodstock era was like with today's twists. Great people all around from the affluent to the homeless. Great vibes and so much to take in from an atmospheric standpoint. From the pier at Washington all the way up to Santa Monica it is sensory euphoria. So much to see and so much to do in such a small geographical footprint. There is no reference for you, you just have to let go and explore for yourself. Free your mind and just be for a while. Only reason there are only 4 stars is the level of homelessness in Venice. There has to be a solution. We can #bebest I think",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erickR6932VV

10,THIS PLACE IS SO GROSS!!,"Unfortunately my short time there wasn’t pleasurable. There are homeless people laying all over, trash scattered around the boardwalk, and alcoholics and drug addicts yelling and screaming everywhere.

30,Just one of the iconic LA-places,"Venice Beach is one of the typical iconic LA places to stroll the promenade, the beach, the skateboard park, steet artists and of course ‘ muscle beach’. Nothing special, just fun and part of the LA-experience. The boulevard is lined with tourist shops. When we were there, they were folming shots for a TV-series. Tip on parking your car: try the parking at the beach itself - that one is only 9,50 USD, while parkings in the neighborhood charge you up to 15 USD.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelHalma

50,Skateboard fun at Venice Beach,"It was a really hot day and the beach was packed. Enjoyed watching a variety of skate boarders riding in the bowl. A real Mix of ages, some in their fourties and a few young ones. A mix of talent too. A fun day out walking past all the shops, buskers and side walk artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judijelly
30,Go to say you go but there are nicer beachws,"Go for the hype of being able to say you have gone but overall, I found the beach and surrounding area relatively dirty. Don’t think I would waste my time in the future. There’s good people watching but that itself is kind of depressing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454christinac
50,Interesting - a must see,Always heard of Venice beach.. a site to see. A little run down but seeing the stereotypical older beach bums (if I can say that without offending) doing their skateboarding or artsy stuff was cool. A really laid back/kicked back atmosphere. Excellent for a stroll...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eurootto

50,Crazy Boardwalk/ Beautiful Canals,"Great fun but mad - really busy, people, stores, muscle men, walkers, electric scooters, protesters and the usual hawkers if CDs! Leave the front and head back to the calm of the beautiful canals - so quaint and picturesque- little bridges and lovely gardens to be nosey about( in a nice way of course!)The beach itself is huge - wide with loads of waves - free to use but $ 18 per day for parking. We had no problem getting a space even at midday on a Sunday.Loads of junk to eat but The Cows End has great smoothies juices and great food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhJ1878CC

30,What a beech,"Beech is amazing, spend a fair bit of time having a walk along the beech stop off for a drink or a snack there's places to choose from. people watching as you see some weird and crazy sights. Busy place with the odd person being rude but you can get people like that anywhere. homeless people are everywhere so be warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PexyScotland

20,Not my “cup of tea”,"This may be a great place is you are looking for a beach experience that includes mobs of people, obscene T-shirt stores, smoking weed, and junk food. Even my 19-year old son was uncomfortable. We only hit the Boardwalk area, as we were traveling through on our way to LA from Hermosa Beach, and the beach was HUGE and looked beautiful. However, one hour was enough for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcyBliss
30,Grungy and crowded,"We tried to ride bikes here and it was challenging! The bikes we rented had seen better days and the brakes didn't work. Anyway, the bike ride from Venice to Santa Monica on the bike path was colorful - people from all over the world, bohemians, druggies, sporty types, wannabe stars, and tourists jostled for space. The shops look tired and the restaurants along the strip are divey. The homeless have pitched camps along the way as well. Guess its worth a visit, after all those Hollywood movie scenes on this beach?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Been2Bagan
30,Average,"The same huge, sandy beach as santa monica. But there are too many homeless people, junkies around in the boardwalk. I did not feel safe when i walked. Beach is nice to spend time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803melisaf

40,Good Half Day or Day Trip,"The benefit of going to Venice Beach, apart from it being a beautiful beach, is the opportunity to easily explore and see the famous Muscle Beach, Gold Gym and Santa Monica Pier. I'd recommend exploring via a Bird/Lime scooter, bike or skateboard/skates along the path running along the beach and turning off for the bits you're interested in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterpX1946JR
50,Must see,"Your heard about it, you saw it on tv and in the movies. You need to see it at least once. The skateboarders, the bodybuilders, the tourists, the weird people all mixed together in this unique neighborhood. It's not the most beautiful place but it's one of these places you never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/check_in777
30,Good vibes,"Nice beach to stay during the day. Good vibes, great music. Cold water 😂 A lot of hostels near beach. Just found a little difficult to find a restaurant, but it depends the type of food do you want (in my case, i can’t eat dairy).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamaestri
30,Stroll on the Boardwalk,"When in LA a visit at Venice beach is amust with a quick stop at Muscle Beach where the equipment in the famous outdoor gym has really aged and not been replaced since my last visit. Other sports grounds include the skateboard park, the basket ball court and many mini tennis courts that we discovered for the first time. Tens of shopping options both on shops on the right displaying Venice beach tees and souvenirs and stands on the left by local artisans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500alexandrek
20,Maybe just not after dusk,"Started on a walk along the beach from Santa Monica at dusk and maybe should have turned around before getting to Venice Beach.

Perhaps 1 If you do not like very much bikes.Buildings are often good, often old, often with many graffities; or even simply ugly . Decoration reminds hippie times. Sometimes graffities are pure and good art. It,s worth; but be prepared to see tons of poverty also.

30,Honky tonk beach turned tourist trap,"What a disappointment. Visited 10 years ago—was a mix of artists and rollerbladers. This trip was just lots of tourists and vendors trying to sell them junk.

50,Great for people watching,"Parked near Santa Monica pier and hired bikes. Cycled the track to Venice and had so much fun people watching and seeing LA beach life. We arrived early (9am) and were pleased we did as it was very hot when we finished our bike ride at 10.30am. So glad we did this bike ride, especially as a sporty family.

50,AMAZING BUT CROWDED!,"The pier at Venice Beach lives up to the hype- it is an experience that will not disappoint- as long as you don't mind crowds ( especially on weekends!) And some unusual characters ( such as protesters with microphones) . There is an Amusement Park, several Restaurants, and plenty of fresh air. Venice Beach is an amazing place to people watch. There is plenty to do and a beautiful place to soend a day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynp200
50,Love the people watching there .,"Not just people watching... great bike path, lots of food options, best drinks and view at the Irwin roof top bar, expensive but worth at least one cocktail- great place for out of town guests.

So much fun to walk the boardwalk.A real taste of So Cal beach scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666verab
30,A freak show by the ocean + grime and crime,"If you must go to see Venice Beach, suggest combining it with a visit to Santa Monica or then head south to Manhattan Beach, Hermosa or other more pleasant beach cities.Venice Beach is a freak show - if you like people juggling chain saws, people painting shells for sale, cheap sunglass vendors, fortune tellers, beggars hitting you up for money, runaway teens, drug addicts doing deals in the parking lots, and some so brazen this on the boardwalk and bathrooms, then have a great time.Everytime I drop visitors off, I give them my cell phone and tell them to call when they've had enough of it. 30 minutes is the longest anyone has ever lasted.Keep your personal belongings to a minimum - don't take if if you can't afford to lose it - and keep your possessions in hand. People seek opportunities to separate items from beachgoers to use or to sell for cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highlandbride
50,A must for the out of towner,"A walk along the Venice boardwalk is great especially on a weekend day. It's a place to walk, shop, watch entertainment, eat, visit ""muscle beach"", and see the many wierdos of LA along the way. Instead of walking one can also rent a scooter, bicycle, or skates. I live in LA area and have visited Venice many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herb_Silverman
50,Venice Beach,"This is a must see for travelers visiting the LA area. They have some pretty decent fast food especially Big Daddys. Lots of great bars too. Be sure to check out the skate park which is a local hang. After people watching; lots of homeless, athletes, tourists, locals, and vendors and shoppingThen grab some birds (scooters) you have to download the app a couple days in advance to make sure you can access them. and scoot up to Santa Monica where it’s happening you got the pier, tongva park, the mall, 4th street promenade. it’s a whole day excursion. I recommend taking an Uber to Venice Beach and then having it pick you up in Santa Monica. Whether your scootering, biking or walking to and fro from Santa Monica to Venice Beach it’s worth seeing. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609suzannew
30,Nice beach,This is what you need to do when on the west coast. It’s a nice beach and definitely a great way to spend the day. If you don’t want to swim or get in the sand you can rent a bike or scooter and enjoy the beach that way. There’s little shops and restaurants all over so you can find something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760erins

40,Quirky,"Loved this beach and was equally thrilled to find sand dollars here too! In the evening it was far emptier than Santa Monica on the beach and we were able to watch the sunset in relative peace. Although out of my entire trip alone with my two boys of going to LA, San Fran and Vegas, I felt most vulnerable walking the boardwalk at night. We struggled to find somewhere to eat for families. Obviously busy during the day and much more friendly with everything open etc! Great quirky shops and people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nelzgirl

40,Interesting place to visit,"We walked through the Venice Beach area. Even though it was late morning when we visited, there was still quite a bit of sights to see, weight lifters, pickle ball players, skateboarders, cyclists. Here you will find everything from tattoo artists to Chinese massage, including a lot of graffiti everywhere. This is quite the contrast to the more upscale Santa Monica beach area. We found it to be quite the interesting place to visit and were glad that we made the effort to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller547
40,Great place to see,"Visited Venice Beach on our trip to LA - it is a place you have got to see. Skateboarding, basketball, cycling, weight lifting - all sorts going on and it really is a beautiful place. The buzz and atmosphere is just fantastic. That said, be prepared to see many tents pitched up on the beach and along the sidewalks as there are so many homeless people here. There is a strong smell of urine and weed all around and some of the streets are quite dirty. Do not attempt to use the public restrooms on the beach- they are really, really dirty and smelly. Muscle Beach was great to see but some of the equipment is so old and rusty. I would recommend you visit here, but you can quite easily do it in a morning or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithb62
50,Venice Beach - an icon of Southern California.,"Filled with tons of eye candy-Girls in bikinis roller skating, muscle bound guys weight lifting, henna body art, tons of items to remember your trip, music - of all kinds and best of all, every sort of non-traditional entertainment. Break-dancing, amazing physical feats - some of it too weird to identify. Its a lucrative spot for entertainers - if they are good, as many as 100 people gather in a circle around the ""act"" and leave tips accordingly. Probably, not a great place for young kids - noisy and pot shops are right on the beach. If you want to enjoy the entire circus atmosphere, you need to go on a weekend, probably, early afternoon. its a bit depressing in the absence of all the entertainers and happy chaos of the weekend. If you are unfamiliar with the a wild mix of all kinds of people, doing all manner of things to earn a buck - this is a great place to be entertain - and if you want, you can entertain the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swimmerNYC90803
30,If limited time in LA don't waste your time coming here,"I think if you're in LA for a month, go ahead, visit it, it's pretty interesting, but if you're here for less than two weeks, don't waste your time. There are plenty of other places in LA that are a must see. This place is very crowded, dirty, you smell weed everywhere you go. It's at times scary, you don't feel safe after hours. There's a vibe to it, and like I said, it's interesting, but you're not missing anything if you don't see it. For example, Santa Monica is crowded and full of tourists as well, but it's MUCH cleaner and prettier in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerier101

There are lots of restaurants to choose from right on the boardwalk at the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dkayec
30,Disappointed,"Venice Beach has been on my bucket list forever, so I was really excited to be able to visit. I shouldn't have been surprised, since I read reviews before I visited. Still, I had high expectations. I still wanted to be somewhat open-minded though. First of all, it is dirty and some parts even smelled like urine. There are a bunch of stores that sell the usual touristy items (t-shirts, magnets, etc.) I didn't stay very long, because it was not great. I did love the people watching, and it was not super surprising to me, since I am pretty open-minded and accepting of people. I did overhear people asking another person if they had drugs on them. But drugs seem to be common in LA, so it wasn't too terribly shocking. I think it is a neat place to visit if it has been on your bucket list. I just couldn't get past the dirtiness and smell of urine. I would skip if it isn't on your bucket list. If you are open to all experiences, then I would definitely visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/141stacib

10,"Dirty, crowded",This was one of the worst experiences of our week in LA. Traffic was at a standstill and Parking is very difficult to find. Trash cans were overflowing and garbage was just about everywhere. We saw two large fights in the first 20 minutes we were there. The homelessness that is so pervasive in all of LA seemed most prevalent in Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyr358

50,Cool at the Beach,"We visited LA in July, it was a really hot day but we kept cool at the beach, impressive waves, lots of fun, couldn’t resist the temptation of going in even though we’d forgotten swimwear!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annmL8096GM
50,No place like it,"There are so many unique and creative things about Socal and Venice Beach is one. From the quirky food stands to the casual surfer culture and homeless and semi-homeless beatniks, artsy and hipster attire and people selling their crafts and inventions, it never ceases to amuse. Plus the pathways for runners, skateboarders, skators and cyclists motivates you to get moving. Lots of motion art, as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naneliz
50,Ultimate Californian experience,"Venice beach is a must for funky people. You can encounter body builders, artists, musicians, clowns, health nuts, crazy bicycle, roller blades and electric scooter riders. Beware of them.It is always crowded, lively, noisy, smells bear and marijuana, full of shops of all kinds, tarot card readers and dog lovers.It is a fun place. There is ocean too. You should go there for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julia0805
30,Iconic but a bit gritty,"Visited in early August as part of our day at the beach. Saw Muscle Beach, the boardwalk, canals and Abbot Kinney First Friday.The boardwalk is a little grittier but definitely not in a way that we felt unsafe. Just a different vibe than Santa Monica, etc.Muscle Beach gym was a bit of a letdown with rusted equipment, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZonaP
30,Lovely beach too crowded,Lovely beach - that cannot change ! - still the surfers however the infrastructure behind the beach is gone too many people too many very poor souvenirs shops - too many dreadful bars and coffee shopsThe life of Venice beach is goneThe “bird” has arrived though a MUST try in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucapE9494DU
50,Must see,Venice Beach is a must see for a visit to LA. I love the walk up the beach as far as Santa Monica. There are tons of shops and small restaurants as well as small independent booths with all kinds of things to sell. It is a truly unique place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmK1320UG
30,People watching and not much else - has gone downhill,"This was my second time to Venice Beach, the first being 6 years ago. The first time we went, there many street performers, and artists with booths selling jewelry, art etc. Sure, there were ""interesting"" people, but that was part of the charm, and muscle beach was fun to see (just to say you did). This time, there was less art/jewelry, and more strangeness seemingly just for the sake of being strange (or shocking). If you are in the area (I recommend parasailing in Marina Del Rey, and the Santa Monica Pier is good for an hour or so), stop by for 20 minutes to say you did, but I would not plan a day around this ""attraction."" There just isn't that much to see or purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLS006
30,Flat sandy beach,"Flat sandy beach and cold sea; pretty boring unless you're a surfer. Cool sea breezes mean the air is clear and the intensity of the sun can catch visitors by surprise. There are a lot of rough sleepers. The beach is well maintained and kept clean. There are good shower and toilet facilities. You don't have far to walk for cafes of various types of cuisine, quality and price. Where ever there are crowds the air is permeated with the smell of pot; which gets a bit tiresome. There's a reason it's called ""dope"" people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6940HKjonathans
50,Family US Trip with teenagers and toddlers,Venice Beach wow a very diverse culture with so many different things to see..The Beach itself is ok not the greatest beach I have been on..Wandering around with Buskers and body builders parading around at the time we visited there was a body builder competition on. It can be very very busy especially on a weekend or a warm day. Well worth the visit though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJstravels3567
40,An experience to be had,"Venice beach is one of those things you have to tick off the list if you go to LA, it lived up to the zany, off the reservation reputation, it's like Camden in London but more high and a bit more run down. Lot of the street artists and sellers were homeless. If your offended by the smell of weed stay away, offered drugs by a guy on a skate board twice and I'm a 40 year old man with kids in my company but none of it was pushy or in your face, all relaxed and friendly. Some of the art was spectacular and without sounding like a hippy the vibe had to be experienced even as a one off, the beach area itself was clean with lots of Wi-Fi hotspots along the way with various playgrounds and activity areas. Well worth a visit even if it's a one off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richyintipp
50,The Mecca!,"From a dream come true on my first visit to happy memories every time I return. As a lifelong Bodybuilding enthusiast, this is a must do location on the bucket list. Sure, it's seen better days and there are one or two ""interesting"" characters dotted about, but I'd encourage anyone to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMrsK7781
40,Great for People Watching,Had a great evening in Venice Beach. Would recommend going in the late afternoon and walking up to the Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisterd2017
20,"Bohemian, grungy and sullied","During the day on the face of it, it’s a vibrant and eclectic blend of people and ideas, from skateboarding to roller disco dancing, graffiti and loud hip hop music blasted from bikes as people pass you on the boardwalk. Around muscle beach people work out and climb ropes posing for photos, it’s really not too bad. But strip away the day trippers and you’re left with a contaminated beach of homeless, pee smell and weed. The pier smells so bad and is so dirty it’s best avoided, there are hawkers and opportunists trying to get your dollars and do stay away after dark. At 7am in the morning it looks savagely down and out. Beach wise it’s okay, stay left of the pier if you want a better experience otherwise head up to Santa Monica beach or with a little driving, Huntington Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bunyip_dreaming
10,Dirty!,Full of homeless drug addicts! Nothing to see tried to hire scooters but won't accept uk driving licences!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobb1971
50,A people watchers paradise!,"We strolled from Muscle Beach to Santa Monica along the promenade . It was a lively place with a real ‘seafront ‘ atmosphere. There was generally a happy relaxed vibe with people engaged in shopping, eating and a variety of activities eg roller blading, singing etc. It was fun just to sit and watch the world go by and observe others just having what seemed to be lots of fun. The weather was warm and the In & Out Burger we had was lovely. Wandering through the paths alongside the canals was interesting and having been to Venice in Italy one could see where the inspiration had come from. I’d definitely go back if I find myself in LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paddiperkins
20,Overcrowded and overrated,What should I see more than I did in the title. Nice beach hut Pismo Monterey and many others are far better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14victorh
40,Fun!,"I had no idea what to expect! I was just with my 12 yr old daughter so I was a little apprehensive but wanted a beach with shops and somewhat entertaining. The beach was beautiful and not too crowded, so many little shops to buy souvenirs and shirts, lots of ice cream shops and we were entertained by an awesome street show!! Best part of the day! Spent almost the whole day there! Only drawback is the homeless people and people walking around cursing and/or messed up on drugs/alcohol.It was a fun day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elzand25
10,Homeless Craft Show,We walked here from Santa Monica beach and did not make it to Muscle Beach or the basketball courts. We turn around and headed back before then because it's just a bunch of druggies selling crap that nobody would want to buy so then they can go get high at night.Here's the best piece of advice I can give a family visiting the Southern California beaches go to Huntington Beach. It is by far the cleanest biggest nicest area with the most shops don't waste your time anywhere else just go to Huntington Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrishN1267WN
50,A different beach,"When we visited this beach we noticed that there are a lot of foreign tourist mostly from Europe. There are also a lot of homeless people and odd characters. The beach is beautiful, a lot of places to eat, some shops, lots of people walking, biking and riding scooters. Parking cost $15 daily near beach or $1 per hr a little bit farther. Restrooms are not that clean. We also enjoyed watching the roller bladers doing exhibition. I think I will not visit at night because of the homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/169gracer
50,Day Visit,"Always worth a visit as it’s a pretty cool part of LA. To me it’s a grungier version of Brighton in the UK. There are various stalls along the beach which sell pretty much the same thing in different guises, most of which I wouldn’t want to buy but it’s nice to have a browse nonethelessI like the StreetArt and the whole vibe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kieransc1972
50,Day at the beach,"Heard so much about this place I wanted to spend a day walking the beach and getting the vibe !Was not disappointed tons of great food, expensive and cheap tee shirts etc..Bike rentals scooter rentals you name it it’s here.Did I mention many unique people?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
30,Crazy place but worth a visit,Well this was some eye opener still stuck in the 70's check out the scate park and have a walk up to muscle beach our so had an electric scooter so took a trip down to Santa Monica peer gets extremely busy at night wouldn't say it's suitable for young children lots of homeless and cannabis being smoked for older kids it's ok fun for a day out to see Venice beaches characters,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HAYCHEYBOYSON
30,Interesting To See,"This was my second time visiting Venice Beach. I initially visited in December 2010. This visit was a part of the Highlights Tour my husband and I scheduled when visiting CA in July. It was great hearing about the history and seeing the different vendors, the skaters, people weight lifting, etc. Be careful not to get scammed by people coming up to you trying to sell their CDs, etc. Also in certain areas, it smells really bad because people use the bathroom outside. There are a lot of homeless people camping out there, but no one approached us. This area closes down pretty early, so you’ll want to visit during the daytime hours. My husband had never been, so it was great sharing the experience with him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617crystalb
30,Not as good as Expected.,"Venice beach area is a nice half day trip. Just to say you saw it. The boardwalk is filled with artists and street-people. Its dirty. Ery dirty. We walked from Santa Monica beach. Its one hour but a nice safe walk on the boardwalk shared by scooters bikes walkers runners. We liked that ling walk with a couple of little snack stores and caffees on the way. Coming and visiting mostly East coast beach area I was disappointed in the West coast beaches. They are far out from the boardwalk to the ocean, not friendly walking for young kids at all nor for oldies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyDayton_Ohio
50,Vast white sands good surf!,"Been here 3 times now on vacation. Further away from Muscle beach is Venice beach - much nicer, less crazy and less busy. Good lifeguard facilities, washrooms and showers on beach close to restaurants and body board hire, umbrella hire.Great lovely beach, good surf - just love it here.Parking near beach $9 all day not too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serenak418
50,Love the atmosphere and ambiance!,"While in LA found Venice beach to be the Best place to visit. Nice beach with a lot of activities, shops, restaurants. Surfer waiting for their wave, skaters, lifeguards, you almost feel you are in a movie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilBKK
50,Mom with 18 year old daughter and her 18 year old friend,"When we got to Venice Beach it was just how I had imagined it. The girls were very surprised. I’d never been there either. We got to walk all the way down to the end of where the vendors stopped. It’s very long where the vendors are. The vendors are very friendly and some of their shops are very, very big. All of the shops each play music. Loud music, lots of food, excellent beach and lots of fun. Not far from Redondo Homewood Suites, Uber took us back and forth. Have fun on your next vacation to Venice Beach!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73_Jewels_73
50,Love the beach walk between Santa Monica Pier and Venice beach!,"Every time we visit LA we go for a walk or bicycle ride between Santa Monica pier and Venice beach. It takes about 25 minutes to walk from the Santa Monica pier to the beginning of Venice beach. Along the walk, there are a lot of fun things to do like walking the line, climbing ropes, look at skateboarders, street artists, painters etc.Hire a bike or a Lime - electric kick bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickenojd
40,Quirky fun visit,Venice Beach was a very unique place that we enjoyed visiting. It’s great fun watching the skateboarders and street artists. It also has a nice beach area. The only drawbacks were that it was quite dirty and you also get pestered a lot. There are several tourist shops but a lot of the things in there has swear words etc. It might make people think twice about bringing families here. The parking is also very expensive in my opinion. Still a fun place to visit when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJanes1511
50,Really nice place to be,I have been to Venice beach for my first time and it really surprised how nice place it is. Local people are very friendly and the whole place is real deal. If you wann hang out on a beach among new people you want to come here. I will definitely get back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveTheWave
50,Venice Beach visit while in America,We were on a day tour so only spend a short amount of time here at Venice Beach. It was a bit chilly and windy but l think it would be beautiful on a gorgeous day people watching! Definitely a must see while visiting LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vikkir69

50,A Truly Unique Experience!!,"We are big fans of Venice. We always take our family and friends here. My nephew grew up coming to Venice every year. Once a bulldog tried to borrow his skateboard. Great food, boardwalk entertainment and unique and eclectic shops and attractions. I want to go right now!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaRobledoGart
40,My Favorite People Watching Place,"Venice Beach is simply fun.Grab some nice walking shoes, sunglasses (to be discreet), and a few bucks for food; the rest takes care of itself.People Watching to the 10th Degree.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349darrylh
50,"Quite famous, interesting place","Went here for a walk with the kids who appreciated the huge skate place where would be stars were training their skills. Not many people on Muscle beach, plenty of souvenir shops and the weirdos hanging out, next to homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DidierNivelles
30,I mostly people watched and visited the pier.,"As far as swimming, I cant tell you, but beaches are pretty and people watching is good. You definitely see some things here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
30,It’s Venice!,It is a great beach to visit & relaxing once you get out to the water. There are many areas where it is dirty & smells like urine due to the multiple harmless (from my experience) homeless people who live on the beach & board walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisav974
20,"Don't bother, unless you're desperate for a swim","As Bette Davis might say - ""What a dump!"" Fast food and tatty souvenir shops. It's not worth the effort of getting there, either by public transport or on a tour. And as for the beach. You'd have to be joking. Come to Australia and see some real and beautiful beaches instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRCsydney
30,Should see at least once,"Venice Beach is just like you see on you tube or in the movies. Lots of shops, tourist stuff, swimwear, skateboards, headshops, muscle beach, bike and scooter rentals. You will see street performers and people of all interests. There is a recreation center, bathrooms and showers. Playground and lots of beach. If you have not been here before, it a place that should be visited at least once to experience it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royalpalmshade
30,Steer clear at night,"If you want to check out Venice Beach, get there during daylight hours and plan to be out before dusk. We were warned at our Sana Monica hotel that Venice Beach can be a little iffy at night and we should have heeded that warning. We got a late start on the beach path to Venice and couldn't find enough bikes to rent along the way, so we wound up walking. About halfway to Venice, we started to encounter some shady characters around dusk and had to stop a few times to let the next group of walkers catch up to us so we weren't isolated on the path with them. After arriving in Venice, mostly everything was closed up - both the vendors' stands along the beach and the shops facing the beach. There were a couple restaurants open and one or two shops, which we checked out, but even they were about to close. Folks were setting up camp for the night on the beach or hanging out by the closed up vendors' stands. We guessed they were some of the artists and vendors who live on the beach or in cars and campers nearby. It was surprising that the place rolled up the sidewalks by dark, but it was a Monday night after all. The smell of pot, which is legal in CA, wafted everywhere we walked in Venice, which wasn't surprising. We had to ask at one of the two open restaurants which street was safe to walk the few blocks from the beach up to the main street where we could catch an Uber back to Santa Monica. Next time, if there is one, we'll go in daylight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelbugMelB2015
40,California dreaming,"For a first-timer to Los Angelos, I would definately recommend a visit to Venice Beach, not to swim necessarily but to walk around and see the local beach culture and the diversity of people. Its a mix of grubby side walks, homeless people alongside luxury properties overlooking a huge beach. Avoid visiting on a hot summer Sunday afternoon, parking is impossible and the crowds insane (unless that is what you would like to see!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmF6861EF
50,"Great place, must see","You just have to see the beach in its entirety once. The muscle beach gym, various street artists, skate parks... Absolutely amazing experience. You get an idea what it's like to live the Californian way of live",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalwf
20,This Beach Probably Had Better Days!,"Thinking this was a must-stop beach in Los Angeles, this place has probably seen and had better days. The beach is ok but leading to it (walkways, merchant and street vendors area) it is very dirty and unsafe. There are a lot of sketchy people and homeless people with a constant smell of weed in the air. We visited in the daytime and were on our guards (walking on needles, being pick-pocketed, etc.) and didn't feel safe at all and were glad to leave asap. I definitely would not show up here at night! We brought our teenagers and wouldn't suggest bringing young children here unless you have a direct way to the beach and ocean bypassing the public areas. Also, DON'T GO to the public washrooms - they were the worst I have ever seen in my life!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcY2859MO
50,Best people watching ever!,"This “beach” is like Coney Island, but warmer, cleaner, and with way more weed. Artists everywhere. Homeless too. Tons of tourists. And free shows like they have in nyc subways and on the streets. Didn’t go in the water. But the walk along the shops was enough to want to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlito106
40,The Circus Goes on!,"An isolated part of the LA, it's sometimes a freak show, other times a dose of social realty, showcasing homelessness and earthly values. Lots of families here but rated R at times, G at others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenB506
50,Beautiful Beach Area,"While I did not go down and actually walk on the beach, I did shop, eat, and walk by it. It was just a beautiful, sunny day and the scene was lovely. We all had a lot of fun and enjoyed our visit to the area. I will definitely visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E4168NOdeborahw
50,Venice Rocks!,Venice beach was amazing! We stayed in Santa Monica but it was so busy and crowded. We ventured down to Venjce and fell in love with it!. Bought some local art and walked the boardwalk and the beach....10 out of 10 in our book! Plan on staying there next time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlefootsies16

40,Everything in LA is overrated,"From one beach to another, first time in LA and was just very busy (ok it’s the summer) I get it, but the city itself didn’t blow me away nothing about it. Great to see and tick of the map. Lots of entertainment on the beaches but while your mostly busy watching shows and tricks I’d be very wary of people pickpocketing. Nice to say I’ve been there. Lovely to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceallachain

30,Over Rated,"This place is a worst case scenario Erik if clueless tourists, street people and half Assad entertainers. What once may have been a funky destination for people watching is now watching the people to make sure you dont get robbed. Low end beach stores add to the delights you will encounter. Stay to the North end for some good beer and pub options. Stay south by Washington for a better beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahmG9399ES
40,Worth a walk on the wild side,"I love the Venice Boardwalk. Unique characters, street entertainment, some fun vendors. Rent a bike and go for a ride. I miss the weekly ride I used to do from Marina del Rey through Venice Beach to Santa Monica and State Beach and back. Stopped at any one of the sidewalk cafes for lunch too. I have photographs of my grandparents on that very beach from 1923so it has special meaning to me and it's a place I always take out of town guests to see a side of Los Ang3eles I think is worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5159CDkathyr
50,Loved it!,"From the beautiful beaches to the muscle beach, dancers, basketball players and the Street hustlers - it has it all!History, creativity and art - all combined in a crazy and obscure way!Shops are excellent and the range of food is too. The water is apparently not clean - so don’t swim!We loved Venice Beach - worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlasgowCurryClub
20,Nothing special about Venice Beach,"It was mentioned as one of the recommended things to do in LA but there is really nothing special about Venice Beach. It is just a regular beach walk and cycling area with some weird people and activities on either side of the beach walk. Comparing with other beaches (such as Santa Monica), it is way lower quality and less safe. Hence not recommended for accommodation or hotel. No quality place for dining as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TC-BN
30,If you want to freak out your relatives from Topeka...,"Venice is one of the cooler parts of the West Side... a rare place where the word ""eclectic"" still means something positive. That doesn't necessarily translate to the beach, where it's more of a polite way of putting things, but still, a walk by the beach is seldom unenjoyable. If you like to people watch and take in some cheap arts, crafts, tattoos, or piercings, the boardwalk is always entertaining in a honky tonk way. It's kind of LA's version of St. Marks Place.It is fun to take out of owners to on your way to somewhere else, lots of great cafe's and such nearby... I just wouldn't make this the sole purpose of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1632ALphilipm
10,Grimey,"I haven’t been back here since my first visit in the late 1970’s when the boardwalk was a fun quirky place. It seems like they are trying to hold onto that feeling in advertisement and memories alone because the place is now a dirty, filthy, junky place. Not even a place for tourists. Those days are gone. Couldn’t wait to get the heck out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancypF5640MS

40,Get a bike and go for it,Baz Lurhman’s Romeo and Juliet is a very accurate portrayal of this area and riding the bike path is the best way to do it. There are a couple of good pizza places along the strip - the red and white one was very good- they look like holes in the wall. If you wait to get to the main food street it’s all pretty much long stay sit down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinarykids
10,Avoid!,"I can't understand how this place got a single good review. It was genuinely horrific. If you like drug infested, filthy dens then it's the place for you.

10,New name for thia place bum beach,"Thia place what suchan ikonic place, but he'll this is such a dump of a place it is an embarrassment to LA. Discusting dirt part of town, old shops, and set up art street people, and then of course the high level of homeless. What such a dark and seady place and we where there during the day, night time would tell if a different story I am tipping. The drug capital of LA, dope smoking hippies and others, regular shop front selling drugs and pipes etc .I know this place is such an ikonic simble to this beach but really is just a discusting part of LA and why on Earth would tourist even centre here is beyond belief. This is not a nice part of town at all and until they do something about cleaning it up I think it's a place you should avoiding attending. Hey if you like dirty grotty, unloved, drugs and other things GS and large homeleaa population. Where they have set up home, then this is your beat place to visit. Otherwise give it a miss on your tourist schedule. Certainly not a place to bring your family to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robcX898NR
40,Best beach experience,"I love this beach!!!I went with my running shows and started jogging along the beach. So many things to see, to start with, there were street performers with their gigs. I then walked around to see few amenities around the beach such as the muscle beach area which is an open air gym set up, a skate park, volley beach areas and many more. So many things can be done here. Apart from that, there are many eateries along the beach and it caters to all... I had a very good veggie burger at one of them.Love the place, hope I can visit again soon..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AABAR238
20,You're left with a saddening feeling,"I would say this is an overrated place to hang out on or go for sightseeing. There are more interesting, nicer and safer places to visit. But if you insist on doing it, expect a crowdy boardwalk, look out for all elements on wheels and keep a tight grip on your handbag. I'm sure Venice Beach may look great in a movie, or that the street art has been good once upon a time, but now you just feel something is itching and you're left with a saddening feeling after a walk up and down the boardwalk. Better maybe if you rent a bike or electric scooter, but nevertheless, it's just not as great that you would like it to be. I'd say, skip it and go to nearby Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TIPPYPIPPY
20,Well?????,"We arrived on a Thursday morning around 9:30 thinking we would see all of the hoopla of Venice Beach. Within minutes we had some starving artists pressing their CDs into our hands and asking for donations. Not a lot of other people, so we were quite anxious to leave. Beaches looked nice, and city was regrooming the sand. Unless you’re dying to see, wouldn’t waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmM2847IW

Lovely sand and nice pier. You could spend a long time here. Very enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdywest
50,So plenty to see,"If you like to feel the sand on your feet; watch fitness fanatics buff at the Muscle Beach; grab food on the go; watch people in their bikes, sccoter, skateboards; shop for souvenirs —- there is to plenty to see, smell, taste and donat Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennydel0716

30,"Cool, but not all its cracked up to be.","We did enjoy Venice Beach but it wasn't was we thought. Its very vibrant and creative with the gymnastics parks/muscle beach/skate parks and the graffiti and street art. In that sense its different and cool to see. However, it is very much a tourist trap, looked slightly run-down in areas and lots of homeless unfortunately. I wouldn't have felt safe walking down some of the side streets or without my partner. It does have such potential.You can hire a bike/scooter/skateboard if thats your thing. And theres plenty of shops for souvenirs and paraphenelia.We were speaking to a resident who advised that the boardwalk and beach wasn't the ""real venice"" and we should go look at the beautiful canals slightly more inset. We didn't get chance but thought i should pass it on.I think now i've been I wouldn't necessarily go back. It just depends whats your thing. We did walk from here to Santa Monica though along the boardwalk which we much preferred!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiam670
20,In need of some investment,"Was so looking forward to seeing Venice beach until we got there by tour bus which visited various areas throughout LA.In desperate need of some investment ..very run down ,loads of homeless and street peddlars trying to offload their various tat into unsuspecting tourists.Couldn’ t wait to leave the place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3698DNalanm
50,Totally FUN,"boardwalk has tons of unique shopping with lots of local flavor, places to eat and drink, and a whole lot of people watching. People walking their dogs, sun bathing, swimming, riding bikes scooters roller-blading skateboarding - just an action filled place to be !! I could live here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950terrig
50,Hanging at venice beach,"What a diverse area. After hitting the Gold's gym it was time to go down there. The classic gym on the beach, stores, street exhibitions, food etc. This place is a must people watching activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toohuge
50,It's everything you see in movies,"This beach had everything that you see in the movies and more. Busy beach, skateboarders, bodybuilders, bikinis, a busy boardwalk and lots of walking.Maybe one of the busiest beaches I've seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyleb2013
50,Laidback beach life and people watching,"Stayed in Hollywood and went a day at the beach. Loved the atmosphere on the beach. All people uses the beach - to get a suntan, to train, to see or be seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelEsmann
40,Great place to people watch,"Street performers, shops, great weather, and tons of things to keep you entertained.You have to see this place at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angel-Mendoza-5
20,Should’ve skipped it,"This beach was a big disappointment. Dirty, loud, tourist trap of a boardwalk. They don’t allow dogs on the beach and we were asked to leave with our 5 month old golden retriever puppy who is a service dog in training. I’d always heard about “Venice beach” and thought it was a must see while in the area but I definitely could have gone without a visit here. Just really glad we didn’t book a place to stay here. Can’t even imagine the colorful people it must draw at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackbear25
30,Kind of dirty,"Not what it used to be, it's still fun to visit, but honestly there are better beaches 🌊 now a days it's a little dirty and and full of homeless people 😞",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramY5305CR
50,Heaven on earth,"The best place to be and to relax. Time stands still and it is just you, beer and the perfect sunset. Don’t wanna go back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaya47
40,A good hang out spot with fiends in a this famous beach,This is one of the famous attraction in LA and 2nd famous for tourist next to Santa Monica Beach. This beach is not as lavish as Santa Monica but this is a commercialised one like it with lot of shops around and there are huge crowds almost any evening with lot of young/teen crowd.. Defenitely a must for tourist and a good for locals teens/friends to hang around a evening when in LA..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunM04
20,A walk on the prom and a paddle in the sea,"Drove from Hollywood in 45min. Parking about 200y from promenade. Busy with walkers, cyclists and scooters. Fairly relaxed and happy atmosphere. A little too crowded for a relaxed walk. Strong smell of pot along the prom.Buskers, portrait artists and craft stalls. Lots of fast foot outlets but few seating outside. A little run down and ramshackle.Beach popular but no deck chairs, subbed etc for hire. Sea was 200y from prom. Clean sandy beachSome body builders exercising, soccer and basketball. Lots of scooters, skaters and cycles. Occasionally, walking was a bit unpleasant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apb180868
10,Tacky and trashy,Worth a visit to know you’ve been and seen it but you only need 30 mins here. So tacky and touristy and more druggies than you want to deal with in one place. If you have young children you may want to skip all together. People don’t come here to go to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haze73
10,Not a place for kids,"Was super disappointed in Venice Beach. Homeless people every where and we used the work “sketchy” over and over. Glad we stopped by, but wouldn’t have wanted to be there at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569nannettes
40,Boogie Boarding,"We had a great time, people watching, finding shell treasures, boogie boarding catching waves. The waves & water were great! Restaurant pretty good/reasonable. Paid for parking ($20) not bad but the attendant needed to be more attentive (Car/paint got scratched/chipped & small dent/ding). Lots of Fun & Sun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GayleP866
40,We where in the area so a must visit,"Plenary of people around good parking at reasonable pricing.It was interesting to watch the people and there actions .The only draw back was that there was a cycle path on beach area but none for people who wanted to walk along beach.The Ocean front walk which is next to houses is a pedestrian walk way but we were nearly knocked over twice by people on bicycles and scooters. No one seems to police this issue.It is some thing you should do, it will be an experience you will probably never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blc45reb
50,Lovely beach,We spent a few hours here. Though it’s a lovely beach it was a Sunday and impossible to find parking. The traffic surrounding the area was horrific so we had to park in a small shopping plaza several blocks up with a 2 hour limit. Once that was accomplished we enjoyed the view and our day.I would recommend coming very very early and preferably Mon-Friday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheersSacramento
50,Soooo much to do!,"We totally enjoyed our visit as a family of 6. Adults and kids alike! Great food options, lots of street entertainment, plenty of room on the beach to sunbathe. We rented bikes and electric scooters for really cheap and rode for miles on the bike path. We rode up to the Santa Monica Pier and enjoyed the festivities. Will definitely return!Try the Poke ahi tuna bowls or the gourmet fries. Delish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommameans
20,Crowded tourist area,"It's definitely a tourist area filled with tacky souvenir shops. The beach itself is beautiful, but so crowded that it's not really worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisiyag2017
20,Don’t bother,My kids tried the muscle equipment. They enjoyed that. But overpriced junk to buy.... we were not interested in that. Beach was ok but not very clean. I will skip Venice beach next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottag833
10,10 minutes wasted,VB is a pit. 10 minutes I’ll never get back. Smell of weed and homeless encampments are overwhelming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/529sukij
10,Tacky place with touts and cheap souvenir shops.,"Venice Beach conjures up images of muscle bound people pumping iron and they are there. However, the shops that line the walkway is littered with tacky souvenir stores selling t shirts with vulgar messages not really suitable for families with young children. Worse still are touts, mainly African American men selling CD's of questionable value and contents. The actual beach is fine but it really is a depressing place to visit. Skip Venice beach and go further north to Santa Monica beach. More family friendly with none of the vulgarities of Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSJAMES
40,Interesting,"We recently stayed three nights in Venice Beach and I have read some other reviews and I can understand why people wouldn't want to take kids or have felt unsafe. I definately wouldn't walk around by myself at night but during the day it is a hive of activity. With lots of people just trying to make a dollar by playing music or selling paintings but be wary of the guys with the CD's who want to know your name and then write it on the cover and try and sell it to you for $10. Yes there is a lot of homeless people who mostly keep to themselves although there are also alot of people who are in there own little world and whether that be due to drugs or mental illness, it does make you a little cautious. Being from overseas and not quite in the time zone everything did shut early so make sure you find somewhere to eat before 9pm. We went down Abbott Kinney one night and found a nice little bar and used the Bird scooters to get around which were cheap and easy with them being everywhere. The beach suprised me. Considering they have such a problem with the homeless, I thought it was really clean. We had a good time in Venice Beach but did keep our wits about us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taykia
40,Fun,"We were told the beach may not be ideal to go to with kids, but honestly, we didn’t come across anything here that seemed to suggest the same. In fact, there were plenty of kids at the beach. There are good eating and drinking options on the Venice boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Touristy_D
50,Deep and wide,"Rarely crowded, gigantic beach. There are places to rent surfboards and lifeguard stands are also present so it’s safe. It is not recommended to walk it in the dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bailarina5678
20,Stay away with children,Canabis being consumed all over the place. Full of all kind of strange people. Could maybe be fun if this is what is being looked for but wouldn’t recommend this otherwise and not with kids. Rather stay in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenGlesener
10,Stay Away from here!!,This is one of the worst beach experience I have had. The whole area is filled with homeless folks. You can smell weed all over the place and very sketchy people inhabit this area. There is dump everywhere and not one seems to bother to clean it. Every business/residential area around here has gated and guarded doors. That sums it up. You can see beggars going through trash cans around houses/beach and haggling tourists for money. Some even chase after people and are relentless. Not sure what all these positive reviews are about.I would recommend to stay away from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveldiaries101
40,My favorite beach,"I love Venice Beach. I could go there every single day. The weather is beautiful...a lil chilly in evening. The people are friendly. There's tons of entertainment for the whole family. You can shop and eat( best corn) (vegan friendly) Shoot some hoops, skate or rent electric scooters. Not to mention, you can surf or swim or just the awesome pics by the water. We loved it don't much we wanna move there. Lol. The only thing I wish they had were frozen margaritas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katinarabb
40,Worth a visit but for most not a place to stay,"This beach area is known for its hippy element with many of the local people having stalls and "" shops "" selling a variety of cheaper goods. The value of some of the goods for sale is questionable but it is certainly worth a visit if only to see the shops and stalls and wall art etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/confused999

50,“The best beach for street entertainment”,Coming from Australia sorry LA but our beaches are the best. But Venice is the BEST for overall entertainment. Everywhere we looked there was so much to see it was great it was everything I hoped for and more we felt safe loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7169DVstevec
50,It is true what they say…,Venice beach is for everyone from the tent people to the wealthy everywhere in between. the street vendors are a hilarious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twin411
20,Not a family beach,"My family and I visited Venice Beach while we were on vacation in Santa Monica. The beach itself is very pretty however the shops are definitely not family friendly, the smell of weed along the beach is everywhere and the street hustlers are very aggressive. We were only there for a very short time before we turned around and went back home. If you have a family, there are many other and way better options in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/653bryanc
30,Lost its old magic...,"Remember when it was a crazy but nice place, plenty of funny freaks. Now it looks like a third world bunch of shops selling cheap items and no more. Many marijuana fans all over the place. No more fun. Dirty and smelly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medoc23
50,Love This places,"Venice Beach love this place, I’m from south east London which truly is a different world my local Beaches are Margate and Brighton there truly no Comparison, just the vibe here and The Entertainment and Culture you couldn’t ask for a better places, I’m Fortunate to have also been to Miami South Beach & I still Prefer the vide here you don’t even have to leave the beach area to get something to eat or drink and It don’t cost you an arm and a leg .Plenty of choice out here with things to do So much choice it’s like the whole beach is buzzing. You have Street Entertainers , Venice Skate park, The pier, shops, surfing areas , Rooftop Lounges where you can just take in the Scenery. Bike paths where you can ride down to Santa Monica Pier,Basketball court, Muscle Beach and so much more. My whole family love this place Surrounded by fun and don’t cost anything once you’re here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82lloydm
50,Fun area to check out,"I was a bit skeptical—I thought it would be really trashy, but it was a lot of fun! Beautiful beach, fun renting scooters and the people-watching was first rate! A bit ticky-tacky but that’s what you would expect. We stayed in Marina Del Rey so we were close enough to walk but away from the hustle and bustle. I would definitely recommend for a fun day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynl393
40,Venice beach morning strole,"It's a strange walk from Rose Ave and alongside Venice beach. Homeless people and street vendors (and a mix of both) on the beach side, and ordinary beach shops(including marijuana outlets) on the other. Seemingly in harmonious co-exisistance. In the morning (9-10) it's obvious that this is an area for the homeless community. Several ""camps"" seems to be set up under the threes near the beach, and the morning bathroom activities are too obvious on the sidewalk. The whole scene looks like a strange attemt of social assimilation between tourists, shop owners, homeless people's and streetartists. I guess you either love or hate it. I couldn't quite make up my mind as I proceeded. What's the alternative for poor people, when you don't have a place to live? I talked to a couple of local city employees I met in the same area. Sometimes its harmony and sometimes the psychiatric diagnosis and/or the addition challenges of some individuals makes every harmonous interaction impossible.It's not fair to Venice beach to let this perspective take all the attention. Nice shops and outlets, in combination with street artists and bike-and segway rentals corrects my views as I walked along the beach further south. The tourism picked up, and the homeless disappeared more and more. On the retour to my car the ""camps"" were gone and the touristic dominance took over.A walk along Venice beach is in many ways a walk along all of the societys layers. Well worth the experience. It's a reality check that should be mandatory. At least it gave me some time for reflection while i had my morning slow wake- up exercise. Visit this place. It's America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386gustavl
40,Looovvvveeeed this,"A definate to visit if you want to see all the strange characters - and normal people - along with the body builders on Muscle beach. A very long, beautiful beach with wide walkway, separate lanes for bicycles etc to enjoy the sunshine. Lots of shops and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liezelp1997
30,Sterile and Disneyfied in a cheap way,"This is a place where I've taken many friends over the years when visiting Los Angeles. This just might be the last. As there has always been an enormous battle between the ""regular"" business' and the ""street vendors"" and artists opposite of them an uneasy truce always seemed to prevail. No more as most of the street artists (at least the ones worth watching) and the street vendors themselves have been tossed out or relegated to other parts of Venice. The result; A boring, watered down version of what used to be an incredibly fun place to visit. Now it's just horrible sunglasses, marijuana and more horrible T-Shirt vendors. The skatepark is interesting and the beach itself is an overlooked jewel, just not the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,A Place To Be Seen,"If you love the beach this is one place you need to see and be seen.The beach itself is massive, fairly clean and a great place to chill.There is a popular bike path that will take you all the way to Santa Monica if you are up for the ride.The “promenade” walk is the life blood of Venice Beach, lots of traders ranging from touristy goods to foods stalls, the quirky and everything in between.There is always activity happening at the many sports facilities and of course there’s the Muscle Beach area (a lot smaller than you might expect)Everyone just seems to be doing their thing and it creates a vibrant, eclectic experience you are sure to enjoy.If you are planning a swim be warned that water is pretty chilly first up but if you can brave it, it actually gets to be ok after a while.Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbG164FE
50,Amazing Place,"This is a must see venue , if travelling to LA than a road trip to Santa Monica beach with a follow up trip to Venice beach , quite an eye opened ,dont miss out on muscle beach - well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U408MSmichaeld

30,Full of junkies,"This beach somehow is a love and hate thing at the same time. Beach is amazing only if it's sunny and summers, the area otherwise is full of beggers and junkies. No major hotel or restaurant chains like Miami beaches. Food and drinks is hard to find. We found if very ordinary in the beginning but started loving it eventually for everything we were not liking eventually. You must stay here for a couple of days on weekends to enjoy all the things. Must try the electric scootys available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumitBanga
50,Homeless teenager heaven!,"When you get there you have to step around some teenagers sitting at the corner huffing on some huge magic markers. That’s OK because you can purchase some five dollar sunglasses and ignore everybody you walk past. They have tons of sunglasses from which to choose.You will be practically molested by people putting a CD into your hand and expecting you to pay for it . But that’s OK because these are famous musicians, and you always want to see stars in Los Angeles don’t you?Since leaving his band, Eddie Van Halen can be seen skating around with a turban on playing some of his favorite solos from Van Halen 1 and albums. Where else are you going to see Van Halen concert for free? - nowhere but Venice Beach!You can watch professional skateboarders do Ollies and 720s at the skate park. Sometimes they land on their face and eat it real hard with a couple fractured vertebrae in their neck. At that point they can skate for another 20 minutes before they are taken to the nearest taco truck for taco medicine (extra hot taco sauce, the red one).I can’t tell you how awesome Venice Beach is, but what I can tell you is how awesome all the homeless teenagers are there. They emailed an odor unlike anywhere else and you’ll never forget it – at Venice Beach !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtrla

10,Oye.,"While there is no harm in being in the sand by the water here, this isn't a beach that I would go out of my way for. On the boardwalk area there is a large amount of graffiti. There are lots of homeless people here camping out and when you walk through you can tell there are people who have done drugs. There are public bathrooms, but they are an absolute complete disaster - many of the door locks are broken, there is no toilet paper in lot of them, and drug users camp out in those bathrooms to use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279ericai
10,Awful,Was staying with friends in Santa Monica and decide to walk along the beach to Venice. I thought I’d get some lunch and maybe a drink and then walk back . What an absolute s@@t hole of a place . You couldn’t stop anywhere along the way as the whole boardwalk was lined with drunks and beggars . Not one bar you’d step foot in . I honestly was shocked at what a dump it was. I have travelled quite a lot and lived all over but this place was a shock. Why anyone would review this area positively is astounding . If you think I’m talking bs visit but plan your exit and eat and drink in advance . Think - the walking dead - and you won’t be far off ! Oh and if you need medical cannabis that seems to be widely available although a bar of soap seems to be most in demand by almost all those I had the misfortune to pass,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davey369

The coolest thing about venice is the wall murals, instead of the beach hit up the downtown murals for excellent instagram photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Iconic beach,This isn't the prettiest beach I've ever visited but the place in general is cool. Walking along the shoreline of Venice beach is very interesting and perfect for people watchers. A bike ride or skate along the path to Santa Monica is a favourite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LandPlaceSea
40,Interesting place,"We walked along the boardwalk and watched the guys pumping iron, then headed over to the skate park to watch some skilful people on their boards. It was a nice clean beach, and lots of little shops around. Venice canals are also lovely. Only thing that was off putting was the constant smell of marijuana through the shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suseowen

50,A little bit of rock and roll with your Hippie experience !!!,"I have always loved being a tourist in my own city.I brought one of my kiddos (a proper teenager, attitude and all) here for a quiet day together.We spent more time in the canal part of Venice Beach than the boardwalk, which is, as expected, noisy, a bit dirty, always teeming with some sincerely kooky (read, eccentric) people, uber hottie athletes, sunburnt tourists, the very special gamut that Venice Beach in particular invites.We saw a drum circle on the beach. That was cool.People were dancing around it mostly without self-conscious irony; they genuinely seemed lost in their own blissful experiences.We walked a lot, chatted mostly about her life ...and I think the environment - which manages to imbue itself with both a super quirky, boho vibe, and also a kind of set-apart gravitas — loaned itself to the intimacy we experienced together. Even though there were people around, the Canal especially still feels private, hidden, special.Plus, a longstanding rumor has it that one of the greatest artists, pop star P!nk, lives on the canal, so we both 💯 geeked out like FanGurls.Which we are.I recommend you bring shades and a cute cap to protect your skin from the oft relentless sunshine.Don’t forget to bring enough water for your party (ideally in a reusable cups!) and extra sunscreen!!!Oh and ...look for parking carefully! Read all signs around parking to make sure you don’t get a ticket!Have fun! Life is precious and so are you!xox",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1266SErebeccas
20,Place you have to visit but don’t have high expecations,I can only imagine how great this place was in the past and there are som nice areas but not where the tourists are taken. We stayed 1hour on a tour bus and that was plenty. This place has turned into a dive with kitchen stalls and shops and toilets that really need a huge makeover. Lots of homeless along the boardwalk and not a pleasant place. Nothing like I imagined.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swa58717

40,Interesting,An alternative place to visit. Lots to see and experience. It is a nice walk up and down the main areas. There is some nice shopping and some cool street shows as well as some great skating to see at the skate bowl. Definitely recommend getting a açai bowl in one of the many cafes.I would definitely recommended setting up a scooter service before visiting. Either Lime or Bird. It is a long walk and my husband and I both wished we had downloaded that service so we could use them to get back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayden_555
30,A surreal place for tourists,"Venice beach is a very surreal place. To me a sort of a human zoo with no cages, but with lots of different kinds of people. From barbies and common people to junkies, homeless, street performers and plenty points to take a look. At Venice board walk you can watch people, buy souvenirs offered at dozens shops, eat finger foods, drink a beer or have breakfast or lunch at a few good and decent places. It is a touristic place world well known and because of it Venice is a place to see and be seen. Do not expect any fancy attraction between the street performers or the dozens of vendors trying to make some money with silly things, some interesting and some literally not worthy to buy. Expend your time at Venice preferentially during morning and afternoon until 6 PM. Never visit Venice at night time because the place is not safe at all. If you want to enjoy the sun at the beach only wet your legs, be careful with the water that in general is contaminated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jomache

On the way, i will get off my bike and walk the boardwalk in venice to see the performances and variety of people visiting.

Relaxed as the beach is, with all sorts of tiny stores to choose your gifts from LA at a cheaper price, with some cafes and bars. Don't be surprised by the smell of weeds and offers from Kush doctor (healing forces of hemp are being experimented on people in need). This place is about the artists - musicians, dancers, painters, musical instruments producers etc. This is a kind of fun jungle, when suddenly someone starts playing drums, and a few minutes later you have the entire orchestra playing, while others dance to this music. Go for it, and let yourself relax!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac

30,A place to walk and meet a wide variety of people,"If this is your first time in Los Angeles and want to spend a few hours walking along the sea front to see street entertainers and tourist booths and you don’t mind some unusual fragrances, that are known to make people happy, then Venice Beach fits that description.If you are looking for a more sophisticated walk, then head south to Manhattan Beach which is also a much better place to relax on the beach, play volleyball and to eat.Venice Beach includes the muscle Beach gymn where you can see people working out. Artists use spray cans to create space fantasies on canvas in front of your eyes, musicians pass by on roller skates and ice cream and pizza is readily available.More a place for teenagers and upwards but I wouldn’t recommend it for young children.If you do visit, the place not to miss though are the Venice Canals. Situated just inland from the beach and a five minute walk. There you can walk around, look at the amazing houses and cross over from one bank to another using the many bridges. A great place for photos.Hope this review proves useful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Georgiela
30,Disappointing,"We came here just to experience this famous place. The beach was impressive, but the rest of the area was dirty and anything but impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birgitteo777
40,Lots to do on the beach.,You can rent chairs and umbrellas from Jay's right as you enter the boardwalk area under the sign. When we were there it was still a bit chilly but pleasant on the beach. If you want to take a break but don't feel like walking get the Lime or Bird app to rent scooters or bikes. Hint one person get it then refer another so you both get some credits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaQ_12
50,Amazing!!,"A must while in LA! For an early morning walk or for spending some time at the beach ,you must go to this amazing beach. Warmly recommended,!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanij60
40,A great beach,Long and beautiful beach with golden sand. No problem parking for free (restricted on certain days so check signs). Few shops and plenty of places to eat. Toilet facilities less than desirable. Surf boards/bikes/paddle boards/ skateboards all available to hire - shop about,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242dp
40,Still The Same,"I did mention Venice in my Muscle Beach review. Venice is a very entertaining area with a good range of stores, some with some great stuff.It was a bit cool, early, and overcast, so it wasn't super active.There are always lots of street performers, some great, some good, some not good. What they tend to have in common, is that they are there to relieve you of your money in exchange for products, but in many cases, photo's with them .They will want payment, so be aware",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnj965
50,Nice Vibe,I would have loved to have spent more time here - unfortunately we were on a tour and only got an hour to look around. Muscle Beach and the skate park were fun to see as were the colorful people hanging about. Just say no to the guys selling their cd’s and you’ll be fine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondi1517
50,Lovely beach,It is a nice beach with many activities can do it there and good to rent a cottage to spend special night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yafeah
50,Beautiful!,"Beautiful beach- my husband and I walked forever! We visited in February so the water was too cold to go in,but we were able to hunt for shells. We collected several sand dollars as well. It was a nice time to visit because the beach was very peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862mindys
30,Not what it used to be.,I guess everyone should go once. But isn’t the attraction it used to have.It is now mostly a row of cheapy souvenir shops and a row of touristy vendors. Nothing special or anything I would purchase. There are fewer street performers than there used to be. So less to look at/watch. One T-shirt shop after another instead.There is a basketball court. Skateboard park. And outdoor gym. The gym used to be filled with the biggest muscle men lifting weights to watch. Not much anymore. One small guy there on a Sunday.A little street art as seen in photos.Marijuana is very abundant and no way to be away from the smell or second hand smoke.Parking is hard to find. We ended upPaying $20 for 2 hours one blockAway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandi_Spears
50,Amazing place,If you are in Los Angeles this is one of the best places to spend your time and if you can go to eat at Bruno’s in Santa Monica beach it’s really good Italian food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunocB7328QO
50,Must visit beach,I visited this place in may with my friends and it was really awesome. Seems like a endless beach but truly worth watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chetan1087
50,AMAZING,"A must have for everyone who visits Los Angeles. You won’t stop walking around and watching. Endless beautiful beach, lots of little shops to browse through, lots of different street performers. You won’t get bored, I promise. Meeting YouTuber’s there is also a must have, watch out:). Rent a bike or an electric scooter and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sroehrdanz
40,People watching at its best,The title pretty much covers it. If you don’t mind smelling pot continuously you can see some wild stuff. Wouldn’t recommend taking anyone under 16 with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkweaver1
50,Awesome!,"Living in Nebraska, I never have experience so much LOVE AND SEEN DIVERSITY. Everyone having a great time, walking on the beach, watching skate boarding, area for a group that were roller skating, photo shoots, basketball tournaments and Food, and so much more! My son had and AMAZING TIME! WE WILL BE BACK TO VENICE BEACH!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227kishan
50,Surprisingly tasty,"We expected your average, beach front tourist, so-so food. It was surprisingly good! Fresh, well-prepared meal and very tasty. The Cobb salad with extra ranch gets two thumbs up and the grilled cheese sandwiches were amazingly good. Our Kids (young adults) love ranch and thought this ranch dressing was beyond delicious! The Venice Terrace is worth trying if you’re in town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenS641
50,Beautiful? Its heavenly,Specially the sunsets are out of this world :) can't recommend this place enough... a must a must visit if you like sandy beaches and warm weather :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syeda409
50,Lots To Do!,"Love everything you can do at Venice Beach whether you want the beach, shops, sightseeing, weightlifting, skateboarding its all at Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742jaclynd
50,One of the most beautiful beaches,"A beach for everyone ! A very beautiful, clean area, with everything you want (shops, restaurants, bars, places of entertainment) nearby .... and of an appreciable size ....If for Americans it's normal, for Europeans there is something ... more special...A great place that I want to see again...If you visit California but you do not get here ... you have not seen anything ...!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baciucarmaciu
50,Something for everyone,"Absolutely must visit. Eclectic beach with so much to see and do plan on spending the day.Lots of board walk to shopping and plenty of restaurants and bars to keep you busy for a week. Just come, park and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinkF93IX
50,Love the place,"I love Venice beach, but its a weird place full of strange weird people. Beach is really nice and shopping is cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brett8541
40,Entertaining,"As well as bars, restaurants and souvenir shops, there's plenty to see at Venice Beach (and along the cycle path in either direction). The Pier is not as large or interesting as the one in Santa Monica, but you can still see some lovely views, and watch the planes take off from LA airport out over the ocean. Muscle Beach and the Skate Park are also worth visiting and spending some time watching the action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie
50,HEY I'M AN OLD HIPPY HOW COULD I NOT LOVE THIS PLACE,"Second time here and it was just as great today as 30 years ago. I love the atmosphere of this place. Now it has changed in past 30 years but its still a great place to walk, watch people and enjoy the sites. We watched for quite some time the kids on skateboard courts. These kids are amazing to watch. My wife saw it for first time and was amazed at the place. We might go back to just see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revrick33
30,Crazy interesting people around,The llace is long with a nice walk place to enjoy walking and also some restaurants around not high end but let's say medium level. Irdibg place with crazy boardibg riders can be seen. Many activities around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hossamm894
50,"Lovely beach, loads to see and do",Absolutely loads to see and do! Lots of free sports and exercise facilities. Lots of street art and performances. Lots of independent shops and places to eat and drink. Definitely worth a visit if you are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberleyopinion
50,Just fun,So maybe a beach is a beach but it’s full of life ! There was a Barcycle and loads of people on their scooters. Just fun. Could have gone cycling,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youke_worldwide
40,Quite an experience,"I can’t say that I had any expectations about Venice Beach yet it wasn’t what I expected. The beach is beautiful, flat and clean. There is such a mix of characters along the beach from homeless, to mentally ill, to drug users and buskers. There are people trying to earn a dollar anyway possible and some good and not so good artists. There are some scary looking people with masks and some harmless ones making you laugh. It was definitely entertaining to say the least. We saw police in 2 spots talking to people which sounded like it was for drug use. There are a few interesting shops- the one with massive transformers and hats was cool and there are a few t-shirt places with the Cali Love vibe. Some of the vendor stalls were “flea market like” yet we stopped and looked. Venice beach is sort of like that accident scene that you know you shouldn’t look at, but you do. You will see offensive words and art and people and feel like you are on another planet but you will walk away feeling glad that you visited. Sometimes we have to see what we shouldn’t or what we don’t want to, simply to be reminded that we are all human, life is beautiful and we are lucky to just be here. Venice beach will make you appreciate what you have and also leave you longing for the utter absurdity of the Beach and it’s residents. We all left a little kinder and with a little more humility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandy007
40,Seedy but fun,"Amidst all the sunglass, T shirt and art stalls this is a fun place to be. The beach is lovely. Beware of bikes, skate boarders and scooters when walking!!It’s an easy walk to Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255060Charlie10
50,It is what it is...,"It is what it is, it will never change and that is a good thing ;-) pumping the muscles, showing off body parts or fly around on a skateboard it’s all as natural as the often shown naked body parts. Bit those idiots on electric steps they should really teach them some basic traffic rules.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikmarc
40,Nice,"Walking along the board walk watching the sites and seeing the world go by is a pleasure, we even found a bar to sit outside and watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darren000000
40,Not as ghetto as expected,We actually had fun here primarily because it wasnt too hot today and beach was not dirty but you still get your share of ghetto if you look around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daikin
40,It’s a very cool place,"The people are friendly, the boardwalk is wide and there’s plenty of room for everyone to bicycle skate walk and jog. The buildings are older, and there’s lots of people showing you stuff, and that’s OK. The sand is clean, very little trash. The only bad thing I noticed was there was quite a few homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piratejoebeach
50,Cycling,"There are lot of people on the beach. Every person enjoyed their time making bobbles ,swimming,skateboarding and more! Cycling road around Bay Area was clean and nice. I really loved cycling there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shihok684
10,Big disappointment. Dangerous and only for backpackers or those cash strapped,"Venice Beach was the biggest let down in LA. The city is known for having a big difference between rich and poor. if you have already been to downtown LA then you will see people living in tents - this is essentially the beachside version.Some will say this is arty and creative but it reminds me of what a backpacker who first travelled abroad would say. The reality is that there are many unsavory characters trying to flog art to make money to pay for drugs.Proof that this isn't a good area is that if you look at the street just behind the beach then you will see private security guards standing to ensure that those characters don't disrupt private property. As soon as you leave the Venice Beach area, the guards magically aren't needed in Santa Monica. That says it all.Stay in Santa Monica and perhaps do a bus tour of Malibu - avoid Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravellerfromGB
40,Gotta visit here,"Part of the California scene, take some cash for the street performers. This is the place for cheap t shirts and souvenirs. Get ice cream or a henna tattoo. Go watch the skaters in the bowls. Great place to people watch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattiBethA
20,Crowded poorly served with basic infrastructure like toilets.,If this is an iconic LA location the bar//standard is very low . The beach is like a 3rd world experience but worse . Long lines to use a dirty messy toilet that are inadequate for the tens of thousands of people at the beach . Venice beach name use lets down the real Venice that is a place of beauty and style . The contrast between multi million dollar canal homes and poverty that receives little or no spending on needed infrastructure should be questioned and fixed . Tours in LA showcase such places and others that are in reality very ordinary .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301StuartD
50,The best place to relax in So Cal,"My wife and I have been spending our summer vacations fhr last 3 years at Venice Beach. We love the funky shops/great restaurants and people of the area. Yes there are a lot of tourists in the area , but we just cant get enough of the area.The beaches are great and there is plenty to do and see. If you haven't been...go, its worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X7459DXmartinm
40,Beautiful beach. lots of activity,"Venice is one of the most happening beaches in LA. Continues from Santa Monica, and has a lot of life and activity. The water is nice and clean, and the beach is relatively white and clean, even though remains very crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohanc708
50,Unique Boardwalk,"After spending several afternoons in the at the area beaches like Huntington Beach and Laguna Beach, Venice Beach was a definite change of pace. The are plenty of shops to check out and plenty of people watching to he had. We had a very nice lunch on the boardwalk and a couple hours in the water. The outdoor gym was a definite surprise. If you head to the Venice Beach, plan to spend the entire afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndyMedic2006
50,Great Beach on Northend,"Enjoyed visit to north end of Venice Beach. Two hour parking was cheap and convenient. Nice wide beach with volleyball near parking lots. Relaxed with enough room to avoid crowing by other beach goers. Our location was on north end of venice beach, kind of between Venice and Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porter_osborne
10,Glad to be on a bike,"Venice Beach is quite a shocking and eye-opening place. For a beach that I can imagine was once a great and lively destination, it is now an unsavoury and quite scary place to be. Homelessness is rife along the whole stretch of the beach. Drugs and alcohol abuse is clearly and big problem, and the buildings along the front have certainly seen better days. If you are going to visit, I suggest bikes are the best option so you can whizz through at a higher speed than walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalls92
30,Bit tacky... lots of tatt shops...,"We decided to head here from Santa Monica... I had quite wrongly thought this might have been a flasher district but no it is like the Gold Coast of Australia on Steroids... it is tacky to the limit, lots of souvenir shops, places to buy weed and lots of vendors selling not very good artefacts, also a place to get a temporary tattoo... There are lots of bars to stop for a drink. The beach aligns the promenade it is a large wide beach but having seen beaches in Australia this is not a patch. It was interesting to see how much activity goes on here though with sporting activities such as people in a competition on high and low bars, skating, basketball etc. We also saw Muscle beach with men pumping iron... It is a must to see but don't expect too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
30,Seedier than expected.,"It did not take long to get a feel for the boardwalk area, and it was not good. Homeless, as well as victims of mental health issues abound. They do not all seem harmless. Even as 4 adults, we were less than comfortable.We watched the skateboarding at the skateboard park but left before getting to Muscle Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JALToronto
50,"White sand, calm ocean","Lots of homeless. We stayed at Ellison suites. It was scary running out there at night to get into hotel. Lots of activity. Homeless people were camped out. But in the morning, it was amazing. White sand beach & calm ocean. Wish I swam in it. Walked w/ kids out to playground which they loved. If we had more energy would of walked to skate park to people watch. Cool shops everywhere on strip, like an outdoor flea market. Pretty cool place to see in daytime",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarayang27
20,Skateboard park was amazing,"There were t-shirt shops, bicycle rental shops, a few food vendors, an “Art” (graffiti) wall that is overpainted regularly, muscle beach, a nice cement bike/jogging path, a skateboard park designed by some of the originators of the sport. It was a cool, early morning visit so we only saw one lady training on the muscle exercise equipment, but there were several accomplished skateboarders and a roller skater taking full advantage of the great skateboard park and we enjoyed watching them perform stunts.We had arrived for a 30 min visit on our LA in a Day tour bus. I didn’t notice much parking for automobiles. There was an undesireable smell in the area the morning we were there. I couldn’t tell if it was foul smelling incense or something else even less pleasant. On a previous visit, my daughter rented a bike and took quite a long ride on the nice paved path. Our tour guide informed us that the area originally had many canals behind the rows of houses. Many of the canals have since been filled, leaving just a few in existance. Hence the city name connection to the city of Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road_Warrior32034
40,Just like you imagine!,Strolling down the beach you get to see lovely homes and crazy shops with tacky things to buy! People watching at its best! Muscle beach is something to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518ATLCouple
50,Great for everyone,This Beach is so beautiful. The beach has a big parking spot and a big strands. The water is very clean and you can have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
30,There are beaches and then there is Venice,"This was so different to what we expected . This place it buzzes , sellers with there special wares , homeless hippies , snake charmers. With always a smell of weed. This place is not for the faint hearted as it can be packed . Not as clean as you think it would be . If you are going to park get as close to the area as possible as it does become cheaper. Glad we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirah2013
30,Two types of Venice,"So there are two ends to Venice Beach. The southern end is really clean and has a few nice places to eat, plus the pier.Then you have the northern very diverse part, not for the faint hearted. I wouldn’t stay in accom here, go more south to Huntington Beach or North to Santa Barbara",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anastasiakollis
50,Such an experience,"I absolutely love coming to Venice beach when LA. It is a truly unique experience. You might see: people holding snakes or birds or cats or dogs, people doing performance art, people singing, people dancing, people selling their goods, people with tons of tattoos, people with a lot of piercings, lots of art, etc. The list truly goes on. You will see such a diverse group of interesting people. I could people watch for hours.There are tons of shops and restaurants along the boardwalk walkway where you can stop. You should obviously check out the famed muscle beach and basketball courts as well as the skaters. It’s all just such a fun experience to take in. There is a great rainbow lifeguard tower that can’t not make you smile.I highly recommend coming here for an experience that will stick with you. Be forewarned, if you come in the morning you will without a doubt see all the homeless people who sleep there waking up and a lot more junkies than you would see during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
40,Have fun in the sun.,"I think it’s a must to visit this place. Last time I was here I walked but now we rented bikes from Tuesday rent, very beautiful pink and green bikes with a basket so it felt like we were locals. All the variety of people you will see on Venice beach is amazing, all the colours,all kinds of smell and many seems to be high on something else than just happiness. You see a lot of homeless people and street performers , artist, joggers, bicyclists and of course a lot of curious tourists. Don’t try to use the public restrooms, they are not properly maintained",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandesa
20,maybe go somewhere else or at least go when it's hot and sunny,"I'm sure on a sunnier day the place would have been more populated with the beautiful people showing off their skating skills/fashion choices but on a dull May Wednesday it was grim.A smattering of disappointed tourists, resigned-looking locals and rows of shops selling tourist tat that no one was buying. Don't bother attempting to eat here... they get it wrong (and it's your fault), and the food is fried and tasteless.Don't get me wrong, nasty destinations of the world are things we don't mind travelling to so we didn't regret it... if the rental car hadn't conked out we would have taken a trip to Walmart...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/occasional_typo
30,Ride from Santa Monica to Benice Beach,We rode from Santa Monica Pier all way to Marina del Rey and thru Venice Beach plenty tat shops and bars too many homeless people around this area not good reallyStick to bike ride if stopping Venice beach go to the Main Street for bars no harassment thereDon’t forget the local acrobats will always choose the local white menTo get your money most of the time they are good entertainment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harry277
40,Venice Beach 420 Friendly,"Walked from Venice Beach to Sta Monica Beach and the air smells a mixture of 420 and the sea breeze. you can see artists, bicyclists, joggers and health enthusiasts. there are playgrounds, restaurants and shops.Restrooms are not properly maintained. There were homeless people and street performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
50,Hippey cool with an alternative touch,"This is a place to love and hate. I love it for the hippey freedom, ocean sights, artists and the different aspects of how you choose to live your life. And for the same reason i kind of hate it, the lack of ambition and None responsibility of life reminds me of myself talking things to seriously but also how i wish that we could blow some common sense into the people who sometimes seems to forget how to be careful. Take a Bike ride on the beach and y Will be more then in seven heaven of a great feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lundinfam
30,"Overrated, under maintaines","This very long boardwalk beach area is poorly maintained. It contains many merchants selling their merchandise out of very old and run down store fronts, some make shifted. Homeless are seen everywhere with tents set up all along the beach side of the boardwalk. Drunks are quite visible during broad daylight. The smell of marijuana can be found throughout different sections of the boardwalk. This beach area may have been family friendly at one point in time, but not anymore. We would never visit here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacinpa
50,Busy fun place to spend the day,"There is so much going on here, with Muscle beach, shops and market stalls, restaurants, Trapeze school, basketball, skateboarding and much more it is a little hub of hip California life.If you are visiting the area, a day in Venice beach is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm1708
10,Post-apocalyptic beach of doom,"I remember Venice when it was a lot different than it is now. Venice is famous for being a hippie/skater/artist/weirdo boulevard of coolness, mellowness, and reggae music. There is still a small part of that, but overall, the entire area is more depressing than uplifting. The boulevard is filthy, the businesses are all old, run-down, and dirty. Even the houses and apartments that face the beach look like they are close to being boarded up for code violations or as drug flops. There are really no buskers anymore, and the street artists are mostly cheap crap and penny trinkets.Homeless are everywhere, and I mean everywhere, sleeping in the grass, on the benches, in the sand, with their trollies and bags in stacks all over the grass and boulevard. Drug use is everywhere, in the open, and I don't just mean the occasional joint. The public toilets were appalling and I'm surprised we didn't see syringes on the sidewalk. The whole thing was like a post-apocalyptic movie, and I'm surprised zombies didn't come shambling out of the alleyway at some point, although many of the people wandering the boulevard could have easily passed for zombies.Heartbreaking and sad. Venice has become a dump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandanB8799XB
40,"great beach, interesting people, funky shops","A great area that attracts a wide variety people with high energy. Peoole are strolling, roller blading, biking, wkectris scooters snd more. Stores are directed mostly at tourists. Beach is big and beautiful with lots of activity. Onky drawback is parking. Street parking takes time and paid lots are pricey. Beautuful sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliespal2
20,Dumpy,"I stayed in two hotels, one in Ontario,the other in Buena Park. Both were old, run down and felt gross. From Ontario to Hollywood, everything is a dump, old ,dirty,run down and crowded. Business owners do not care about curb appeal at all and the outside is so filthy. So disappointed with California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaButterfly79
30,Disappointing place,We were very disappointed with the untidiness of this place with all the litter and homeless people. It needs a big clean up. the beach was reasonable but overall not worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olie293
40,The Contrast of the USA on Display,"The best and worst of the USA on display for me. You have a beautifully maintained beach with lots of activities going on with restaurants, stalls selling a range of artworks, entertainers and the like, so from that perspective a lot of fun can be had by all. On the downside is the poverty on display with people sleeping rough, people trying to get food from charity vans etc. It was sad to see in such a rich country. An ideal tip to pass the time is to get a good seat in one of the restaurants/ cafes, enjoy some food and just watch all the characters wander by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHewe54
50,Love this beach,Beautiful and relaxing beach. It's so big that you can easily find a spot to sit or lie down even during busy times. A great location to hangout or just to enjoy the sand and the water. It's not difficult to find parking nearby. I highly recommend this beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/u07

50,This place defines Hip!,"I have read about this beac town for many years. But you really have to be there to experience all of the activity going on around you. Many restaurants, food vendors, memorabilia shops, and the best thing that we found was being able to rent little electric scooters. We rode them for miles around the area that has very well maintained walkways. Don't miss this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjDan48
50,Venice is Venice,"This exactly what one should expect to see at Venice Beach, CA. Nothing spectacular but great for people watching and find a sea of weirdos among the thousands of tourists. I used to like it better the old days cause the vibe was better. But again this is Venice Beach, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drink50fifty
10,Shipwreck,"Stopped by to kill a couple of hours before a flight. Wasn’t impressed. The promenade was like a shipwreck had happened and the wretched survivors were eking out their existence, having given up all hope of rescue. Homeless people camped and sprawled everywhere (their pet dogs looked like they were in better shape). Despite the cool breezes you could smell the body odor and human waste. The few shops were dingy and like something out of a Mad Max movie—except that BarterTown probably was more inviting.Outrageous that the city government is so hapless at addressing this problem. I was last at the beach in 2007 and it was nothing like this. Stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajtlawyer
50,"2 beaches , polar opposites but worth seeing","Attended Venice Beach and Huntington Beach over Memorial Day weekend . Both worth seeing although both couldn’t be completely different from each other . Venice Beach is larger , eclectic , and anything goes. The boardwalk goes on for miles unfortunately we went late and therefore didn’t get to Santa Monica. There are several stores bars, and people selling anything and everything .A must see . Huntington Beach is smaller , much cleaner with great restaurants, and stores. A great place to surf apparently . The amount of surfers out when we attended was insane . Definitely worth seeing both beaches and enjoy .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolebG9541JN
50,Gorgeous Beach with shops and restaurants and bars and more!,"Don't forget a camera, towel, sunglasses and ponytail holder (it can get windy out there). This beach is beautiful and huge, not over run with sunning chairs and mass population. It was an awesome stretch of beach with great shops, bars, restaurants and so many activities to choose from. So many people were enjoying a stroll on the trail, or biking or roller blading...if you're active, you'll find what you want to do here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SummerR705
50,Great for People Watching,"Anytime we’re in the LA area, we have to visit Venice Beach. There are great little shops to find souvenirs and grab a bite to eat. The best time at this beach is to watch the people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABQvolcanogirl
30,Cali Hot Spot,"‘Ello chaps!If you’re ever wondering where the hippies and gym rats hang out in California, then you should know they’re in Venice Beach.Venice Beach has a long pier where guys are fishing all day and night. There is an avenue of eclectic stores and restaurants along the way, leading you to Muscle Beach and the skate park.It’s a hodgepodge of culture, interesting to say the least.Luxury and high end it is not, an experience it most certainly is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HerbertEdgewood
30,Fun all around!!,"A good strip of beach with lots of fun things around. Bicycles, scooters etc are available for rent and one can enjoy them on the special tracks available for them. Sports activity like volleyball and basketball available. If you are into body building, the muscle beach area is also there. Street performers also entertain the crowds off and on. The beach and water activity also available. Apart from these activities abundant shops, eating places, restaurants, souvenirs etc are available. Behind the boardwalk ample parking available for 10 to 15 dollars for the day. Overall a fun place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sainbasha
50,No other beach like this,"People with all colours playing basketball together,old and young playing music together,fashion and hip and long hairs and very old hippies together!!!Biking,rollers,skateboards and surfing.Lots of small stores and places to eat and hear music live and not.I really havent seen anything like this!!!Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elklix
50,Something You Must Experience At Least Once,"This iconic location is something everyone has heard of by the age of 15 and is a must see for its loveable oddities and quirkiness. As soon as you arrive on the boardwalk, be ready to be approached by hustlers and funny smells - yeah that smell. It is a great place to walk through and experience so many awesome people and places in the world. This location is used in so many movie locations I cant count anymore so that part of it is fun too. Muscle beach, the skateboard park and open lawns of Venice beach are all there for the gazing> Enjoy yourself and dont miss it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlsEatsExplrs
20,Not what i expected,"We walked here from Santa Monica and its a comfortable walk, as you enter the Venice beach area you really start to see a lot of homeless and almost a community of people down on their luck. I didn't feel threatened or scared in anyway by this but surprised by the volume. All the stores are selling cheep tacky souvenirs or cannabis related products, again no issue with this but i thought with its bohemian history there would have been more niche stores and vendors.Maybe my expectations were too high",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMACCA
20,Loud and filled with Tourists,"We have went there as we expected to see a nice beach and attempted to see the ""Muscle Beach"", however We haven't found either.The beach promenade is overvilled with Tourists and cheep shops. The Muscle Beach was deserted. Not sure why.If you attempt to park your car then expect a 12-15 dollar price tag. The only surprising think we found where run down buildings along the beach (most of them deserted) and a lot homeless peopleIt is simply not worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattmanLondon
30,It’s definitely not Italy,"I give Venice Beach 3 stars because there is some interesting modern history to the place, but it’s dirty and there are homeless galore.Arnold used to pump iron here in the 70’s and muscle beach is still alive and well, pretty cool. The boardwalk is full of touristy shops selling t-shirts and souvenirs. On a busy summer day it is a good place for people watching, but Venice is over hyped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coaticook
40,Still a bit chilly when we visited but the beach looked very nice,"I like this beach because it is wide/spacious. It is located close to the boardwalk, so it is not isolated/secluded, which not everyone may like. If you don't want to sunbathe - watch the surfers - so much fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiewaa
30,Like the zoo but with people,"In my opinion, this place is worth a visit just to people watch. One of the greatest assortments of freaks on earth. As long as you know what to expect and don’t have to use the bathroom you’ll be in good shape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwcheryl
30,"""Curiosity for Family""",I've been here only one time and I can see why. Vendors selling expensive souvenirs and food. You can also rent bikes to ride the entire boardwalk all the way up to Santa Monica Pier and back. Handicap parking is free. It's all hype for the tourists. IJS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebonycowgirl
40,Strolling the Boardwalk,"Venice Beach has a fun atmosphere of a little bit of everything. Walk along the boardwalk and you have no lack of vendors, restaurants and weight lifters. Fun place to spend an afternoon strolling and watching the skateboarders and bicyclists. Sit on an outdoor patio to people watch and really get the flavor of Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbyjb
20,Ok I Guess,"I mean, this beach is ok because it is on the ocean and in California obviously with lots of shops and eats etc..... BUT, due to the heat and sheer amount of traffic, there is so much trash smell and it just doesn’t seem that clean when you compare it to some other beaches in Oregon, Western Canada, South/Central America, or the Mediterranean. So unfortunately only a two star. Sorry....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benjamint509
50,Had to visit this famous beach,"Rented one of those bikes, you see everywhere and rode along the pathway to Santa Monica pier, very cool and easy pace. Stop and see what catches your eye.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joe_canuck1
30,Typical tourist area,"Venice beach was pretty cool, about 8 dollars a day to park which isn't too bad. Nice shops, clean beach. Homeless people swarm this place thought, trying to sell you crap. A ton of crazy people talking to themselves l. Washing there clothes in the public bathrooms. Not a high class place but other than that it has a good atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775courtneyk
30,Lovely beach with a twisted flair,"After hearing so much about Venice Beach I had to see it for myself. I encountered a large sandy beach, with a spectacular coastline and a lot of diverse people having that typical LA flair. Although I didn't stay for all too long, what really stood out was that there were quite a few homeless people around the beach area. I would recommend doing a bike tour up along the coast to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhoevding
30,Beautiful beach,This beach is beautiful and huge and has proper sandy sand. That was lovely. But the other stuff around it is a bit of a disappointment. No trendy cafe with a view of the beach that I could find. I think businesses could really develop that area a bit more to sell more than the general tat on offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvitaKnits
40,Fun if you know what you're getting into,"We've traveled all over the world and one thing that is for certain is people either love or hate Venice Beach, CA. Current home of Muscle Beach, which I'm glad hasn't been torn down, former home of bohemians such as Jim Morrison, Venice has a certain je ne sais quoi that alot of places don't have. If you're looking for a ""beach"" experience and want to frolic in the water, Venice is not the place to do it. Sure you can walk on the sand but the boardwalk is where it's at. Covered with everything from knick knacks, tshirts, mom and pop stores, homeless tents and restaurants it's a unique and vibrant scene. You can walk, ride a bike or even take an electric scooter, I know they look annoying but they are SO much fun to ride, up the beach path to Santa Monica Pier which is only a stone's throw away. But there is only one Venice. The Abbot-Kinney block is also only several blocks away from the beach and worth it if you're looking for bars and restaurants. Just grab an electric scooter and you'll be there in no time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarriedNoChildren
40,Interesting Experience,"Lots of people, lots of vendors, lots of restaurants, lots of sand.We took a tour to reach this beach and only got to visit for 45minutes. It was a Sunday afternoon, so very busy.We wanted to experience the atmosphere and see the Pacific Ocean since only seen the Atlantic. Unlike the beaches back home, to ocean was far away and we didn’t have proper footwear to walk in the sand. The views were interesting enough. There are some strange people and things you will see but we did still feel safe. We did get to grab a quick bite and shop for souvenirs a little which was just enough for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4Life
50,A day isn’t enough!,Had to walk the Venice Beach Boardwalk and I shouldn’t have been surprised by the Marijuana Marketing....Took the Oceanfront Walk and had a delicious smoothie at muscle beach.Such an interesting place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770nickis
40,Lovely atmosphere,"This is one of the most crowded and visited beaches of LA. It has the famous Muscle beach and the walk along the beach is amazing.Absolutely good vibes. A lot of sports fields (volleyball, basketball, tennis, gym) and the view during sunset is just amazingSome good coffee shops also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825bayramt
10,Don’t understand why you would come here,People review this and love it and take their kids but I certainly wouldn’t. Full of homeless and places offering weed and really seedy. Not even clean. Certainly has character if you like that sort of thing. Lots of security riding around which speaks volumes to me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morago675
40,Iconic beach,Iconic beach to visit to experience California. It's not a nice clean beach to go lay on and enjoy water . It's a place you visit to see quirky people. Artists and street performers . It's best to visit on the weekend for full experience. I love to go get slice of pizza and buy incense .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabeths485
40,It was a fun day and hightlight of the trip,"We stayed in Santa Monica, rented bikes and rode to Venice Beach. It was the highlight of our 4 day trip. Me and my 13 Year old daughter enjoyed watching the street performers, enjoyed lunch and a wonderful margarita right on the beach. There is a wide variety of shops to check out.**Yes it is still Venice beach and there is a lot of weed smoking going on. But we found this at every beach we went to on our trip.Hindsight, I would have saved the money and stayed in Venice Beach. The Lodging is cheaper, food is cheaper, and there is lots more to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DESYLAY123
50,My kids love it here,"So it’s not your run of the mill place you might set out to for entertaining your kids. Life is very real here. Kids exist here too and can have a great time. It takes awareness and being an adult for your kids to have a great experience. This place is what you make it. I personally like it and think that we (anyone coming here) can make it our own, treating others how we want to be treated, having a laugh, lending a helping hand. So those things here and you’ll have a great time here, I guarantee it. Lots to do in close proximity too! 👌🏖🙏🌅",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilmV7631SN

30,Venice Beach didn’t do much for me,"Had a few hours to kill and went to Venice Beach, Los Angeles, CA. People watching OK. Pleasant weather and walk to Santa Monica. Touristy and busy. Reminded me of a California like Myrtle Beach with an international flair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B4419PYrobertc
30,Its definitely a must! But beware!!,We had a stroll along the front for a few hours getting Photo’s with the gym boys checking out the skate park and shops!! BUT BEWARE!! The t-shirt “print shop’s” a t-shirt is $16+ bucks But the print your looking @ 36+ bucks I got stung not like me 🧐🥊 total for 3 nice t’s $140 ooooooooch! But it’s America it gave the meaning to the “HUSTLE”,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ossscar
20,Very seedy and run down,"This place is ""well past its sell by date"". Dirty and seedy with a pervading odour of cannabis. Try not to get run over by skateboarders. Go on a few miles to Santa Monica would be my advice and give Venice a very wide berth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wizzo2016
50,3 hour layover at LAX turned into a quick beach trip,We had a three hour layover at LAX on the way to Vegas and decided to Uber to Venice Beach for a cup of coffee at Menotti’a and a chance to people watch. We were to early in the day for the muscle beach crowd but had a great time watching the skateboarders. I’m a Door’s fan and took a few moments to reflect on the chance meeting of Jim and Ray at Venice Beach after their UCLA film school days... ghosts of rock history past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brlittle
40,Stayed two nights,"We stayed in Venice beach near the pier. The beach is beautiful and clean. I noticed a lot of families (Saturday and Sunday) since it was warm and sunny. Walking north towards Santa Monica on the concrete path is where things become commercial with all of the T-shirt shops and street vendors. There is also a big skate park which is cool. Even at just over 70 degrees the sun was intense and it wouldNot have been an enjoyable stroll to Santa Monica- so we took at pedicab (bike) great use of $20.I am happy we stayed at the Inn at Venice Beach on Washington. It was close to some casual restaurants, a small Starbucks, a convenience store and about a 3 minute walk to the the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365marthal
40,Los Angeles,"Venice beach is a long strip with dozens of local shops who rent bikes sell souvenirs and other sorts of products. There are also local people selling there hand made goods such as paintings, monuments etc. The beach has several paid parking locations and is patrolled by police. Good for families and friends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bin3abdalla
50,"Yep, Venice Beach is as weird as they say - but wonderful!","We stayed at the Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach and took in the local sites. Walking on the boardwalk, end to end, is a must for people-watching: rich, poor, young, old, the beautiful people and the wannabees, roller-bladers and bikers, walkers and sleepers, artists and athletes - they’re all here. Check out the “muscle beach” area for some amazing acrobatics on the rings and some cool parcour, and check out all the local artists on the boardwalk and the funky shops. Be careful of your possessions: there are tons of people here who would gladly relieve you of your wallet and watch if you let them, but if you keep an eye out and keep your stuff in interior pockets, you should be fine. Enjoy the kaleidoscope of Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyC870

40,They've Cleaned Up The Place,"I went to Venice Beach for the people watching after not having gone there in years, and I was surprised that it's a bit more family-oriented than it was in the past. The tee shirts in the shops weren't quite as shocking to me, but maybe it's because we live in a world where news is entertainment and reality TV is a thing. I got a henna tattoo on my arm and my adult kids took me for an ice cream at Ben & Jerry's. It was nice to walk around and people watch on a Sunday afternoon! Yes, we even saw the Pacific Ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edyrp
50,Cold but beautiful with nosy seagulls,"This was our first visit to a proper CA beach (we went to Marina first, it doesn't count as its so tiny). Loved the waves and the pier - it was windy and cold (went in Feb). Still my 4 year old loved it and wouldn't leave without playing in (freezing cold) water - his joy was so pure that nothing else mattered.Later we did hear that this beach isn't safe - but we didn't witness anything odd during our afternoon there.(Beach parking was available on the Friday afternoon that we went there - $8)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AniHari
40,Fun to see,It was so cold in April with the breeze off the ocean. We paid $20 for parking when we could have done the beach parking for $8. Bathrooms were disgusting. People were actually in the ocean boogie boarding and surfing. Waves were awesome. Afterwards we did a walk to Washington St to get dinner. Younger crowd for the most part.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnette27
50,Walk from Venice to Santa Monica,"We walked from Santa Monica to Venice but think it would have been better the other way. It’s a lovely walk but got a little seedy in parts towards Venice but that didn’t take away from it. Still a lovely walk, just busier down the Venice end and right up at the Santa Monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L4418SZac

If you like skate boarding or roller blades then this is it.Cement like basin just for skaters of all ages.Along the beaches you meet all kinds from performers to vendors to restaurants.lots of shops selling souvenirs to bike rentals.Take an afternoon stroll and see the sights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HART6591
40,Sacrifice Your Senses,"So whilst staying in L.A. we took a ride to the beach. Keep an open mind if you dare to visit because you are gonna see and meet all kinds of people from all walks of life.It's what I describe as an attack of your senses. The people, the music, the sights and the atmosphere are just something else.We visited by day and parked for $6, all day parking. I didn't visit at night.Keep an open mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nige_863

10,Dump,"Should be renaming this place Tramp beach. The whole beach is lined with down and outs and drunks. Nowhere decent to have a drink or food, awful place. Hermosa beach isn't far away and us FAR superior to this",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigstref
10,Very underwhelming,"Not a desirable place to visit, it was dirty with rubbish and had a lot of homeless people . We didn't feel comfortable there walking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseMarcB
20,Tacky,Tourist in need of a tshirt? Perfect spot. Casual fine dining on the beach? Not so much. Better to visit beautiful Venice canals for a relaxing stroll. Disappointed with beach area. Smelly and unimpressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683suzanner
50,"Sun, Beach, Water and ""Freaks""","Venice Beach is one of the major attractions of Los Angeles. The beaches are nice. I played basketball there for 30 years- so I am a local visitor.....If you want to walk the boardwalk you will encounter a tremendous cross-section of people. Long hair-no hair-tats-piercings-and more. There are a numerous amounts of of vendors selling food to art and jewelry. You can also stop and view some live entertainment. Bring a few dollars to ""tip"" the peeps-that's how they earn their money......It's fun and relatively SAFE....Always watch your back in any big city.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markclewis

40,The Symbolic Beach that is a Los Angeles Landmark,"For decades this beach has entertained millions of people. For generations, the magic continues. It's your chance to mix with famous people and ""want-to-bee's"". The famous Muscle Beach draws the curious from all over the world. Parking is bad but it is worth the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesbC9833HM
30,Very colorful beach and people,"This is a beach I would not like to spend the summer on. In April was fine but in summer it is probably very crowded. I loved the canals - the Muscle beach is really rusty, not sure what is the hype about. Check out the street art, it is really nice. Not so nice is the smell of Cannabis everywhere ;).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YNNYN
50,Boho exciting Venice,"When I want something different, a little flair to my day, I head over to Venice beach.A place where you can bargain hunt, ride bikes, eat yummies and shop for incense or stones and crystals. My favorite is walking past the drumming circle. A bunch of music lovers that appreciate a good tune and have a positive disposition, mostly moving to the music, contributing to the sounds or dancing.. It's a nice, healthy and beautifully simple way to connect and enjoy the beach and LA lifestyle. I highly recommend.xo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luxbohemiantraveler
30,Not everyone's cup of tea.,"Venice beach has always been emblematic of the ""LA lifestyle"" and like many things in LA, the image is better than the reality. While you will find beach, sun and a hip vibe, you will also find aggressive panhandlers, homeless camping in the strand and questionable art and performers. But, if you want to experience a bit of the LA scene, it's worth an afternoon stroll. I would caution that ifif you have young children, they might see things that as parents you might not want to ex",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlC8530VB
10,Depressing,"I visited out of curiosity but was unimpressed. Depressing place, better spend your time elsewhere...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/158wietsev
40,Get off the Boardwalk,"Venice Boardwalk itself is essentially a tourist trap. Blocks of stuff few people want, crowded, even the fabled Gold's Gym mostly has muscled men posing for pictures and money, BUT the actual beach is long and flat and just a 5 minute walk away is Abott Kenney full of fun restaurants and funky shops. And I much prefer walking up and down the cute residential streets to see the historic beach houses. So combine it with other things, it can be part of a fun visit to that part of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdunn308
20,Went for a walk down the boardwalk and through town,"Very disappointing. The further we walked down the boardwalk the worse it got. So dirty, garbage everywhere. The smell was beyond awful.

40,lovely place where you can spend all day,Imagine you are walking by the sea where you can shop and wine and dine in a peaceful and fun environment. I took the shore to santa monica pier and enjoyed every yard of it. There may be some troubling scenes for families as you are exposed to cannabis centers or other drug related stuff but still worth to spend a day if you really enjoy outdoors. I parked a few meters behind the sea strip just for 10 bucks a day. Walked around sports facilities and beach where ı took beautiful pictures and then had a lunch on santa monica pier after a half an hour walk. If you like you can also rent bikes for a faster ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erolt657

40,Fairly clean beach close to LA,"Wide and sandy beach next to famous (or not so much) beach walk. There’s plenty of cheap car parking available (at 4 usd flat fare).

Not too much shade, so be ready with plenty of sun block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Nobody_1979

It’s a beautiful stroll on a sunny day, you can hire a bike to make the sightseeing a bit faster or just lay on the beach the whole day - remember the sunscreen 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rapeli
30,Uncomfortable place to be for me...,"Everyone told me to go to Venice Beach. That it was interesting. But don't go after dark, or alone. It was a very busy spot on a Tuesday afternoon. Valet parking was $15 but there were other options that were cheaper. I was in LA for three days and this spot made me the most uncomfortable. I'm just a sheltered country bumpkin, I guess. The smell of cheap weed was everywhere and so strong. Skateboarders flying through as well as bicyclists, motorized scooters, and roller-skaters. Bathrooms are a little yucky so go before you come and for the love of God, do not go in those bathrooms without shoes. Ugh. There were men randomly handing out CDs as people would pass by. I've encountered this in NYC so knew to keep walking but my husband was like ""oh, yeah, whats this??"" lol Then he takes it, the guys says he wants to autograph it. He does and then demands a donation. I'm saying no thank you and trying to keep walking but my husband has already been sucked in... LOL. They got mad because we didn't give them money. I was a little nervous but I also do not handle confrontation well. Especially with strangers. I feel like most people will love this place as it really is very interesting seeing everyone and all the little shops down there. But... if you are a country bumpkin like me, you will likely not want to come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaB906

Good thing Venice Beach was nearby. it was “the” place to be it has a true LA vibe we rode motor scooters called birds which were awesome and saw so much.

10,Major disappointment,"I was very much looking forward to seeing the famous Venice Beach but I was horribly disappointed. It seemed like every second shop along the beachfront was a medical marijuana shop. It was filthy and the smell was most unpleasant. There were numerous pop up stalls that can only be described as cheap and tacky. By contrast, I found neighbouring Santa Monica to be lovely. Save yourself a trip and give Venice Beach a miss. If you really want to tick it off your list, travel there by train rather than the bus as the bus takes well over an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodidella
30,Maybe Not The Best Place To Go By Yourself,"Whelp, lesson learned. Going to Venice Beach solo is really just an invitation to get harassed. I think there was a lot to see & do, but really my goal was to make it back onto my tour bus in one piece. I will say that the food stands looked really delicious but many weren't fully open when I got there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Action_Jackson2
30,"Cool experience, dirty beach","Great: people watching. The views. The sailboats on the water. Walking along the beach.The not-so-great: the beach is dirty (we walked past a lot of trash - including finger nail clippers?!). I wasn't into the idea of using those bathrooms, so we stayed long enough to explore and enjoy and then moved on. Parking near the beach is expensive. $9-25 depending on where you find a spot.I'm glad we went, because going to Venice seemed like something we had to do on our trip to LA for a long weekend, but it definitely didn't rank on the beautiful beaches list, unfortunately!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
10,Unsure why this was recommended as a stopover from the airport,"We hired a car when we landed in LA and had a few hours to kill before checking into our hotel. I had read that Venice Beach is a great place to do this. We arrived and to say we felt that the opposite was true is an understatement. Granted it was early in the morning, but the place was filthy, there was a lot of vomit and urine around. I am not sure why people recommend this as a place to kill some time from the airport. Throughout my whole month in the USA I have never felt so uncomfortable. We left after about 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J-Bird86
40,"It’s venice. It’s dirty, and filthy and fun. Don’t swim in the water though.","Love, love, love Venice beach. But the prices are getting pretty high. I used to come here for all my down town La purchases since t was a little more fun than driving to the city. But everything’s getting overpriced. So I deducted a star. Still love it though. Love the energy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazmineK15
20,Dirty and unhealthy !,"This place has the capacity to get 6 stars but unfortunately at this moment I can not give it more than 2 stars and even that only for the beautiful ocean and God given natural beauty.The place is run down by so many homeless people with their trash, tents and litter all over the place. It smells bad and it is not healthy, it is skid row on the beach!Good luck if u want to use a bathroom, I wouldn't because they are so unhealthy and there is no sign of higiene anywhere.How could the city of Los Angeles let such a naturally beautiful place get so run down is beyond my humble understanding.So gear up, put a mask and your gloves on if u want to visitGreat potential going to waste on a daily basis, what a pity !!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanian1234
10,Unclean,We took a tour of the LA hot spots and this was the only stop that was disappointing. It just seemed so run down and dirty. We much preferred the Santa Monica pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieU762
40,"Fun, but not for everyone","OK, I lived in Venice for years and find it to be a wildly interesting area, but it's not necessarily for everyone. It tends towards ""adult"" and ""permissive"" rather than family-friendly, though probably would have been OK for my family. Maybe not yours.It's colorful, different and open. Incidentally, I would not actually come here to go to the beach. If you want to go to a beautiful beach with clean sand and great surf, there are far better in Los Angeles in both directions.Parking on summer weekends can be challenging. The parking lots are small and street parking is near impossible as the area immediately around the beach is mostly residential. Better to take a car, use the bus, or walk from the light rail stop in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgO2056FX
20,"Just ok, but could of skipped it.",I would have been fine with skipping Venice Beach. Weed shops everywhere... and seemed dirty to me. I liked the shops and the views are amazing though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cjervey2014
50,beautiful beach,absolutely enjoyed every minute spent here. Lots of talented artist. food vendors and shops. It is just what you see in the movies. I definitely recommend Venice Beach boardwalk when visiting LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryr50
50,Great beach something for everyone,"We have recently returned fromA visit here love this place has great atmosphere bohemian style stalls selling all sorts of art and crafts, street performers. We did try and hire a bike to ride the famous trail along the beach but didn't take our passports and you do need id as we went to two and were disappointed The toilets public ones along beach are not that cleanEither it's a great place to ppl watch and take In the atmosphere we parked nearby cost 20 dollars for a few hours but there are others cheaper. Also see muscle beach workout area well worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosewarr1106
50,Amazing views,"The board walk is amazing. So much to see. We walked down the whole board walk. Make sure you carry cash if you plant to buy anything, since most vendors don't take cash. Make sure you check out all the spray paint art!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OttesenL
50,Fun in the sand,This is a great sandy beach with loads of space. There are people selling wares along the boardwalk and even people playing music. Kids love all the sand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rimohler
50,Nothing else like it!,"This spot is an amazing experience. You are guaranteed to see a crazy mix of people all having a great time. The beach is great and there is tons of space to relax. The boardwalk is very busy with vendors, street performers and homeless weirdos. Truly an amazing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorettaBoy
50,Always a good time,"I love going to Venice beach. The mix of people is half the fun. If someone is visiting from another state you must take them here. I always get my incense here. Great place to do some shopping, eat a meal, get some sun, and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redhead691869
20,do not confuse beachs,"Traveling down Washington Blvd from Marina Del ray. When you get to pier and head left to channel, everything is great, wide beach with plenty of sand dollars. If you go to pier and turn right towards Venice....whoa what a dump. Very sketchy. Lots of homeless, very dirty and trashy. loads of junk shops and disgusting eateries. Muscle beach is terrible, $10 to lift on outdated rusty machines. Only cool part is the skate park....wow loads of talent. All bike rental places have junk ($18 a day) and the newest thing is the Bird electric scooters, these things can been rented by anyone and are everywhere. My son rented one and loved them. We rented bikes and traveled all the way to Santa Monica. The free pier is very crowded so we ventured into town to 3rd street Promenade and loved it. Very clean and tons of shopping. We then continued our bike ride to Palisades beach which was deserted but saw many sea lions. All total 12 mile bike ride from Marina Del Ray. Unfortunate you have to pass thru Venice beach area....yuck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeirman
10,What a filthy dump!!!!!!!🤢,"This place is NOT what you see on TV or in brochures. What a filthy dump !!!!Once you get by all this the beach is very nice, but don't go near the only public washrooms. The state should blow these up 🤢Go to Santa Monica same beach cleaner nicer area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rvhappyer
40,Mixed bunch 😳,"We stayed in the area , it’s fun to people watch. Beach amazing, lots of strange people and homeless people. Don’t go if your easily offended . Pot smoked freely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLGTRD
50,Great Afternoon,"We walked over to Venice from Santa Monica. It's a bit of a trek - about 30 mins but so worth it. Beautiful walk along the beach - you can also rent bikes pretty much everywhere in this area. Venice is interesting. There are a lot of characters which makes it great for people watching! Lots of little shops, restaurants. Im not sure I'd want to stay in the area but it's a great place to visit. A must do when you visit LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinecK8063OK
30,Perhaps on a hot summer day,Without a crowd to people watch there isn’t a lot to see or do here. A little dirty and run down. We’ve all seen it in movies so you may go just to check it off the list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markandcathycalgary
40,Nice place for a quick visit,"It was good to see muscle beach and have a bit of a play on the equipment behind the gym. There's lots of shops along the beachfront selling the usual touristy stuff, but it's fun to wander for a bit.It was a cold day, so wasn't that fun to play at the beach...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginamcbina12
50,Beachy and real,"Nice visiting in the “off” season. Too chilly for the beach to be crowded, and perfect for walking/ riding/etc. love the boardwalky vibe. Not put-off by the homeless— if I were homeless I would want to be here too, I never felt unsafe or threatened ( i was not here at night, though, so cannot speak to that). Didn’t buy anything but like to see that folks can still sell their own handiwork. Nice cafes to eat & people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvmtraveller
30,Scary!,Venice Beach was a bit weedy for me - the smell that is. Stinking of cannabis and with no toned bodies exercising in the muscle gym it was a bit of a disappointment. Could have watched the skate park all day though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56geraldinef
10,Don't bother going,"Not a very good area. We walked from Santa Monica and not worth it. Only good thing was Gold's Gym. If a bodybuilder, definitely stop in otherwise don't waste the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjw893
10,AVOID VENICE BEACH,Visited today and it was scummy. Loads of homeless and down-and-outs. My friend was conned by one of the many t-shirt stalls. STAY AWAY! she was duped out of $50 for a printed tshirt. She was properly hustled by the vendor with shpeel and initial flattery. When she asked for a refund the mood changed and her request was refused. The same tshirt was $9 next door. We spoke to the police but they said it was a civil dispute. In hindsight Venice beach was not worth the hassle. There are better beaches and nicer vibes elsewhere. Homeless everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tilly57
40,"Always a good, cultural experience","We visited Venice Beach every time we return to L.A. to see family. One of my favorite places to wander. No fake L.A. vibe, just real people. What more of L.A. used to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632frederickd
20,Seedy and Nasty,"I’m sure many will disagree with me but I’m going to say it- Venice Beach is seedy and nasty. The glorification of criminality, drugs, and vagrancy does not make a place a den of diversity as some have said. As a husband with pre-teenage daughters I am not comfortable in a place such as this!! It is NOT family friendly. Now we did walk down to the water and the views are spectacular of the pacific and the hills! However finding the same views at a safer and friendlier area is worth finding it! Parents and family folks please beware!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinsGirls
50,This beach is massive,"This beach is massively wide. There is plently of space, not crowded at all.Avoid the bathrooms as they seem to have people living in them. Great place to take your family and have fun in the huge waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441kristyr
50,Fell free to be yourself,The beach is huge and the variety of people is amazing. Here you and hangout and just be yourself because no one will actually take notice between you and the rest of the exotic people at the beach and the boardwalk!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larskl2015
40,A must visit!,"Well you have not been to Venice beach if you have not been at this interesting area. Muscle beach, the volley ball area and skating area was all very interesting. You will see all walks of life and some great street shows. Everyone is trying to make a buck there and you can find some really good restaurants and Ice cream. Parking is hard to find and will cost you, but its all worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swazijumbo
20,Gorgeous fews.. but felt unsafe in this area,"When we travel I take a six mile run a few days a vacation and on my run I ended up at Venice Beach around 8 am two days in a row- different routes. Although the beach was beautiful, I would not recommend this area. I felt unsafe and the bar area of Venice reminded me (the smells etc) of a fair of carnival the morning after.. I ran through that, out across the beach and up on the Pier and after two days doing this.. I decided to not run a third day. I would try a different part of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennifermq
20,Avoid if you’re with your kids,"My husband and I visited Venice Beach many years ago and thought it was great. We loved watching the roller skaters, the people working out at muscle beach, etc. flash forward at least 15 years, and we visited with our boys (14 & 8). While the beach itself is fine, the boardwalk is pretty trashy, filthy bathrooms,tons of pot, etc. Not my first choice with my kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyJV
50,February - booking hot! Beautiful place,"Spent the morning here before my flight home. An incredible beach with great views. Impeccably clean and miles of golden sands. A real traditional American beach. Great views of the mountains, Santa Monica Pier and Santa Monica itself. Just stunning. Wish I’d had longer there! 100% want to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemsyLou89
30,Venice Beach,Glad we have been but was not as nice as Santa Monica Beach just up the coast. Lots of groups walking around smoking drugs which made my wife feel uncomfortable. Beautiful beach but I imagine it would be a dangerous place in the evenings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pabloelmacho
50,Tons to see and lots of people watching,"Interesting place to visit and see local sights, street performers, skatepark with some talented boarders. My kids loved the visit we had here and were entertained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855conniep
40,Venice Beach where the City meets the Sea,"Venice is a great day trip or even half day depending where you are staying in LA. Parking is sometimes difficult and expensive but the bike riding is excellent and the people watching can be great fun. You can park at the Venice Pier, Santa Monica Pier or on the street if you are clever and patient. I recommend you bring or rent bicycles and try to go as far North as the Santa Monica Pier and as far South as Marina Del Rey. Just walking along the beach front and seeing the street performers, skate boarders and general freak show is fun but you have to walk your bike if you are not on the designated path. There are great places to eat along Washington Blvd, in Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica and plenty of fast food along the way. Please note that it is often foggy at the beach in the morning in May and June and the water is cold. Later in the summer you get a full day of sun and the water warms up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
50,Lots of Fun in the Sun,The beach is only a part of the Venice Beach experience. There are great shops and restaurants. On the beach there are performers. You never know who will enhance your day at the beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenv764
40,Visited during summer time,"Good place for a stroll.. exercise enthusiasts abound, hotels, nice and not so nice. Good area for multi racial foods from pizza to sit down restaurants of all types and all ratings. Sunny, cloudy or overcast,always busy boardwalk, all ethnicities and walks of life. Cheap treats and eats to visual entertainment of the stunning beaches , shops and bodybuilding exercise areas. Watch homeless, there are some, most friendly, but be aware. Lots of public low cost things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramonvjr
20,Extortionate parking,Someone in a uniform waves you into this carpark only to be charged over the top fees...we were staying for less than an hour but they charged us 25dollars. When we arrived back we saw them charge 15. When we queried the staff were completely rude and dismissive. Park elsewhere...there's a main park on the beach...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d0negalt
40,Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach,Bit unclear about how to get from the beach back through Santa Monica or to the harbour. Still a good and very large beach though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stonerose5
10,very dirty and full of druggies,"i walked around here with my young kids and teenagers and it was very dirty from the moment we got out of the car. we walked up on the sidewalk and there were stores with inappropriate clothing, dirty food, stores selling weed, and a ton of homeless people. i felt uncomfortable and i know my family did as well. my young kids wanted to walk on the beach but i would not let them for fear of needles in the sand. there are homeless people, beggars, drug addicts, and crazy people. would not recommend to visit. there are many other beaches in LA that are a lot nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familyvaca_13
50,A great spot to experience the not so fancy LA beach,"This is a true LA beach experience. Lots to do or just people watch. Nothing fancy. Great to ride bikes, scooters or skateboard. Also has a great free skatepark right on the sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerWise
20,Interesting...,"GladIi have seen it once, but nothing compels me to visit it again. Once is enough. Almost a carnival feel to it. Parking is crazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jvreming
30,Quirky and good for people watching,"I liked walking the ocean walk and looking at the expensive homes and the people. Be prepared to explain what that sweet smoky smell is to your teenagers. You’ll see a little bit of everything here. Grand homes, homeless people, t-shirts galore, buskers, good and bad art, henna, ice cream and taco shops, Peruvian food. The beach is wide and the sand is nice. Water is cold. Parking was $6 at the beach. There is a pier where you can watch people fish. There were a couple of sea lions hanging around begging for fish at the end of the pier. It was fun to watch the hot surfing instructors catching a wave. The marine layer won’t be burn off until afternoon, so dress for the weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachcolorado
40,Trip to muscle beach,"Very cool and loads going on. The outdoor gym, skate park, graffiti and artwork everywhere. We stayed for sunset and wouldn’t recommend that w younger kids. Loads of marijuana vendors. Really neat to see though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151kristied
40,Cool and Commoditized,"I have never been there and it was cool, everything i was expecting was there but it is too commoditized, i would not like to live there. But its okay to spend a day or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eubs
10,Venice Beach,"Outdated, Graffiti, homeless, dirty....Would not recommend.All along the walk path is tattered homeless tents.Place should be bulldozed and scraped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamak86
40,A little bit of everything,Ocean. Quaint little houses on the canals. The hurly burly of a beach town. Every kind of humanity on the winding concrete path where a boardwalk would normally be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psilber
50,Bring your camera!,So many people!! Lots of vendors on the boardwalk. Lots of little stores all along the walk. I suggest you start past Venice and walk your way into the hot spot. Grab a parking spot where you can!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8612MOdonnar
40,Culture abounds,What a culturally diverse place! Spend the day here and enjoy the oceanfront and then do some shopping. Try renting a Bird electric scooter. So cheap and so fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787jeniw
50,Vacation,Very nice location. We spent a cpl hours walking and people watching. Loved the skateboard park. Some very talented kids. The beach is very clean it’s the back streets that are sketchy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crusier4life
10,"Dirty, dated and dangerous","Venice Beach and boardwalk seem to be mainly populated by the homeless, beggars, people on drugs or with mental health problems and people trying to sell poor quality junk. The whole area is rundown, tired and just plain dirty and smells of the many people smoking weed. Definitely not a good area for families and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else for that matter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelj987
40,Cool place to hang out,This place is super chilled. Cafe’s along the boardwalk; musicians and entertainers etc. I’d also recommend heading up to the skatepark - really good atmosphere and fun to watch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPWEsq
50,Nice place to swim and take a day off,"Loved the scenic view of the westernmost coast from this point, blue waters too and find sands. Activities are quite limited when we visited here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navas2002
40,Hmm Interesting,"OK so we did a private tour and were dropped off at Venice Beach so we could have a look around. It was very entertaining to say the very least. There were buskers everywhere, we saw a lot of homeless people, which was a bit disheartening and plenty of souvenir shops. The beach itself was huge. The foreshore was beautifully landscaped with roller skating parks and pathways etc (some were a bit scary so we avoided). Overall it was a very interesting to walk. Definitely worth a look during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teresa700
50,Fun Hike! Iconic!,The Hollywood sign is iconic. Known most throughout the world it is obviously a thing you want to see in LA. My recommendation is hiking up a trail to get there because you can’t really drive up to it anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hhalvz95
50,Super fun but very dirty!,This place is a blast! My friends and I rode bikes and ate ice cream and just truly soaked in the coast. The beach is a little dirty and is loaded with homeless people but it has such a fun vibe!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexwalkuski
50,Visit Iconic Venice Beach on Spring Easter Holiday,"Easter and spring will be gorgeous in los Angeles, we are getting late season rain, the beach will be amazing, and Venice is one of the electric places to be and experience. If you were not alive in the 60's, or 70's and want to experience that era, or miss that time in history visit Venice, It is so much fun. Spend the day walk to Santa Monica. So much to do and see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
30,Just okay,"The beach is just alright as beaches go. The promenade is full of shops selling T-shirts and other tacky tourist souvenirs. It is a sporty beach so there is a skateboard park, squash and tennis courts, basketball courts and of course the world-famous muscle beach section where the bodybuilders train. The beach does smell of urine and excrement in several areas, perhaps a testament to the sheer numbers who live free around the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petern834
10,Its past!,"Nothing to see but poverty, drug addicts and bad odors. You have to walk south to feel good, eat good and breath pure air. Many drug addicts begging for money, trying to rip you of and garbage eatting. Nothing to see, nothing to buy, better to live your memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanv449
30,The Only Saving Grace,"The core Venice Beach area around the Boardwalk is very honky-tonk . . . if you've never been to one, a really short visit will quickly satisfy your curiosity. As other reviewers noted, nearby parts of Venice Beach are run down and sadly filled with those down on their luck.However, the section of Venice Beach around the old canals (by Dell Street) are definitely worth a few hours of leisurely strolling. The homes exhibit distinct styles and pride of place definitely abounds. There are many whimsical and curious touches amidst the well-landscaped residences. These houses are cheek-by-howl, splashed with color, and show off the artistry of the owners.Once you're done, drive off to Main Street and enjoy the better side of Venice Beach filled with cafes and curio shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246cj
50,"Venice Beach 1990's,2000's","I been to Venice Beach it's fun to get outside,and have a walk on the shores or walk around the shops to see what's new.The person from the United Kingdom is right it's a little outdated Venice Beach needs upgrades.Do they still have the guy there from the Congo that jumps in glass that's yells ohgubuga?The Pizza is cool the tattoo shops are awesome beautiful ladies walking around enjoying the good vibes.It's that bad people are selling CD's on the street still you need to upgrade download the app it's free. The Olympic rings are a good feature.The famous Glass house was always my favorite estate to look at when I was in the area.Venice Beach Rocks!-Anthony",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyburns215
40,The real LA,"Whenever I thought of Venice Beach, I had this beautiful beach with amazing houses and shops imagined. The beach is beautiful, house are nice (not Hollywood or Santa Monica like) and you have your typical souvenir stores. It's just the people. Here you see the real LA: a lot of homeless people and drug addicts. It's a shame, but also gives the visitors a real perspective that LA ain't all about the glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larsv165
50,Quirky and fabulous,We hired bikes and cycled through Venice Beach in the sunshine. The stalls and shops and cafes are all quirky and funky and so are the people.Just a cool place to visit. A must if your in LA. Definitely recommend getting a bike and cycling from Venice to Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stivesfoodfan
50,Eclectic and great for people watching,"A complete mixture of people and well worth a visit. Whilst it is true that there are lots of homeless on the street, it isn't really a problem during the daytime and only adds to the quirkiness of the place. The prices seem to be more expensive for food and drinks but that is only to be expected in a tourist location. For safety I would probably advise the beach front walk at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GHUK29
50,Cool Beach,"The weather didn’t help, but our daughters (9 and 2) enjoyed the walk. For most of the part, the beach is clean and has numerous facilities. There are public restrooms but not quite clean and hardly any business offers alternatives. But overall is a beautiful spot and you get to walk and eat nice junk food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785agustind
20,Cheap and nasty didn't feel particularly safe.,In the area so wanted to check out what all the fuss is about Venice beach. My advice would be if you feel the same way don't waste your time.The area is very run down and frequented by down and outs who sit watching the visitors. Every few yards you are bothered by men trying to sell you a CD. The shops are run down and tatty. Doesn't anyone there have a job!Once you get past the 'colourful' characters the beach is quite nice but I would not want to spend a lot of time there and definitely not with children.Parking at this time of the year was between $6 & $10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizp599
20,Less attractive than Southend,"It's quite down-at-heel. When they use it as a backdrop or scene on tv shows, it looks like some up-market happening place. It's not. It's a bit grubby, the buildings are not in great condition, there's a skate-park (whoo) and some other 'municipal park' type stuff and it's a beach. There's also shops / stalls selling tat, like Southend. Warmer than Southend, better sand and it faces the setting sun. But way less class (yes, even than Southend).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillyFogger
40,Interesting and fun,"We had a great time at Venice Beach but, fair warning to people coming with young children, it’s a little gritty. There are numerous tattoo shops and people smoking pot along the main strip - if that bothers you then steer clear. That being said we had fun watching skaters do tricks at the beach skate park and there were lots of fun tourist shops to explore. The beach is beautiful and there are musicians playing every block or so. Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98haleyj
40,Fantastic beach,"This is the second time we have visited Venice beach, its a busy place and certainly has some colourful characters, there is a lot of homeless people around but they do not hassle you for money or food etc, the beach itself is beautiful and clean, the Venice walk itself is full of shops mostly tourist shops selling the same thing, it has lots of things to see, one of which is the skate park where young amd old show off there talent, or you can just sit and chill taking in the sun, the beach parking is quite expensive and there are other cheaper car parks only a few minutes walk, Venice beach has something for everyone and you can easily spend the whole day here, be careful when buying water/drinks/food, try and go off the beach where prices are considerably cheaper, a bottle of water on the beach can cost as much as 8 dollars, if you go off the beach you will pay around 4 dollars, a must see if your in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanhK4442UP
50,cool skateboard park,"We were there in March(still chilly). walked around and saw the skateboard park. cool place to visit. I'm sure in the summer it is really hopping. large beach area and ""beach"" shops all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buzmar86
50,Must go,"This is a must go place, not exactly the beach, the side walk along the beach is a special and interesting place to be. All kinds of interesting people along with artists, some homeless people, lots of tourists and some locals as well. I took the ""Bird"" (Scooter you rent by minute with an app) from Venice to Santa Monica, It was an very interesting ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjmoreira

50,Stroll and enjoy the sites,"Fun area to take a stroll, go north of “Venice” light sign to experience the boardwalk stalls and touristy shops and scattered restaurants as you walk toward Santa Monica, go south to check out the beachfront homes, volley ball players and quieter beach past the Venice pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetHotels
40,You can walk from Santa Monica to Venice beach,Definitely walk from Santa Monica beach to Venice beach. It took me around 4 hours and there are cafés along the beach. This place is perfect for families or couples or even yourself if you want to chill walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301ling
40,Walk along the beach to the marina,Great beach... can get really busy on the main strip with tat shops etc. But a great beach with lots of people watching to do.

20,Over rated,"Nice to visit on a day trip but I would say it is over rated for what it is.

40,Well maintained beach,"This a well maintained and wide beach with plenty of facilities, bike path, life guards, and beautiful vistas. I ran earlier in the morning along the paved path before it got too busy. Can get quiet busy on the paved areas in the afternoon on nice days. My hotel overlooked the beach with great views of the water and mountains to the north. Great place to watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsj5777

40,"When you’re so close, and have a little extra time, you can’t not stop off and see the iconic Venice Beach.","I’ve visited Venice Beach on 6 March 2018 on an almost cloudless day with the temperature about 73°. Walking down the boardwalk was extraordinarily interesting with a diverse and eclectic group of people in the shops and on the boardwalk. Thankfully it was a weekday and was not overly crowded, but I still found the day relaxing as I had no destination in mind, just to take in and absorb the location and the culture. I found it to be worthwhile as I got a little sun, stopped off for a gelato and a bottle of water, and stretch my legs along the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sasmo17
10,Nasty.. don’t go.,"Dirty, dog poop everywhere and homeless. The shops are okay and the food is good, but this is definitely not a place you would want to take young children. We’ve witnessed homeless arguing, teenagers doing drugs on the side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerCabais
50,"Venice: If you do one thing in LA, this is it.","Yeah, I mourn the sleepy little beach town with all it's characters and quirks; but if you do one thing when you visit LA, it should be to visit Venice.I lived in Venice 25 years ago, and it was very edgy. Today, it is unrecognizable. Back in the day, Abbot Kinney Blvd was nothing but a run-down liquor store, boarded-up store fronts and a few shops selling the not-yet-cool midcentury furniture.Today, the street buzzes like Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It's all smart shops and trendy restaurants and coffee joints (personal fave: Intelligencia).Venice has always been a cool hangout, but it maybe choking on it's own self-consciousness. If you go, you can still breathe if the air isn't too laced with smug.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39ronk
50,Awesome place for tourists & locals,"Venice is laidback. The ocean waves are amazing. This is the perfect area in LA for surfers & skateboarders; or people who are more chill and open minded.

20,Better beaches around,"Having traveled to many beaches in Southern California and the Los Angeles area, Venice Beach is one of my least favorite. The beach itself is pretty, but it is cluttered with junky shops along its boardwalk and is relatively dirty. Parking is limited in the area. I prefer Manhattan Beach much more than here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooken498
30,What a Sideshow!,"After hearing so much about Venice Beach, I was looking forward to visiting. And it was interesting to say the least.

20,Pretty Honky-Tonk,"The beach itself is OK and the pier makes for a good walk, but the adjacent walkways and boardwalk are a jumble of low-end t-shirt, tattoo and trinket shops.

30,"""Don't Need to Go Back""","This beach basically has a little bit of everything. Flea market style stores to the people playing basketball on the boardwalk. Don't use the bathrooms if you can resist the urge. They are DIRTY. Beach was standard beach. This particular day it was really windy, which made the sand kick up something serious. Also, there were a lot of people asking for money on boardwalk. The world-famous Muscle Beach is here, if you're looking for hallowed ground. I prefer beach at Santa Monica Pier, as the whole area is just way cleaner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig1086
10,Just don't,"There's no other way to say it. Venice Beach is yucky. I wanted to shower after we left there. I realize the place is free-spirited and everything goes there, but it was too much for us. Between the smell of pot, homeless people everywhere and general sense of disgust all around us, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The beach is lovely, but we won't go back. Too much ick to get through to even see the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAHLJH
40,Great during the Day. Be careful at night,"Great walk along Venice Beach to Santa Monica during the day.

30,Boardwalk scene,"Took a long walk along the Venice Boardwalk...Everything from the sublime to the ridiculous. The weather was fine, sunny with nice ocean breezes as we walked the length of the pedestrian walkway. Street performers, swap meet type booths hawking sunglasses, tee-shirts, souvenirs, etc. Sidewalk cafes and artisans selling posters and original art work. An excellent independent bookstore, Small Worlk Books, hidden behind a sidewalk cafe, 1400 block. Beware the public on-beach restrooms... they are hideous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebmans

Lots of cheap souvenirs, Very chilled out place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017
40,Good time,"I had a good time visiting Venice Beach even though it is long way from Hollywood. Lots of shops, characters, skateboarders around. Best way to explore the beach is by renting a bike ( I suggest rent a LA Metro Bike). Stunning view of palm trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299saurabhg
30,Must-see in LA,"People probably go here for the boardwalk, street performers, skatepark, and other outdoor type activities. If I have to choose, I would choose to go here over Santa Monica beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HM543
40,Awesome experience,"This was our first time at Venice beach. I was hesitant after a visit to Santa Monica in the past, however, I instantly fell in love with the vibe at Venice beach. Parking was simple (we got lucky and were able to park on the street for free). We had a 6 month old in a stroller but it was no issue maneuvering with her. The boardwalk allows for easy access to everything Venice has to offer...minus the water of course. There was lots of souvenir shops and street vendors. A lot of truly unique artwork and talent was offered. Lots of street performers with some being better than others. There was literally something for everyone. They had dancing roller skaters, skateboarding, bodybuilding, instrumental groups, basketball and tennis, and more. I would go there for the experience itself. We had never been in an atmosphere so welcoming to each individual. Public restrooms were decent but can have long lines. Also didn’t see any baby changing stations. Great authentic food and overall great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandaa921
50,The new breed meets the old breed,"I'm a native Angeleno and there are three things every native Angeleno must experience before they die. One is going to Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm (depending on your budget). Two, gong to a Dodger or Lakers game. Three, hang out at Venice Beach.Why do you ask is that third one important? it's the people. They come from all walks of life and with different ways of thinking and beliefs. The people who sell the little aluminum cans they make into airplanes are as important as the girl walking around with a snake to give it some air. You'll see shops and restaurant and bodies of all types, shapes, sizes and personalities. The nightlife has improved also; if you go along Abbot Kinney Road (Ave.) you'll see millennials moving along, enjoying each others company and eating in both fine dining and the next ""big"" restaurant in town. Go along Windward Ave. towards the beach, and in that two block stretch, there's no shortage of a bar or lounge where you can just chill or go party.The beach itself; what can you say? It is clean, swimmable, and produces enough swells for body boarding and surfing. At first glance you don't expect it to be, but It's very casual and subdued. The beach is also well patrolled and, in a few places, they don't mind toplessness (side boob please, still not Euro-beach)In short, there is no shortage of thing to do, whether a local or a tourist, this accessible piece of land is the place to be. And it's bike and walking -friendy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romplep

30,Venice beach,"Stayed right on Venice Beach for 3 nights, cool place , very eccentric with all types of characters floating around, in saying that a half day visit does the trick, wether it be walking or riding a bike from Venice beach to Santa Monica pier that’s about all the time you need to take it in. Some of the stalls are cool others are just full of crap, hanging around to sunset is worth the wait as each night has great sunsets .

50,Just love it,"From bike rides at a very reasonable price to all the cool and neat things to look at or even purchase. It is like a whole big inexpensive boardwalk area but way cooler and less expensive things to purchase. The jam sessions and music everywhere to Muscle beach where folks are training keeping fit to aggressive games of hand ball and much more. There is something for everyone. Oh yeah did I forget to tell you the beach is right there. Very clean I found a sand dollar still in tact. I always enjoy checking out whats for sale too. You find some really neat things here weather it is mass produced but my fav's are the homemade stuff from jewelry to art to lawn ornaments and much much more.

My son got forced to buy a CD he did not want when he left us for 15 min...The drifters get drunk at night and fight non-stop screaming...police often comes with sirens to bring peace...Stay at Santa Monica or Manhattan Beach but avoid Venice Beach - it is not as romantic as it sounds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DmitryK649
30,Mixed emotions,No doubt the sight is very attractiveAs a tourist you will notice quiet shockingly guys not having an easy life so kind of aggressiveness can appear especially early in the morning-Otherwise it is a window to the ocean and so many nice houses to enjoy and to dream off on the promenade... walk run bike skate roller everything you want to chill out or to practice on a sweating mode,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel423

20,Beatiful decadent place full of homeless and drunks,"The pictore of my 1 year old playing on the park in front of the sea with two drunk people fighting on the parking lot behind was not the memory I was expecting from Venice beach.The place is beatifull with a pedestrian road by the sea. There is a kids park by the sea that my kid really enjoyed and gave the families there an option to the beach.There is a restroom area crowded with Homeless and drunks that literally live there. I would not recomend to use this place as it is really dirty.We had a hard time finding a place on the rest area near the beach that was not used by a homeless to sleep or hang around. You have a police station, but police officers will only act upon violent events, dont expect them to ask the sleeping drunk to leave for you to enjoy the place with your family.We also saw a lot of drug use near place where kids play, something that made me limit my visits to this place. I am not sure what the deal with the place is, but drug use and alcohol abuse should not be allowed where young people or families go.As stated on the title, the place must have seen better times, but know it is in bad shape and with a decadent look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyzon12

Please don't let this come off wrong but I need to mention it because I did not expect this and it may be helpful to others. I expected this beach to be like NJ Ocean Grove (clean and family friendly environment), but instead it was like Atlantic City (a place where the homeless seek shelter on the board walk). Next visit to Cali I will consider a different beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6288EHmonicab
30,A sure first tourist stop.,"Venice Beach is a must-see for those stopping in or new to LA. There is an exercise area with equipment, beach walk shops/restaurants, volleyball nets, plenty of sand to relax (with some shaded areas) and a killer skatepark. Insider tip: the skatepark is famous for being in the Tony Hawk video games and garners a huge crowd. Since this is a tourist hot spot it is crowded with vendors, tourists, and locals alike. Vendors range from tattoo shops, food, tee shirts, local artists, snacks - you name it, its there.Tips: park a little down from the beach and walk up Abbot Kinney Blvd to check out the cool shops and restaurants. Total beach vibes here but major finds like Adidas Originals and local boutiques.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberxapocalypse

In fact, I spent hours playing instruments on the beach one night with a bunch of them and bought a load of beers for them. It was an amazing experience.The boardwalk itself is packed with characters, people selling art, mad shops, craziness... it is what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else. There's food, drinks, everything you need.It;s in the heart of Doors Land - a must if you're a fan and so many nearby places that are equally as cool (Abott Kinney just a kick in the pants away).For some, a couple of hours may suffice - I hung out there for a few days, hit the beach and boardwalk at night and saw no trouble - all friendly, all happy, all totally Venice.Where's your will to be weird?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistersten

10,Terrible experience,"Try to definitely avoid the boardwalk... I took 2 friends that were visiting from Chile and they had the most “Ghetto”, most horrible experience ever! They went into a T-Shirt shop to see if they wanted to buy something. While talking with one of the sales person, she told them that if they got 2 shirts they would get a discount... Well, so they did and when they went to the cashier (who by the way was the owner, middle eastern man) to pay, they paid with a big bill and the owner shortened them with 12 bucks... so they told the owner that the sales person had said that if they took 2 shirts they were going to issue them a discount. So the owner called the sales person and she denied all. Then we told them that we didn’t want the shirts anymore and to give us back the money because we felt scammed they both started shouting at all 3 of us and said that there where no refunds and to just leave...!!! So I’m definitely not going back to that place again!! They worn me before about the boardwalk but honestly I never had any problems... But I definitely don’t want any friends or myself to go through something like that again....Ps: if you look closer into this picture right in the entrance left from the red lifeguard hoodies... you can see the “lady” giving us the middle finger....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/realtor2u

The promenade which runs along side is reminiscent of a fairground: lots to entertain but sadly scruffy and expensive. Car parking is expensive, but there are spots a few hundred metres away, if you are prepared to walk. We stopped for a drink in a side street cafe on our way back to the car. In no way smart! My husband is still recovering from paying $20 for two very small bottles of orange juice, the listed price.

20,Like danger?,"Are you looking to hang with the homeless, skate board in a scary environment, score drugs? Come to Venice! Rode bikes down to Venice from Santa Monica. My friend was asked by no less than 6 guys near the skateboard park whether he wanted to buy drugs. On our walk to get food, saw a homeless community. One of which had been using an old pizza box as a toilet on the side walk. Also plenty of homeless and hippy types living on the beach. And by living on the beach, I mean have moved couches, beds, tables, chairs, etc. to the beach. Several homeless people were passed out on futniture on or near the beach. Did not feel safe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ihateusairways

40,"Beautiful Beach, strip outdated","The beaches of Venice and Santa Monica are beautiful, really nice to spend som time there. The boulevard unfortunately needs a fierce renovation. It is all outdated and soem buildings are wrecked and dirty. A lot of shops and a lot of rubbish they sell. Many homeless people, that is no problem but they make a mess sometimes and does not improve the image of the boulevard. There is 100 times more potential for this beach but stiil nice to spend some time and hire a bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthijsK

Although, some know of it as being just a beach it has everything.. rollerskaters, street entertainment, outside gym, dancers, a funfair, shops, music, restaurants.. have I missed something? Probably, but this is a cool place to hang, even to sunbathe the people watching is always interesting, the place looks as realistic as the gta version..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/309376
30,Busy but fun,"We were there on a very busy weekend and the crowds on the bike path were a lot to deal with; people were running off the path or into each other so you have to be careful. It is a fun path and goes for a long way; there are so many people doing so many things in that area...sunbathing, watching, picnic-ing, eating, walking, shopping, skateboarding, scootering, biking, running, swimming, showing off their muscles...typical beach stuff but with that CA flair...fun to see and experience after hearing about it for so long. The muscle-y guy lifting weights seemed a little like a caged spectacle in a zoo but people were trying to get their picture taken with him and that was all good. I kinda felt for the guy though he was an eyeful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452lesliee
50,Always Fun!,Don't blink because you will miss something else! There are a million things to look at down at Venice Beach!

Even a guy offered us to buy weed!!! We just walked...trying to ignore those things because we wanted to enjoy the beautiful sunset. We're from Chile and it called our attention that there are lots of public restroom and their are clean!!! Without graffities or draws inside...and the most important..they all have toilet paper!!! You can buy memorabilias...but they are expensive. If you like ride bike or skate or just walk along the beach...do it early, after 18hrs I don't recommend you do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cote-Va-Chile

10,Don’t go - rude and abusive,"How things have changed.... Venice beach used to have a fun / alternative vibe to it which was great. I took my family there and was shocked by how bad this area has become. Rude people pushing crap cds at you, overwhelming smell of weed and homeless people everywhere. So... what you to be cool is now dangerous and unpleasant. Take your tourist $$$ elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seancF5493UR
30,"We named it ""marijuana beach""","If you like people watching and laughingThis is a place where there alLeast one of each type of crazy kinds of people.

40,Venice Beach Boardwalk,"If you like to ""people watch"" this is the place for you. One of the most interesting places you can visit in the Los Angeles area to see people from all different aspects of life. There is no charge to visit Venice Beach except for parking and we paid $10 to park for as long as we want (we went during the afternoon so I don't know if it cost more at night or not). The shops along Venice Beach are your normal gift stores you come to expect along a famous beach. The gift shops are more expensive than most gift shops I visit along other beaches in America.The restaurants along the boardwalk were disappointing. There weren't as many as we were expecting. The best part of Venice Beach other than the ""people watching"" are the activities you can do there such as biking, roller blading, skate boarding (they have a skate board park), basketball, volleyball, handball & weight lifting. We saw numerous street entertainers who perform for tips and they like to drag out the performance to draw more of a crowd and pull out ""volunteers"" to be part of the show. Don't be surprised if you see some type of film crew taping some kind of show. Don't forget to get a picture of the iconic ""Venice"" sign that hangs over the street. It hangs at the intersection of Windward Ave & Pacific.If you visit it appeared that the crowd kept getting larger as the day went along (we left around 5pm) so I don't know how crowded it is at night. Venice Beach offers a lot of great photo opportunities so if you're into photography you will enjoy spending time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,Great Beach we some real Characters,Venice Beach is worth a look but with caution there are a lot of homeless & some strange characters along the walk at Venice Beach with some trying to sell you some rubbish stuff but then there are some great little places along the way also. We bought some beautiful wooden crafts which were really reasonable and fantastic. If you are going to Santa Monica it’s certainly worth a look and walk we walked from Venice Beach back to Santa Monica Pier which was only about 30 Minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen9966

30,A Place of Extremes,"Venice Beach ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous, from cheap to expensive, from clean to filthy, from quiet to loud, from depressing to enlightening, from ugly to beautiful, and so on and so on...Pretty much about people watching - walk to Santa Monica Pier and watch people; fascinating. Don't buy anything! Watch the sunset.Make sure you take the opportunity to wander through the canals a couple of blocks inland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CIHTravels
50,Beautiful beach - goes for miles! (Sunday visit January 2018),"We wanted to include Venice Beach in our 2 week road trip!It was amazing - beautiful views, amazing weather and so much to do and loads of places to eat.There are so many different types of people, I loved that everyone had their own unique style.You can download an app called Bird as you will notice lots of people on scooters - the app shows you all of the unused and ready to use scooters near you on a map and tells you how much battery they have left! You walk up to a scooter with your app - scan the QR code and you can use this and leave it wherever when you have finished so that someone else can have a turn! This was such good fun and saved our legs on the walk back to Santa Monica Pier which is about 2km! There was a small fee straight to your card depending on the distance and time travelled.I would definitely recommend a trip to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onlysophie

Just have fun and keep it moving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRAVEBEAR

40,Venice Beach boardwalk,Really interesting area for tourist walk around and just check stuff out. The beach itself is impressive and looked very inviting. A lot of vendors pushing sales and some cheap souvenir products here for sure. It was a pretty cool experience and recommend if you have not done if before.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanosV8
50,Love it,Went for a stroll & an ice cream - This was amazing on a warm day. Can recommend it for families & solo travelers alike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341idab
40,Much to see,"Even in January, which I assume is off season here, there is so much going on at Venice Beach. There are people everywhere and interesting stores. It seems to just blend in with Santa Monica Beach, although maybe I noticed a change in shops between the two. We rode our bikes though the area and seemed to notice a lot of people living in tents and such, or maybe they were just there for the day. Eclectic is the word I'd use here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxpaste
50,Ahhh Venice Beach...non stop entertainment!,"We stayed right on the beach, and we literally spent a day just watching the world parade by...joggers, bike riders, roller skaters, dog walkers, tourists, families, street entertainers, local market stalls...even saw a movie being shot on the beach!Lots of cafes and restaurants, very colourful, the beach is beautiful though there are a lot of homeless locals around during the day.

Don’t believe it.. !! It’s a scam..They will charge you $20 for the T shirt( more if it’s a premium shirt!! ..and who the hell knows which is which! ) AND $25 for the print..The 4 poor quality T shirts cost us$194 and when questioning the cost the guy taking the money said “Sorry mate nothing I can do! “Well we can.. !!! DO NOT BUY from these vendors! If you do? Make sure of price before they print!!They will rip you off!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Themannz
30,Depends on what you're looking for,"Venice Beach is, in a word, unusual. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for. The Strand bike and walk path follows along the shore with beach on one side and shops on the other. Skate parks, ninja warrior obstacles, and playgrounds pop up periodically along this path.If you want a quirky people-watching experience, you'll definitely find that here. Knickknacks and ""art"" are sold from tables lining the pathway. (Some of it is actually pretty impressive while others are just...unusual.) There is an abundant amount of weed among the people who frequent this beach. There is also a large number of homeless communities that form along this beach.But if you want an upscale beach neighborhood/dining experience or if you want a family day at the beach that resembles a postcard Californian experience, I would recommend visiting Santa Monica or Manhattan Beach instead.Side note: there is a large parking lot at the end of Washington Blvd. It's expensive but convenient for the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TT_ND
20,Not so Glamorous,"Good to see, there are a couple of good cafe's for lunch, i recommend hiring a bike to get there. The souvenir shops are cheap and nasty but its good to have a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecksPoint
50,Loveeeee,It’s such a fun place! Great board walk- amazing sun set views and bars! Bring a sweater and long pants in Jan. It got cold. The water was so so cold. Could not swim in it but did put my foot in there. Fried Oreo was great from board walk. Great souvenir shops too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471mandeeph
10,Don’t waste your time!,"This place has changed a lot in the last couple years. Tons of homeless everywhere and weed. Little mini camps in several places. Homeless and bums trying to sell “art work” and paintings from their residences for cash. Want to be rappers and musicians trying to push their CD’s on you.Dirty as he!! too, the homeless don’t throw anything away. My daughter asked why we are even in this area. So disappointing, you’d think Venice Beach would do something to clean it up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matt_paler54311

30,Over rated,"I agree with Zalgariath, ""this place is kind of nuts."" I think our whole family got a bit buzzed on second-hand smoke and for that reason, I would not suggest if for young families unless that your thing.It was very touristy and lots of people looking for handouts. The beach was clean and nice to walk on in the morning. Walking out on the pier was fun, but wear shoes and watch out for fish hooks and dog poop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cckraft
50,A little paradise,"It was an awesome experience! The endless beach, the sun, that ocean, oh and there is even an outdoor gym and skate parks!! What could be better!It is even more beautiful during sunsets! So much locals and tourists but nice atmosphere overall!¡Lo amarás!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingfreak2018
30,Lots to see!!,We came to Venice beach for a stroll up to Santa Monica pier and having been to Miami south beach I would say it's very similar although there is a lot to see here there's also a lot you don't want to see!It's very clean and has a cool vibe although a lot of homeless people flock here in the day so you can get bombarded with people begging - quite common around LA.There's a few coffee shops around but I'd wait until your nearer the pier to eat as there's much better choices. Parking is fairly easy and there's lots of car parks that are fairly priced- be careful with the one man band signs charging you $15 dollars for the day as this is a lot more expensive than pay and display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joeyanna1234
50,Venice Beach,A must! Venice Beach is great by day and also we enjoyed walking up it during the sunset. Fun lively for tourists and nice coffee bars and great people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victorias369
40,Everything you'd expect,"This place is kind of nuts, popular with locals and tourists alike. It is a massive tourist trap but you kind of have to expect that. Oddly the cheapest parking was right on the beach at the official car park. Avoid all the spruikers holding up signs to private car parks on the approach. (At least in March, summer may be different!) Weed, freaks, muscle-bound roid heads, bikes, bladers and a lot of sand. Oddly as a 'beach' by Australian standards for surfing and swimming is is very average, but as a spectacle and place to hang out with heaps of activities, it is a place to be. There was some sort of bike day going on when we visited with cyclists everywhere, great to see. Be aware you are in a tourist trap and enjoy the atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit but won't be everyone's cup of tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath
50,Lovely,"Great tourist beach in LA. So close to LA it’s a must. Plenty of famous sites such as the basket ball pitch, the muscle gym and the skate board park. Lots of beach shops and ‘hip’ shops along the stretch. Lots of local entertainment and people selling cds! Sand was lovely, didn’t go into the water but was great for surfing. For a dip it would be great but wouldn’t say it’s a beach for sun beds as such. Still it’s a must visit and it gets a full 5 stars from me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shauns_Holidays

The Ice cream we had was to die for. The boardwalk is crazy. Its definitely congested and there are a lot of tourists but if you can ignore all the crazy tourists and take this place in for what it is, its a pretty good time! It is most definitely a place you can people watch. Muscle Beach.....its something to see, although I did have my fair share of laughs at these guys and it made us feel a little uncomfortable how into themselves they were. LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbodami
50,Majestic ocean and perfect sand before you. Tacky shops behind you. Watch out for bikes.,Huge clean beach and beautiful (cold) ocean. You can wade or you can surf. Sand is perfect for sand castles. Lots of stores with moderate quality fast/junk/snack food right behind the beach. Also wire enclosed sport courts and weight lifting areas. There is convenient bike rental right there which explains in part why there is constant traffic of bicycles along a path parallel to the shoreline but 50 yards back. But be careful because the bicyclist may not always see you as your cross back from the beach to the shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618isaack

20,Wow what a disappointment!!!,"My whole life I’ve seen LA advertised in such an amazing manner that perhaps my expectations were just too high.First it was blown by the “walk of stars” which is not so glamorous.. then by other sights and then the stop to the famous Venice beach.Walking down the strip we get stopped by people giving free CDs. We were hesitant but they were forced on us and the person said to listen and review on Facebook. I said we would do so... then he tried to scam us for money/donation... I said all I have is a $50 and he was like “oh that’s fine”. We ran fast.Muscle beach is yuk. Kept walking past that. There was just rubbish everywhere, dodgy encounters and I just felt super unsafe at all times.Food was bad, made me sick (Gyro place)One star given for the flags on the beach which we found cool. That was about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielAiello
50,Best beach in the world,"Full of graffiti and art, this beach is unlike any other in the world. It as a character. There are houses behind which are lakes (to replicate the Venetian canals). A market selling quirky stuff, swimwear to tattoo stores, you can expect everything here. Lot of dining options in the vicinity. An open air gymnasium is a perfect place to work out. Expect to see fashion shoots here. But a bit tricky and homeless people are sleeping right outside expensive homes. Not safe after sunset as I was told by friends.

50,Absolutely LOVE This Beach,"We were able to visit ""Venice Beach"" while on a tour of Los Angeles several summers ago. I grew up on North Carolina beaches as a kid & I lived on Mississippi Beaches in my early 20s (+Fla Beaches) & then most of my adult life on a Long Island, NY Beach Town & now back on a NC Barrier Island Beach. Venice Beach is one of the most overall exciting & complete beaches I have ever been to, it combines all of the best of all the beaches into one. Everything from the water & sand to it's Famous Boardwalk, shops vendors, street entertainers was so very much fun. I use to say South Beach, Florida was the overall best until I saw Venice Beach.Anyone visiting the LA area must go to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat
40,Venice Beach,"We recently visited this location in Dec 17. It was very quite, as it was winter but still people around working out. We rode bikes from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and back. Plenty of shopping (souvenir shops). A beautiful spot, would be great to go there in the summer, beach was beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginiaM305
50,Beach Vacation,From street artist to tourists to Angelenos to homeless Venice does not disappoint- rent a bike for $20/day @ the gingerbread court & head out to see the canals for which the town is famous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oreogingy
10,The nastiest beach I have ever been on!!!,"This was by far the nastiest beach I have ever been around. The restrooms are unusable. Doors and locks broken, they have not been cleaned ever!!!!! People started just squatting on the floor in one. Unless you live like that how can you expect families to come down and enjoy themselves??? The muscle beach area was gross and smelled like urine. The boardwalk along there had trouble written all over it. People blaring music the kids really don't need to hear. I had a guy run his skateboard right into my ankle then giggle about it. I guess if your a local and that's your thing, hats of to you. I will head back to the Florida beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Powderburner
40,A must,"Venice Beach is an interesting place, a tripto the 60s. The energy brought by the people and artist make it for a cool experience. The beach is clean & fun for the family! Watching the locals surf and skate board is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yettem2014
40,Whoa!!!! Pretty wild 😜,Definitely not for the faint of heart... all kinds of walk of life here to entertain you. It's a cross of an Artistic cannabis culture meets washed up has been meets buskers ... and by 4 in the afternoon it's pretty wild!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4mdavie
10,Dirty dirty dirty,"I was actually in shock by this beach area. It was disgusting. Filled with homeless people, filled with trash, and people selling cheap things out of tents. It felt like an unsafe area. Just smelled bad. I would not recommend this beach/area at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1656UGkellyf
50,Great fun seaside resort,We actually stayed in at the beach for one night - typical seaside resort with Muscle Beach a main attraction for some. You can hire electric scooters by the trip. Pick one up sign in via your smart phone - ride to your destination and leave the scooter on the pavement. Total convenience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kentishman45
40,Sand or sidewalk?,"Venice Beach is an astounding beach. It is huge! So much sand and room. Gentle slope into the water, well patrolled, ranks well for clean water, very good beach.Venice Beach boardwalk is beach adjacent, full of people especially on the weekend. An absolute tourist place. Many nice shops, even if a little repetitive (t-shirts, sunglasses, tattoos mostly), and restaurants appropriate to a beach atmosphere.The two locations are worlds apart in terms of feel. The beach is natural, relaxed, easy going, the commercial area is built for business, and requires your monetary participation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkane8
40,Great tourist attraction,"Venice beach is one of the ultimate experiences of Los Angeles. It’s theme of surfer America is at an all time high where you can experience the best of people watching. Grab some great food to go from some of Los Angeles’s great restaurants on abbot Kinney, or grab some quick poke at a shop along the beach and sit on the concrete wall and observe! Great surfing, souvenirs shops, inexpensive Mexican made blankets, Kenyan wares, tennis courts, outdoor gyms, long walks or rent a bike and head down the coast! There lots to offer anyone whether you’re a couple looking for a sunset bike ride and dinner or a walk through the canals, or a family planning a surfing/paddle boarding beach day or friends getting together there’s shopping galore on abbot Kinney! Even if you’re solo and want to just go for a walk there’s lots to do here and the place comes alive at night as well. Only downsides: sometimes it can get quite crowded in the summertime and parking is difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BennySD

30,Awesome Views,"We walked down to Venice Beach from the Santa Monica Pier, Awesome view of the mountains and ocean. The muscle beach gym was a bit of a let down as it is very dirty and beat up. Also as others have mentioned there is a very large homeless population in the area as well as the constant smell of marijuana",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnc7200
50,Crazy Spot!,"Excellent for people watching, strolling the sidewalks, looking for junky souvenirs and enjoying just another sunny day in southern California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riskm

More strange people than ever before and the smell of dope was throughout the air.My sons really didn’t enjoy it and we walked back on the beach, so to avoid the strange people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kato-Canada
40,Entertaining walk,"Although we were suckers in a ‘free’ reggae CD sales job, the rest of our 2 and 1/2 hour walk was a pleasant stroll beside the massive beach of the Pacific Ocean.In our 1st mile or so we passed a mostly vacant muscle beach - the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit was a little too cool I guess?Along the east side of the sometimes spilt walk/bike path, T shirt and Knick knack hawkers were sprinkled amongst pricey condominiums.Really enjoyed watching the tight rope gymnasts just before our 3 mile turn around mark at Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmcleanschmalz
30,Interesting but not amazing...,This is a unique beach with lots of people watching and art. It's worth a visit but it's not a place I'd frequent. There are much nicer beaches nearby that aren't so busy or dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldtravelSM
40,An Essential Part Of The California Experience But Be Careful,"Go at the weekend and you will be assured of seeing the good, the bad and the weird aspects of humanity. You will see men with muscles especially at Muscle Beach which is where Schwarzenegger used to hang out. (Try Gold's gym in Santa Monica or look for a big man riding a bike if you want to see him today) You will see girls in bikini's some who should be in them and some who shouldn't. You may see a man juggling chain saws or playing an electronic guitar on a skateboard.You will also see myriad stalls selling T-shirts and various other souvenirs. The better shops are back from the beach which you'll see later on. Do visit the pier and your kids will thank you and maybe even visit the aquarium which is underneath the pier. Ask as you'll probably never find it on your own.I wish I could tell you where to park but I can't. Get there for 9:30am and you'll have more options. Not a place to hang out in the evening. A lot of drugs in the area and users come out at night. This is a spot to enjoy in the daytime before going for a nice brunch somewhere. A lot of good places to eat in Santa Monica and don't be afraid to ask someone for a recommendation for whatever type of food you fancy eating. Closed mouths don't get fed:-) Take water, wear sunscreen, ladies zip up or close your bags and have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB

30,Large beach with plenty people.,"Beach was crowded and plenty of shops and activities along the boardwalk and park.Toilet and shower facilities easy to find, but inadequate and not well maintained.Bustling, carnival atmosphere even on weekday afternoon, plenty working out on Muscle Beach.Overall good beach but need to be better maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewteng
30,Don’t breathe too deep,"My husband & I visited so he could see Muscle Beach. That is a dump. I guess I’m not sure what I was expecting but honestly, it looks dumpy.Venice Beach is quite large & clean from what we saw but everywhere we walked, people were smoking weed. It got quite smelly & tiring. You of course have to pay to park. A lot of lots charge $10/2hours but we found a lot that was $8 until 10 pm. We arrived around 5 pm. There was a sign that said $15 all day. That lot was very close to the muscle beach area. So if you don’t take the first offer you see, you might get a better value.There are places to eat around there but all seemed pretty touristy so we opted to leave & find something away from that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VioletMN
10,Will never return!,"Somewhere I’d always wanted to go and I’ve ticked it off my bucket list and will never return. I get that it’s bohemian but it’s full of homeless people, it’s full of litter and witnessed someone getting their handbag snatched. Just didn’t have a nice vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fairyfairhurst2014
20,Trashy and sad,I was expecting trashy and loud but was surprised at how seedy and sad Venice Beach was. We walked about a kilometre along the boardwalk but there wasn’t much to recommend other than it was a lovely sunny winters day for a walk. It’s a very wide beach so quite a long walk across sand to get to the ocean. Lots of much nicer beaches to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimleyCairns

20,Gone down hill,"My 15 year old daughter, her friend and I visited last spring break for a late afternoon. I was disappointed. The place was always seedy but with an eclectic feel. I had visited a half dozen times in the nineties. Sure has gone down hill toward the tacky and trashy side of the spectrum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IL-Family0f5
10,Mostly set-up for vendors selling,"First and foremost, be very careful of shady people offering things such as cd's for free. Visited with my daughter (early 20's). Two guys approached both of us and used a typical set-up to create a crime of theft. First, one approached my daughter complimenting on her beauty and immediately mentioning a free cd as they are a new group from Jamaica and 2nd guy went in between us separating my daughter and me with easy access to my daughter's purse. As a tried to go around the guy to get to my daughter, he tried to block me. I managed to get around him and protect my daughter. He didn't like it by asking me, ""what is wrong with you?"". There should be undercover police - better not only for tourists but vendors especially because after this experience my daughter and I felt the vendors could be scamming as well. On another note, beach is huge! There is an outside gym as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912eves

Tons of garbage, sleeping bags, people talking to themselves, and police officers managing these people. All of the shops here were kitschy.

20,Bucket list but it stops there,"Very interesting experience. Lots of homeless. Some of them fighting, yelling. Some of them smoking drugs. Was not the Venice Beach I was expecting. Nice stroll along the beach front from the SM Pier to here though. I wouldn’t recommend bringing kids or going at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecBelle
40,Venice Beach Has Something for Everyone,"Over the years I have come here to play competitive beach volleyball on the sand courts (Note: you may have to bring your own cords/lines). In high school I used to come to buy incense and inexpensive ethnic jewelry, which you can still do. Most recently, I come here for walks with my boyfriend and then, to get food nearby on Abbott Kinney. Abbott Kinney can be crowded with hipsters if you go at the wrong time on weekend nights or Fridays, but going to the beach here to walk the old Boardwalk and take in the strange people and knick knacks being sold is still fun. You can walk far down into the Marina and visit tasty establishments like Mercede's Grill, or you can go to James' Beach Restaurant in Venice right of the Boardwalk. If you can head to Venice Beach midday and then go for a happy hour to one of the nearby restaurants, it's an enjoyable way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad

40,Early on a weekday,"We were able to visit with small children early in a weekday. Happy we did because there were enough ""characters "" there to give me a feel for what to expect as the day progressed. This was not the same beach I remembered as a child . No street performers , no muscle men . Not much of anything really but a very dirty entrance. My kiddos enjoyed watching the skate boarders , there were several younger kiddos out and of course they saw a teenager rip his pants that thought that was cool as well . I would take a few things as possible to keep up with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaster83
50,Nice little Venice,"Did a nice leisurely walk.along the beach in the morning and it was very relaxing.

Good walk in the morning before the weed smoking and homeless people spoil the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bennylimlee
30,"Nice Beach, Run Down Area","Venice beach itself is pretty nice though very crowded. We had a feally pleasant day there.Hoever the area around the beach is a little dingy and seedy we felt. It's not that anything bad happened to us, nor did we feel threatened in any way, it's just a little run down and not particularly nice to wander around.As I said though the beach is nice with lots of activity. Music blares, vendors sell and there are loads of people exercising and working out on the boardwalk.A nice beach to spend some time in and nice waters to swim in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bozeman-Dublin

The beach seems to house many ""beach bums"", for a lack of better word. Many interesting characters in this area. Not sure I'd bring kids here. We also checked out muscle beach which was neat. There's also tons of really cute shops nestled in between streets. Overall, this area was much dirtier than I was expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875meaganl

50,Love Venice Beach!!,I grew up nearby and have always loved Venice Beach. Now I live in San Diego and still try to come up a few times a year to get my “fix” of Venice. So much to take in if you like to people watch. Also great bicycle path that goes for miles up and down the beaches.

40,"Sunshine, Surf, and Surprises","I had been to Venice Beach before but it still held at least one surprise for me. We enjoyed strolling the walk as usual, browsing the somewhat overpriced shops, observing the surfers and skateboarders, appreciating the artisans ad their wares, watching paddleball matches, all the usual. My surprise was being able to observe and listen to the denizens of the beach. One offered to sell marijuana, even in the shadow of the medicinal marijuana dispensaries. Some chatted as they searched the garbage for sellable recycleables. Then I heard several discussing some conflicts with some local young people. It was fascinating. It was a contrasted backdrop to the often affluent tourists who frequent the beach. Overall, Venice Beach is a (free) must see L.A. attraction. Prepare to spend almost a day, and prepare for surprises even if you've been there before. There is always something new!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamdT5357XT

Too many aggressive street hustlers trying to hawk their dismal demo tapes.I just want to buy a t-shirt, and maybe a funnel cake. Is that too much to ask without getting constantly harassed?The most interesting aspect is looking at all of the funky houses bordering the beach.

40,This is a very interesting place but one I really enjoyed and think it is something everyone should see.,"We enjoyed walking along Venice Beach, looking in the shops and people watching. We really had no idea how long of a walk it was. I didn't mind the walk but I wish I had parked in the middle instead of on one end like we did.

Venice has some very nice areas and some very upscale homes and restaurants, but the smell of poverty and marijuana are everywhere. We stayed two blocks from the beach, and spent several hours walking up and down the boardwalk. Mixed in with the dozens of t-shirt shops and pot dispensaries, there were dozens, or maybe hundreds of artists and performers along the beach, and it was fun to see so many talented people in one place.

It strikes me that this place might be pretty interesting for people from smaller towns or remote locations. For me coming from a big city, it was more take-it-or-leave-it. Wasn't actually much going on when I was there. Wasn't much in the name of good eats, from what I could see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KnewGuessed
20,Overrun by homeless,"My first visit here in 20 years and certainly won't hurry back. It can still be fun to walk, run, bike, blade or shop for touristy items (cheaper here than on Santa Monica Pier) but the homeless population has simply overrun Venice Beach. There are little camps all along the Boardwalk and on the Beach in this area. We stayed in the well traveled areas after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BPutt
50,Awesome!,Lovely beach to walk down and see. There's lots of scalpers so try to avoid walking in the side walk through the dense crowds. The skatepark is great for photos and the stores are nice to look into. Some of the architecture alone is worth the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hansdergerman
50,Relax and enjoy the view,"Venice beach is famous for people watching and the vibe. We were not disappointed.A great stroll along the stalls, enjoying a drink and walk on the very wide beach is an absolutely lovely combo of a day in Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigwideworld4
20,Keep Away for Kids - but Great Walk,"First time to USA - Tourist attractionVenice beach from Santa MonicaWatch out for Beggars - NO EYE CONTACT - They will come up to you and beg for money but they insult you and they are all high on weed and will try to attack you.

30,Sadly seedy Venice Beach,"The expectation of a fun stroll full of people watching and brunch was not going to happen at Venice Beach. It has become supremely touristy and full of junky souvenir shops, $5 tshirts, and junky fast food shops. Check out the ocean, walk the path down by the ocean and skip the rest. Head to Abbot Kinney and enjoy a stroll, shopping and lots of food choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CohenD1234
40,Classic crazy lovely Venice Beach,"Venice Beach is one of the most known, filmed, shown beaches in the world. Featured in movies, tv shows, music videos, commercials and video games. Everybody recognise the boardwalk, muscle beach, the skatepark, the lifeguard towers. Here you can spend the whole day should you be an outdoor person. Surfspots like breakwater, the jetty and the pier is always busy with surfers of all levels, the skater park dito.Enjoy all the street performers, cafés, bars and art/crafts booths along the boardwalk. Finnish of with a glass and enjoy the California sunset. Respect the homeless and the native Venice locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petertQ604YM

40,Good fun in the sun....but definitely avoid after dark,"This place is optimum for fascinating people-watching. The beach is deep and beautiful, the sunsets unparalleled, and it's full of shops and quirky cafes. As soon as the sun goes down, though, it turns into a tent city, and can feel very unsafe. However, walking the boardwalk back to the Santa Monica Pier after dark was very comfortable, with a nice sense of community with other walkers and those sitting or playing along the way. A good experience here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRIPTravelTailor

40,"A Kaleidescope of Colour, People, Artists, Shops, Dogs, Food & Assorted Characters","This place is a real eye-opener, characters of all sorts, sizes, shapes, mental health & just about ANYTHING goes - fascinating. Lots of stores, bargains (if you do your homework), locals willing to barter to get your business, make certain you ALWAYS ask price upfront before ordering printing of apparel, if you don't, you WILL get a nasty, costly surprise.All in all, we experienced the culture here and yes, there are lots of homeless, helpless and even some crazies - but I think that is what makes this place what it is ... COLOURFUL in every way & so fascinating to see (at least ONCE) if you have never been.Would definitely go back, but so glad we were not here in the middle of summer holidays, can only imagine how crazy it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMCGM
50,Love this place,I love it here but would only visit in the daytime. Can imagine its abit scary at night. Its a great place to people watch and there are some interesting characters along the boardwalk. There is always lots of sports going on from weight training at the famous muscle beach to tennis and basketball. Some good places to buy rock t shirts at a reasonable price. Its also worth visiting the nearby canals just to look at the beautiful houses that line the canals. They are all so individual and different. I like to walk along the sea shore from Venice to Santa Monica. Its a fantastic walk watching the crashing waves. Takes about an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfanti

50,Great Atmosphere,"My first visit here and what a great atmosphere and vibe this area has. Such a relaxing area. Massive beach. Ample green areas, paths for walkers, cyclists.

Heaps of tourist shops, places to eat and drink",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livetotravel747

50,Go early,Parking is rough but it is wild and nothing quite like it anywhere. It should take half a day depending on if you drink then plan for an entire day and evening as the night life is very laid back and fun. Artist community meets street freaks and nice restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleg230
50,Walk down the beach,"Great way to spend your afternoon or evening strolling and enjoying the sights and sounds. Great sidewalk shops, food stands and local artists selling their wares. You can rent bikes for a ride on the path that runs parallel to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanmT4053GU
50,A LOVELY BEACH AND PLACE TO GO,"Was only here for a short while as i was touring around Los Angeles. I liked this beach better than Santa Monica.There was a Subway Sandwich shop , so got a bite to eat there and took it on the seafront where we sat and admired what was around us.There are toilets, a basketball court, and lots of shops, mostly souvenir shops, but most of all loved watching the skateboarders as they did all their tricks on this skate park. The beach was lovely and shame i could not spend more time here.Glad i came and a must place to go and see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddier576

50,I LOVE THIS PLACE,"Wow Venice beach is so chill and relaxing, some interesting characters but still had so much walking along the beach and the sidewalk where all the shops are. the shops are a little pricey considering its all the cheap stuff you would by for 10$ in mexico. Lots of art to see, highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationjunkie2387
50,This is one of Californias greatest attractions !!,I love Venice Beach its a sideshow and a recreation center all in one - never borring ever - parking is tough so get there early or pay the lots - Friday- Sunday thousands of people walk the walkway - weight lifting - paddle tennis - and street acts - go and enjoy !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooklyn2bh
50,Loved Venice Beach!,"Loved walking up and down along the boardwalk, there is always something going on. I got to see the live performance of a group of dancers that were actually featured on the show, So you think you can Dance. There is always a great atmosphere and lot's of shops were you can find souvenirs and a bite to eat.Take the time to visit the beach as it is awesome as well as the gym at Muscle beach and other outdoor gym areas. Can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vash17
40,Parking can be expensive but worth the visit!,Great active beach and boardwalk. Expect a lot of people and parking can be expensive. Lots to see and walk along the boardwalk with friendly locals and visitors. Great place to spend a day strolling and relax next to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soe494
30,ok,"I've always wanted to visit Venice Beach based on what I see on TV but there is nothing spectacular about it, somewhere you can skateboard, hang out, see people dressed up as characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941selenam
40,Lovely sandy beach,The boardwalk was pretty crowded but you could sit undisturbed on the beach and look at the ocean. Definitely a must see when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annes460
30,A bicycle ride to Venice Beach,"My husband and I️ rented bikes and rode from the Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Rey to Venice Beach. It’s an easy bike ride as there is a bike path. Venice Beach has cleaned up since its poor reputation years ago. The police station is right there on the beach and there is a police presence on the beach and in the area. Some of the first shops are dirty and run down but once you get past the initial shock of the homeless people and the shops facing the water, there are nicer and cleaner stores and restaurants in the area. There are a lot of unique paintings on buildings and murals around town. Make sure you venture down the road and see the original Venice canals that were designed by Abbot Kinney when he founded Venice. He designed the town after Venice, Italy. I️ would recommend going with a friend or another person as there are some shady people. It’s a unique experience and you need to visit if you are in the L.A. area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyB311
40,The Famous Venice Beach: Artsy and Fun,"Venice is a special beach. I've lived in So Cal most of my life and Venice stands out as one of the most unique beaches I've been to. There are a lot of creative people that live here and around the area, therefore, you see a lot of fun and interesting people. If you enjoy people watching or want to visit a beach that you'd probably see in a California movie scene..Venice beach is your spot.Traveler Tip: If you're looking for a remote beach with no noise, I'd look elsewhere like Malibu or the beaches of south OC. Venice is very active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth
30,Not what it used to be,Was a bit disappointed in Venice Beach to be honest. The actual beach is lovely. But the boardwalk and shops are average. Lots of homeless folk living in tents off boardwalk on beach. Lots of average run of the mill shops. Marijuana shops. Nothing special. We walked to Venice Beach from Santa Monica Beach. Santa Monica is much nicer.Apparently Santa Monica is now known as Silicon Beach. All the Silicon Valley folk are buying up in Santa Monica/Venice Beach and struggling actors/artists can no longer afford to live there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296sharona
50,Cruising on a Sunny Day,"We spent the day down in Venice beach, we hired a bike and rode from one end to the other beautiful weather great atmosphere and having the sea breeze blow on you while riding just absolutely relaxing. Good thing about hiring bikes they have little bike shops along Venice beach that all belong to the same company, so my bike had a seat problem and we stopped and got it changed to another bike which was really cool.They have little restaurants all along and also the Santa Monica Pier, it was really packed we never went on it so we kept riding.Great day to spend either relaxing on the beach, going swimming riding a bike working out at muscle beach or eating at one of their many restaurants along Venice. It doesn't disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/995kerryt
50,Fun day at the beach!,"This place was amazing! The beach, the pier, nearby Muscle Beach, all the unique street artists/vendors and the nearby restaurants! All within walking distance of low priced parking! $9 for the whole day, if you stay...and why wouldn’t you? That’s a steal for California parking! The views are so beautiful you’ll think you’re in a movie, there’s plenty to do there, a wide variety of places to eat and the people watching is endless!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deonna2
40,A Cast of Interesting Characters,We walked from Santa Monica to and through Venice Beach. Venice beach is an attraction: so many characters. I felt safe despite some of the characters we met being less savoury than others (there is a definite homeless problem there and throughout Los Angeles). The shops are full of tourist tat mostly but fun to look at. The beach is gorgeous. An expanse of sand and sea. A definite must visit for any visit to L.A. in my book,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiglets
40,Beach for Days!!!,The beach here is bigger than I expected. Tons of little shops and places to eat along the boardwalk. Plenty of people watching! Muscle beach area was way smaller than I thought. Obviously a great place to catch some rays!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/razz_01
30,It's certainly interesting,"We stopped here on a tour. The tour guide stayed in the van. I know why. There were certainly some ""interesting"" people here. We come from Australia and have many much better beaches here, so the beach itself was a little underwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaracQ2713OL
50,Nice to walk around and get away from the crowds,Completely different atmosphere than Hollywood Blvd - was nice to check out and decompress from the crowds. More of a relaxed beach vibe around here. Was wonderful to walk around and people watch. Parking was not expensive at all. Beach was pretty clean and litter-free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltheworld461
20,Beware,"Please beware of the scammers. There are a lot of people scamming tourist into buying CD on the boardwalk - if you didn't know about it its easy to get caught out. Simply do not accept anything handed to you. If possible keep your hands in your pockets.If its your first time - its very much how you may have seen it on TV or in Films. Lots of runners, cyclists and roller skaters on the boardwalk. On the otherside closer to the beach there is another walk way which tends to be a bit quieter.On the main boardwalk there are lots of shops selling Teeshirts - possibly at the the cheapest prices I have seen across LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263markj
20,"Known as ""Muscle Beach""","Venice Beach is also known as ""Muscle Beach"" where there is an outdoor gym and where the name came from being the birthplace of the physical fitness boom in the US which started in 1934.I believe it moved from its original location to this location some years ago. In fact in the mid-1960s Arnold Schwarzenegger trained here for the Mr Universe title.I personally wasn't a fan of this area.Its has a lovely beach area with lots of shops and restaurants scattered around the boardwalk.But there are lots of wierd characters around, a strong smell of marijuana and there seem to be scamsters around. The cd scam which is present in Hollywood seems to be present here as well.I much preferred Santa Monica Beach around the pier which was much more family friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommomelbourne
40,Great place if you love the hipster type atmosphere,"I found it very interesting as you can people watch; loads of roller bladders, skate boarders performing, people playing basket ball etc. Very much the ""LA"" scene as you see in the movies. You can walk up to Santa Monica pier from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YNL127
30,Afternoon visit,"In good weather this place is busy and hot! Loads of cheap and takky shops and a few bars and hippie style shops, wasn't really for me, muscle beach is pretty run down and just for the big egos now I feel, been once, far nicer spots along the coast to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hatha101086
30,Weekday visit,We visited on a weekday and were a little disappointed that not a lot was going on. We did have excellent tacos at one of the stands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawbrittain
20,Don't bother ... it's seedy!,We were disappointed after hearing all the hype about Venice Beach. It's really seedy and scruffy with a number of homeless people living rough on the beach.The rest rooms are awful! They're dirty and there are no wash facilities or hand sanitizer. We had better than this in the National Parks!My advice? ... Don't bother!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/and13Tenby
10,What a disappointment!,We got a rickshaw ride from Santa Monica beach with the sun ready to set which was beautiful and then we turned up at Venice beach with lots of homeless either setting up for the night or moving on. I’m sure the beach itself is lovely but we were told to take a stroll watch the sunset and enjoy a few beers. No way we got the first available Uber out of there and that wasn’t as easy as said.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946leithw
40,Very interesting and fun!,"We had a great time riding bikes and walking around Venice Beach. Loved people watching and really enjoyed it. Very out there and different, but that's why you travel right!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyliebulling
20,Not worth the hype,"What a let down, not a kid friendly place,only visit during daylight hours as only god knows what happens here at night,Happy i did it but will never do it again, not to sound heartless but the amount of homeless people and people under the influence hanging around by the beach is not an ideal tourist attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigAdz
50,Boardwalk,"We went in the evening and watched the beautiful sunset. The Boardwalk was packed with lots of interesting people watching. Lots of food places if you want to eat there. We were tight on time, so we didn't get any food.... but it smelt good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jend859
40,Nice...but,"Very nice beach but there are alot of homeless people on this strip. alot of unique shops to chose from such as bike shops to rent bikes, smoke shops, tattoos and piercing shops, art work etc. defintely alot to see.

30,Nice but too commercialized,Like many other California beaches it has nice sand and palm trees. The boardwalk is very commercial with lots of souvenir shops and eateries. Some of the buildings are a bit run down. Personally I feel the media and Hollywood has made it look a lot nicer on the screen than it actually is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5544LOpeterh

50,Beautiful morning,We had a lovely time at Venice beach. It was Friday morning and the influx of visitors had not yet amassed . It was easy to park and walk around and there was a relaxed and calm feel to the streets and beach. The sand was soft and golden and seemed to stretch for miles. Full of characters from homeless but harmless as well as locals fishing and catching some rays. Tourists ride along the bike paths whilst others skateboarded and skated. We had a bite to eat overlooking the beach and strolled along the main drag of street featuring souvenir and surf stores along with bars and eateries. It seemed a different place to one I've experienced on the weekends the last time I was here. The canals are worth a visit too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandap994
20,Sigh... tattoos and cannabis...,"The Venice strand was always a bit offbeat with tourists, t-shirt sellers, street performers, skaters, etc. I was so disappointed with the change to mostly cannabis stores and oddities. The street performers were just a step up from beggars and the artists were nothing like I remembered from many years ago. Not even a half decent place to get a bite to eat. It's a great place to bicycle through - wonderful, winding paths from Marina del Rey to Santa Monica. I won't be stopping here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S610NCthomasp
30,Be Aware At All Times !,"I would suggest only visiting here between 11am - 3pm as it only just about felt safe then, anything outside of these hours I don't think would be secure at all. A must see for the tourist but only once and not for very long. The glory days are long gone and is now tacky and seedy and you would not want to make a wrong turn here.Be careful and keep family members close as they will be propositioned in all sorts of undesirable ways. A world away from the classy Santa Monica a short distance away !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jadfran1
20,"Homeless, Homeless and more Homeless","My wife and I walked from Santa Monica and the closer we got to Venice the more and more homeless. We both wanted to stop and sit but every bench was taken with homeless and their belongings( which looked like trash). You felt unsafe. Did not want to walk away from the beach. Plus, a lot were young people.. Sad to think there are so may homeless for all different reasons. No easy fix.I was looking forward to seeing the canals...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevekM9138PL

30,Disappointing - dirty and cheap tourist trash,A nice beach but very disappointing promenade. Full of cheap touristy trash and quite dirty.Would recommend you instead head up the beach further to Santa Monica beach and pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyM277
50,Nice beach stroll,"Great board walk. With lots of nice arts. However, the homeless do make it a bit surrealistic. Do not forget to check out the skate park. That is really great and those skaters are insane! There were some small kids doing extreme tricks. Enjoyed that one. There was not that much to see on the muscle beach, a pity. Would like to see the place when it's more crowded and they lift insane weights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomAALTER
30,"Do not get too excited about Venice Beach, California.","Do not get too excited about Venice Beach. The ""beach"" itself is not great. Much better beaches North and South 20 miles or so. The 'boardwalk' has hundreds of street vendors. Most of the stuff is probably from China. So ""Caveat emptor"". Make sure it is not something you can buy at home, probably less. It is 'interesting' to walk the vendors. BUT be super careful No expensive jewelry or even something that looks expensive. High crime area all over Venice. Worth the look to go there, as long as your eyes and ears are wide open. Lots of 'hucksters'. The days of seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger or anyone else ""famous"" on the beach are long gone. You might get lucky with a sidewalk cafe. Every time I have guest from out of State they want to go. I show them where to walk. I sit in a cafe and wait for them to return. The chamber will tell you things in glowing terms. I tell in factual words.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jess90069
50,Great people watching!!,"My favorite thing on Venice beach was renting a bicycle and riding down the side walk, just taking it all in!!! The people watching is so fun, there are street vendors set up, bums and homeless camping out, surfers catching waves, and plenty of events going on close to Muscle Beach. Tons of shops and restaurants here. A very iconic part of SoCal culture that you must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahigdon3

Honestly, I did not feel secure while being there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFV86
50,Cool and quirky,Come here for the sand and the quirky boardwalk. The beach is lovely to chill on whilst you either get in the sea or watch the surfers or more brave swimmers enjoying the waves. The boardwalk is full of your typical seaside shops selling ‘I love LA’ style t-shirts and henna artists on hand at each corner. Muscle Beach is based here as well so you can even check that out too. Definitely a cool place to spend time at!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6519NUlizm
50,Fun,When we got to L.A. we went straight to Venice Beach. It was fun to see everything I had seen on TV in person. Being a part of the area and scene.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacieP301
40,Iconic,"So what have you heard about Venice Beach? Great stretch of beach where the fit and beautiful work out, roller skate and skate board? Well it's not quite like that but you'll find it greatly interesting.Yes there is a Muscle Beach but it isn't that large an area and there were very few people working out (maybe 4 or 5) when we were there. There were a couple of people roller skating and there was a skate board park but there wasn't as much of this activity than I'd imagined. HOWEVER where Venice Beach scored for me was the distinct vibe (very laid back), the street stalls (selling all sorts of crafts and individualistic items), the street art, the unique shops and the bars/restaurants offering an opportunity to people watch.This is a great stretch of beach, provides an opportunity to wander for miles and soak in a very different atmosphere.Top Tip: Park on the front, buy a ticket for much longer than you anticipate (the stretch is very long and you'll want to explore more than you think). It's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philip_Marsh
50,Crazy Good!,it is a must when you visit LA. People from all over are there enjoying the California Sun. Crazy artwork and shops all around. Performance show on the street with no effort ! Beautiful super wide beach. Amazing skate park. Real LA vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaghoul
50,Beautiful to watch sunset,"Go there spend sometime walking by the beach or cycling around or swim in the beach, lots of dining options. After sunset better to leave and come back to your place. Neat clean and maintained",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441ipsitad
50,Meal,Gorgeous beach friendly people good food walked along beach visited shops along the way excellent day out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/645francesw
40,Venice beach,Beautiful. Just enjoy the scenery. Take a bit into the Pacific. Nice golden sand. Enjoy the atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilanS509
50,Love the beach,Not the cleanest beach I have ever been to but it was nice. The atmosphere was great!! Really enjoyed walking around. Don’t let the guys give u a DVD unless you are prepared to pay!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahay94
30,Pretty beach no sharks teeth,Went there to find some sharks teeth couldn't find any!! We asked a life guard where to find some and he told us a beach that had TONS of sharks teeth....but absolutely none at Venice.....it's not the sharks teeth capital of The world,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450shanar
20,Dirty and strange,"Our German exchange student wanted to see the famous Venice Beach. Parking was over priced and hard to find. It was incredibly dirty, crowded and full of people using or selling drugs. Save yourself the trip and visit the beaches in Orange County! Cleaner, more family friendly and no drugs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauriepaz
30,VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK,"Tourists should probably have at least one visit to Venice Beach. There are a lot of weird vendors selling hand-crafted products. Some are very nice. At night time, there is a huge crowd of pot smokers on the beach. Venice Beach also has the muscle gym right on the beach which is different. You can also ride bikes or skate on the beach sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckytobeme
50,"Quirky, Fun, and Very Real","Let me just start by saying, it is what it is. Throw out any expectations you may have of this place to get the real experience. It's gritty, strange, some areas dirty, but still a fun place to visit and hangout with friends. There's actually a lot to see and do. We watched skaters at the skate park (although you could get a contact ""high"" with all that weed being smoked so limit the time with your kids there; not really but there is a lot of weed being released in the air), talked to vendors, bought some custom printed apparel, ate at Figtree Café, watched street performers, and just walked and talked while taking in the salt air. In-between buildings in Venice, you will see amazing street art. After walking the beach and boardwalk, visit the other streets throughout and sight see. We found the best parking lot right at the beginning of the boardwalk (it's the one with the huge Venice car street art on the wall). Restrooms at the beach and park though were terrible. We held it in until getting a bite to eat at Figtree Café. Don't expect fancy food, upscale restaurants, and stuck-up people. We had the greatest time at Venice Beach and the surrounding neighborhoods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CultureLush
50,Great beach for surfing,"This beach is great beach for surfing, you can enjoy surfing or just spend the day on the beach watching surfers enjoy riding the waves, also the Lagoons are amazing and are 5 mins walking distance and you can access them from the beach. Parking there is like hell, so my advise, park at the Venice lagoons' parking locations which is 9$ till sunset and enjoy you day there :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnawito
40,love this place,"so lively . awesome beach,so much art so many little stores,skatepark,gym . theres just so much to do and see there the only negative is there are ALOT of homeless people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikey201
20,Santa Monica is nicer,"Eh - that's my overall thought of Venice Beach to be honest. The beach itself, on its own is nice enough, granted. The path and area behind it, er less so.Well unless you don't mind it being full of run down shops, beggars, drunks and people stoned out their minds and the strong smell of weed. It's a shame as if it was cleaned up and some better businesses brought in I think it would discourage a lot of the folk who are currently there from remaining there.If you are tourists visiting, I'd skip Venice and go down the coast to Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olihenryy
50,Loved it,I love this beach. I went on a Segway tour which took us all the way down the beach and stopped every now and again to tell us about the history behind some of it e.g Arnold Schwarzenegger at muscle beach etc. Very interesting place and lots of street entertainment who don't pass a bucket round in hope that you cough up some change. Lots of shops and stalls selling all things imaginable from life size transformers to paintings and seashells. It's all worth checking out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546alician
30,Give this a miss and take in the other beaches in the area.,"PArking if you can get it is $15 and there are plentiful beaches like Redondo Beach or Santa MOnica which offer better facilities and easier access. If you just want to enjoy the beach go for Redondo, if you want to watch people and enjoy the facilities choose Santa Monica where we Parker for just $2.50 on a Sunday just 3 blocks from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
40,"Hasn't changed, still has it's charm","Finding a parking space bar Venice Beach can be quite difficult, unless you are prepared to pay about $20 to park in one of the car parks. I drove round for about 10minutes before finding a space with a parking meter, which cost $2 and about a 5 minute walk to the pier.It’s been 17 years since I was last at Venice Beach and I’m happy to say that it hasn’t changed a great deal over the years, apart from it’s now becoming a bit more trendy.The fishing pier was packed as usual, there was one couple that appeared to constantly being pulling mackerel out of the sea. So if you are in to fishing, its a goos place to fish.It’s worth the walk along the boardwalk, passing muscle beach and all of the other sports areas and be entertained by the street performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJA_7
50,Plenty of open space,"What a sight! You could easily spend a whole day here. From a long walk to the beach, to wandering along the boardwalk, to watching the talented skateboarders at the skate park... there is plenty to see in Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinaB_Sydney
40,Fun place to pass time,We enjoyed walking along Venice beach and people watching. The Muscle beach was fun too. Nice way to pass time. Easy to park nearby but there was a cost (either 10 or 15 USD from memory) attached as you would expect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786jamiew
40,If you like to be seen and to see,"On the boardwalk. Lots of commerce and panhandlers. Skaters, rollers, cyclists, dogs, musicians.On the Beach. Not that many people that day. Nice and clean sand. Did not go into the water. Top much under current for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/141larsp
30,Underwhelming but interesting,"Venice Beach has a reputation that says you should see it - problem is there isn't much there to see. There is a promenade with many homeless people and tatty shops, unimaginative architecture...HOWEVER, when you go into the little streets at the back you find the most charming housing area with little bridges and cute photo spots - very pretty and yes, it has a bit of Venetian/ Amsterdam charm about it. The main street still has some signs of old grandiose - I think back in the day there was a stylish arcade down the main bit, now just a mural reminds you of what was there. If it was to be rebuilt it would be a truly special place.Not much to see on the Muscle part of the beach, but its a great cycle from Santa Monica. Many cafes to be fed at so overal worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlgaM924
50,Loved this place,"This place reminds me of my GTA game. This has to be a top 2 place that I have visited & not because of the attraction or name that it carries but because of the people there. We experienced nothing but love while we were there, everyone were kind & they had all kinds of entertainment & shopping. People offering to take pictures because they knew we had to be tourists & people offered for us to take a look at their beautiful homes as well. A few famous people were also apart of the crowd but one person I believe I saw was Keith Powers man I should have asked. They have a pizza spot to eat as well that has giant slices & it tastes good for you pizza lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dayzmylasdad
10,Dirty,Would score this as a zero if i could.The shops were cheap looking. Nothing looked inviting. The place had an awful smell and the ocean looked dirty. Would not recommend especially to those with children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144kated
30,Tacky but cool at the same time,A good place to people watch and buy some cheap stuff if you want. Also a good place to inhale some second hand weed! I guess that it's famous for the more edgy side of LA and good to see but there are better beaches in California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bandyrobs
50,Best beach walk,The most wonderful place i ever been in my life. I felt like im in a movie. So many friendly people around. Warm wind and the sense of sand beneath my legs. The best time to be there is sunset time and just walk in a good company. That was truely awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xelena_boston
40,Lovely sunny day out,"Enjoyed the day out, plenty of shops and lots going on. Fairly cheap to eat. Places to hire bikes, easily accessed on the metro bus and train lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBellairsBamber
40,Worth a walk for sure!,It's been years since I was in the LA area and I was thrilled to see they have made a sep ride pathway along the beach in the Venice Beach area. Last time I was there it was really frustrating combating the bikes and skate boarders. There are still inconsiderate skater boarders rushing through the crowds but it's far better than it used to be.There are hoards of temporary camps set up along the walk (with people living in them) but they weren't hassling us at all.It's still a fun stroll to see all the artists and artists along the way. Take the time to talk to them and you'll learn something for sure. Grab a water bottle at one of the little shops and just wander.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen78703
50,Fun place,Went to Venice Beach the other day. Still a fun place. Only a couple of street performers but still fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCRON
10,Why all the fuss.,"Well, why all the fuss? To us, it came across as a very down market beach resort with basically everything that screams ‘tatty and down market'. Of all the art or so called art on display, there was basically nothing of any note while the array of fast food outlets, tasteless t shirt shops and the plethora of other 'low market' establishments, made us wonder why it was a so called ‘must place’ to visit.America at its worst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10chris02
50,Beautiful sandy beach,We enjoyed a picnic on the beach with friends. The sand is soft and clean and were were able to errct a gazebo to shade the food and drinks. The water is clean and great for swimming in. There is plenty of parking and restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144martinn
40,Take a walk along the beach,"Very diverse place - nice homes, beautiful beach and so many different people walking arround, from tourists to local people, from rich people running on the path and to homeless people sleeping on the beach and of course a lot of true and untrue artists. So the beach is nice, but to have a walk along it is much more interesting:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siomikas
40,Suprised,Didn't really have any expectations for Venice Beach so went with an open mind. First thing that struck me was the amount of homeless people and people clearly on drugs or with mental health issues. It is definitely a place of haves and have nots. The Beach front seems to be the focus of the problem which is a shame because it's a lovely beach. Then there's Muscle Beach which speaks for itself and worth a look. Further back there are some really expensive shops and restaurants.I'm glad we visited but I can't see us ever returning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karmabuddha
40,Definitely Worth a Sunday Stroll,"This was a great place to take a Sunday morning stroll. Peopled by some of the most wacky, hippy, friendly enthusiastic I have every encountered, this place is unique. Walking from one end to the other you can take in Muscle Beach and Santa Monika Pier. There are a few Coffe shops along the way and the entertainers, stall holders and speakers along your route all offer a varied blend of stimulation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaely416
30,Really Diverse Site,"This area in LA is really nice but if you are conservative Just be sure that you are open minded because you will see lots of character people in a REALLY diverse place. I had fun but we where only adults, actually I would say that is not a place to take the kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodadvisorca
40,Venice Canals,"The best part about Venice Beach was viewing the canals that were purposely installed in this area. The canals had apartment style dwellings on each side, just like Venice. I remember seeing this site in many movies as the overcanal connecting bridges were used a lot in the movies.The beach was very beautiful as well but was on a tour so did not have time to really enjoy it. Would probably go back again at another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992lindad
50,The Circus is in Town! A Must Sea Attraction!,"Since 1982 I have been coming to Venice Beach..a great attraction for some of the bestpeople watching in the world. All set amongst the most beautiful visuals of the Pacific Ocean.This place has not really changed in over 40 years.and for first timers it’s as fresh as years ago.. except for the parking !...very difficult specially in the summer or on the weekends ..Venice Beach is a visual kaleidoscope.. full of attractions, lots of food, shopping, sports, beach, ocean, street shows.. marijuana shops . People with strollers people with pets people jogging roller skates skateboarding bicycling and whatever traction you can think of...A great fun day in the sun. A must see visit while in town.Good for people of all ages....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sourywest
50,Always a surprise waiting,"Venice Beach has so much to offer. Day and night you can enjoy the street performers who are so talented you will stop and enjoy their performance. Don't forget to tip, anything will help. Great restaurants await you and you may want to go after 5 and enjoy happy hour. That's if you are over 21. If you are visiting LA you can find lots of gift ideas. There are live musical performances at the beach, check out the information desk for a program of monthly activities. LA is a town bursting with activities so enjoy yourself while you are here and you can't beat the weather. I love LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s9957
20,"So beautiful, so dumpy at the same time","The beach itself is expansive, clean and warm. The beach boardwalk is a dump, filled with hobos, hucksters and hole-in-the-wall crap shops. Not worth the price of parking. One bright spot: a delicious lunch at the Venice Ale House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Empress9999
30,Somewhat tacky but worth a visit!,"Venice Beach is teeming with life and activities, it was great to see so much going on - cycling, skate boarding etc. The Beach itself is clean and pleasant, the stalls lining it are full of tourist tat, but I suppose you would expect that. It was an interesting experience to visit once but that is all! My husband is still recovering from being charged $20 for two very small orange juices down a side street at a cafe!😂",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilld360
10,Awful,"I went there for a soccer tournament.. took my kids, needlessly to say ... what a mistake. Weird and homeless people everywhere. Shopping? No thanks. Rude guys at the stores. Skip this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I5493VPmarial
30,Not great,"There are better beaches in the UK. Yes it's long and sandy but when I was there, the water was green and quite rough so there was no way i was going in there. I saw 2 young girls sprint towards the water, look at the colour and back off. Eeew. It was pleasant in the sun, which is where the UK falls down, but I can't rate this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gillianm567
50,Loved it!!!,"This is one of the most famous beaches in California and I loved it!! A lot of life, good vibes, beautiful beach, music, food, and not expensive. I will love to live close to here so I could visit more. The boardwalk is about 20-35 minute walk long. Everything did start to close down about 9-10pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Travel2487
40,Really eclectic place,Another place not to miss in California. Lots of shops of all kinds. People of all kinds. Bike rentals the ocean and much more. Only drawback was some merchandise being sold in my opinion is not appropriate for children. Fabulous place to people watch. And a nice beach and many activities and street performers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721jeffo
50,Afternoon In the Sun,"I was on a business trip and decided to re-visit Venice Beach. What a nice evening. I went to the beach and did some body surfing. Watched a pickup basketball game, and some great skateboarders at the skateboard park. Then top it off a beautiful sunset. What a nice afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198tomf198
40,Nice beach full of activities,"Nice get a bicycle e have a trip around . Stop for a Açaí Bowl , chilling a little before going back to bicycle again .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/788solangem
50,Excellent!!!,"The whole area of Venice Beach is just amazing!!! A street foul of palm trees with many shops, restaurants & bars, next to the beach. Many people there for skate, surfing, swimming, or just walking there and enjoying the view, especially at sunset!! Must go!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paschaliusz
30,Dirty,"Everyone needs to go but there’s a lot of homeless people. Street people singing, skating, & skateboarding. I would not want to eat anything there because everything looks dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silljunk
40,Not as wild as we thought it would be....,"We almost didn't go to Venice beach because of the hype about how unruly it could be. We ended up going on a Saturday afternoon and there were a lot of people, street vendors, muscians, food etc but not wild or unruly. The skate park and Muscle beach area were fun to watch. It was an easy walk up to Santa Monica pier. The Small World book shop was a nice quiet spot to stop. overall glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmosier06
50,Fanily Tennis Match,"We visited after the victory at the tennis matches and, it's a different scene. I highly advise you check it at if you happen to be in the area. It's really wild and, it's also where the guitar playing hiy on roller skates who was used in a few moviw beach scenes in the 80's used to hang out on thr Boardwalk along the beach and also where Muscle beach is. So, you'll see what i mean by different. There are also many places to get something to eat and, get there plenty early or, you'll never find parking. Safe Travels! 😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/datluscik
50,Lovely way to spend time with the ocean,"you need not spend a lot of money coming to Venice Beach, just bring your family and stroll around, play with the sand and beach, what I love is just sit and people watch. Great way to spend the entire day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardC2834
50,At least this circus continues to operate,"A phantasmagoric agglomeration of all that is Los Angeles. Beach, sun, ocean, bicycles, surfers, sellers of anything portable, a potpourri of aromas, food, jugglers, dancers, acrobatic skaters, painters, artists, crafts people, music, waves of people, all within a strongarm's throw of the Pacific. Even the cops are on bikes. Parking is expensive unless you find something on the street and need a day's hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO
50,Great spot to walk and see the sunset!,"Great location to walk from the Rose Hotel. Lots of palm trees and the murals to look on the buildings. Lots of booths, skateboard park, and many more. Good distraction away from work and enjoy the stroll. Not far from Abbot Kinney. Great dining. Plus, the Main Street. Many great restaurants! Have to come back more often and discover the secrets of Venice. Charming town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/819terriv
30,Interesting place - but perhaps overrated,"We visited the Venice boardwalk last Friday afternoon. The beach was nice (of course) but the general atmosphere wasn't particularly great. There were lots of odd characters and it was the kind of place where complete strangers come up to you and start saying indecipherabe things.Considering how long it takes to get here from West Hollywood etc. I couldn't say I would really recommend it. I would prefer to have stayed further north in Santa Monica, which was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY
50,Awesome,"Awesome ocean views, lovely beach. Good tourist attraction. Was a stop on our LA bus tour, lots of history in this town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714kalier
30,Aussies on tour,"Not what we thought. Scruffy and messy but quite a good atmosphere. Lots of gift and T shirt shops full of tat really. Muscle beach was so not was expected, iconic but a dump. Needs a clean up and some decent coffee shops. Wouldn't really eat anywhere on the sea front. It would have been nice to ride on the cycle path but not enough time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelalala49
40,A fun tourist strip with lots of characters,"My wife and I stayed 1 block off the boardwalk for 4 days / 3 nights, 5 minutes walk away so we would go down there for breakfast or lunch and walk up and down before heading off to see other parts of LA.Venice is the border of LA city next to Santa Monica city and the difference between the two is noticeable.Walk 20 minutes north and it is more upmarket and a bit quieter than Venice, still nice but without the “character”.Venice is full of souvenir shops and locals with stalls selling all the t shirts and bits you could ever want.The locals are colourful and carefree. Quite a few homeless people but they never really troubled anyone. You are just as likely to be wished a blessed day as you are to be asked for a cigarette.Skateboards and rollerblades whizz past at a steady rate and the local characters are an unusual mix.Plenty of places to eat and drink or hire bicycles or segways.It is fun to zip along on a Segway and enjoy the breeze and the view. Takes about and hour to go from the south of Venice up the Santa Monica and back stopping occasionally to sit and watch.It’s a fun place to visit but after a few days I think you’ve probably seen all you need. For us 3 or 4 days was plenty and we didn’t think we needed any more time.Close to LAX, about 25 minutes drive time so it’s easy to get to and to get out of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrisBarry
30,Nice place to walk,This is a nice beach to walk around. There is lots of entertainers to watch.Place is a little dirty though. Food I wouldn't recommend eating here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32aidad
40,Nice beach,"This is tourists haven! There is a long stretch of the boardwalk that has street vendors - it could be a bit overwhelming at times. There was a ""rave"" happening around 5pm which was strange but maybe indicative of the whole area - wild and unpredicatable. It just felt ... kind of dirty.The beach itself was stunning - it's endless and pretty clean. We even got to see dolphins swimming along the coast. The waves aren't huge but you will still see some people surfing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kari1001
30,Famous but not exciting,"Santa Mônica pier much better!!!There is a lot of activities to do, but seems Koke a desorganized place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175marcelom
50,Boogieboarding,Beach is spectacular. It has the best waves to enjoy boogie boarding or just to hang around and watch waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JokkeP5
20,Not what I expected :(,"Venice beach was blah. Unfortunately I thought it would be prettier lol with nice restaurants and bars.... It turned out to be a regular beach with a carnival feel. Was disappointed. But oh well, now I've been and won't go back lol. If you like grabbing a hot dog and walking the busy dirty boardwalk then you'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowsunsun
50,A peaceful place to collect your thoughts,"There is more to going to a beach than just swimming. Strolling along the scenic Pacific Ocean is not only a way to burn calories, it is also good for the soul. Early in the morning is a great time to visit, before the crowds arrive. Watching the waves is very peaceful as well as relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc
20,Disappointing,"One of the places I wanted to visit whilst in LA was muscle beach but have to say it was extremely disappointing!! Beach was lovely, lifeguards present nice feel on the beach walking from Santa Monica pier. Once I arrived at Venice it made me feel uneasy, seemed to be numerous drug users and homeless people around. It had a very unpredictable atmosphere for my liking, I couldn't wait to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellygO1705VB
40,"Sun, Sand and People-Watching","Venice Beach is not our favorite place in LA, but it's an essential sight. It seems not to have changed a bit in the 25 years we've been visiting. In our younger years, we used to pack our rollerblades and skate up and down the boardwalk. This time, we contented ourselves with strolling. The back streets of Venice are interesting too. A little of Venice Beach goes a long way. We wouldn't choose to stay right in the middle of the commotion, but it's always fun to dip into it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tallpinesCO
40,A fun day,"There is always something going on at Venice Beach. So much to do from surfing, skating, bike riding, swimming, shopping, and dining. Not to mention the street performers. Some strange characters but certainly wouldn't put me off going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyaN91LL
40,Better than it's reputation,I previously heard that Venice Beach was not as clean but I must disagree. I thought the beach was very nice. The sand didn't have many broken shells or rocks on it and I only saw one price of trash on it. The water was chillier when I went so I didn't go in fully but I would go back when it was warmer. It wasn't as crowded as Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/letsdosomething12
50,Relaxing time,"Love it, is very clean and peaceful. The water was a little cold but nice, recommend to visit Venice beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noemin915
40,Tourist beach,This is situated close to Santa Monica beach. There is Arnold Schwarzenegger gym also close by. If you in this area worth a visit. Beach is nice to have a bath.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aadhes
40,On tour with the Mclintons,"We were staying at Venice beach, close to Santa Monica & Abbot Kinney Blvd. Quite a few homeless at Venice, but they keep to themselves. Great bike trail along the sand to Santa Monica a fun thing to do. Lots of shops and great people watching. Muscle beach!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avenue12016
40,Lots to see,Very entertaining area to walk through from the people at the open gym Muscle Beach to the Guys in the Skate bowl. It's very crowded but there's plenty of places to eat and hang out. It's s must do when you're in LA walk along all the way to the pier or rent a bicycle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SargentTom
40,Very touristy but worth a visit,"Venice beach is as packed on the side walk as one would expect. With live performers and artists everywhere it has a great energy to it. The restaurants and bars around there are quite expensive, but that's to be expected for such an area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigKeVvi
50,"I am in Love, Venice you are amazing","Great atmosphere, shops, restaurants, rental options, surfboards and more. beautiful and clean beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LitaP29
50,Like the movies,"Another epic experience my husband and I had in LA. There is soooooo much to do at Venice Beach. From mini tennis, to skate boarding, roller skating, volley ball, gym (seriously), bicycling, swimming and tons more. We hired two bicycles and rode up and down the Beach - it is one of our favourite memories. The only downside is that now and then you get an almost overwhelming smell of weed - it makes us feel quite nauseous as we’re not into that stuff, but the plus side is that everyone is so super chilled because they’re all stoned! ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyDays123321
30,For the young and carefree,"We rented an apartment on Venice beach which was in a great location. It's a very busy spot with loads of stalls and shops along the promenade, there are loads of people sleeping in makeshift shelters along the beach which spoils the feeling of this part of the promenade, however you can walk to Santa Monica pier along the prom and this is much nicer with no intimidation. Also worth a visit is Manhatten beach going the other way past Playa del Rey, this is a lovely spot much more up market. All the beaches along the coast are fabulous, wide sandy and clean with lifeguards. Just felt a little uncomfortable with Venice - more for the young with no worries. Plenty of places to eat close by and within easy access to LA central. We had a car so were able to get around easily. A visit to Rodeo Drive was great, also seeing all the huge properties in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahM501
40,Venice beach,Feels of summer and peaceful waves of ocean with beautiful sunset made amazing day in Venice beach. I loved that bohemian vibe too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826sevgik
50,All love here!,"Regardless of what you're searching for, you can find it at Venice Beach! This place is a nice mixture of tourism and the old, dirty, hippy vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393isabellad
10,Extremely disappointing,"We were there on Labour Day which probably added to the complete horror of our experience. It was hellishly busy, loud music intruding , tacky, trashy shops, junk food and the tragedy of homelessness and drug abuse added to the depressing scene. the beach looked beautiful but we couldn't wait to get away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832carolt
50,Interesting placr,We have been to Venice Beach a couple of times and personally I find it a little intimidating because there are so many homeless people around there. My husband really likes the atmosphere at Venice Beach so it appears that it is just personal preference. On the last occasion we went there we hired bicycles from Santa Monica and cycled through Venice Beach down to Marina Del Ray which was great fun. Venice Beach is definitely worth visiting as long as you are prepared for the high number of homeless people that hang around there. We have never had any problems while we have been to Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandyB679
50,Venice,"Awesome Beach. The mood is cool, and the people are just really friendly. All in all I had a great time. Thanks Venice!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844emadp
10,Venice Beach - Sad and disappointing,"We had looked forward to visiting Venice Beach but were really disappointed by it. It wasn't full of interesting eccentrics as we had been led to believe but rather beggars, junkies and hustlers. There was a sense of hopelessness about the place and it just felt seedy and tawdry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arthurs823
30,Raw Muscle,"Venice Beach is one of those must see LA places, though I'm not sure why. It's a bit dirty and tacky and there's not a lot to see apart from some peacocking muscle guys and skateboarding dudes. 30 min stroll through is all you need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheThrifyFiftys
40,Beautiful beach,"We visited while in L.A. and guess what? Parking costs a lot no matter where you go in L.A., including Venice Beach. Beautiful beach with lots of ball courts and the workout area (Muscle Beach) where Arnold and several others used to show off. Lots of crummy little clothing and food shops stretched out along the street side of the beach area. Nasty public restrooms with homeless people doing PTA baths at the sinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g3times
50,Highlight of our trip,"Love Venice beach on a Saturday afternoon, great vibe, basketball tournaments going on, muscle beach workout area looked sad and a little run down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beaglesx2
40,Must see Venue near LA!!,"Venice beach is a place to go for people watching and taking a long stroll along the boardwalk. A mixed array of different people from across all cultures. Lots of shops and restaurants make this a fun activity. A lot of artists selling their crafts. Interesting shops . One is the Titanic Boutique with iron sculptures, clothes,hats and knickknacks .. worth browsing I bought a great western hat that havent seen before. The beach is long but the water is cold so keep that in mind",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockdoc7
30,Large beach but not much going on.,My wife and I turned up whilst staying in Beverly Hills to see the famous Venice Beach. The beach is huge and is covered with lovely soft sand. The Muscle Beach building was looking a bit run down but there were a handful of people just hanging around doing pull-ups and the like. Biking along the beach track seems very popular but I didn’t see where they were hiring the bikes from if indeed they were.The beach area looked clean like all other parts of the state we’d seen but the public toilet facilities were a big let down. Only go there if you’re desperate.A definite must are the Venice canals a few blocks behind the beach area. The canals and houses are stunning. A absolute must-see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetenCaz63
40,Fun place,"Quite a cool place with outdoor gym and place for workout or perhaps to show off all the muscles.. Friend got ripped off by a clothing shop, originally quote for $45 for 2 pieces of top with printing but end up got to pay double the price.. Refused to let him out of the shop when he refused to pay for it. So please stay clear of the printing clothing shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doraemonger
20,Best People Watching Place to Visit,"This is the place to go to watch an interesting array of people and meet them first hand. The beach is not the cleanest, but it will suffice as a one day place to visit to say you've been there. Lots of washed up seaweed and broken shells on the beach. The Pier beside Venice Beach smells heavily of urine and marijuana. Flocks of seagulls and pigeons with all their droppings saturated the pier. Lots of homeless people scattered throughout sleeping on the beach or walking around talking to themselves. The palm trees are painted with graffiti.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5658JZmichellel
40,Parking is an issue,The weather was incredible and really the sea breeze is unforgettable but to reach there we had to keep rounding to find an empty parking.you have to fo too early specially if your car is a big sized one. The shops there are stuffed with all beach essentials. To get food most if it is to go and they are average restaurants . The public showers are always busy and you have to wait for your turn in a ling queues. Loved the flags on the beach and the atmosphere of people singing and dancing there .it is a must visit place in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wafaan2016
40,"Beach is Great, lots of homeless though!","The Beach itself is wonderful, clean, peaceful, you have plenty of places to work out, buy souvenirs, shirts, fast food and so on, but the homeless community is huge, and you can't feel 100% comfortable and safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirioga86
20,Tacky,"Went because everyone says you should , but not a great place , full of tacky over priced shops and hippies who have sold out.That aside the walk by the ocean is fine , personally I would stick to Santa Monica and the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjoanneh
50,"Fun football weekend-HOTEL ERWIN-Venice, CA","Spent four days and three nights at Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach, Ca with five adults and two children! Absolutely the loveliest people and hotel in town we think! From check in till check out, our every need was met and every expectation was handled! Lovely hotel in perfect location (2 blocks from the beach), most pleasant employees ever (always with a smile on their faces), walking distance to anything you wanted to do, great in-house restaurant with great prices, and a roof top deck with views for miles! A bottle of wine was delivered to our room thanking us for our visit, but most impressive, on day two milk and cookies were delivered to our babies room! Now that takes ""special folks"" to think of our 3 year old and 19 month old!Thanks for a lovely weekend and we will be back if we are coming to your neck of the woods again!Don't hesitate to book a visit to HOTEL ERWIN-1697 Pacific Avenue-Venice Beach, CA. 90291310-452-1111",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieB5623
40,Nice Day at the Beach,Good place to go to see California beach culture. I went during the week so parking was easy and there were fewer people. This place looked like it would be crazy on the weekends. There are many shops to check out right near the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grantds
30,"Ok, but a bit dirtier and full of homeless people",Walked from Santa Monica to Venice and noticed that it got more and more homeless people etc the closer we got to Venice.Quite ok during the day but i am not sure i would go here at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glencampbell112
50,Beautiful Sand Beach,"When we visited Venice Beach I was amazed at just how large the beach actually is. A wonderul place to take a walk, people watch, bike ride, exercise, etc. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAH_Chicago_Paris
20,Disappointing,Beach is lovely but the surrounding areas are really shabby. Huge problem with homeless and drug addicts. Someone had been found deceased on the beach whilst we were there and the police had cordoned only a small area off. We watched as various homeless people approached the police creaming and shouting. Not a relaxing experience. I would not take children here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moreholidaysplease87
40,Crazy place to visit,"Surrounded by eclectic shops, restaurants and street acts, Venice Beach is a great place to visit. There was an old guy walking on glass whilst we were there, totally fascinating but so mad too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jnyfrk8
40,Must see during daytime. Don't go at night.,During daytime it's a great place to visit. You get to see the over the top shops at the beach. You can see many people playing different sports. Most fun to watch are the surfers. Just go on a day with okay weather and good waves.Everything closes aroubd sundown and that's when you want to leave. The atmosphere changes a lot at sundown. Also a lot of homeless show up after sundown. Just ignore them and they ignore you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941bartl
30,Mythical beach,"Can't go to LA and not go to Venice beach. This beach is a institution for subculture, still find lots of artists and marginals. Don't need to rent a bike, very walkable. Good luck finding a bathroom, the public ones are gross.Venice beach skate park is a skateboarder dreamThe canals , luxury houses and beautiful garden are dreamy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorenaMontreal

Restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexaKPL
20,"Nice beach, trashy boardwalk",My husband wanted to come here to see Muscle Beach. The actual beach and the sports courts were nice and cool to see but the boardwalk area is really trashy. You could smell weed everywhere and there are dispensaries all along the strip along with stores selling cheap crappy clothing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smolinsk
40,Good,The beach was really pretty. Not to crowded. The sand was pretty also. The parking was a little uncomfortable. The the wave was the BEST. I on sorry I don't bring my board.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francesb439
50,Nice Day or Half-Day Trip,"My wife and I had some time before a trip to Bali. We spent half a day at Venice Beach. Not far from LAX. A lot of fun for young and old. Boardwalk is fun, so is watching the skate boarders. Walked by Muscle Beach, bought gifts for people. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diverguy33
40,"Nice beach, dirty vendor area.",Visited area for pier/beach. Area by pier was nice and a enjoyed watching the surfers. Further down the boardwalk area with the vendors/Muscle beach was dirty and not worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRLARRYP
50,Don't miss it,"A cool urban culture blast!I was impressed by this beach not only by the size of it but also by the people- watching opportunities; many different kinds of people selling things like art and music.Everything about it was awesome. I actually enjoyed my time here a lot more than Santa MonicaGo in the morning and park at one of the small lots close by. You can pay for a ""day stay"" or by time.Tip: change into swim suit before you arrive. The bathrooms are shabbyMust dos:1)go to Big Daddy's pizza for a slice ($5) . Some of the best pizza I've ever eaten!2)buy some cool sunglasses",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305chelseaj
30,Good vibes!,We went there on a weekday and the place was not very crowded but the touristy atmosphere was there and lots of people doing their thing. Place was a little dirtier than Santa Monica but it was a nice place to people watch and watching the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shedee
10,Gross,"Venice Beach is disgusting. It's a homeless camp - I thought I might catch something by just walking through. The nice little sitting areas are all over-taken by the ""campers"". Would never visit again, couldn't wait to get out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452colleenw
50,Beach life,"It was a beautiful hot day we walked from Santa Monica Beach up to Venice beach .lots of people enjoying the music along the way . It was the Fourth of July the beach was full of people, we hired bikes and road back to Santa Monica ... then back to Venice beach that was great fun but u have to go pretty fast as everyone else is . There is lots of shops and bars around to stop and have something nice to eat and drink .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agnus10
50,Nice,"Nice to see surfers at this place! Also, Nice view from Baywatch towers ;)Sun, sand, ocean, very nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjuroA2
30,Seedy,"Glory days are gone. Venice Beach is seedy, dirty, and sad. It's loaded with homeless people, and feels borderline unsafe. It's such a shame. The City of Los Angeles has been remiss in preserving the charm of Venice Beach, and even more to blame for the abundance of homeless. While there are beautiful parts of Venice (Abbott Kinney shopping, Venice Canals), don't bother with Venice beach. And, definitely don't go there with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadhouseNY
40,nice beach / interesting night live,"a wonderful beach and an interesting night life at the boardwalk, you can see a lot of freaky people.Some interesting shops are there, some restaurants, prices are high...Parking is expensive, you may check the streets in the back of Pacific Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4359KDpeterm
50,Sunset by the beach 💛,"My friend is new to the US and we decided to go down to Venice Beach and watch the sunset. When we got to the Ocean Walk, it was very lively, there were different performances on every street, some people were filming the beauty of the place, it is bike friendly, there were also a couple of skaters and a famous gym as well named Muscle Beach! It was a bit crowded with all the tourist stopping in The middle of the street to take photos. My friend and I had a really great time catching up and we had a chill walk around Venice Beach. 👌🏽👌🏽",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammmwah
30,Sundays are packed,"Made the mistake of going on Sunday and it was really packed! The parking cost me around $40 too.There are multiple fast food restaurants along the beach and lots of touristy shops. It had a rowdy feel to it and it was really the only place along the west coast that it didn't feel very safe.Kind of a let down in terms of the gym at the beach - very commercialised and expensive.You definitely need to go see it by yourself, but certainly not on a Sunday and expect a let down.And remember to take water with you as it is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackTheExplorer
50,"Fun, loved the beach and people watching","On a visit to Los Angeles traveling with two teenagers just graduating from high school this was the beach they wanted to see. We had a lot of fun we got there early in the morning by 10 a.m. to assure parking which we found only feet away from the beach. We only had to pay $15 for the entire day. The beach was beautiful in July, not too crowded but the water was cold of course. The kids love the boardwalk we had a wonderful lunch and walked up and down just people watching and t-shirt shopping. Lots of stores and lots to eat, really funny characters along the way. The smell of marijuana everywhere LOL but I guess that is expected. Traffic was horrendous, plan on your travel time being longer both ways if you're traveling far. We came from downtown Los Angeles which would have been 30 miles and it took us an hour and a half to get there. Saw it once, we don't need to go back. But it was an experience that we loved and got to see Muscle Beach and all the great landmarks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momma252
40,"Classic beach, city charm, Cali vibes and good shopping, ok to swim","Venice is such a unique, wonderful place in a lot of ways! It just depends what you are looking for.If you want a super fresh, outdoorsy experience of swimming and nature, DON'T go here, haha. It can be beautiful and fun (I mean, it IS a beach and the ocean is always pretty) but it's more of a ""social"" kind of beach. (Go to Zuma/El Matador or even Marina Del Rey to get more space and good swimming/boogie boarding in for those all-day nature-days).If you want to be able to combine your beach-day with some more city-like vibes and people watching, it's amazing. Browsing wild shops and funky hippie boutiques, touristy stuff, bars, cafes and ice cream and hot dog stands and then get your feet wet, feel your toes in the sand, etc. this is the place for you!Parking can be rough so if you're willing to park about a 5-10 minute walk away from the beach it can be pretty easy to get free street parking. Good for saving money! And then you get to explore more of the area. (Which, as you will read, is what I think makes Venice worth going to, anyway). Been going here for over 15 years with my girlfriends.It's iconic and there are a lot of characters and scantily clad dudes and women, but it can be a little sketch on the main boardwalk and the alleyways, so just keep your eyes open if it's really crowded and especially if you're there late at night (Nothing horrible, just can be lots of ""beach bum"" types and some dodgy characters that could be a bit intimidating depending on who you are and if you are there alone or not).Great drum circle at times on the beach, look for that if it peaks your interest, performers doing crazy things, all of which you'll see if you walk down the beach path. (Go north to towards the pier to walk towards Santa Monica).The beach for swimming is decent and doable, and best (I think) for just laying out when you want to be around people. As I said it's a good beach to do a half day and then shopping, eating, etc. A very eclectic spot that is full of Cali history and vibes.What's especially great about it is you can walk away from the beach about 10 minutes and go exploring on the (now) super posh but still beachy Abbot Kinney blvd. nearby and all the cute shops and good eats (and coffee) etc. It's a wonderful area and also great at night; bustling and good for a nice night out but still got that casual beachy vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726jamiel
50,Wonderful,"Great place to go with anyone, fantastic for a day in the sun and a lots of cool 😎 place to hung out, bar restaurant and fitness.... is a must if you in LA ....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Georgejung13
40,Venice is a very unique destination,"Venice has much to offer. The beach and ocean, street vendors and people watching. Shopping is also available. Going to Venice beach is a true adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susannG5194YI
40,It's in my backyard-I live in Venice,If you think that you are getting the Cote D'Azur with Venice Beach - let me be the first to tell you - it's not! Don't expect cultivated civilized behavior. The boardwalk is a carnival for the senses - there are tourist shops whose business it is to prey on you - know this now! Don't shop on the boardwalk. Keep your wallet hidden. Having given you the warnings - do enjoy yourself! it is the greatest display of people watching on this coast. Leave your judgments behind - this is Venice and everything goes ... feel free to be free! Watch the most enchanting sunsets ever created - watch from a distance as the Santa Monica Pier begins to sparkle ... Venice is the decadent part of ones soul - walk far enough north and you can feel the vibe instantly change from Venice to Santa Monica (much more 'orderly')Watch them work out at muscle beachWalk the boardwalk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4549ZXlizs
40,Venice Beach is always a great experience,"From the roller skating guitar playing rasta man, to the vendors selling art work , henna tattooes and palm reading, and fun food choices, there is never a dull moment at Venice beach! Places to be sure to stop at are Muscle Beach and the Venice Beach Bistro. Make sure to check prices at multiple stores before buying souvenirs, prices vary greatly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jildac
40,Classic Los Angeles venue,"Best viewed on the weekend, when all the ""freaks"" are out and about. There are always odd people hawking goods and viewpoints along the beach, along with an ever present smell of marijuana smoke. On the little side alleys, you can find some decent street-type food. A few blocks away (inland) is Abbot Kinney Blvd, which has more food and sights to see. Unfortunately, Abbot Kinney has gone upscale in the last 5 - 10 years, so it is not quite as funky as it used to be. Still, the Venice beach area is well worth a visit. Parking can be difficult if you are looking for a free spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalstew
30,hummm ... good,dozens of small shops with the same stufff surrounded by teens with skateboards and skatesNot decadent but glorious time was over.Go to santa monica pier or take A1 down to Huntington Beach if you have some time.Much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yons130

I wouldn't bring my kids here though...Marijuana, fortune tellers, gift shops, marijuana, performers, street food, Marijuana, basketball courts, muscle beach, homeless ppl, Marijuana. ..it's something to see.

40,My fave to visit!,"A stroll down Venice is a must when in LA. See the beautiful beach and surfers in the ocean. Fantastic bike and roller blade promenade for miles. Crazy people watching, skaters, hand ballers, street basketball and pickle ballers. Don't forget about the outdoor bodybuilding gym as well. So many eclectic shops to buy the craziest stuff you will ever see. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/webb
40,Good beach,"Its a nice beach to spend your time. Its not too crowded the day we visited. There is a path to Bicycle on the beach. There is a market just along the beach which has eateries, musician playing, souvenier shops. One can roam around and enjoy that as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
40,Enjoy but be careful,"Nice for typical day on the beach, sunbathing, swimming, picnicking, there is an area of roller skating. The buildings around it have nice artistic graffitis on them. Shops around it sell interesting things but people there are a bit creepy. Nothing happened though. Some lovely dining options are available too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PinkRosesN

50,Legendary Hoops Park & Beach,"A great beach! Clean as well as cultural. The markets a filled with cheap souvenirs and great tasting food, that'll leave you wanting more when you sadly depart. Had no problem with my stuff out in the open. But those curious of how to hide you stuff, I dig a hole and bury my personal belongs under my beach towel. Put everything in a plastic knack with a string attached and pull it out when you leave.2 take sways from the beach.1.) a creepy looking clown bum was harassing me kids and trying to make them balloons and just wouldnt leave. It got to the point where I had to be physical.2.) lifeguards approached us to inform us about being in the surfing side of the beach. Apparently there are 2 sides, one for pedestrians to swim close and far. The other side is for surfing. Didn't see any signs but that's what we were told.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BW303
20,Disappointed,"This was not at all what we thought it would be, it's run down and full of tacky cheap shops. The muscle beach area is old and worn out looking and it's not the type of place you wold want to be after dark. We walked down from Santa Monica pier and was a contrast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starbar1414
30,Took out of town visitors,This has been one our recommended places to visit in the past. But the influx of wino's & homeless people has spoiled the unqiue charatisitcs of this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morfynn
50,Love it,Always something new to see on the board walk. Never a boring moment. Love walking from the Santa Monica pier to the Venice pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geniousiam
40,Better than Santa Monica,"For me personally, if you're looking for quality beach time then you should choose Venice over Santa Monica. It's definitely more artsy and the vibe is a lot different, but it's not nearly as touristy and corny (at times). The shops are fun, the street art is to die for, and you can't beat walking up and down the Venice Canals to see the houses and the boats.Definitely a must-see beach if you're in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PH2003
30,A visit to Venice Beach,"The beach attract a wide range of people. It is well policed so you feel safe but it could be cleaner. There are interesting places to buy souvenirs of all types and legal drugs and tattoos are available along the walkway. The beach is quite nice particularly in the late afternoon when the sun is setting. The places is crowded on weekends and holidays. I think there are better beaches for locals such as Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica and Malibu. However, Venice Beach is quite unique for the tourist and includes body-building equipment and other attractions not available at the other beaches. There are also plenty of bars, food service places and other places to purchase cheap souvenirs. Some people would not appreciate the Venice Beach crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H44AEgabrielr
50,A key and unique part of LA--amazing people watching,"Venice Beach is hip, bizarre, seedy and quintessential Los Angeles and the beach scene. I recommend walking around and then renting a bike and heading south, maybe even to Manhattan Beach or Hermosa Beach.

20,An 'alternative' beachfront to walk along.,"A polar opposite to Santa Monica which is the next beach along. The stalls, bars and restaurants are aimed at a young generation and were to me of lower quality.

50,Great noon on a nice beach !,"Venice beach is a very nice spot for swimming, surfing and sunbathing. Its full of attractions, shows, street musicians. Very warm ocean and super cool waves.

Other than that, swimming experience was super cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauruze
40,Nice waves and fine sand,"The beach is huge and there is plenty of space for everyone. We used to put ourselves close to the pier so you could walk in the water both from the beach and from the pier.Some days it becomes very big waves so you have to be a little careful.You have the whole seafront behind you so you want a bit more peace and quiet, so I recommend renting a bike and moving on to Santa Monica direction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Couple_H_A

Stop if you're in the area, don't go much out of your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiS942
40,"Fun, weird and authentic Hippie environment with a lot of homeless","Venice beach is an authentically 70's neighborhood, a lot of activities Basket ball, biking, skating etc. can be seen, beach is clean and ok for a swim, the restaurants are plenty and in different categories and levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenrikC_12
40,must do,"This is a must do although the beach as such is not that special. What is special are the skateboarders, the musicians, the artists and the restaurants there. Great atmosphere and you have to take a photo of the venice sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb382
30,Good and Bad: Worth it to see once,"Venice beach is neat. It's filled with interesting people, some selling quite unique wares. A concert with attendees decked out in tye-dye and clothing reminiscent of the 1970s was taking place on the beach when we came.On the other hand, it is so stinky and there are more homeless people here than I have ever seen in one place. I got to see one going the bathroom in full view in the sand which really put me off hanging around to long.I recommend seeing Venice by bike. You can speed through the sites you don't want to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonC9891
40,"It's a""trip"" man!!!!","OMG ........ you just have to visit this place to experience it..... I have never seen anything like it, literally anything goes, from people selling jokes to pot!!!There is a massive gathering of homeless people and I definitely wouldn't want to be here after dark however felt reasonably safe during the day.We hired bikes and rode up to Pacific palisades which is an absolutely must do the views are amazing, we also stopped off at the Santa Monica Pier which again was just a must do whilst in the area, the atmosphere was just superb. Bike hire is really reasonable it cost $40 for 2 bikes for 3 hours .... in our view money well spent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling-Dave1961
30,It needs some cleanup,"It has been a few years since my last visit to Venice beach. It's not for everyone. I can appreciate the artists and people trying to make a living. I just found the grudge a little hard to handle. Once you settle into the vibe and watch the skateboarders and see the talent from everywhere you seem lose the less than favourable people hanging about. Otherwise a few streets over awaits a lovely surprise ! A street filled with art, boutiques and great restaurants called Abbott Kinney. A huge recommendation to visit there !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diana_Montreal2017
30,Ok beach,We walked from Venice Beach to Sant Monica pier. In the beginning of the street it smells a lot of weed and there is a lot of people skating and playing basketball. But there are some good food places along the street. Unfortunately it was very cloudy and misty so we couldn't see the sea. But definitely worth visiting!!:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caromilla1
50,Beautiful Venice Beach,Visited 8-27-17 about 4pm. A must see when in Los Angeles. Pretty beach. Very clean. Water was to cold for me but that's just me. Touched with feet only. Really nice visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynettam

30,A lot of homeless people are hanging around there,Nice beach but you have to know that a lot of homeless people hanging around. Sometimes it smells really bad. But you can enjoy the beach and sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jochi_KN
50,A must see for those appreciative of the hippie culture!,Having grownup in the late sixties and seventies I definitely enjoyed the visit to Venice beach and the surrounding areas which hold much history.It is less touristy than Santa Monica and much less crowded with many entertaining activities to be enjoyed.The water was cold even though it was a hot summer day in case you are planning a dip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDeSilvas
30,Fantastic beach avoid the strip,"This is a real yin yang experience. We walked from Santa Monica boulevard through Venice beach. The beach is fantastic, really clean and very well staffed by lifeguards. The strip though at best bohemian charm, with some fun street performers; at worst meander through a homeless district that stank of pee. Probably best to either walk just on the beach or take a bicycle so you can take in the best bits and move quickly through the worst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyd437
30,"Definitely cleaned up, but still.....","Weed shops everywhere. Bums, homeless, and weirdos everywhere. But it's a sight to see and a must do for tourists. I live here and instill like to go and see the freakshow.Parking is expensive but if you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes, you can save a lot. Just remember where you parked a d don't get towed!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllTryAnythingTwice1
50,Great Time on Venice Beach!,"Your vacation to Southern California will not be complete without a visit to Venice Beach. Venice Beach is a trendy Little Beach town just south of Santa Monica. Tons of local artists, shops and restaurants. If you're down with the 420 craze, you could easily get your weed card from any number of dispensary doctors for about $40.Don't get involved in any tours. You can get the Venice Beach Easley with Uber or Lyft or you can take a bus from any area in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamSellsCalifornia
40,buy and do anything,"This was part of the Hollywood tour and we had a 45 minute walk in the beach. Noisy and festive as there were performances in the open spaces and anyone can participate. The shops were lined up selling all things and all services from tattoo, massage, self painting, etc and all kinds of items from various places too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsbtfdn
40,Had to check it out,Venice Beach was not recommend by numerous people. Went to see it and enjoyed ourselves. Need to be careful of overly friendly people with ill intentions. Walked the beach and area and of course had to go to muscle Beach. Was not the hype that it is made out to be. However interesting and the tourist thing to do. We walked from there to the Venice Pier. Enjoyed the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6422016
40,Wow - enjoyed it here,We walked down from santa Monica and as soon as we arrived the vibe changed if you are from UK the way I would describe it is like going Camden in London very hip. There are alot of people selling things specifically art work some very unique stuff. There are also food options and street performers. You need to keep an eye on valuables as with everywhere but everyone was very friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyDogChampion85
50,A lifetime experience,I don't know exactly what it is that got me so hooked on Venice. It is one of the highlights of my trip to LA and a place that I would really love to visit more often and dedicate more time to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silviacristiana
40,It has a STYLE,I liked it so much. There are lots of skaters and a huge beach. There are lots of local shops (Marijuana too!!!). So fun place. In GTA V you can find exactly Venice Beach. GOOD,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GianGian00
40,Beautiful and dirty,Beautiful on one end and dirty on the other end. All in all it is interesting. The beach is nice in all stars. The little shops area is a bit dirty and pushy like any tourist spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs476
30,Wasn't expecting much and Venice delivered,"I think Venice Beach is a must-see simply because it's so well known. It's smelly and dirty but if you love people watching this is your place. Would not return. Been there, done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsrouleau
30,Part of LA culture,"You may hate this place or adore it but you cannot avoid it. The beach by itself is nice. Sand is clean and the water is free of seaweed. The strip with shops is sleazy and a tourist trap with overpriced souvenirs of cheap low quality. You will encounter freaks here from all genre from the bearded lady to Mr. piercing, also a lot of side shows are happening along the path. Mary Jane is available and consumed abundantly and sadly a lot of homeless bums can be found here. Years ago, I used to come here to see the roller disco dancers. Muscle beach is a hit or miss but you can see some pretty interesting characters here. There is street/roadside style food available but prices are on the high side. Just a few miles up is Santa Monica beach and pier which has been constantly developed and upgraded unlike Venice beach.Venice is not a place to go with your kids if you are conservative, specially the beach as you can sometimes run into nude bathers. Overall if you are a tourist and would like to experience the weird side of LA, this place should be on your list to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muazzams2017
50,Beautiful and alive,"Must visit spot, so alive, free, fresh, lot's of activities, nice place to rest and have fun! Very alive friendly people. Love the sun warmth during summer and watching people smile:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gotsaoligova
50,"lots to see, hear, smell, taste, and do! Great day out!","We went to Venice Beach not knowing what to expect and we were enchanted by all the fun things to see and do. We walked along the strip for quite a ways and stopped at several artists stalls and booths along the way. We really got a kick out of some of the great creative designs we saw (though there were a few really lame ones too). My sister ended up chatting one of the artists for about an hour and buying two or three of his prints.Eventually, we made our way down to the waterfront and found a nice spot on the beach that wasn't too crowded. We spend a nice hour or so relaxing in the sun and enjoying the sights and sounds.Because we didn't find there was enough shade along the strip and we were getting really hot and tired, we were desperate for indoor seating. We decided to have lunch at the Sidewalk Cafe and Bar, which turned out to be awesome! Great service and delicious food!We didn't have any problems with merchants, as some other reviewers suggested. We were treated very amicably and the advertised prices were exactly what we were charged.There is just so much to see and do here that I couldn't possibly put it all into one review... so this is all you get. Just a wee taste of an afternoon at Venice Beach. Go and experience it for yourself.Word of advice for UBER or LYFT users: We found the wifi really troublesome at Venice Beach. We had a very hard time getting decent enough reception to order a car. If you know when you want to head home after your day at the beach, my recommendation would be to pre-book your car so that you don't run into the same frustrations that we had! Plan ahead: the internet amd the cellphone reception is just too spotty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birdienumnums1
50,Amazing place,"Love love love it. Such a long beautiful walk along the beach. Alot to do & see, markets, food & entertainment. Love how they have a sports center there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354cinit
30,It's A Real Californian Experience!,"It's a place for the young, the tourist, the shopper, those wishing to sunbathe and those wishing to keep fit - either on a bikes, skates or something else. Rental places along here offer a variety of equipment. You may be able to watch a baseball game there at times and other forms of entertainment. . It's a bustling stretch and a bit on the loud side - probably what many would expect - with the music from the shops and the bustlers. Offers a variety of eating places so shouldn't go hungry. Also has stalls and shops galore!! Besides all this, there is of course a big, wide sandy beach and the beautiful ocean. Certainly go there once and you'll see if it's your type of place or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546
40,Funky but dirty,"Venice is everything you can hope for, full of animation, spots for sports, shops and bars. It is rather dirty and full of homeless people and it has a latent smell of weed and pee that makes it quite unique (not in a good way). It becomes even less reassuring at night. Going there on the afternoon is a good experience tho",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britocarvalhobruno
50,So much fun!,"One of my absolute favorite places to say hello to when i get to LA either for business or vacation purposes...totally in love with the boardwalk skatepark, i could stare at those absolutely gorgeous guys all day long!!!!! got bikes to santa monica pier and back and it was tons of fun with my friends :))Could get a proper espresso and healthy meal in the surroundings, whose i had more days to spend in LA ❤️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValentinaB1304
30,This place is changing and not for the better,"This is my 3rd time to Venice Beach. The beach itself is gorgeous, but it's the strip with the shops that is a haven for money dire outcasts who pray on naive tourists to fish out their funds. And it is getting worse.I went into a store, picked up a top from a full rack of identical tops and asked how much. The guy said $19. So I tried it on, said yes please, handed him the top and followed him to the counter, which was on a massive 1mtr tall step, so I could not see him. He then started printing up a new top, with the exact same logo on it. Then said $42 thanks. I'm sorry What!? Apparently the $19 was only for the plain top without a logo. Oh really!? Nice of you to tell me that when I asked! He also tried to add a $25 hat onto my purchase that I never wanted. Very Dodgy and they are all the same.The best description I can think of for Venice Beach is, it's a lovely beach that happens to also be a massive fallacious tourist trap. The strip itself is very dirty and dingy, but very popular with tourists anyway.Be very cautious of your bags and pick pockets and be prepared not be told the truth in regards to prices. Do not be afraid to say NO if the price goes up at the register.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxymcfoxface
40,Best place for people watching,"Everytime we come to Cali we spend an afternoon walking around here. If you don't mind weirdos, bums, performers and people with snakes around their neck. Lots of little shops to buy jewelry and apparel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyerin2019
40,It's a place you should see once in your life for the experience,"Walked the beach once and rode a bike through a second time at sunset. It is not for shopping but there is a beautiful beach, a very colorful crowd, cheap boardwalk type food and interesting sites including the skate park and outdoor body building gym. You can see the Santa Monica pier from this area and bike from Venice back up to Santa Monica, a great ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeF827

Although I am sure there are many who would enjoy the history of Venice Beach, I felt like I needed to take a shower after spending an hour there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U8958QBjenniferw
20,Filthy and sad,"The positive was the sandy beach, that's it. Shame on the city for not doing more to help the homeless . This beach is a haven for the homeless and mentally ill. Very sad to see this. This place is full of drugs and paraphernalia . Vendors and scammers. The public bathrooms are filthy beyond belief, hazardous to your health! Don't touch anything. Maybe someday this place will get cleaned up . Yes go see it just to say you did .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celeb3
40,"Beautiful beach, funky shops and bike riding","I took 3 kids ages 15, 14 and 11 to experience the Venice Beach strip. We rented bicycles and had fun riding up and down the bike lanes. The Venice Beach strip is lined with funky stores that sell all kinds of things for tourists including lots of drug paraphernalia. There are ""green doctor"" shops on every corner and the scent of cannabis flows freely in the air. There are many tattoo and piercing salons on the strip, fast food stands, and street performers. The strip is a short bike ride from the Santa Monica pier. We had fun however be aware that you will be exposed to adult themed gift items such as graphic t-shirts and drug paraphernalia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahavaemunahl
50,Great Walk on the Pier,"We were lucky to have sunny, balmy weather. Venice Beach was a highlight of our vacation. It's easy to drive to, park and walk around. You can spot planes flying out of LAX in the distance. The pier was a pleasure to walk on to the end. It is not crowded (like Santa Monica Beach and Pier) and it was very enjoyable. We were not on the part where all the stores are and it looks like a circus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kabear
40,Crowded but interesting,We went with my granddaughters. Parking is impossible but we got to the beach. Lots of people all over - you have to be careful specially with young kids. They need to stay by your side. The water is very cold. We didn't stay long but it was fun for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiet0813

30,Crowded,It is maybe a once in a lifetime experience but in other great beachcitys you can find the same shops selling t-shirts an other stuff. For a european it is amazing to smell that often marihuana on one place and it felt sometimes to much. So I think it wiil stay by this first time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wergie1

40,Beautiful Weirdness,"As my 13 yr old son said...'a lot of people here made ...BAD ...choices.' ""Yes son...you are correct."" Venice beach is another side of the world that we sometimes don't want to look at but are all better off that we did. I viewed it as a lesson in maturity for my son and it sparked at lot of discussion later. That said...the beach was great and pretty at dusk and we really enjoyed watching the skateboarders. Best way to make the visit enjoyable is to rent a bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKellock

You can play volleyball, basket ball you can rent bicycles and bike along the sea front for many miles with wonderful views of the Los Angles Bay all the way to Malibu and Palos Verdes.

We visited in the morning so many of the street performers had not yet surfaced but there was plenty of atmosphere already.I had no concerns taking my 11 year old to check out the famous Muscle Beach and the skateboard park. We weren't in the market for a tattoo but did enjoy taking selfies against the graffiti wall and the graffiti covered palm trees on the beach.We were there as part of our "" A DAY IN LA"" tour and it was particularly useful having our guide point out the Jim Morrison and Arnold Swarzenegger murals.We were also shown the canal where some of the celebs allegedly have homes.All in all no resemblance to the Venice upon which it is modelled but an integral part of the LA landscape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chilli_bom_bom

From the humorously named Malaka Brothers (very funny if you speak Greek, but you may then not eat there) to the guys selling medical weed cards. I bought 20 fidget spinners and more tourist crap than I thought possible, but I had a great time doing it.

Artist are very talented. There is plenty to do from surfing to cycle riding. The beach has a body building section which is very small but has a lot of people training. There is also a separate section for Boxers training. The dad is col as it's the Pacific and has ideal waves for surfers of which there are many. Plenty of life guards about as well as police patrols. This makes you feel safe.The prices here this year are really expensive so you need to really budget out here.

BIG MISTAKE! The place we are staying is nice and that will be another review, but Venice Beach is pathetic and I DO NOT recommend anyone bring their children here if they haven't already been exposed to homeless people who are screaming profanities and scattered the entire length of the beach. The local street vendors store fronts are plastered with graffiti. My children (who are teenagers) were scared to death and needless to say, we didn't spend any time directly on Venice Beach.

But you get a vibe for California here.,"Easy walkable beach (and walkable to Santa Monica Pier, which I highly suggest ending your day there, it is perfect lit up at night). Venice beach has every kind of ""california"" type person you can find. It is best for people watching, there are much more relaxed beaches for spending laying out or in the ocean. Don't get me wrong, you can do that here, but it isn't as relaxing. Worth seeing but wouldn't spend more than an afternoon here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisa_0123210
40,"Cool beach and lovely walk through ""Venice "" waterways .","We had taken a day trip to Santa Monica and then took a lovely walk to visit Venice Beach .The beach walk itself brought us through an area filled with creative wall art and individuals/ artists from all areas of life united in the love of the area .From this we then travelled up to see the the beautiful waterways of what could only be described ""little Venice "" in Los Angeles .Beautiful houses linked by canals and bridges were so cool to see and only a stone throw from the beach .A must see part of this lovely area .Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did :)M",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belledub
40,Venice Beach experience!,"The family and I stayed at one of the beach hotels for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The beach itself is immaculate and groomed each night with lifeguards every few hundred metres. The area to the left of the skatepark adjacent to the surf area is particularly good for families where the beach shelves gently into the sea so good for younger children. The beach front has a festival like feel to it during the day with all sorts going on and there is no other place like it for people watching! It made me feel very nostalgic, taking me back to the late seventies as a teen during the early skateboarding era and regardless of your interests, a visit to the beach skate park is a must! It's Venice beach, so yes, there are homeless people around but in three days and three nights we didn't feel intimidated once as appose to experiencing aggressive begging in our hometown in UK!! The area is discreetly well policed but common sense applies with regards to valuables etc. There are places to eat at all levels and whilst generally prices are inflated because of where it is, you can snack on slices of pizza etc for three dollars, so a day here doesn't need to break the bank if on a budget. A definite highlight of our trip...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenC292
50,Muscle Beach!!,Went to check out the scene.. it was awesome... I even went to pump iron at he iconic Muscle Beach..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PenniesEarned
10,Dirty / freak show,"Totally disgusting. ""Green doctor pot places "" everywhere ...Dirty and full of freaks/ homeless / squatters. Do yourself a favour and go to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momof3kidsToronto
50,The Venice experience,"I prefer this beach to the other LA beaches. Get down by the skate park and hoops courts and just people watch. We got 2 dozen tasty wings at the corner wing place and just watched in awe as the world passed us by. Dope smoke abounds! The roller skater dancers are fascinating to me. The beach is good for plain old sun tanning and surfing. If you are not into the alternative scene and the occasional shocking/offensive site, then head north to Santa Monica. This is more of a freak show. But a cool one. People where bikini bottoms that say things like ""this @ss is not gonna slap itself!!"" Tip: don't get cute with parking. Find the first place (even if you pay $20) and walk there from a distance. You can get caught in a snarl of traffic and 90 minutes later you're yelling at your spouse and wondering what happened!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubberbubby
40,Venice beach,"We wanted to see muscle beach. What we didn't want to see was all the other stuff. Interesting environment. Could people watch all day. If you want a beach... go down by Marina del Rey. If you want the touristy Shops, and dog walking, go to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2913LTlisas
40,Beautiful sunset,One of LA's iconic beaches - great for watching the sun go down behind the Hollywood hills whilst watching the surfers in the waves!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726karinh
30,Grubby,"Quite disappointing to tell the truth. Lots of touristy shops, Muscle Beach rather small and unimpressive, but somewhere you have to go I suppose!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6937GFdebbies
50,Crazy,"It is an experience. Great people watching and seeing the big guys at muscle beach. so strong. Everyday is different and fun. The beach, skate park is mesmerizing. There is a great bar called Highs. It is a rooftop bar and snacks and an amazing view for a sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/draydo
50,Venice Beach was a lovely surprise,"I didn't know too much about Venice beach, i've only heard about Santa Monica Pier. I liked Santa Monica and we rented a tandem bike so decided to go check out Venice beach. It's hipsters/skater feel is cool. They have muscle beach where they were having a body building contest. I used to be in the local area of Camden Town in London and it had all these little shops that reminded me of that. Venice beach is a cool place to go and worth visiting. We preferred it to the more generic and commercial Santa Monica area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drifting_nomad
50,Beautiful Beach,"The beach here is kept so clean. I wish they would allow drinking on the beach, but that is probably why it's so clean. The street performers were very entertaining and there are lots of food options. I found many touristy things to buy. Beware when traveling with children that there are people everywhere smoking pot; I had no idea it was legal there. Muscle Beach gym was quite overrated and there was hardly anyone there. There was skateboarders, skaters, artists, all kinds of entertainment going on there. We had to pay to park like a mile away, but other than that, it was a great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonb128
50,Great weather great day at the beach,"This was the first time that I have ever been to the beach and parking was no issue. The weather was great although the water smelled horrible. There were no crowds which was a huge plus. You could pick anywhere that you wanted to sit on the beach!!! My husband got sick while at the beach at the lifeguard got him help immediately. The paramedics did a piss poor job of helping him, I am so glad that my husband didn't die. So as long as you are well this is a great beach to attend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendita
10,Another awful LA 'attraction',"Do not put yourself through the ordeal of visiting this god forsaken place. An iconic beach that has been taken over by druggies, down and outs, tacky street performers and cheap awful shops.The pier area is better but not great. The beach is pristine but the boardwalk is a mess. The whole area is something I will never return to, which is a shame.As with the rest of LA it relies on tourists doing the tourist things and makes no effort to make the experience enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidfN211JF
50,Winter family trip,"There isn't anything that compares to Venice Beach!! Just stroll along the walk way and enjoy all of the different people, cultures and the Crazies. Lots of great places to eat. Just sit, enjoy and watch it all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727deborahs
40,Glad to have finally seen it for myself,"If you're from the U.S., you've heard about Venice Beach all your life. It was fun to finally see it in person. The beach is SO WIDE and long. Didn't like that you can't have drinks on the beach, but that is the case all over CA. It's a lot of open space, for not sure what. People watching was fun. The waves were incredible the day we were there. Enjoyed watching the surfers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oliviababy2016
50,Crazy Cool,"Venice Beach! Crazy place but very cool and eclectic too. You can see the world pass by on any given weekend.

30,Average beach,"When we compare with this beache with US south east beaches, it seems to be very average. There are no making views of water or beach markets. All is very simple and nothing much to do. We went during July m onth and it was cold after sunset. U can walk to Santa Monica pier from here which is nice. The only thing which I liked was the beautiful sunset view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saher2015
50,A must when you visit to LA,"It is unique, it is Southern California at it's best, and worst! Sunshine, artists, skate boarders, beach, the beautiful Pacific, t-shirts and ice cream. You also can get a contact high from all the medical marijuana in the air...not sure if that's good or bad. There is a homeless issue as well-what better place to be if you find yourself in that predicament. Parking is available at Rose Avenue, there is a great cafe or go to the old Firehouse for a bite to eat or just head to the boardwalk for the sights and sounds! Spend the day or spend an hour-but make sure you get there !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunaday
50,Love Venice Beach,I always try to come here when i am in LA visiting my sister. This time i walked to the ocean to dip my toes in the water and take a walk on the beach. Had lunch at a nice place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lgage2017
50,Fun for a layover!,I love visiting Venice Beach while I am on a layover because it's a great way to get outta the hotel and just walk along the beach. So many little arts and craft vendors as you start your walk to the pier. Definitely a fun place to go if you are visiting LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/458greerg
50,Just like the movies,"Me and the hubby went on our trip out in LA. The sand was so hot felt like I was walking on hot coals. Otherwise plently of room large beach. Saw the skateboard park, it was cool watching them skate. The boardwalk was smooth no steps to climb up. The locals were doing there things, playing instruments, dancing, singing and hustling tourist out of their money. Just what you expected to find on Venich Beach. Great vibes, merchants are very friendly. A MUST SEE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738shamils
20,Don't bother,"Were were told to go to Venice beach to say you've been! Why did I bother. Parking expensive between $10-$20 for the day if your mad enough to stay that long. Thankfully we paid $2 for one hour on a meter and probably was half an hour of that. Tacky, dirty horrible place full of skateboarders, street artist's?? strong smell of weed, urine and lots of homelessness. Go to Santa Monica beach up the road which is lovely and worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M159KRcarolinem
50,Nice beach,"I went there last evening and we caught the sunset, it was amazing. The beach is clean and there are also many restaurants over there, and also a Starbucks, I am totally a big fan of Starbucks. I recommend everybody go around 6-7, coz not too hot or cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yumixr
30,Not for families with young children,"We knew what to expect going in but I certainly wouldn't take small children to Venice Beach. The homeless population is very apparent and it was hard for my 12 year old to take in. We did enjoy watching the skateboarders at the skate park and rending bikes. It is an easy ride between Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier. If you want to see the famous Muscle Beach, you found it! However, there isn't much to offer here except cheap tshirts, tattoos, and such.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murielcu
30,Fun to people watch,"took a drive up the coast and stopped off at Venice Beach on our way to Malibu. It was a fun pit stop for an hour, but not really much to do once you've walked out on the pier and back.Take an hour and then get back in your car to wherever it is that you're going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larrylegend28
30,"Overrated, touristic and slightly shabby","Was kind of disappointed in Venice beach. Yes, it's nice to see the famous Guitar man on roller skates (was it the real one, it appeared to be) but otherwise it's just another beach front. Some more activity than other beach areas, but otherwise just the same. Also, parking is expensive. A lot of tourist, a lot shops with souvenirs, and sometimes a bit shabby even. If you have some time to spare whilst in the LA area, go here, but if you have to take the drive just to see it, do not bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasEMM
30,Well....,"My first time to Venice Beach and I was surprised by how dirty it is. I'm use to Florida beaches where they are clean and don't have panhandlers everywhere. The beach itself was nice, the water was cold but the sunset was perfect.The amount of trash everywhere drove me crazy. The people were interesting to watch, lots of street performers. Not much to do, but I found a nice bar to sit and have a drink at. I didn't spend much time here, but now I can say I've been to the West Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nooch21

40,"Colorful vibe, lots of street shopping","Venice Beach was packed with people from all walks of life. It is very colorful, with murals painted on many of the buidlings. Street artists had tents set up to peruse there were also many boardwalk performers and permanent shops to go into. Biking through the area was fun and the beach seemed very active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinedm23

40,Afternoon visit/People watching,"Definitely the place to people watch. Skateboarders were very impressive. If you have little kids, I would skip it...lots of places to get weed...people approaching you asking if you want to buy weed. The gift shops are a little trashy. But like I said, great place to people watch. Honestly, the Venice Canal Walk was fantastic!!! I loved seeing all the unique houses on the canals and walking over all the bridges. Plenty of great photo opportunities. I think that is the real gem and a must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flygirl1993
40,Venice Beach & Muscle Beach,"Went for a walk along the Venice Beach foreshore walking path this morning to check out the famous muscle beach area.This place lives up to its image and reputation with all sorts of characters out and about doing their thing. Playing basketball, racquet ball, lifting weights and handball, it was awesome.A great experience today I can recommend if you love people watching and seeing stereotypes come to life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rod102au
30,Venice beach,Very touristy. Nice to hire Bikes and just cycle along the boardwalk.Plenty of crazys to see. Worth the walk and the experience. Walk the pier and then go the the 3rd street promenade. It's a great shopping precinct with a superb shopping centre at the south side. Park in government parking otherwise you can park in the mall quite reasonable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DazzaWR
30,Went for an interesting walk,"We had to visit Venice Beach as part of our road trip stops. If you're here during the day, it's very entertaining and lots going on. I wouldn't come here in the evening or night as the people can be shady and we've been told unsafe. You see all walks of life here which makes it interesting.

20,Not the best of CA,"Hmm, it's kind of a circus there. The boardwalk isn't attractive. The ""performers"" seem sad and desperate and ""kiosks"" are tacky.There are a lot of oddballs walking around.

Homeless people everywhere asking for money every hundred feet. The smell of Marijuana was so strong, I almost got buzzed. The boardwalk was dirty and cheap t-shirt shops rule the sidewalk. We left after only 20 minutes. Dont waste your gas driving here. Go to a nice beach like Malibu or Hunnington Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854rodneyt
10,Sad plight...,"Flew across the country to visit ""the other Venice"" ... and were appalled by what we found. Filthy dirty and urine-scented streets ... graffiti everywhere ... we thought we were in a third-world country. Visit Venice, FL instead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talimari
30,Worth a Look but Don't Linger,"The suburb of Venice Beach in design and architecture is interesting due to history and canal homes so very much worth a walk a or drive around this area.The Beach area of Venice is more well known part of this suburb. The Beach isn't the greatest surfing spot but you can go for a swim.The suburb is bohemian and attracts the 'artists', it also has a hedonistic element with 'Muscle Beach' section an outside gym that is more about being seen!!The whole Beach front is lined with cheap tourist shops selling souvenirs, t-shirts etcThere is also open area market stalls selling everything from 'your future predictions' to art works and craft, more tourist trap.Take in the scene and the atmosphere, take a picture out front of Morrison Apartments, one time home to Jim Morrison of 'The Doors'. Also the Unit block next door with all gargoyles and demonic features is a well worth photograph opportunity.This area is worth a look as part of the LA Experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewieTraveller

30,Interesting place,"Beautiful beach especially at sunset. Lots of people enjoying being outside, fun to watch the surfers, amazing skate park talent and generally a good people watching spot. No action at Muscle Beach on this Tuesday eve. Variety of interesting shops and souvenir stands, wish I could have seen them all. Public restrooms available. Drive straight up to the beach and pay $5 for parking right at the sand the first parking you come to costs $20, so drive a couple blocks closer. My understanding is the price for parking goes up if there are events or special activities going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MACVirginia

20,I know it's Venice Beach but.....,Every year we come to visit Venice beach from Australia but this will def be the last. I understand it's legal to buy weed but with so many families walking the Venice strip I was dumbfounded to see people smoking dope on the strip and in full view of everyone. Have some compassion for those with kids and those who don't want to take in your second hand dope smoke.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukephd
40,Great place to see by bike,"We hired bikes and road along the dedicated cycle areas marked on the pedestrian concreted walkway just at the back of the beach. You get to see all the sights and keep a gentle breeze blowing through the bike movement so it does not get too hot. There are lots of people around but you don't get a crowded feeling.The hire is good value, so there is time to stop in the market and also time to just relax and lie on the beach before returning the bikes.Probably best not to go down there at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Top_Tourer_2009
50,You never know what you'll see,"Visited on a Friday and thought it would be quiet. We were wrong. Parked at Santa Monica Pier for $12 unlimited time. There is hourly parking for $3.00 an hour if you don't plan to stay all day. We visited the pier and walked along the walkway to Venice Beach. It takes about 30 minutes if you walk it straight. Venice beach is full of people from all walks of life. There is great street entertainment and we even saw a famous YouTuber that was having random people do challenges for money - called ""Do it for the dough"". Ate at a small hole in the wall that made the best and largest burritos we have ever had and they were only $7 each. We ended up being in the area for about 8 hours so we got our monies worth out of the parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljd4
10,Interesting!,"So, if you are not bothered by dudes on skateboards dressed as skeletons being pulled along by big dogs, people openly smoking weed, shops selling offensive clothing and very sad and lonely looking homeless people then knock yourself out with a walk down Venice Beach! If any of this would bother you or your family in any way then avoid the place. Also $30 to park the car (they must have seen us coming) and nowhere decent to eat. Reassuringly the Police Helicopter was buzzing overhead and there were several Police Cars rushing up and down the beach. Mad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiseMillar
50,Bike path including entertainment!,"Venice Beach is much better for biking, running and beach volleyball than swimming in my opinion. From West Washington Boulevard to West Channel Road just north of Annenberg Beach House on a beach cruiser took us approximately 1.5 hrs. which is exactly enough time to get a severe sunburn. I’ve learned my lesson. This ride can be filled with odd and amusing entertainment, depending on how you see it. You can most certainly catch a good game of beach volleyball. You are bound to hear troubadours doing creative versions of Doors and Beatles songs and see an assortment of extreme athleticism. The occasional person on a vehicle you’ve never before seen, rats and other vermin on a leashes and I guess this list is only as long as the times you have made this ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnossDesign

50,Love it,I love it here! It's definitely a bit weird and wonderful but such a good spot to stroll along! Go to muscle beach and watch some strong men throwing weights around or to the skateboarding park where we saw a 5 year old absolutely killing it on the half pipe! I didn't feel particularly unsafe but I've heard you do need to make sure you are careful with your belongings!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiF2901
20,"Nice beach, dirty boardwalk","I have always loved Venice Beach, but the areas surrounding it are quite dirty and smelly, especially when it is hot. My young tween and teenager were not overly impressed, since they are used the beaches in Florida, which are very clean.Sadly, this was probably the last time I go when visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniekessler
30,Mother & adult daughter trip,Had to visit this iconic spot. We are glad we visited. The beach & surround park area are just beautiful.The market area felt a bit dodgy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandravW6496AL
50,favorite place,I absolutely adore this place! I love that there are so many different cultures to see I could easily spend there hours. I hope I could come back someday. Very chill vibes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/951dominikaz
30,Expected more,"There are no bars on beach, no nothing, or at least we couldnt find any, just a regular middle class beach with a lot of interesting people from all around the world who came just because its a famous VENICE beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maja_ul
40,Good spot,"I've heard Venice beach can get a bad rep but it's a great beach - very swimmable water, clean beach (way cleaner than Santa Monica pier area), and it feels less crowded than Santa Monica. I recommend biking here as parking can be hard to find and pricey. Good area for grabbing a snack, drink and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwoglo
40,Run down but still charming,"21 years since my last visit and little has changed - it's still run down, has a large number of homeless people and a lot of market stalls selling junk - but somehow it's still authentic and full of charm.Great beaches with white sands, watch the locals at Muscle Beach, in the skate park or jogging along the boardwalk.Good fun for a day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miketinmouth
40,Take bike and drive to Santa Monica,"The best way to explore Venice Beach is certainly a bike or something similar. Stop at some of the fun places like the skate park and bike up to (or even past) Santa Monica pier. Relax and enjoy that comes with Venice Beach. If you do it in the summertime do it earlier in the morning or late afternoon as it does get hot. Don't forget to make a stroll on Sante Monica Pier, yes it is a tourist place but a fun one just to have a walk and easily visited if you are coming in by bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895bartv
50,Nice place to visit in Los Angeles,"The famous Venice Beach is a place not to miss if you spend time in LA. Muscle beach, skate Park, bike hiring, volleyball courts, shop, restaurants, and many fabulous local people... Do not miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p0ulet0
40,Interesting place to visit,"If you are in L.A. visit Venice beach. The beach itself is sandy, and huge. The boardwalk area has loads of restaurants, shops selling normal beach souvenir. Watch the kids in the skateboard park, see people rollerblading, cyclists everywhere, a people watching mecca.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5696IFstevea
40,loved it,spent a couple of hours here before heading to airport definitely would return again seemed like everone was having a great time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheslinen
10,Not for families,"Family trip to L.A. and we wanted to hit this must see location. It was easily the worst stop on our trip. No place to park. Walked down the boardwalk, drug deals going down, rap music with swear words blasting. Shops with trashy worded clothes in kid level view. I was hoping to watch some great skateboarding and basketball games and Schwarzenegger'ish muscle beach. It was a disappointment. Don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreye799
50,A fab place to hangout but very touristy!,You know you're somewhere special when you wander along Venice Beach broadwalk and admire the stunning beach. Its clearly where the cool people hang out and they just love to show off their muscles (on muscle beach and everywhere else).We enjoyed our visit but the number of gift shops along the broadwalk may upset some people.Its great to hire bikes and ride to Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJG780
30,Nice but very crowded,"Lots to see if you want to watch performances or muscle men working out, skaters etc. Nice beach, lots of shops and restaurants.

40,Nice walking experience,"This was one of our stops on our tour. We got off and walked to the skate park which was really cool to see people performing tricks and just skating around, then we took a short walk to Muscle Beach. Both are good for people watching and just getting a feel for the area. There are quite a few stores to shop around that aren't too expensive so you can pick up a quick souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1594VQcc

50,History...,"Let us forget about the strange concept of rebuilding Venice (Italy) on the West Coast, I mean honestly who had a silly idea like that. Abbot Kinney, atobacco millionaire, in 1905 had this idea with a partner.Venice of America opened on July 4, 1905, Kinney had dug several miles of canals to drain the marshes for his residential area, built a 370 m-long pleasure pier with an auditorium, ship restaurant, and dance hall, constructed a hot salt-water plunge, and built a block-long arcaded business street with Venetian architecture. The idea as crazy as it seems had some success, still has because tourists are still going to Venice Beach, which was a Hippie Place, a Muscle Beach and now it has become a bit run down.In January the weather was nice, it was not hot at all... beautiful weather... Not to crowded, so I had a lovely experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanG786
40,A whole other world,"This place is like no other on earth. There is such an eclectic atmosphere of cultures, food and people. If you're in the area, I highly recommend you take a few hours to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minmor
50,Better than expected,"A fun experience to walk down the boardwalk with it's array of people and personalities. The skate park offers plenty of WOW moments with a plethora of talent riding it. The beach is absolutely breathtaking and not at all overly crowded. The lifeguards were very attentive to what was going on. People were friendly. Overall, the experience was much better than expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E8336ZBmichellel
50,Everything you've heard people talk about,"It really is just like the stories everyone has told you about Venice Beach. There is an array of people who come to this beach every day. Local artists, dancers, singers, and many other talented individuals gather here. The famous boardwalk here only adds to the breathtaking views, gorgeous sand, and refreshing water of the Pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzyMarie23
40,Really nice beach,"We were here the other day and I was expecting it to be packed like Mexican resort beaches. It was clean, people were friendly, kids were having a blast. Nice place to walk on a hot day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albertacanadafemale
50,The best beach ...,"It really is a dream to visit here. The most beautiful beach with awesome views surrounded by sport, entertainment and great bars. You can't ask for much more than what you get here :)Tip: Hire a bike and ride up to Santa Monica, another awesome beach. Just make sure you stay on the cycle path!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljochan

30,Gotta go see the interesting people!`,"The beach itself is not very clean. They definitely need a coastal cleanup crew, not each week, but each day. So many tourists from US and foreign countries...they seem to no clean up after themselves. The life guards were awesome, however, and really paid attention to the swimmers and surfers. It was really busy. Many homeless people are around, but they are harmless. It is just sad. Gotta go to see the guys working out at muscle beach. It is just a right of passage. We ate lunch by the bookstore (yep, some normalcy here). However, in front of us, because we ate outside, a couple were having their children dance for money. The police station was near, but none around for this child abuse. Marijuana smells everywhere. An older man, playing his grand piano without music right there on the beach! Wow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauriev2013
40,Well worth a visit,"We stayed at Venice beach for a week and I can see why some people love it and some hate it. Its a quirky place very busy with strange people doing all sorts of things on the busy boardwalk, and there are homeless people at the side of the street.Its a place I would definitely visit but not stay as I don't feel the sky high price to stay by the beach is worth the money.Santa Monica is only a few miles away where you have the Metro giving you access to many places also Marina Del Rey lots of good hotels much cheaper than Venice beach and just a $5 taxi ride away. The beach is a lovely place to spend the day you can hire a bike and ride to Santa Monica watch all the people showing of their muscles at muscle beach or have a meal along the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whino186390
50,Bohemian,"Never got to the ocean there was so much to do along the way! Artists are at the entrance playing for tips.

30,Great Place to Shop and People Watch,"My wife and I like to rent bikes at Hermosa Cyclery in Hermosa Beach and ride the Strand all the way to Santa Monica Pier (18mi.).

30,Unique place to be,"Venice beach is packed no matter what the time of year. It is a unique place with unique people. If you want to spend a quiet and relaxed day on the beach, do not go here. This is more of tourist spot to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanjansen
40,Must see in any visit to LA.,"You've probably heard many strange things about Venice Beach. When you visit, you'll discover that most of them are true. Start at bike/walk path on the beach at Washington Blvd and walk north toward the Santa Monica pier. It is a 2 1/2 mile walk. What you will see along the way is an endless international array of people, food, stores and activities. There is no end to the types of characters you will see. Most are very freindly and harmless.The stores range from the usual souvenir shops to exotic items and inluding marijuana dispensaries. There can be many kinds of performers, from singers, dancers, palm readers etc. There's lots of food places, but mainly junk food. Along the way you'll walk past muscle beach. this is another interesting experience. Both men and women showing off their ""stuff"". There is plenty of parking everywhere but if your visiting and don't have a car, both UBER and Lyft can get you there. Don't waste your time with public transportation-like most of LA, it is horrible. Dress comfortably, walk slowly and enjoy the craziness. Safety is a major conern for all of us, but LAPD patrols the path and the area is very safe.You will end up at the Santa Monica pier, which is another interesting LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
40,GORGEOUS,"The beach itself is goregous. It was the best looking beach I have ever seen (better than east coast beaches) but the ""boardwalk"" was crowded and full of homeless people. But I would definitely go again though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736jamals
30,Wow! Interesting,Lots of beach and interesting characters to see! Try not the get overwhelmed with the homeless and urine smell! There were some amazing young people utilizing the skate park and some good musicians playing. Unfortunately there were also some musicians trying to get money out of you for their cd. A nice young rapper did give us a great cd of his music. He may have some future going there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victorial83
50,The strangest beach in LA,You have to love Venice beach for all its great weird traits. I loved going there as a child and teen going to all the vendors on the side of the boardwalk. You never know the kind of people you'll come across. They used to have the Freak show there but I believe they took it out. If you are looking for souvenirs also a great place to find things to take back home with you. And of course you have muscle beach. You'll always find someone working out there. And if you are looking for the green doctor you'll be sure to find them there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNicoleS375
40,Get ready to eat,"Venice Beach PIER - DO VISIT THE BEACHESThe atmosphere was a lot more cheerful, there isn't much to do except take wonderful sundown photos at 8pm at night, walk the wonder line of the beach, and make sur eye leave room for food.Plenty of beach food, hotdogs, burgers, famed Bubba Shrimp and various other wonder restaurants in the area.Lots of druggues, weirdos and beggars a teh pier, so ignore and wouldn't go at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaireJedrek
50,Great people watching & activities.,Great for everyone. You can walk or rent bikes or skateboards to to go up and down the board walk. There are street performers and shops to check check out the pier is a short bike ride a way. There is a nice skate park just off the beach. Santa Monica pier is a bike ride away up the board walk. Hope to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/158timj
40,Strange but True!,This has got to be the strangest place ever! It is an observer's paradise! Folks do strange demonstrations on this beach and there are a number of different eateries. Your typical beach until you really take a look at what is going on around you! You need to see it for yourself! Good for all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PLO528

Speaking as a LA native, a lot of tourists go here to get a feel for LA, but it's a lot of tourists you find there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RioAngelina
20,THIS PLACE IS NOTHING LIKE VENICE ITALY!!!!!,"Venice has been metamorphing for decades; it just gets crazier and crazier and tourists seem to love it. Believe it or not, it is the second most popular tourist attraction in the entire State of California--behind Disneyland. Regrettably, it is now in its tourist trap stage. With the street performers and henna tattoo artists monopolizing the boardwalk and vendors hawking the same old tired t-shirts, Venice seems to be losing its charm. And let's not forget the homeless that give Venice its own peculiar charm.....Parking is ALWAYS a problem and lots adjacent to the boardwalk now charge $30 FLAT RATE ON WEEKENDS.I would NOT recommend bringing young children to this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronnwhit
30,Lively area with an edge.,"Very busy with lots of eccentric folk. Tattoo parlours aplenty. It's not upscale, but interesting to walk through for a few hours. The building graffiti is cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bax52

50,"Nice, relaxing chill","The beach was clean, easy to park. The boardwalk was nice too and had a nice selection of shops. I liked it much more than Santa Monica which was more touristy in my opinion and lacked a variety of good restaurants on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnchantedTraveler2

So much to see,do ,eat, (and smoke if you see the right doctor ha ha)then soak up the sun ,white sand and surf,and finish with a local beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgO4159GL
20,Angry Artists,Not sure I could recommend visiting Venice Beach. I liked it years ago but this time many of the artists on the boardwalk seemed angry and rude. Still fun to people watch. The shops are full of trashy souvenirs that aren't worth looking at much less taking home. The cafe on the boardwalk was a nice alternative to standing and eating and had good food and service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccabN6585AN
30,A bit too gritty,"For folks under 30, the grittiness and energy of Venice Beach can be fun. My wife and I are a little past that point, and wouldn't mind if there were a few less homeless people camping in the grass and fewer street vendors. There are some excellent restaurants in Venice, but those near the beach mostly cater to tourists. As for the beach itself, we prefer others, like Will Rogers in the Palisades. The bike path along the coast is great, and extends in many miles in both directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dollyamas

40,Fun & Funky & Look For The Canals!!,"Between Santa Monica & Marina Del Rey is Venice Beach. Most people don't go to Venice Beach to swim or sun bathe even though the beach has beautiful sand. What makes Venice Beach different is a very long concrete promenade (not a boardwalk) where there are many small stores & food stalls. It is good for people watching since there is a fairly large skate park, outdoor gym, and some street performers. This is not an upscale area like Malibu and tourists should understand this is somewhat bohemian - you WILL see some strange people and smell a little pot. But everyone in Venice is there to have a good time! Lastly, most people never see why Venice has that name - if you look down the side streets East of Pacific Avenue you WILL SEE CANALS!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weRtheWorld2016
40,Now you see it !,This seaside community has a very active boardwalk.The crowd is quite eclectic and very mellow.Muscle beach still draws a nice crowd and there is plenty to see.The real charm is two blocks east of the ocean.The Venice style canal (namesake)is lined with stunning homes you can walk by.Truly a treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123dubdutch

30,"Wow, Crazy, Interesting, Weird Place!","This is a tough review... I loved and hated this place at the same time.I hated it because it was dirty, marijuana smoke hung everywhere, and there were some seriously sketchy people. The bathrooms were a complete disaster with half of them shut down, and the other half requiring verrrrrry long waits. The half that were shut down were replaced by port-o-potties that were literally over-flowing with human waste. Beyond disgusting and a total health hazard. The odor around them was almost unbearable. We also had to park like a couple miles away from the beach and had to pay an exorbitant price for the privilege.But I also loved it because it was extremely interesting with an interesting variety of people. The beach itself is just OK, but there was a ton of activity going on. We had a great time watching the skateboarders do their thing and were informed that Venice is basically the birthplace of boarding. We also enjoyed watching the And1 basketball games going on.It was just a really cool, interesting place to visit. Would I go back? Probably not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
40,Visited on July 4th!,"Our grandsons, 14 & 17, wanted to see Venice Beach when they visited us in July. They were particularly interested in seeing the muscle beach gym and the different actors & musicians along the walkway. So we figured that July 4th would provide all of that entertainment, and we were right! Parking was steep at $30 a day at a lot 1 block away. We arrived early, 9:30 a.m., and after 11 a.m. the same lot was $40 for the day! There was a Muscle Beach Contest in progress when we arrived so we viewed the contestants as they bulked up for their appearance, and as they posed for the judges. Some of these men and women were pretty spectacular! Then we walked a little further along the boardwalk and saw a skate board park toward the ocean. Many very good boarders were performing, not as contestants but to practice their skills and show off. So that was fun to see also. Many boardwalk performers were along the strand which added to our experience. A Tarot sign offered a Psychic Palm Reading and our boys were eager to learn their future. As expected, they listened but understood that this was not an accurate depiction, but they still enjoyed the experience. After testing the ocean water and wandering through a few shops, we walked to the canals for a totally different part of Venice. See my review on the Canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII

It's people-watching at its very best. you'll see an 80 year old skateboarder, triplets dressed as Christina Aguilera, and someone is bound to be offering free hugs. What else could you ask for? Well maybe great street food, quirky shops, and the freakin' ocean! If you start south wear comfortable shoes and in the evening walk all the way to Santa Monica Pier and ride the ferris wheel! Yay!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miller2theresa

40,Less crowded that Santa Monica,"When we came to this area we started at the Santa Monica beach. It was very crowded so we headed the short distance down to Venice beach. The crowds seemed smaller and more local rather than tourists. The beach was clean. I didn't have anyone trying to sell us stuff (umbrellas, boogie boards, etc) like we did at Santa Monica. I would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sableind
10,Not the best place to visit,"Wanted to visit this place due to its movie fame but found the whole experience disappointing. Luckily visited Santa Monica afterwards which is far better. The boardwalk and whole place was brimming with poor and homeless people most of which were high or drunk which was sad, that mixed with the smell and the signs advertising medical marijuana , quite legal here, on ever corner was off putting . Parking was a fraught affair and cost $20. We were pleased to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveEatingOut6
40,You have to see it yourself,"I personally liked Venice Beach a lot. I used to live in Hermosa Beach and my friends and I went to Venice to grab some Food or go out for Drinks.

40,You've Seen It On TV.,"Muscle beach. Thats what springs to mind. They could do with some TLC on the outdoor gym equipment. Too cold the day we were there to see anyone working out properly. Clubs around the area strive to be the loudest so it's pretty noisy, but its a busy place close to ocean. Beach is very nice. Plenty to do and look at here. Our time was very limited so didn't get too many chances to explore the surrounding shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tincoll
10,Scared,The people who live out of the trash cans and eat food from the ground scared my kids. Not family oriented. Not appropriate and lots of Hobos. Would not recommend going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721TR
50,A must visit,"Not only are there tons of singers guitarists, jugglers, [chainsaw even] on the beach walkway but the Venice canal is a must see. I just think how great it must have been to live there in the sixties [Jim MoOrrison/The Doors} et al. Actual canal is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/143adrianl
30,Muscle beach,"It was our first stop of CA. Like the board walk, really good for souvenirs. Water was too cold, so couldn't get into it. Little crowded. Still enjoy the muscle beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soarin2016
50,I live here!😃,"Great place to come and visit sunny California! Many restaurants, brew pubs and great people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356robynm
20,Grim,Seedy and Grim with some of the filthiest public restrooms I've seen outside of a third world country. Go someplace else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callesol105
50,"Venice Beach, lots to see!","Loved Venice Beach! Went there on a Saturday and they had markets all along the sidewalk. These had everything you can imagine for sale and at cheap prices!! Some crazy buskers singing about sandwiches and even spotted a celeb who graced me with a photo opp! (Lori Petty incase you were wondering!).Beautiful walk from Venice Beach all the way to Santa Monica Pier, took about 90 mins but was just gorgeous. If you get tired you can always catch one of the little bicycle shuttles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheChocolateOne
50,Very Cool,"Wow what a place! So many interesting people. We went on 2 seperate occasions and enjoyed the atmosphere. Food wasn't the best. First time was a takeout pizza place and it was not good, The second time was a bar type restaurant and it was average. I would eat before I came if I was to go again. There's plenty of parking for the beach at only $8 for the day. The beach was nice and we enjoyed laying in the sun and having a swim. Patrolled beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693taniaw
30,Walk along the beach vendors,Very similar to the board walks here in JerseyWith the shops with Tee shirts bathing suits gift shops etc. same stuff different coast. Beach is beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ijs11
40,Retro Beach Boardwalk,"Took our 17 year old who hadn't been to CA since he was 9 to Venice Beach. Lots of shopping (hats, t-shirts, sunglasses, medical marijuana), sights (muscle beach), activity (walk on the sand, swim, play paddle tennis). Beautiful palm trees and great people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858ClaireW
40,Like Amsterdam without the ladies,There is a real vibe here but be prepared for impressionable toddlers and prep-teens to be exposed to some new vocab in the t short shops. Nevertheless lots going on and a cool vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinADXB
40,Great,I have seen this so many times in movies and on tv and now have actually been very hip and trendy and great atmosphere from the street band to watching someone trying to rob the ATM !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125richardf
40,Independence Day,"We spent the entire day here July 4, 2017 while on vacation in Los Angeles area.Must say, a whole pile of ""odd ducks"" floating around here, not sure the reason it's so concentrated with homeless and mentally ill people however it is.It was an experience that's for sure, however after a few hours of hearing people screaming at invisible people around them it gets tiring to say the least.The amount of marijuana in the area as well is insane, unsure the reasoning besides the ""Green Doctor"" shops all along the strip here.A highlight was the skate park along with the basketball courts for us, great to just relax and watch the skill levels and all ages competing for the crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew_613
50,Entertainment galore,"So much to see at Venice Beach. Certainly a lovely beach in its own right but the surrounding offerings make it different to anywhere else. Shops, stalls, biking, skating, experience options, people watching...so much - surely something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceL638
50,Colourful,Fab beach with a long boardwalk which will entertain for hours. Clean with lots of restrooms. So many colourful characters on this stretch. Long walk over sand to beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayo55
40,Good place to visit with kids and workout,"It was windy the day we visited so we had sand in our eyes when anyone walked by as we laid on the beach. However the breeze on that hot day was wonderful. It is a difficult walk if you're not in shape or a little kid to get to the water through walking on all that sand. But it's a great workout too!! The area surrounding the beach features the famous Muscle Beach and the day we visited which was 4th of July featured female body builders there in competition. There's lots of souvenir shacks and we lived the fresh fruit vendors offering their wares of fresh mango, watermelon and pineapple. It was very good, sweet and refreshing on a hot summer day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochellem935
50,Tacky place,Don't waste your money coming here.Stay in Santa Monica which is do much prettier.This place just has fast food shops and muscle bound poseurs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erskine129
50,"Enjoyable, relaxing","We close to the Muscle Beach. It has a public parking with 9$ flat rate. The beach was busy but not too packed. People were coming and going. Kids were enjoying themselves on the half board. Waves were good beginners like them. Life guards were properly on duty, occasionally pushing all swimmers to the side in order not to clash with surfers. Quite clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ksksksksks
50,Awesome beach. Lots of character and excitement!,"This is definitely a famous beach, many movies shot here, and you can see why. Expansive boardwalk area, deep beach front, and a very clean water. Strong waves that will knock the wind out of you, so never turn your back on your them. Lots of surf shops and eateries, tattoo shops and souvenir sports. Parking is a bit of a hassle however if you're ok with parting with Abouaesha $20 you will find a public lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NO963
20,Sketchy,"If you're into people watching and the smell of pot this is a great place for you. Not so much for me and my 12 year old daughter and her friend. It seemed a bit dirty and the people were questionable, not all appropriate for 12 year olds. My husband enjoyed it but the rest of us couldn't get out of there fast enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeltY5106QJ
20,"Parts of Hor-al-Bash, in Iraq is Cleaner","Remarkable how dirt, filth and a lack quality can pass for an attraction. If you look like you are washed, have a job and are not from Venice Beach be prepared to be asked for money - to purchase sample tapes of crappy noise (music) and don't even think about exposing yourself to the public facilities.A freakin' slip-trench is better maintained than 3/4 of Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LTCJJFOODIE
40,Uniquely LA!,"An interesting place to check out while in LA, and probably only exists in LA. A mixture of free spirits, junkies, sport freaks, beach lovers, and just about everyone else. Many unique stores are available to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyHS
40,Visit to Venice and Santa Monica Beaches,"Both beaches were beautifully clean, spacious, and well maintained. We travelled by train from Hollywood to Santa Monica, caught the bus to the end of Venice beach and then walked the entire stretch. Took 1 change of train and platform, and 1 hour journey. Well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebP9090DT
40,"Glad to see it once, once is fine","The beach is beautiful - the water was great - traveled with three teens...they were happy to catch some rays. If I had to pick a beach to go and spend time, there are nicer beaches in California. It was worth it to see it as it is on tv, movies, etc. all the time. Easy to find and easy to find a place to park. We didn't mind the $20 to park as it was a one time deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
10,Ugh,"Think of weird people in bathing suits, accompanied by swaying druggies and lots of homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eclmom47
40,Entertaining beach fun,"so many things to see here, boardwalk, skate boarders, muscle beach, street entertainers and of course the beautiful ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachrats2013
20,Not for us,"One word for Venice beach, sketchy. It wasn't our scene. If you are into skating, skateboards, tattoos maybe this is your thing. It was okay to visit once to get the feel of the place but I would not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrew752017
50,Its beautiful!,The view is very nice and lots of things to do the pier is extreamely long it can't take up to 45 mins to an hrs walking on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road705563
50,Beautiful!,"Visited Venice while on a bizz trip in LA. Absolutely gorgeous! Vibrant, diverse, life full! I wish I could stay more than just few hours. Definitely see Abbot Kinney!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bianca015
50,4th of July at Venice Beach.,We visited Venice Beach over 4th of July weekend. We went on Friday morning around 10 a.m. which we usually don't do. There were not very many people there when we first arrived which was really nice. We were able to get a good parking space and avoid the rush. The weather was perfect and we were able to shop with ease. People began to come before we left around wine and the usual Venice Beach shenanigans began LOL. Always a good time....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarynH1
50,Loved it! So quirky,"We loved Venice beach. It was super fun to people watch. Our kids are 6 and 7, and they had a grand time. We played on the beach, had some GREAT poke at Poke-Poke, watched the skateboarders, and bought our tacky touristy gifts. But by far it was most fun to just watch the wide range of people walking by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BECAddo
10,Past it's best - by a long way,"We wanted to visit as we had seen a lot about it over the years. To say it's run down is an understatement. The iconic "" muscle beach "" is a rusty relic with many homeless sleeping on park benches. I'd go as far as saying it's not that safe either. It's a pity but just stay with Santa Monica further down the road",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayWestYorks
40,Wandering,Lots of atmosphere. Muscle Beach was an eye opener. Buff looking people working out in an enclosure similar to a zoo exhibition. Lots of people standing watching and taking pics! Shops were way overpriced for a 'market' atmosphere (e.g fridge magnets for $6.99).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2845CEsharonl
40,Nice beach and lots of space,Most beaches you go to are narrow slivers of sand overrun by people. We found this beach to have lots of space and really nice sand. Great to spend time relaxing. I do agree with another reviewer that the toilets are pretty gross.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tim_21617
40,Nice walk,We walked along Abbott Kinney which was lovely with great brunch spots and shopping! The Toms flagship was our fave. Te beach front is a bit touristy and smells of marijuana everywhere but still iconic and worth a stroll/cycle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Torichang
30,Rough Around the Edges,"We walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach around 6 pm and found a complete difference in the crowd on the boardwalk, the vendors, what they sold, cleanliness etc. I was with my teens and husband and they are old enough to understand the difference,but I don't think I would like to take my young kids here. Pot smokers everywhere. We joked and said we had the munchies when we left the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanineP40
40,Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach over run by homeless and marijuana. Beautiful houses right on the beach. Dodgy people trying to sell cd's, heaps of shopping. Good for people watching.😎.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellefC2285KZ
30,Okay,"If you like people watching, this is a good place. Cheap shops, medical marijuana, homeless, but a fun skateboard 'pool' to watch the skateboarders. The beach looked nice but we didn't use it. That's about all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helium571truth
20,Great Beach!,"...but almost impossible to find a parking lot. Parking is super expensive. Public restrooms are awful and poorly maintained. The Beach itself is a real sight, beautiful sand, and the peer is just awesome. You can easily rent for example a bike if you want to save your feet. Remember to bring your own toilet paper and a lot of hand sanitizer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115pirittah
50,Great place - for everyone,"The beach is nice, and wide.The boardwalk is full of fun shops and lots of people.Also go past the muscle beach, outdoors training centre and the ball courts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soren_Odense
40,A great place to visit.,"Part of a day trip, so didn't stay long , but would have loved to.Lots going on, people watching is the best.Lots of interesting non chain shops.Loads of interesting places to eat and lots of weird people to entertain you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shyscotsman
50,Leisurely people watching while taking a stroll,A wonderful place to soak in the chill local vibes and check out diverse styles of peeps walking the boardwalk. One of my favorite spots in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492katyak
50,Nice beach with lots of work out facilities,"It's always nice to spend a day on the beach. But it's nicer to spend it on a special beach. Nice atmosfere, a pier. Shops nereby what do you want more? Ok, the ocean and sunshine and we had that to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh342
50,Beautiful Beach,We walked along the beach and into the water after walking the boardwalk. Very beautiful beach with lots going on all the time. Also very safe with lifeguards and police everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150jacobm
30,Vacation with friends,"Many sites to see! Wanted to say I had been there so why not! Many inappropriate sites if you have children. You can smell the illegal stuff everywhere you walk. Not hung I was surprised about, just not kid friendly. The skate park, giant V, and muscle beach were cool to see. The place was packed. Many street performers and vendors. You can eat pretty cheap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wayne1833
50,Different vibe to anywhere else I've ever been!,"Loved L.A. Such a chilled out and cool place with all different types of people and Venice beach is just the epitome of that.People just chilling by the beach and eating food/smoking/drinking. Such a good experience.Rent bikes, watch skateboarding or do some shopping and go to one of the many restaurants.Lots of homeless and I was initially shocked by it but they didn't bother anyone that I could see and they're just people too trying to get by! They seem harmless enough but I'd always be aware of who's around just in case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diddles1990
50,Must see,Love the ambience . A must stop for anyone visiting LA ! There is no place like Venice beach ! I would recommend you take a bike ridge from Venice to Santa Monica .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelseas7221
50,Father's Day,"Love venice. I love eating and ahopping on the boardwalk. There are bike rentals and paths, santa monica is down the street. It gets crowded on the weekends and parking can be a little pricey if you dont find street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKiaBaby
30,Not good on a weekday morning,This place is probably exciting at the weekend especially if you are into skateboarding or muscle building but at 10.00 on a weekday much of it is shuttered and covered in graffiti.Can't say I enjoyed it but is was interesting to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerl044
40,Just a walk through the area.,It is much smaller than I expected. Several different areas. We enjoyed a short walk on the beach after seeing the sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Realty56
40,Good...not great.,"I think we visited on the wrong day. It seemed as if the locals were so outnumbered by tourists we could not see what I hope is not a mythical version of Venice Beach. A lot of great restaurants, bars and shops made up for that. No one was working out at Muscle Beach though and the folks on the courts looked like I could have played with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IkoIkoIko
30,California Classic,"The beach area is nice. I loved all the graffatti, etc. It made for some great photos. A little dirty but all and all, still a great part of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514melissat
50,Mad Venice Beach,"Had a great day out!. We first went to the Santa Monica pier and did the ferris wheel ride which gave you some idea of the size of the beach. We walked from the pier on the main side walk towards Venice Beach. Wow this is certainly a place to people watch and all walks of life are here!!. Had a meal and drink at one of the cafe's adjacent to the side walk and a jazz/rock fusion band started playing opposite us - they were very good so we were completely entertained!. There are wide stretches of sand so a reasonable walk to the sea which was delightful!. I'm not certain if it would be a safe place to go during the night. Please see my ""Youtube"" video's search for MrFabchild",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2766JCstevec
40,Fun place to walk aroud,"Lots of cool vendors, artists, just people of all kinds. Very touristy it seems. a lot to see though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1011angiec
30,A genuine freak show,"Venice Beach is a destination. With its muscle beach outdoor gym and full-time street people, you will be amazed at this cultural microcosm. Marijuana shops are as abundant as the seagulls. Not a place for the faint at heart, it's worth seeing at least once in your lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2500QQmarkd
40,Super beech and fun walking the beach paths,Plenty to see and a superb beech. A cool beer at the sidewalk cafe followed by a stroll viewing goods etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisandJulieM
30,Over crowded and eccentric but great people watching,Venice is old and not stylish. Newer developments and restaurants are the next blocks off the beach. Very tourist laden. Worth a quick visit but much better beaches are to the south.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_irjacobs
50,The Best Thing About LA,"My title says it all - Venice Beach is the best thing about Los Angeles, the place is buzzing with its own unique vibe. Great for cycling, running, walking or just people watching from one of the cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imob84
50,Awesome place to be,Venice beach is one of my top attraction in Los Angeles. Love the broad walk. Lots of colourful people and activities all around. I loved the sunset view from the pier. Overall 10 out of 10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TabraizFeham
50,Soft white sand... Great waves... Lots of Beach!,"We stayed in Marina Del Rey for our vacation. It was an easy walk to Venice beach...10-15 minutes depending on how far you want to go.Our first visit to Venice beach was on a cloudy, chilly morning. Was not impressed. We opted to travel to Newport Beach the next day (1 hr. away). Interesting enough, on our last day, we decided to try Venice Beach out again . It was a very sunny day and we went in the afternoon when it was warmer. The weather makes all the difference! Venice Beach looked like a different beach to us... with sand cleaner and whiter and smoother than on Newport Beach! The waves for swimming and boogie boarding were bigger too!The locals said that the weather in June is not great... They call it ""June Gloom"". July would probably be a better time to visit.We also lived Venice Beach coz of the Boardwalk and the many places (cheap) to eat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5048XHmariat
50,A rave in a toilet bowl,"Wasn't sure what I was expecting from Venice Beach but it was definitely memorable. To sum it all it's like having a rave in a toilet bowl but a surreal one at that.The smell of urine is always prominent. There are lots of homeless sleeping rough with there life's possessions next to them in a trolley. Lots of undesirables loitering around & there seems to be a smell of cannabis within every 100 metres. But that aside, music is always blasted out with street performers everywhere, everyone seems very chilled out enjoying the vibe.Funnily enough I rented a bike for a few hours at a local bike store, unfortunately for me there was only a pink girls bike available. My girlfriend asked I would be ok with a girly bike, I laughed & stated with the amount of eccentrics it won't even get a notice.Great time, highly recommend & I would like to return one day. Just come with an open mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashbobs1211
40,Pretty Beach,"Pretty beach. It was fun to watch all the skateboarders. I am not sure I would recommend this beach to those with small children though, it just didn't seem that kid friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murphydarla
30,Getting better,"Visited this location 5 years ago, pleased to report that it's cleaner, less homeless people begging and less weed shops. Beach was busy and clean, surf was great and the life guards manage the safety of swimmers really well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23shents
30,Better quality beach atmosphere,"Great for activities including skateboarding, roller skates, basketball, running and walking. Good hard bodies to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anagorski
30,Famous beach,"This is somewhere I've been wanting to visit for a long time, having seen so often on tv and in movies. The reality is a bit of a let down. There were tacky gift shops lining the entire length it seems. Yes there were some whacky characters which made it interesting but really, it was kinda underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were a little high. I did appreciate the history of the area and that I saw the basketball courts where ""White Men Can't Jump"" was shot, and Joe Weider's gym as well although it was a lot smaller than I pictured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slim5144
30,Lovely Beach But....,"The beach itself is lovely but it's let down by the rest of the area has that tired and run down feeling about it with all sorts of ""characters"" milling around.We took a walk along the front to Santa Monica where you get the same great beach along the way but in a more relaxing environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi

50,Take a stroll or bike from Venice to Santa Monica,"Great view, tons of sand, sunscreen is a must. If you're not the biggest fan of tanning or swimming, take a stroll or bike to the nearby Santa Monica, the is a path by the ocean, great view all the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627justynap
40,One of my favourite areas in LA during the summer,"Super nice area to go swim, sunbathe, go for a bike ride along the beach until Santa Monica. Lot of entertainment with street performers and people of any kind :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vvpprr
40,Had to see it,"Walked the boardwalk form Santa Monica Pier to this area. Followed the boardwalk to the beach and walked back on the ocean. Bikes and walkers mixed together. Just be aware of others and you should be fine. Not clear about walking directions so we had to navigate around others. Once at Venice there are multiple shops and restaraunts. We ate at The Side Walk Cafe with a great view of the people passing by. Very crowded, but all part of the experience. Some people asking for food at the tables cloest to the boardwalk. I'd ask for an inner table. Great skate park nearby. Wonderful entertainment! Down side for us were the bands that set up on the sidewalk outside restaraunts. Music was loud and made conversation limited. We found a restaurant without the set up music playing at the time of our meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etraxler2014
30,"Beautiful beach, but...","The beach itself is beautiful but I'd let down by the sketchy character of the area itself - lots of dodgy characters around which made it tricky to relax. If you actually want to spend a day on the beach, Santa Monica is a better bet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
40,Fun in the Sun,"The Upper part of Venice Beach is lovely. So enjoyable to walk the beach, see the youth (young and old) having fun on the beach. Between the basketball courts, watching young children being coached, the work out equipment available, each beach persons relaxing and enjoying the well kept beach just puts you in that ""slow and go"" mood. Worth a day on the beach. Lower end is okay but definitely a different feel than ""Muscle Beach""!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraC4981
10,Don't go here if you don't have to,"This place was a shocker.Dosent look or feel anything like Los Angeles.I couldn't eat in the resturant because it was so so dirty.So very crowded,Rough and a just a No go area for ME.I was so turned off.Thinking I didn't fly all those hours from Africa for such a horrific experience.Hate it.NEVER again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charityb94
50,A nice beach and great people watching along the boardwalk,Felt like this was staple we had to visit while in LA. It wasn't that far of a drive from West Hollywood. Spent a few hours looking around. Places to shop and eat in addition to hanging out on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lahelsel
40,Different Experience,Venice beach is a nice beach with a different experience. Many skate boarders can be seen showing their tricks. It's an awesome place for Gym lovers too. Children can be seen making sand castles too which is a treasure to watch for me at least.Feels good to walk. Nice eateries too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singhalanju
40,Casual beach,"We cycled here from Santa Monica. I like it, it's a laid back beach with elements of its hippy days. Lots of stalls selling stuff, places to eat & drink. Plus like most of LA a lot of homelessness. However I liked it & would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandamonkey

30,Dirty But Still Fun,"I've visited Venice Beach several times since moving to Los Angeles. The beach itself is a little bit dirty in places, especially when compared to other beaches. Also, Venice is a little shady, but it can still be pretty fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorr55
40,Interesting place...,"There's plenty going on here.Skate boarders perform their tricks. Basket ball, Gym lovers work out and lots of others entertainment to enjoy.Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christhursfield
40,The LA beach culture,"Spend about 2 hours just walking around to see how the LA young entertain themselves in Venice. If you want a casual lunch allow another hour for that. Watch young men skate board in a bowl, men play basket ball, flex their muscles in an enclosed area, roller blading all over, or rent bikes to ride. People shop here at all sorts of stands and if you love the beach bring a blanket and an umbrella and spend the whole day there playing on the beach and eating while you watch the scene of Venice Beach. Ask people where are the canals of Venice and if you enjoy looking at great houses and gardens on the canals you will add to your days experience.Parking is $ 5.00 for the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486vickyh

30,DIrty Beach,I took a Friend who came out of town to this beach and it was dirty. You are going to get many homeless at beaches in California but the amount of them was more then expected. You do have some good food options around the boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielcC5650EW

50,Never a dull moment,"Venice beach/boardwalk is always entertaining. From people blowing fire to crazy hair and tattoos to aerobics and kids singing and dancing all for a tip. lots of good food, some cheap and some expensive. You can get a slice of pizza for 2 bucks or a sit down meal at The sidewalk for about 40 bucks for 2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/augustined768
20,Passing Visit,Cycled to Venice Beach from Santa Monica. So glad I didn't book this area. It was a huge let down after arriving in Santa Monica....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SURLIS04
50,My Little Venice,"I don't know why, but when I was planning my trip to LA I wanted to stay on Venice Beach. May be too much movies, may just a big love to the sea.Just imagine, wake up early morning, get a coffee in a Starbucks (it could be somewhere else) and meet the sunrise having breakfast on the beach, after that a little bit of sunbathing (just a little bit, other ways you gonna get burned) and a little bit of swimming in the ocean. Or, even better, walk along the beach, a lot of surfers, a lot of skaters, a lot of energy.Yes, that what I was doing for my 5 days stay on Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriabR6368IO
40,Beautiful,"What a lovely lovely place. Myself and my wife walked from Santa Monica all the way to Venice beach and it was one of the most beautiful walks we've been on. Looking back at the houses hanging off of Malibu, the carnival atmosphere at Santa Monica, the amazing beach all the way along, street performers, artists, skaters, cyclists just so relaxing and Venice itself is lovely but again watch out for the hustlers and also on a sad note the amount of homeless at some parts is hard to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottishred74
50,FUN Crazy Day,"Its a Must if your in LA you have to come to Venice Beach, and Pier.This is where you will get a view of our colorful and diverse La people. Its Fun, food is great, drinks are awesome, bars are happening, any hour of the day its a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoKeRsQaR
50,A World Famous Beach and Boardwalk,"A great place to people watch, from the muscleheads working out (it's called muscle beach!) to the hip hop artists selling their work. Enjoy the beach or walk along the boardwalk and check out the restaurants and shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billegee123
40,A paradise in your backyard,"We are close by the beach and it feels like paradise in my backyard. Both vibrant and calm beach . Pretty amazing views .Usually crowded in evening but still much less then neighborhood beaches. Fun crowd , Vibrant art and colorful ambiance.Parking is available through comes with a price if you want to park closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rs243
30,its changed,"we visited Venice Beach 20 years ago, it seems today to be a little more run down, large number of homeless people harmless but still distracting. Parking is expensive and a problem if you can find an empty spot, you will get a parking ticket within minutes so be prepared, to us nothing much to see or do lots of fast food joints, a few pubs and lots of tacky gift shops, been there done that sort of deal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mulgrew
50,Love,"Love the relaxed atmosphere. There is always a lot going on in Venice, never a dull moment! Plenty of eye candy, souvenirs and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403lesliee
30,Ok if your a Tourist or smoke weed.,"There are way better beaches to visit than this one. Crappy waves, dirty water and beach. Smells like Marijauna everywhere. Good if you want to watch the weirdest people in L.A. performing on the street for tips. Weirdo Sanctuary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyt988
50,Venice has kept its identity.,Venice Beach has always been eccentric since it was founded 100 years ago. It has gentrified over the years with the arrival of Silicon beach but it still retains its 60s hippie vibe. Don't let the griminess or the homeless folks bother you. In my mind it only adds to the authentic character of this unique place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412carole
10,Stay Away From Venice,"There is no reason for any tourist to go to Venice Beach. And when I say 'tourist' I include people from Los Angeles. It is by far one of the saddest beaches of the county. The water is not great. The sand itself can have trash even after it is cleaned. And the boardwalk is covered with unsavory types. If you are visiting Los Angeles and want to go to the beach then take Uber or Lyft to Manhattan Beach or Hermosa beach. I would also skip Malibu. Maybe go up to Pt. Dume. Maybe. But even that is questionable depending on the crowd. There are fancy restaurants on Abbott-Kinney in Venice, which are good. But I dunno, the area is so crowded I don't know if they are worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
20,Don't believe the hype ..this place is horrible,All the American TV shows portray Venice Beach as this great place to be.......well its not....you have street vendors selling the cheapest tackiest things on one one side and homeless people on the other......the beach itself is ok but nothing special and the food in this area is just fast food style.......give it a miss......if not....you have been warned,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988mathewm
20,Dirty and sad,"I don't know why I had such an anomalous idea what to expect.There is graffiti everywhere.The boardwalk (which has no boards, just cement) is flanked by flea market type vendors selling touristy non-sense. I was also taken aback by the high number of homeless people. The place just looks unloved, dirty and in need of an overhaul. Fugly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E128XQalexc
10,"Venice beach, dirty!","We road bikes from Santa Monica to Venice beach which is covered in homeless people, is dirty and makes you feel a little uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolemY1985VL

50,Great Times,"I recently traveled to Los Angeles on a family vacation and stayed near the airport. Venice Beach was very easy to get to. The nearby food and shopping was great! The beach was clean, the police patrolled frequently, and we had so much fun here with people watching. Our next trip back will include Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JadeA123
30,Bit worn out,"Took a trip to Venice Sunday morning.Had planned to walk along parts of it, take in the atmosphereAlso get some food and drinks.Only found one pace for that that was good (sidewalk café), see separate report.Interesting but was so disappointed, nothing like you see in the films.Rather worn out tents on the beach that the homeless own, shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87marting
10,Very disappointing,"We had read what a must see Venice Beach was but we were so disappointed. The boardwalk was dirty and trashy, not what we imagined.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wilsonvic
50,Venice beach,Worth a look we cycled from santa monica and was a beautiful ride with wide beaches was hot and had a swim. Venice muscle men made for a good pic.... very American,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395alishas
30,"Once you've gone, no need to return","Sure, you can go here and people watch, or go to a ""green"" shop for a medical pot card. But it's kind of icky. People roaming. We did enjoy the skateboarders.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisamarch
40,"Nice beach, Odd boardwalk","Nice place to park yourself, get some sun and watch some surfing. The beach and boardwalk do not offer much shade after early morning so take that into consideration when planning your day. The boardwalk is lined with vendors, artists and ""artists""...some are interesting, some odd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9845ZFsarahw
40,Fascinating few days,"So much fun people watching, lying on the beach and meeting new people. Wouldn't need more than a couple of days here but it was a pretty fun vibe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretacodyre
50,Nice vibe...,"Really liked the vibe down here, felt like I could relax and breathe, probably got a contact high though... Weed smells are crazy in LA! We walked up to muscle beach, and down to Santa Monica pier... Lots of steps, but a very chill and cool day...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corrie563
40,Don't go if you're easily offended.,"Lot's to see and do. We rented bikes which was fun. I will say be prepared for people trying to give you their CD for a donation and sell you all kinds of stuff. As we walked through the boardwalk, you'd suddenly smell weed and some people wear very little clothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferw394
30,Interesting but wouldn't return,"Boardwalk is interesting , especially if you get to see street performers. Souvenir shopping aplenty , same with food options. People using Muscle beach and nearby sports related equipment was fascinating.We were there only in the day time , with 2 young kids. Don't think I would take family down there at night. We saw police apprehending someone as it is.If you have spare time venture down here , otherwise you ain't missing too much if you can't squeeze it in.We had an LAX airport stay and had a few hours spare and in the afternoon took an Uber (about $7) to Venice beach for a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoosterJo
50,Beautiful stretch of beach,"Spent an entire day lazing on the beach, swimming and strolling through the ocean walk shops. People around were all very friendly and some beautiful homes along the beach. We walked from Santa Monica pier along the beach to marina del Rey swimming and shopping along the way it was a great day highly recommended. Muscle beach is just funny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julzi91
30,"Pretty beach, busy Boardwalk","Venice beach is a must see when touring LA. The graffiti, weed dispensaries, loud music, bicycles and people working out is all there. We visited for a short time, walking to the end of the boardwalk and then around along the beach. There were stores along the boardwalk, but nothing that we were interested in. The beach was the best part for us, but Santa Monica was preferred by our group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lollie777
10,One visit was more than enough,"This may rate as one of the dirtiest, nastiest places I have even visited. Trash everywhere, sidewalks littered. Homeless and homeless appearing persons are everywhere, laying on the sidewalks, sleeping on the beach, on the boardwalk, in the alleys etc. You would have to step over/around some of them while shopping and site seeing. Some appeared to be heavily under the influence of one or more substances, some were obviously mentally ill, ranting, raving, manic appearing. My husband and I work in public service related jobs and are not easily bothered or scared by these persons, however, being immersed in that environment while I am on a vacation, with my kids, is definitely not something I will ever repeat. This area is the only place we have ever been truly scared for our safety in multiple previous trips, including several in Mexico. The ONLY place EVER.The smell of marijuana was THICK almost everywhere on the boardwalk. People openly smoking it from pipes and joints in broad daylight. Again, we aren't personally offended, just is not something I feel like I want to be immersed in while enjoying a beach vacation.On an positive note, if you are a people-watcher, you will never be bored while visiting here. The beach itself looked very nice, was too cool during our visit to try and swim or spend any real time in the sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaB893
50,Fantastic,"Scenery, people watching, tacky shops, good bars and restaurants. Local 'artists', and muscle beach, great beach and surf----what's else can you ask for?.Plus it's close to the airport so you don't have to get on the 405.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomMarietta
40,Gorgeous Beach,"Such a fun beach with lots street vendors, but during the week there aren't many vendors so it's better to go on Fridays and weekends. There are also a lot also many shops and restaurants and fun street performers to watch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KylieN532
50,Eye-popping scene,"Loved riding our rental bikes along the Venice strip, checking out the fun, diverse humanity on display at muscle beach, the skateboard park, and the roller skate party that was happening on Sunday. Great vibes, people out just enjoying the scene. Abbot Kinney is nearby for sophisticated food and shopping to round things out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drawntogroovy
40,Muscle Beach and Sporty events!!,The Boulevard is a cool place to browse the row upon row of stalls and shops. Hire a bike. Eat ice cream. Skateboard...play basketball...swim and surf. This is action beach!! But you can also just sit and chill in the shade of the trees and watch the world go by. Very vibey...great energy and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tereza09

30,Unique as Always,"It's been 3 years since our last trip and most of the Venice Beach area has remained the same. Very artsy, homelessness and panhandlers. I noticed this time however there seemed to be more aggressive panhandling (wannabe rappers trying to make a name). I'm all for free enterprise but some of it was over the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BReal549
50,Vacation fun!,What a fun place to spend a good portion of your day! Beautiful beach and lots of fun shops. Definitely a variety of sites and people!! Great food too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480cjp
30,Not family oriented,"I just visited. It was me and three teens. Everywhere you look is a homeless person, beggers trying games to get your money. As you walk the boardwalk the smell of marijuana comes from the shops. As one guy walked by he blew marijuana smoke into my daughters face. The shops have clothing on outside that have vulgar slogans about womens private parts that's not appropriate for kids. This is adult oriented not like the beaches ive been too previously. Four different times my 16 year old was asked to purchase marijuana and was also asked where he (the other man) could find a hooker. We walked to Santa Monica beach to ride the rides and it was much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellerS4187UL
40,MUST SEE!!,Venice Beach is one of those place's that is a bit raunchy. If in Los Angeles you must visit. Eat at the Sidewalk Cafe food is good and the staff great Tony the Manager,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9543LFmichaelf
50,"Great views, great people, amazing beach!!","This is an absolute must visit in LA!!Between the vendors on the walk path, the skate boarders in the skate park and the amazing food on offer, Venice beach is the place to be!!!There's so much variety for a beach and you will leave feeling relaxed and like a local.You can park on the beach from $5-$10 for the whole day. So don't park too far away",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanieceey
30,The Venice beach,Great for people watching and interesting shopping. Cute little cafes for snacks and beer. Sad about all the homeless people and begging.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynneA512
50,Biking,We biked from Santa Monica to Venice beach. The weather was perfect. Stopped at a cpl shops along the way. Can't wait to do it again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seauxhollywood
30,Worth a visit if you have time.,If you have time visit here but don't make it a priority. Muscle beach is interesting but even that is now all rusty. The street market is interesting and run by what appears to be old hippies who spend a lot of the time getting High. The walkway is clean enough and the beach itself is wonderfully clean and nice. Better option is Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ianbb8
30,Lots of homelessness in area,"Spent the morning ad Santa Monica pier and beach, then headed along to Venice beach. The vibe is different, some of it quiet cool, some weird. I did notice a lot of homelessness in the area. I preferred Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzD2013
40,You'll always see the most interesting people hanging out here.,"On a recent visit to LA we journeyed to Venice Beach for an afternoon. It's always fun to see the different kinds of people that hang out there, there are all kinds. The beach is beautiful and the skate park is amazing to watch what the skaters can do (unfortunately they were filming a movie when we visited, which was still cool). My son loved the gymnastics equipment behind Muscle Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kat1999
40,Amazing!,"This place is so chilled out, everyone seemed to be having a great time. We hired bicycles and went from Santa Monica pier to the end of Venice beach and Muscle beach. There's loads of shops, bars and restaurants. The sand and water are really pretty and there's loads to see. Lots of street artists selling their work. Didn't see any chairs on the beach so take a towel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sgwads
50,Awesome,What a really cool place to see. Many different characters walking around sidewalk entertainment is fun to watch as are all the many different people that frequent the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111randalls
40,People watching!,This beach is famous for the people watching...and it does not disappoint! Be prepared to see very unusual sites! Its a must go at least once!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sciencerules03
50,A must see - bit seedy at night though,"Amazing sights to see on Venice beach - lots of LA life. We visited during the day walking right to Santa Monica pier and back - long walk but really enjoyed it. We also visited at night and found the atmosphere a bit edgy, didn't feel totally comfortable. Best to visit in afternoon when Venice Beach life has got into full swing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyandSarahG
40,Venice Beach,Enjoyed our afternoon stroll down Venice Beach. A lot of interesting people. This is where you can get your souvenirs for a good deal!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trini85Hilo
50,Chill Day with Friends,Today I went to Santa Monica and Venice and I went with my friends and little brother it was a beautiful day out and we went to go in the water and it was cold at first but once we get use to it we enjoyed going there now every weekend I am going to santa monica and venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben0724
50,High from walking through the cannabis clouds but a great experience,"Take the boardwalk, see the bohemians and the muscle bound guys parading around but don't inhale too deeply, the place is thick with cannabis",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intrepidexplorersid
20,Mixed feelings,"We wanted to see Venice Beach for the canal homes. That part was neat, but the beach area a few blocks away was rather scary. I didn't feel safe at all in broad daylight. It was crowded and quite weird. I would NEVER recommend taking children there and rather regret making the effort to see it since we had limited time in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrannyD2013
50,Great,Nice for a day out. Santa Monica pier is along the beach. So you won't be spoilt for things to do. There's the shops along the road walk with a variety of merc. Somehow we couldn't find muscle works beach 😩,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lh1738
20,Overrated,"My husband couldn't wait to go to Venise Beach Boardwalk while we were in LA. What a waste of time. It is on a beatiful beach but it is nothing but tshirt shops and tattoo parlors. Muscle Beach was a joke. The bathrooms and all the beach benches are home to the homeless. We saw no street performers but a lot of street ""artists"". No need to return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunsher
50,Unwind on the Beach,"Have stayed at Venice on a couple of previous occasions.Is a great place to base yourself, can get to Santa Monica Pier, Venice canals, shops, restaurants etc.Weather is normally fine and the beach is well groomed.The residents of the area are generally friendly and don't hassle you.Just need to find a new abode due to issues I had with booking.com on this last visit, as I refuse to use their lack of service again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/well_travelled330
50,Has to be done - hot locals having fun and chilling,"Go to the beach. Stay all day. Watch the skater boys skate, the stoners stone and the bodybuilder work out. Buy some souvenirs, take some pictures. Have a blast.Friendly people all around. Great day in the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlynB1971
50,Unique experience,Must see. Good street acts and plenty of shirts to choose to buy from. Several homeless though. Neat to watch muscle beach and skate park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/206douga
40,Must do!,"Pick a day and take the walk around Venice Beach! It's a must do and a great experience. Weekend days are the best since the most activity is happening. Between the street performers, the vendors, the basketball games, and the eclectic crowd it's a must do when you visit LA. I would stick to doing the walk during the day just because some of the people can be a little shady in the area but overall felt safe and really enjoyed the walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayM22
50,Good ol Venice,"This is a unique beach with entertainment everywhere, lots of artsy shops, muscle beach, Venice oceanarium, you can also check out the freak show too, it's just a unique different scene here. You gotta come and see yourself",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rembertop2017
30,As expected,Venice beach is a must do on a trip to LA. Very commercial. Skateboard park is brill. We cycled so my tip is if you cycle park your bike at the police substation... lots of cameras there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowsh
50,Cool,"We parked very close to the road entrance. For a few dollars could park the car in safety. On arrival, some Street artists put on a show.My girlfriend visited some of the specialist shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1776JKpeterb
50,Probably the most interesting beach area I have seen!,...and my job is to see enjoy beaches around the world 😃I have been to Venice beach during my short stay in May and I had a blast!The beach is beautiful but that's not the interesting part about Venice.We went to have lunch at the promenade (try the fries at The Wee Chippy) and a long stroll along the little shops and street carts. Venice is special! The people you will see and meet are special. Make sure to talk to a few of them and enjoy the local vibes. Go check out the skate park and watch the skaters.Don't expect anything and experience everything. This place will leave you speechless :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felixvornfeld
30,Quick stroll along the shore,Enjoying a warm summer day with a stroll along this famous beach. The water was very cold but luckily the sand was warm. I did find a large piece of broken glass along our walk and quickly threw it away in one of the numerous garbage cans. The beach itself was pretty clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayhoff
10,Just skip this beach!!,"I took my 16yr daughter to see Venice beach because of all the movies she has seen with the beach in them. It's nothing like the movies!! Weed is smoked freely on the beaches and homeless are on every corner begging!! People are very rude and the walk is so nasty. Go to Santa Monica pier instead. We did see muscle beach, but it was a let down. Not what it used to be at all!! Public parking is $20-40 per day. Take a Lyft or Uber to the beach and safe the parking money. The pier is only 13 minutes away from Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthT3130FP
50,Unique and fun place,Visited on a Sunday afternoon and had a fun time people watching. The skatepark was entertainingoing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieS134
40,An interesting experience,"The area has a lot of street vendors selling things from their art to souvenirs. Parking is a little expensive closer to the beach and I'm sure you can find cheaper places to park further away. It is a different culture altogether and worth an experience. There is a thriving arts scene and you will find a lot of murals and artwork when walking around. You won't see too many families with children - it is not as ""family friendly"" as the other beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621fs
30,Very large beach,Cool and free to swim beach. Not so clear and this sea is actually ocean so that be careful while you're swimming there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/595erenc
40,Very Good Depending Upon your Interests,"For some, Venice Beach is a cool place to visit with lots of interesting, colorful people to see. I smelled marijuana no less than 10 times. There are a lot of active people playing sports and exercising. Muscle Beach is there. Lots of vendors selling hats, tee-shirts, toys, and sunglasses. Lots of food options. This is the edgy, yet accessible side of the L.A. beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ogau2015
20,A walk on the wild side...,"Having just moved to SoCal, thought we should check out the iconic Venice Beach. Wow, what a place! Full of street vendors selling all sorts of stuff, most of which is useless, hippies and skateboarders this wasn't what I expected. The crowds are huge, the promenade is a mess and prices reflect the fact that this is a tourist hotspot. By all means go but keep your expectations low. Also, beware... parking is limited and there are loads of valets who charge $10-20 to park. I suggest parking at a city lot a few blocks away for $3.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Husky2008
40,"nice, but not a must in my opinion.","It's nice because of the ocean, the different vendors and the street performers.but be aware that there are people offering you to buy their discs and will almost forcibly put it in your hand- it's OK to say no thank you, don't feel bad. there are some good places to eat, but check the reviews first as there are tourist traps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaG8154
40,Always fun place to visit while in LA,We went there on a warm Sunday afternoon. It is always fun and lively and I love the energy here. I visit LA once or twice every year for some reason Venice Beach dirtier than before hence my 4 star but it is a lot fun and must visit place while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OktayS_13
10,Venice Beach,"Would not tell anyone to go there, dirty and looks like homeless have taken up residence. We caught the bus from San Monica but you can just walk along the beach walkways to get there 1.4 mile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip709803
50,So much to see,"I can now understand why Venice Beach is one of the things to do when visiting LA. Swim in the ocean, play volleyball or a miriade of other beach sports, walk along the promenade, hire and ride a bicycle, have a snack or a meal at one of many restaurants along the boardwalk or buy from one of the stacks of stalls selling their products - so much to do.I'd go on the weekend as more people are out and about to give the place a better atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KdofMelb

50,Awesome,If I lived near Venice beach I would be there everyday. There are multiple types of sports to play and entertainment along the way! The skate park was amazing to see all of the talent!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer557589
50,The home of the Muscle men,"As it was cold when I visited, there wasn't anyone working out at the outdoor gym they have, but I'm sure if you went in summer they would not disappoint if that's what you want to see. The area is nice to walk around in and the long stretch of beach is great for riding bikes and running/walking for fitness. I had no idea that the beach was so huge it takes a while to get to the water. There's not much happening during the cooler months, but I did walk from Santa Monica Pier for Kms along the beach. They have asphalt bike and pedestrian paths in the middle of the sand so you are half way to the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancypantsdancer2009
40,A lovely beach,"The stretch of sand at the beach is long and quite pristine. Interest is added by the volleyball games and the people roller blading, skateboarding and cycling along the sidewalk. There are any number of businesses selling everything from coffee, clothing and art. It's an interesting walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sstoney52
40,"Weekends are best, walk the canals",This is a very eclectic beach. Many street performers. Muscle beach is always entertaining. Grab brunch at one of the sidewalk cafes and enjoy the people. Best late morning mid day. The vibe has changed a bit since the Freak Show left. It is a bit unfortunate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hezzie101
50,It's okay,Well I live and grew up in a tropical island in Philippines. But I have to say I am not really impressed on people here some are grumpy and weird but it's part of my experience coming here and see the Venice. We had fun walking and watching. So many discount store too. This place has a good memory of my late brother in law and hubby & sis in law remember him on this place so I like to be part of it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msfilipinatraveler
10,Avoid.,Whole place seems seedy and rundown. The shops are offensive to the ear and eye. Strong smell of cannabis in the air. Toilets are a health hazard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec642
20,Mixed feelings,"Nice beach walk with separate bike lanes and pedestrians.But how about the junkies? City council need to do something about it. It's public space yes, but being such a touristic place, tourists are retaining horrid images like many I saw of addicted people high and in dire condition. Take them to rehab.Weather wasnt the best, so sure the beach itself will be pleasant in sunny day.How about some junkies we saw under the pier bringing potential stolen bags and searching for valuables inside? What to say??Sad",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardor75
50,Fantastic free freak show!,"What an amazing place for an afternoon. Sure, many will say it's a bit grotty and maybe sleazy? but for a feast of the senses you have to visit Venice Beach while in LA! There's so much to see and a stroll down to Santa Monica Pier from Venice is perfect for people watching. There's souvenir shopping, Sidewalk food stalls, skateboarding, performing acts, people of all walks and talks and persuasions and music and much merriment. If you want to sit and eat my long time favourite is Sidewalk Cafe. It's a frenzy on weekends but I always have my last day in LA here, it's always fun and edgy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179wadeb
40,Fun place to visit,Very entertaining place plus lots of activities .Parking has a flat rate of $15 . If you used the meter parking in the area make sure that you are aware of the time . The citation is $63 plus $2 handling fee by credit card .Conclusion better paid the $15 worry free.The Bank of Venice Restaurant serves delicious food averaging about $15 for food in the limited menu . The toilets in the restaurant are only cater to customers and need a code to unlock the doors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fedtnt
30,Just ok,Walked from santa monica to venice beach and the differance is unreal.venice beach not as nice.dirty and not very nice.was good to see.but we left straight away.dont waste your time going here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/david1892
10,Good day out for people watching,"Traveling with young kids safety and entertainment is all you want.Venice beach has this .I lived near here 25 years ago and the neighbourhood changed a lot .I felt very relaxed down the southern end that was in the old days full of suspect characters ....Good beach , friendly locals and ok food outlets .A good day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greatfulperson
20,Sad,"I don't know what I was looking for or expecting, but it wasn't found here. If you are into ""art"" that can be found at any State Fair, then this is your place. It's one of those things or places that you can say... ""Been there, done that."" The only thing that keeps me from giving this a ""terrible"" rating, is the Muscle Beach part of Venice. That was pretty interesting due to the fact that they were having a deadlifting competition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisj392
50,Just a chilled out and relaxed place to be,We love this as a family location. the beach is great and the boardwalk is a fascinating place to hand out on. Suitable for kids and adults,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveMcNalls
50,"Wacky, beautiful, fun, eclectic!","The boardwalk may be a little grungy for some, but we loved it. The beach is beautiful, our teenage sons skateboarded off on their own and my husband and I enjoyed some coffee and people-watched. It was a fun, chill way to spend a few hours by the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReesS
40,Lovely beach,"Lovely beach with lots going on, worth a visit to see the acrobatics etc going on! gets quite busy on a weekend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quiche_nufc
30,Crazy,Visited here over Memorial Day weekend. The place was CRAZY. Great people watching. Plenty to eat and see. Crowds well controlled and large police presence. Lots of junky shops for souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureamy1
30,"Good beach, Boardwalk not for everyone","Spent a few hours on the boardwalk by Venice Beach on May 24th, as it was too cold for swimming. Interesting characters along the ""strip"" - offering all sorts of services and artwork, and some fun touristy shops. But the thin line between ""out there"" and ""seediness"" was blurred and the number of homeless people - on the strip and 2 blocks inland - was the highest we saw in California. Enjoyed the stroll, but won't hurry back. The beach itself was big and clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173mariep
40,Quirky day out,"Great place to wander along on a sunny day. Lots of food stalls to buy food and snacks. Some interesting art being sold along the path, vintage clothes, clothes and souvenirs. Fun people watching on the exercise equipment and skate park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfl26
40,Weekend hangout,"Come to people watch and see the freaks! Great fun and beautiful beach. Always something to see or do with plenty of dining and drinking options...lots of breakfast place choices too....was here last weekend to see U2 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena....good times, good vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesgF1818VD
40,The sea was foggy and beach deserted,"I had been told there is the chance of fog or maybe smog on calm days in winter, it's true. There were still people walking along the boardwalk albeit they were rugged up. I couldn't see the sea, I only saw the sand. Easy to get to from the metro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benitosays
50,"Sun,Sand,and fun",If your looking for a good beach experience I'd check out Venice beach at least once.There are lovely hotels you can stay at and the beaches are beautiful my favorite part is the sunsets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22maria2256
20,Not what we expected,It was very busy. Road blocked off. Cops Everywhere. No where to park. When we finally got to the strip of Venice beach soo crowded. Some very inappropriate people around. The beach sand and ocean was the best part only.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981yeem
20,Dodge ville,What a stinking dirty blight in this cityFull of homeless and scammers.One of the worst beaches I have ever seen. Dirty smells like hobo urine and looks dirty.Thirty minute visit then head to a better place that doesn't smell like an open toilet.Hey check out the public toilet if you want the full prison experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Themessiahoffire
50,Beach nap,"This is the perfect place to escape for a few hours in LA. We came to take a nap on the beach. We came, we saw, we napped. We've also walked the beach before. It a great walk with mountains in the background. Can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbyf137
40,Great people watching,"This beach is more than just a beach. Of course there is a wide sandy beach with miles of ocean but there is so much more. There is a busy boardwalk where you can walk, rollerblade or bike. There are lots of touristy shops and street vendors. There is a skate park, basketball court and muscle beach where muscular men and women workout and compete. There are places where you can rent beach chairs and umbrellas. The sunsets are beautiful over the Santa Monica mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancym616
50,Love Venice Beach!,Always love Venice Beach! Such interesting characters & little joints to eat. It was my boyfriend's first trip to Venice & he was not disappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833kathiv
40,Famous and Still Funky,A beautiful walk along the boardwalk amid gently wafting aromas of the 70s was fun on a warm spring day. Be sure to go inland for increasingly gentrified shops and restaurants that still reference a hippy past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956kathyl
50,Picturesque,"On this sunny day the beach was more than perfect. Cold clear waves, yatches with open sails, dolphins close to beach and warm sand under the feet. Children made sand castles and people were surf boarding.Showers were close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/231romanas
40,"Muscles, Craziness and A Big Beach","We had time to kill during layover at LAX for a day and took an Uber to Venice Beach to see what all the fuss was about. Our trip began with our first stop at Tocaya Organica restaurant which we have reviewed separately. From this location we turned west toward the salty air breezes from the Ocean.Entering the boardwalk area the craziness begins with tattoo shops, vendors, and more. We stopped at the skateboard park for look at what was going on. The skill level of the individuals was not overly great during our visit but it was and interesting show. Next was the beach which was quite large. Grains of sand trickle their way into you shoes or sandals immediately while life guard stand reminding one of Baywatch stand in the distance. A nice beach but not overtly warm on this date and the water cold as usual.Next Muscle beach where an open gym exists with individuals lifting weights and looking like they have popped a few too any steroids. People watch on the boardwalk become the main event and street vendors sell and perform along the walkway.Overall this is a one time visit and one some could avoid but the main beach area is large and nice. There is lots of people watching but I can see that getting old so the main attraction here is probably the large beach which is heavily patrolled by police.Tip: Don't miss out on visiting the Canals nearby",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SomedayTrips
40,Lovely walk,It's always nice to go for a walk along the beach and if you go at the weekends you see really muscly men exercising. ( however this does put off the normal gym bunny who doesn't compare in stature ha ha),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anne255120
50,Weird and wonderful,Venice beach is definitely a place you should witness whilst in LA! There's every conceivable type of human being here doing weird and wonderful things. The shops which litter the boardwalk are full of strange items and the whole place smells like cannabis! there's loads of stalls selling crazy tat and colourful entertainers mingling with the tourists. Amazing place for a stroll in the Cali Sun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philparry1
50,Ecclectic,"This is the best place if you love to people watch, shop, sunbathe, check out great food and much more. There is something for everyone. Work out at muscle beach, get a tattoo and go to the local bars. It's all within the beaches boardwalk. I recommend Hinanos bar on the very edge of Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/319carrieg
50,Nice beach,"Nice beach in Los Angeles. Lot of restaurants and shops, there are also skate park, muscle beach, murals etc to see. Rent a bike and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
40,Fun beach to check out,The characters on the beach and boardwalk are always worth checking out and can give you many hours of fun and laughter. The beach was fairly clean when I was there last time too.Parking can be expensive and or a hassle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DynamicFly
20,Huge let down,"Homeless people harassed us constantly, people kept trying to give us their mix tape and the toilets were nothing short of what you'd find in Dharavi. It was cool to see a film set and the actual beach seemed perfectly pleasant, but the constant harassing was a pain and spoilt it for us. Walk a bit further along and go to Santa Monica instead! Much nicer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/701harriete
50,Beach walks and characters,Walking along here is an experience to be enjoyed. You see some interesting things and people but there is no other place like it. Well worth the drive out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28becd
50,Wide and relaxed,"From Pacific Ave. many artworks on the wall build up the mood as you go. As you ask the price of one bedroom rent, you'll notice it is a special place and why Snap has their office here.You may cycle or rollerblade, as you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsuyoshim834
40,Definitely a California Character,"For those visiting the LA area, Venice Beach is a must! It has a personality and charm that cannot be matched. The boardwalk is filled with performers and artists, and there are many unique shops. The Venice Canals were also a beautiful site!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganp500
40,Skate Park Watching,We walked the Boardwalk but my favourite part of Venice Beach was watching skaters at the skate park. We stayed for ages just watching people do all sorts of tricks. There were some young skaters too and seeing the older skaters give them room and encouragement was lovely. Great way for us to round out our trip to LA before flying home,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmflynn
20,Not what I was expecting,"Not really my cup of tea. I must be getting old but I don't enjoy seeing lots of people getting stoned in the streets. The place is filthy and full of homeless people. It's not that I have a problem with homeless people, it's just so sad to see so many people living like this....so not really a place I enjoyed. The beach itself was nice and it was great to see the kids skate boarding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taskette007
40,"So, Whatever happened to the chain saw juggler?","The original chainsaw juggler retired, so I am told, in 1994 after eleven years performing what may arguably be Venice beach's most amazing act. His name was Robert Gruenberg and apparently his road to retirement began when, during an appearance on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, he let it slip he pulled in six hundred a weekend ---cash--- performing on Venice beach. The following year his tax returns were audited and the rest as they say is history... He was last sighted selling real estate in southern California and playing professional poker in Las Vegas.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbchea
30,Walk the Broadwalk,This has changed a lot over the years but still worth the visit. Good street food. We visited during the day which was colourful and vibrant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicnoodles69
20,Not really a tourist attraction...,"Just a lot of tourist trinkets, t'shirts and burgers/hot dogs. I didn't think it was very clean. Was there to meet up w/family members. We headed over to Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KuriousKat2
50,So beautiful beach!,I highly recomend visiting Venince beach. Very beutiful and close to Santa Monica beach so that you can visit both places at once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gunn1988
40,"Beautiful beach, excellent people watch","We spent a few hours at Venice beach whilst touring LA. The beach is beautiful and yes it is an excellent people watch. It is filled with such a mixture of people and activity. It is worth visiting just to experience the place. I would say be warned that it is full of youngsters, free and easy and it could be intimidating if you were expecting just a normal beach visit. We stayed for around 2 hrs which was enough for us just to experience the place. I don't feel it is somewhere I would need to return having seen it once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEQ17
30,Nothing special lol,"Sand was nice, beach was clean. Had a couple bars nearby. One of which we had a terrible as well as first time experience of racism where the bartender refused to serve us. We moved along to the second and more happening bar/party and got some drinks and had some fun. The beach didn't wow us because we're from the Caribbean but I guess for locals it was ok.Also a beautiful view of the Santa Monica pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RossinaR
30,Very Crowded in Spring and Summer!,Venice is a whole is not part of California. It is more an Idea. So if you want to see the real crazy of California. Then by all means go there. As this is the dirty & tired place just like Hollywood or as the natives say Holly weird. As it may be hard to believe but most of Los Angeles is one vast tract of suburbs and fairly normal folks.But enough of that. Just be prepared for horrible traffic and parking on the weekends. Also just because you are at the beach. DO NOT LOSE YOUR STREET SMARTS! That and bring money as the place is very expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
10,"Horrible, drug infested area...",Usually so crowded with local thugs that it makes you very uncomfortable!Maybe early morning/afternoon but generally. ..STAY AWAY!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyl511
50,Great tourist stop,"Venice never dissappoints with its variety of interesting people, boardwalk and shops. On a nice day you see acrobats, people selling CDs, bikinis, people blessing pets. It's odd but fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/497MikeM497
40,Venice outting!,"Venice Beach the Mecca for fine art,individual talent,bodybuilding, street talent. Many movies and talent can be found here. ..for example Michel Collier was discovered on Venice renouned comedian. Some fine eateries to choose from. No need to tell you about the gorgeous women who just swarms the beach. Jogging,cycling, skating,Rollerblade, camping, and much more....I have been to many beaches but none like Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothybJ2148KT
40,Fun people watching,"If you are new to LA, this is a stalwart. Lots of fun people watching, muscle beach,descent pizza by the slice and cheap and cheerful vendors. Of course it is on the beachso roller skating or biking is a must! Many dogs and interesting humans. Beach culture at its best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulajeand
50,Favorite!!,"We spent our honeymoon in the L.A. area and visited a lot of beaches. Venice was by FAR our favorite. The culture, the activities, the people, all of it. Venice is by far the coolest spot on the coast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thechelle218
40,Day trip,You can get here by train so don't do a tour like we did because you don't get enough time to explore or have a swim let alone eat. It's very busy and there are lots of market shops to buy souvenirs. The skate boarders are cool to watch as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GloriaM558
10,Over rated and watch your wallet,"Unless you go to get weed, there really is no point in visiting Venice Beach The last few friends I took who insisted that they wanted to go, all wanted to leave almost immediately. Not to mention parking or pickpockets.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaA539
40,Venice Beach,The beach itself is nice. Lots of activity along the walking and biking paths. The smell of marijuana is everywhere and there are a lot of homeless people. If you're looking for something a little more family friendly I would recommend Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmaier1969
10,Sad,"Heartbreaking to see so many homeless people! We walked along at around 8-9am for breakfast and saw countless amounts of people sleeping rough on the beach, living out of shopping trolleys. The beach and boardwalk are filthy, and tired looking. The majority of shops are tourist traps of t-shirt and magnets. An overall deprived area that needs help, would not feel safe here at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809faithb
30,Lovely to see,Always heard about Venice Beach and it was on the list of places to see! It was OK but the area was a little dirty and full of homeless. It was much nicer walking the 20 minutes down the beach to Santa Monica!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreapS7870BM
50,Never a dull moment...,"You will most certainly be entertained by the plethora of ""performers"" on the scene. Sand, Sea and Sightseeing. what more can you ask for right! Take your own bike or rent one for an hour or a day and bike your way clear thru Santa Monica to Malibu and enjoy the scenic California Beach route. totally Awesomeness",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32irisa
40,"Shops, Weights and Freaks, Oh my!",This is such a unique place! Lots of interesting shops and beautiful views. Be sure to check out the skate park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidd98321
50,Must see,"A trip down to Venice Beach is a must do while in California. Great vendors on the boardwalk, great little shops, wonderful entertainment, beautiful beach. Great place to spend a beautiful sunny California day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conanton
50,Stunning scenery,"We cycled to Venice beach from Santa Monica using hired bicycles. We had great expectations as so many people had recommended Venice Beach, and we weren't disappointed. It is so diverse, and everything is just so interesting to look at, could have spent all day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295lob
10,Free Pot!,"Just walk and you smell the air!The place is full of it! Groups of people on the beach and the wind 💨 it hits ya!Heaps of tattooing shops and t-shirt shopsA once u walked it not a place I would like to visits again, a lot different looking than the adds on TV., and it wasn't very busy with tourist only people that live there on the beach or nearby.Enjoyed the walk a very hot day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288lisar
30,Missed bus stop,We got on a Blue Bus to go to Third Street Promenade but missed our stop so stayed on to Venice Beach. As soon as we got off the bus all you could smell was Cannabis and see eccentric ( cranks & weirdos ) people. It was a hot weekend and was packed there are plenty of stalls/shops selling cold drinks etc but it's not a European pavement ( Boardwalk) cafe culture.If you like noisy crowded beach front culture it's good if you don't like that culture go to Third Street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chalkiewhite58
40,Great beach and shops.,Well maintained beach area and paved board walk. Lots of people on bikes and walking dogs. Great for walking and people watching. Good restaurants and bars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rxplus
30,Good for shopping bad for beaches,"If you're wanting a fun trip down the Venice strip, I HIGHLY recommend it. There are so many amazing shops and sidewalk performers and artists! It is a MUST SEE/MUST DO in LA. Locals like me know this, however I want to warn you of the beaches. It's not safe. There is glass, and needles from drugs as this area has a high populous of homeless. In the day time Venice is generally safe. The shops on the strip start to close around 6pm. Have fun and be safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greatful_Expressions
50,How can you miss this?,Oh come on! You can't come to LA and not stop by Venice Beach. So relieved when we got there and confirmed it wasn't the cesspool that some other reviewers had written that it was. Had a lot of fun sitting at an outdoor cafe just people watching and taking it all in. Stopped on the beach for some pics of the palm trees and surf then afterwards walked all the way to Santa Monica pier (be prepared it is a bit of a walk but doable even in the flip flops that we had on). Wonderful day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mycousinbrynnie
30,Beautiful beach but ruff,"I liked Venice beach, but to be honest i did not fell safe. It was not for the fact that you could get Marijuana legally but for the fact that i did not find the people friendly at all, comparing for example with santa monica beach.You will have beautiful views and if you like to work out this is the spot.The pier is disgusting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaov184
30,Don't visit on a hot sunny weekend,Incredibly busy difficult to find anywhere to park so essentially did a drive by. Clearly a hot weekend day is not the time to visit. Clearly very popular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975helenb
40,Beach is beautiful but the pier is awful!,"We walked to the pier. It wasn't like other piers we have seen, there was no place to sit and it was dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpicSpirit11
40,Nice beach with great sunset views,Great sunset views worth seeing. Crowded beach as it's very touristy but a must do when visiting California. Parking is not easy to find so look off the beaten path a few blocks away if you do not want to pay to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipAz
40,Wanna See Something Different,"It is a boardwalk that is very different. On the weekends there are a variety of different people set up selling many different kinds of wares. Incense, spray can art, woven art, sea shell art, etc. There are shops and weekend shops also. Everything from toys to clothing. Some good buys and others I shy away from. Many souvenir shops. Plenty of places to eat or snack.I have brought my grandchildren here with never a problem. Many people have strollers and kids with them. I have noticed that a few people bring their dogs but always on a leash.There are many different kinds of people entertaining bystanders, for tips.This is an older part of LA. But, even though you will see homeless and weirdo people, I have never had a problem and LAPD is there on bicycle and horseback patrol.You can rent a bike or roller skates as there is a special blacktop path for these riders/skaters.The public bathrooms are dirty so bring disinfectant just in case.On the north end there is Muscle Beach where there are contests or you can just watch men and women working out and showing off their muscles.If lucky and early you may find street parking but there is a city parking lot for an all day fee.Do not miss the Venice Canal nearby (walking) distance. Very beautiful with many ducks, when I was there.We normally drive a bit north to Santa Monica Pier ( that would be a separate review) and eat at Bubba Gumps prior to returning home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sacmabSimiValley
40,Fantastic ambience,We walked from Santa Monica and just walked the boardwalk. It is very much set up for tourists but even so with lots of bars and shops it is well worth a visit. We thoroughly enjoyed it and if we had stayed longer would have definitely returned.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7835JCbenp
30,Goid beach but dirty did not feel like taking family,This is a very crowded beach. It was hard to find parking. There is a public parking just pay $5 but it is on your own risk. All kinds of people so you may not feel safe. Don't forget to see professional skateboarder skating. You will catch nice view of sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalvayh
50,Stunning,"A must visit, interesting to recognise many locations used in film sets over the years, a very pleasant walk not crowded, lovely houses pleasant views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paramechanic
10,Dirty rundown area,I cycled along the beach using the cycle path.. unfortunately even though it said not for pedestrians they took no notice.. the path was slippery in fact a cyclist fell off in front of me.. there are people smoking cannabis everywhere.. the smell is horrendous.. homeless people begging all the time.. definitely not an area I would feel safe in after dark ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khadijah24
50,Best in LA,"Venice Beach was the high point of my stay in LA! Fantastic mixture of people, just enjoying/celebrating the day. Great facilities for sports, skating, biking, surfing, basketball etc. The best set to socialise and meet people. You can find very nice places to eat with delicious food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tzenko
50,People watching!,Fun to walk up and down the boardwalk and look at the people. Lots and lots of shops and food stalls.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitownsam
20,Don't go alone!,I walked down from Santa Monica which is lovely and as soon as I hit Venice Beach the smell of pot and the great unwashed hit me. I was alone and I am not really bothered by much but I didnt feel comfortable. The stores are all cheap and tired. Muscle beach is tiny. The beach is lovely. I wouldnt go on the boardwalk again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jojowils71
40,Bike around,"Well known from movies and shows, but in the end, it's just another beach. Lots of vendors and shops. Nice beach, public restrooms available. Seperate bike path. Nice for a visit or to have lunch. You can also park right next to the beach, I think 6 or 8$ unlimited and you're right there in between the boardwalk and the beach. If you're only going for an hour or so, try to find streetparking, it's about 2$ an hour, but max an hour (the one I found anyway).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalithaMM
50,Great place to visit!,"Visited Venice Beach a number of times. Great to walk along the canals, but especially fun to walk along the walkway along the beach. See muscle beach area and diffferent folks (some weird) along the way. Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lincoln117
40,crazy place,"THIS PLACE IS CRAZI. There is so much to see in Venice. Crazy people who are dancing, singing or whatever on the streets, so many people on skateboards, roller-skates or bikes. The beach is very clean and surprising calm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niareisen
50,A must day out,"Had a great day people watching, 2nd time there when over from Scotland, would go again for sure. Great fun, and I felt very safe, loved watching all the scateboarding and plenty places to stop for eats and of course beer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleymcvay

40,"A Nice Walk, Kind of Chilly","We walked along Venice Beach, since we have heard so much about it. It was OK, kind of chilly, with a few knick knack kind of stores, souvenir shirts and some low end dining along the way. There was some lousy entertainment along the walk, filthy bathrooms, punks on bikes and skateboards with lots of weed being smoked by many. Not the most classy stroll I've ever been on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobilly
50,Just what I hoped and more!,"We've all heard of Venice beach, and have opinions no doubt! I came with my young son in the daytime and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. On that note, I'll do my self-adhesive others-a favour and not bring him after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonn691
50,So beautiful & countless things to do!,"Just go & enjoy the weather, lounge in the sand or on the grassy hills. Or work out in the outdoor gym, play ball, bike, skate, roller skate, the list goes on. Eat & shop. This place has everything in one of the most beautiful landscapes ever created! My favorite place!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HomeGirlCandace
30,Holiday,An interesting place to visit with lots of street venders and colourful characters. The beach is lovely and it fun to watch the those practicing at the skate park. I would not like to visit late at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/340pennyb
50,Eclectic Shopping and Beach Experience,"I spent Mother's Day in the Venice Beach area with my son. He brought me to this beach because of the eclectic shopping and activities at this beach. It is also a good place to watch people surfing, creating sand art,and to visit the street merchants selling artwork and hand made items. The beach area is much bigger than other beaches in the LA/ and Santa Monica areas. I saw a lot of families with small children enjoying the play areas and skateboard park that they have. Loved the walking/running/biking path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anita767
50,Not the best place in LA,"We were hoping that Venice Beach would be more Baywatch than Benidorm. That may be a little harsh, but there isn't too much to recommend here. It's all just a little bit seedy and downtrodden. Agred it does have what seems like endless golden beaches, but there are also what seem like endless homeless, high, ""hippes"" living on the beach front trying sell palm readings, dodgy art and wierd experiences in return for money for their next high. It's just a long row of tacky tourist shops. We didn't stay long. Sorry Venice, but it's just not for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthew636
40,Plenty of weirdness and I'm fine with that.,"I walked here from Santa Monica and it was a really great walk. I had been told Venice was ""funky"" and it is in every way. There are artists, tacky shops, pot smokers, homeless, skaters, tourists, locals and a lot more. I picked up several pieces of art that I just love and the prices were reasonable and the artists were nice to talk to. Sure I was approached a few times but you can rebuff folks and keep on walking. Next to the Sidewalk Cafe was a great independent bookshop and I seriously could have hung out there a lot longer. My friend found a beautiful art piece at an Egyptian store there. Sure there are tons of junky souvenirs, the occasional whiff of something foul but there were plenty of fun things to do and see. If you are uptight about a little bit of grunge, homelessness or pot, yeah, don't come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paseando
50,Locals were great,Loved hiring a bike and exploring all around the area. All the locals were very lovely and soo cool seeing a mix of people using the skate park especially an 7 year old tearing it up!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenSmith21
50,Crazy fun place to visit,"Venice Beach - the Hollywood of Beaches ( but less homeless and more delightfully wacky than plain crazy).Very proud of Wife's independent decision ( with no pressure from me other than pointing out the Venice Beach pier in the distance) to join me on the epic journey down the boardwalk from Santa Monica to Venice. After several stops to rejuvenate legs and generally have a break from dodging the unintelligent who couldn't tell the difference between a bicycle icon and a pedestrian one, we finally arrived at the sea of colour, stalls, art and entertainment. We checked out some skateboard wizkids, a multicultural game of street basketball and then wandered into some street theatre we were gonna catch a glimpse of but then somehow I sort of became part of the show so we ended up being there for about an hour!Very talented and entertaining bunch of guys with a very positive message about life. Then we tried some delicious concoction called a Mangoneada - crushed ice, mango pieces, some kind of sour syrup and chilli. We sort of got rid of the chilli coated straw - a bit overpowering - and after mixing it was very refreshing.Continued to walk after a medical check of Wife's legs and went to see the canals area - some lovely houses but the canals were a bit short on water.A very entertaining and eye opening experience down at Venice. Very much worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR
40,Must see institution,I first visited 26 years ago and nothing seems to have changed. Same vibe and though facilities much improved they managed to successfully retain the overall original spirit. Great outing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BFO1964
20,A LOT OF BUMS,There was not many art and crafts set up. The were more bums then in the past years.The restaurants were nice considering the area. Its a nice walk along the beach for people watching. Would not go there if you are intimidated by tramps. You have to pay for parking on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546
20,Needs a big face lift,"Now we are Aussie tourists from Queensland so it's hard to beat our beaches. The beaches along this area are all kind of famous from American TV and we had a day to kill before flying out after staying in Santa Monica. Drove down the coast to check out the beaches. What a difference between Santa Monica and here. Venice is old, dirty, homeless scattered around. Shops along the front are so unappealing. Lots of people though. Beach is nothing special and the Pier is old. Not my vibe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skigirlGoldCoast
40,Lovely beach!,The beach itself is lovely and it's great to see muscle beach and the skate park! There is a tacky side to it and people will pester you to buy things from them so be a savvy traveller!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gordejczuk90
10,Not nice,"Hippies, beggars, tramps, dirty. The place is nasty crowded but far too many people living begging on the promenade. Food was expensive for what it is. go 2 miles further up for clean beaches and tramp free no hassle day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7725QBpetes
40,Iconic Venice Beach,"Venice Beach is famous for Muscle Beach, the boardwalk, and people watching. Large crowds here, so I wouldn't choose this spot for a relaxing beach day, but for an eventful one I certainly would. It's nice to check Venice out once, and then every so often. For first time travelers to Southern California, I would highly recommend checking out Venice Beach for some memorable sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewsC7868UF
40,bike trip Venice Beach,rente a bike and do the bike trip between Venice Beach and Santa Marta ....... very cool !! .................................,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benoitloeuil2014
50,One of our favourite places in the world,"Brilliant bohemian atmosphere, not everyone's cup of tea. For us its a place with real life, no pretensions. Warts and all. Republicans and Conservatives keep OUT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5900XOkeithm
30,Just a regular tourist destination,"I didn't have much excitement about this place - it's overcrowded with tourists and all kind of cheap chinese souvenirs. The only worth seeing place here is Freak Show, but I've heard that it was closed in May 2017. The beach itself is nothing special, so if you're looking for a nice quiet place to swim - this one is definitely not for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiag394
40,Muscle beach!!! Hotttttt!,"Great beach! Very flat sand good for strolling about on, muscle beach filled with strong types exercising, lots of interesting things to see and do. Great bike path that winds along the beach!Can get a little crowded when there are events or acts on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1411WQangelos
30,Nice beach but not as expected,"We stayed very close to the Venice Beach and first evening we went out we saw hardly any people or activities. We were quite disappointed but thought we had not maybe walked far enough.next day we came from the other direktion ( from Santa Monica Pier) and this time we saw more people and activities, but still less then expected. Maybe April is not high season yet.From what I had read and pictures I had seen in advance this was a little disappointing - but I still guess it is a nice place to take a walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macscotte
40,Fun for a few hours,"Venice beach is definitely fun for a day. There's plenty to see and enough places to sit down and have lunch or whatever.. But it's not worth all the attention imo. It's nice.. but I would choose the San Diego beaches over this one any day. Don't park just outside the beach though, it SO much more expensive than right at the beach. Total rip off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648cheryln
50,We love this place!,I love the variety of people at Venice Beach! Such a fun people watching experience. We watched some epic skateboarders. This is my third visit and I'd still go back. Probably don't go as a single female though...doesn't feel super safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533katiem
30,First beach ever,Beside a weird guy thinking we were taking pics of his gf it was a nice day and lots to see. Sand shoes a must,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ingine
50,'Must see' on your itinerary,This place is all you're expecting it to be... full of interesting people and a superb beach. Definitely one to tick off!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LolaandBess
30,It was nice to see,I was surprised there wasn't any water to clean off your feet. Not busy and easy to get parking. Very windy and nice to put your feet in the cold pacific ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMBIker
50,Best place to people watch in LA,"We sopped over in LA en route to Vegas. Stayed close by and spent a day walking around Santa Monica and the Venice Beach walkway. On any ordinary day (not necessarily a weekend) you will see sights that will astound you – provided you were not born/bred in LA. People walking dogs with shoes (dogs wear the shoes), dogs in prams, crazies everywhere etc.Take a break at any of the eateries (there are very good ones), and enjoy the sights!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24adamj
40,Venice Beach,"Venice Beach is a great place to spend the day. The shops and restaurants along the beach are more like the boardwalks of Jersey, but the are many great shops and restaurants just a block from the beach. It's a great place to people watch. If you aren't going to spend part of the time on the beach a half day here is all you need. The beach is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredraymond522
30,American freak show,"It's this kind of place you should see, but not the place you'd like to stay for longer period if time. You can walk along the strand and observe all sorts of characters (if you know what i mean). Area looks freaky and funny during the day, but i am not sure if i would like to be there after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420agab
50,The people watching is out of this world here.,"We stopped here on our family road trip down the coast of California. We were a family of six (ages 6 to 60-something) traveling from San Francisco down to Disney. Most of our stops up until this point had included cold but beautiful coastal views that were focused on the natural scenery in the area.This place is where our family experienced the real first bit of craziness while in California. The people watching was so drastically diversified here. You see everything from families enjoying the water and strolling the boardwalk, artists galore, bands, political activists, freak shows, marijuana businesses, college groups, souvenir shops, restaurants, tattoo shops, etc. This was definitely a different experience for our family. Our kids really wanted to do the freak show when we walked in. We did not do it, but they have a nice display outside and we should have just let the boys go and enjoy. The price was decent for an attraction in the area.The day we were here was the first warmish day of our vacation in California, so we were more focused on the beach. This is for sure a bucket list beach to check out. We thought we would be doing a lot of explaining things to our kids after some of the sites, but they were too focused on the beach to really care about a lot else. Most beaches we had been on in the past were in the Caribbean, so we were used to warm, calm waters. This water was cold, but the waves were fun. Our boys had a blast running into the waves and being knocked over again and again. My mom even enjoyed her beach time here and laughed like crazy trying to get up and back to shore after being knocked down.All in all, this is a great choice for a beach stop while in California just to say you've been and enjoy all the weirdness it has to offer. We would recommend it for any group of people, including families with younger children. I would recommend though that you look up reviews and know that there may be some things that are more grown-up focused along here too. If this bothers you, I would probably recommend you find a different beach in the area. There are lots of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shawni_and_Buck
20,It could have been great spot if not all those shady characters sitting there all day,"Beautiful wide beach with great promenade however it is full of homeless people, drug addicts etc. Im shocked that LA authority does not solve the problem as it could have been great spot for families, instead it is big show of strange people and shops with weed and garbage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EwaP83
40,Nice Beach to walk around,"It's a nice beach to walk around, there's a nice place to do sports. Needs more food options on the beach it self. Something I did not like at all is that after being walking on the beach for a while I noticed that I step on some kind of oil and not one but several times. Was hard to wash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neoabaper
10,Boy! this beach is different,"I have never seen so many different types of people. Families enjoying there time together body builder, skate boarding, people dancing with someone or by their selves and skating. The beach is clean large and beautiful. Just seeing the Mountains and the ocean together was awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nascarcar88
50,Intresting and different,Spent three days in LA and centered at Venice beach. Enjoyed the location and the vibrancy around us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimGreyfoxHouse
50,Anniversary,"My wife n I get tattoos every anniversary from different artists and locations. So we decided to go on a stroll on the Venice boardwalk one Sunday afternoon. We love going down there for the weather, the beach, awesome stores all along the walk, we always stop in this bar on the board walk (I forget the name) but it's the one with the big red awning. Anyways we order two pitchers of margarita and just people watch. Which is the funniest thing, really interesting characters down there. Harmless but interesting. It is definitely a scene to check out if your from out of town or even a local needing a place to go. Thnx for the read. Peace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221daniely

30,Vacation,"The pier is beautiful. The more you go down Venice, the more 'grown up' it became for our younger ones. But the pier was beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindmarie
50,The vibe is high and the sight is artistry~,"Venice Beach is the home of some of the most amazing artists and creatives. The boardwalk has an old school hippie feel complete with skatepark and layers of graffiti art. The Freak Show and the boardwalk performers are all there to light up the walk as you find great pieces of Art, Earth and Visuals that are unique to the Venice experience. The beach has breathtaking views of the Cali coastline and the waves are always ripe for surfing. Venice Beach is a place everyone will love for some reason or another- or all of them. There are all types of eateries and sweet spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polishedblack
40,Great place for people watching.,"The Venice beach boardwalk is an colorful mix of street performers, local businesses and people watching. Best time to go is any sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4butchc
50,Greatest people watching in the world.,There are a lot of vagrants but those aside this place is great for some good old people watching. A lot of bars and restaurants on the main strip with seating outside that basically gives you a front row view of everything our world has to offer. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lampsneedlove
40,On your bike !!,"Whatever your age, the best way to get around is by bicycle. There are plenty of places with 'rentals' .The beach car park at Rose Lane is only $6 for the day !!Plenty of cafes, bars, and restaurants to choose from, often with good street musicians nearby !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gravity-Graham
40,A pleasant stoll by the sea with artists along the way,We welked from Santa Monica to Venice Beacht. It was a pleasant stroll with a beautiful view.

30,Interesting people,"After going to Santa Monica Pier, I would definitely say this is a more eclectic area. There were marijuana shops, more homeless people, and just a generally different vibe. We had rented bikes in Santa Monica and rode down here. It was a beautiful bike ride along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813kristam
30,Worth visiting,"It wasn't what we expected, it was dirty and full of homeless people. Side walk cafe is the place to eat while you're there. Overall it was worth seeing just to say you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneaBk

Almost no tourists in April (everyone was at Coachella). Too cold to swim and windy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisedeSuisse
20,Dont Hate me....I am the only person in the world who cant stand Venice Beach,Honesty is the best policy...look ...you dont have to trash me...my family will do it for you...they are classy people and they all love it...I remember what it was like in the 70's when the druggies were fighting the healthnuts for space....I heard about how it was like in the 40's...with canals replicating the real Venice in Italy (which by the way is my favorite city in all the world !)they took out the canals...or at least the travel thru the canals as it was meant to be....and packed in the people...on the beach and on land...its like a depressed coney island now to me....a freak show and often home for aging stars going to a sit-in for nude beach rites....yikes...put your suits back on plez loland there is always a crowd and little parking ...ok alright already...enough....get it....I dont dig it...but live and let live...to each his own....just not me ok ha !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnak959

20,"Disappointed - dirty, old, not maintained",20 years back I was there too and I had it different in mind. What I found in 2017 was just ugly and a Venice Beach that is not welcoming and feel you comfortable. I am not repeating what all the others said. However it is true and disappointing. Why let the state this wonderful beach come down?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristianAmmann

40,A Short stay at Venice Beach Los Angeles,"Rented a small house near the beach, reasonably priced abt. 200 Dollars/day.Enjoyed the fantastic restaurants in the area. A little expensive considering US Prices in general, But California !I am very happy to send a 15 days in this area, nice walking between narrov streets with very pitoresque houses from 60ties even earlier, flowers everywhere.No one is in hectic stress, silent and slow moving atmosphere gave all of us a peacefull and enjoyable two weeks. History is no big deal but lots of nature, organic foods everywhere. Recomend everyone with small kids or grand kids. I have never been a place where the faces are happier. Smiling is a must, Enjoy happy peoples land. cakata",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cakata

40,Interesting bike ride.,"Our family of 4 rented bikes and rode all the way to Santa Monica Pier (about 5 miles or so). Very interesting! Lots of skateboarders an bikers. Saw unbeleivable amounts of homeless people. Some in little ""camps"" with 10-20 people in tents. Literally over 1,000. Sad to see and made you feel how lucky you are. Not one bothered anyone that I saw. Kept to themselves and went through garbage cans for food and cans ro sell. Great views along the ride.

50,Nice walk with weird people but a beautiful view.,"Would recommend going here both in sunset but maybe also during the day. It's a beautiful view, some fun but touristy shops and a bunch of weird people. Rent a bike or just walk by the beach. Maybe watch the people at the outdoor gym. It's a must to go down to Venice beach while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeckaJohansson
30,Bored walk ? certainly not !,"Despite the rantings about homeless people, panhandlers, 'grass' scent in the air, it s recommended for 1st time overseas travellers to LA to get a whiff of LA culture shock (skid row is another!)Lots of eye openers including wall arts and legalised medicinal pot shops, sand mermaid. lots of tacky souvenir shops tooThe pumping iron arena ($10 for a workout) is a mecca for diehard Arnold fans !There is no recognisable fast food outlet option , if you are hungry and don't fancy the few eateries along the stretch !We walked all the way to Santa Monica which took 1/2 hour.

40,Venice Beach is Now Silicon Beach,"Venice Beach is not as notorious as it once was, having lived in an apt. right on the boardwalk, but has lost nothing in terms of notoriety. Why they call it a boardwalk I don't know. It's asphalt. With the influx of Silicon Valley companies and upwardly mobile employees, Venice has morphed from trendy hippie enclave to trendy yuppyville, now referred to as Silicon Beach by real estate professionals. One thing hasn't changed ... the ever present fumes of marijuana and the homeless population. Still, it is perfectly safe to take the family for a stroll and take in the zoo of humanity, street vendors and boardwalk sideshow acts. Thankfully the chainsaw juggler has been banned. There's a new zip line up by the skateboard bowls. The restaurant most attended is the Sidewalk Cafe for it's ""zoo view"" just off Windward street. A more upscale restaurant is Larry's on Windward, co-owned by High, the rooftop lounge at Hotel Erwin (just south of Windward). High is the place to go for sunsets and Hollywood sophistication at the beach. Cocktails are expensive but you're paying for the view, DJ and ambiance. Indeed, Venice Beach is growing up. Parking still sucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
30,The Weird and the Interesting,"I would confirm that this destination is worth a visit at least once. Many movies and TV shows have been filmed here. But, I would also warn that there is a lot of crime, homeless people and tourists. Be very careful with your valuables. I would not go there after dark.There are a lot of street performers and tourist oriented shops for souvenirs. There are some good places to sit on the patio and watch the parade go by.Just be careful out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gumshoe2000

40,Awesome atmosphere,"Went on a tour- this was the last stop after visiting down town LA, Hollywood and Santa Monica pier. A boho atmosphere with lots of shops on the beach front. I loved the painted murals which visually enhances this city. A completely different feel from the pier which is only 5 minutes drive away.If you are visiting LA I recommend a tour. No traffic to navigate - the motorways are hectic, and you get to see so much. Just know what sort of time you need to explore. Our tour was great for us as we got 30 mins here, an hour there, but that may not be enough time for everybody.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260raewynr
30,Freaky and Bizarre,"I thought I had seen it all, but I guess not. Be prepared for the bizarre at the broadwalk. So many weird people! Please don't take this as an offense, I guess I grew old already, but this place is something. Lots of smoking you-know-what so not happy I brought my daughter here ...

We were really disappointed when we got to the main stretch though. One side of the road was full of shops selling tacky gifts and weed and the other side was lined with homeless people. We went to see the canals and they were a different world - quiet, calm, serene etc. so it was definitely worth the walk but the promenade wasn't great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4719TRjillm
50,Fancy beach,"Venice Beach is a really nice place, i call it the beauty of nature... very clean. It has this fancy look because of the fancy houses around the place. You must visit this land mark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fadhel_Ali
40,Good place to wonder around,"Good place to wonder around. Interesting people and unfortunately lot's of homeless people. Good spot for view drinks, cycling/running etc. Didn't try food anywhere but there was options for that too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iippa23
30,A little dated but still iconic,"Like a lot of attractions in LA Venice beach is a little dated but such an icon you have to visit.The shops along the boardwalk all seem to sell the same hoodies and t shirts and they were not particularly inspirational!The restrooms leave a lot to be desired but they are in constant use so it's not difficult to see why.Park on one of the back streets to avoid the inflated parking costs, we parked on Westminster.Go there just to say you've been!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppermint
20,Dirty and a lot of homeless people,We did the walk to Venice beach from Santa Monica and we were happy to turn around and walk back. There were a lot of homeless people begging and people with mental health issues. It stunk of weed with no police in sight.We are glad we saw it but wouldn't return or recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowcat1990
50,Ice place to visit,We rent d bikes and got to see alot. However they. Lose at 5h so make sure to rent early. So much to see and do.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAYASYD
50,Vibrant!!,This is one place that makes you feel alive. The energy and the vibe just keeps a smile on your face. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286luckyl
30,Venice Beach,"Some things are not good for kids. I liked watching the guys at the skate park. The sand is awesome at this beach. The pot ""Dr."" are everywhere so be aware before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/APowell125
40,Excellent day out.,We walked from Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach pier opposite whalers. A fair effort. Really enjoyable. Ducked down for a swim. Said no to all free cds and offers of weed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
50,"Entertaining, fun and full of life","Stayed right on Venice beach with perfect sunsets, people watching, entertainment, shopping, great food, grab dinner at the Sidewalk cafe- Tuesday nites $5 all you can eat tacos in the bar, ( not for kids unfortunately) or grab a fish or shrimp taco along the boardwalk, hire a bike and take the kids for a cruise up to the pier , hold a snake, check out some hot bods at muscle beach, swim or sun bake, spot a dolphin, meet fantastic friendly people, be entertained by the buskers and comedic entertainment groups plus loads more, you name it and I'm sure it can be done, seen and experienced in this wonderful place! Visit now, live life and make the most of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovetravelling1327
50,Another place,"This is a must see.....the beach surf, hippie, skate, stoner scene. This one strip has it all. It's a place like no other and it's one of my favourite spots to visit. With artworks every and local skaters a lot of time can be lost when down here. Also only a 30 min walk from the famous santa monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2762RUchrisc
50,Amazing experience,What a view and energy around that place mixing surf and skateboarders. Wish I could though back to there!Legend place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcell2017
50,Visited on my 1st day in US!!,"I love Venice Beach. My husband took me here on my first day in the U.S. Yep, L.A. is my port of entry. So one way to see the U.S. is to spend your first days in sightseeing and being a tourist first. It had its own charms compared to Huntington. I couldn't pick between them. We both have visited them on the same day. The traffic in L.A. makes you stay a lot inside the car. So be sure to plan ahead and choose the best ones to see first if you have a small schedule. Will visit here again.... ❤️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonstarsandsea
20,Too many people,"Ok, the beach is nice. It's a sandy beach in the sun! However, walking along Venice beach there were way too many people and way too many ""unusual and unique"" people. Some of them made us a little uncomfortable. Maybe that's your thing, not ours. There are a lot of tattoo parlors and people smoking all kinds of stuff and blowing it in your face, not all that pleasant. Psychic shops and pot shops, again not our thing. It was neat to see the skateboarding and the body building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmlphoenix
30,"Interesting, but kind of sleazy","We rode bikes and roller blades from Santa Monica to Venice Beach to see what it was like. The beach, bike paths, volleyball courts, etc are great. But the place is permeated by the smell of pot, as it seems to be tolerated everywhere here. The food is overpriced and not particularly good. There are lots of small shops selling strange t shirts and stuff. The public bathrooms are awful. There are better beaches to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDM12345
50,BEYOND another Beach Spot...,"Go beyond the beach experience at Venice Beach. An eclectic grouping of the shops, restaurants and people watching. Parking is reasonable at a huge lot off Venice Blvd (go straight as if you're driving into the ocean). Get back on a bicycle and peddle your heart out. Get some of the new bikes at RIDE VENICE and ask them for their new electric bikes or hand controlled electric skateboard for the more adventurous - FUN and VERY reasonable. Get a sausage at Jodi Maroni's close to the parking lot. Watch people, get a suntan, but MOST of ALL, have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HT909
40,Eclectic but also sad,"All human life is present and it is worth a couple of hours walking to see all the shops (including those selling hash), people and sports sections. The skate board park is good to watch for a while. Lots of temporary stands and also a lot of life's more unfortunate people. Park on the bottom of Rose Avenue for the most convenient and reasonable access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
20,Just ok,Venice beach is kind of disappointing it is just a board walk with a few street performers. And some shops for your enjoyment. There are really no good restaurants on the beach so good luck finding food. The actual beach its self is ok but nothing special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentp116
50,Great people watching!,"This is our second visit to Venice and its a fun place to people watch. The guys working out at Muscle Beach, posing for pictures with the tourists or watching a filming taking place on the beach. Lots of touristy shops to get t-shirts, souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4_Travlin_Fools
30,Sketchy!,Beautiful beach but way too many people and sketchy characters for me to want to go back. Especially with all the other beach options available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jadedii
40,Venice Beach,"My son and I spent 4 days at Venice Beach. We stayed at Venice Breeze Suites - excellent - read review there - with an ocean front room thus had our own personal window to peer at the people strolling by and over the sand and ocean. Many reviewers say yuck but I found the area to be quite clean relatively. Yes, there are homeless people but they are very tidy bundling up their belongings during the day. Yes pot aroma is here and there but didn't bother us. Walked around after dark with no worries. Police stroll up and down keeping things level. We heard the trash collectors every morning and littering was minimum compared to NYC or other cities. One nice thing is there are public restrooms everywhere (though I never used them) so people are not using the streets (other cities particularly NYC smell like urine ). Lots of street performers. Carry lots of 1 dollar bills. Do support them if you enjoy their music/art etc. Some are very talented and make the ambiance. I do not give cash to homeless people because I don't trust it is not going to be spent on drugs/alcohol so I bought dog treats and food to donate to all the dog companions of homeless people - just my way of pitching in - they do not have much of a choice in the matter but look content so I wanted to help them out. Walking is easy or you can rent bikes. There are separate pathways for each. We walked up to Santa Monica and loved seeing all the different activities the beach has to offer such as the skate park, surfing, volleyball, basketball, racketball, flex bands and so much more. Great sporty outdoor lifestyle. We walked out to the pier, along the canals, up and down the boardwalk. Tons of fun yummy places to eat. Great coffee and tea at Groundworks. Grab a drink then head over to skatepark to observe the daredevils or check out the ever changing art wall next door. The beach itself is HUGE. The water was chilly in April even for us New Englanders . All in all , I would go back and visit again. I think staying for a few days helped to really get to know it vs just visiting the boardwalk for a couple of hours. TRAVEL TIP: We did not rent a car for our week long stay in LA but used Lyft instead. Avoided parking costs and headaches . Saved us a lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tobydog67
40,Photo shoot,"Did my photo shoot here, got some great shots! The weather was perfect, it was Thursday so it was not to crowded. Only down fall is the beach has black tar on the sand and it got all over my foot, it was a nightmares to scrub off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730janayw
50,Got it all !,"This is a must if you are in LA - aside the beach there is the pier and plenty of people, shops and street vendors . Check out Jim Morrisons artwork at Speedway & 19th. Head to a very cool food /coffe strip at Abbott Kinney and if in Venice at breakfast/brunch time you must get a Fairfax at Eggslut I did not have to queue like you do at Grand Central though I was there on a Tues at 11am",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMANBRAD
40,See and be seen...,"We only went to this beach out of curiosity, we had heard stories of this being ""muscle beach"" and that title does stand for this place. It's a good beach and clean. I went with baggy clothes as I knew my holiday ""pouch"" was visible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintlysinner
50,Nice place,nice place. To walk or surf the times i have visited california i always go through marina del rey and venice beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariozepeda
50,Great Place,"First time in Venice Beach, well my two adult children was so happy taking them to this place. We have a quality by riding bikes from one end to another. Very safe place and the stores next the beach is great to many things to pick from restaurant and cloths shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eric681988
50,Never a dull moment,Visited Venice beach on the Saturday before Easter. The weather was fine so the crowd was to be expected. From the dancing skaters to the skateboard show there's never a dull moment. You could sit on the beach and watch the waves or take a walk down the boardwalk that stretches for miles. I even stumbled upon a wedding ceremony beside the boardwalk. This beach is ideal for people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eve212015
50,Different but exciting culuture,"Coming from an open minded 27 year old, I loved it here. Very different cultures on display. However it is probably not the place to bring young children as there's tons of homeless people and very strong second hand marijuana everywhere. But very vibey and enjoyable and lots to see. It's a good 2-3 hr activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolves0991
50,Don't Miss It....,"If you want to a clean and tidy theme park go to Disneyland. Venice beach is not that. it can be dirty and druggy but It's a slice of real life. Although it's a total tourist trap it's Chaotic and exciting with a wonderful beach and we LOVED it. Visited with our 4 kids aged 14,13, 7 & 7. Of course you are going to see things which might be uncomfortable, whether that's explaining the weed culture to your teenagers or the homeless to your younger kids but I wouldn't have missed it. Hire bikes and cycle to Santa Monica and back too to play on the beach playground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justine7058
50,Get stoned and Walk around,We are 420 friendly guys just decided to see Venice Beach. Awesome place. Very colorful. People are coming from different places to enjoy the view and the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hafeez_poldz
30,Just a tourist visiting place,"If you want the same type of shops that sell souvenirs, t shirts etc for a mile and the walkway is full of other tourists and ""homeless"" people, then this is the place for you. Even muscle beach is not on the beach but a concrete fenced area.The best thing about Venice beach is the walk to Santa monica pier. This takes about 40 minutes and is quite enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canddsyd
40,Enjoyed riding bikes,"We rented two bikes (one was more like a small scooter) and went around the beach. Kids loved it, and I walked around on my own alone, which was also pretty nice. Good cafes and restaurants around, and several (free) parking spaces too, if you are early, even on weekends.After travelling for many days,I get to appreciate the importance of PARKING in big cities..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yujino880
20,The Iconic Venice Beach,"Wow what a disappointment, we arrived to the boardwalk toA side street that was like something out of Boyz in the hood. Shops were market like with same tshirts and dresses all along the walk way.The area seems not like is depicted in the movies that have the beach in it. Homeless people were every where with there bikes,dogs and belongings dotted all along the walkway.The toilet faculties are disgusting and unhygienic.... again this area is Iconic to California so why is it so run down? I visited the same location 14years prior and it has only gotten worse. I would not recommend visiting with children unless you want to explain about the smell of Marijuana and the homeless people to your young children .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigfellaindustrygear
50,So Many Things to Look At!,"We walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach, and it wasn't hard to work out when we'd arrived – with an abundance of painted buildings and colourful characters, Venice Beach is an eye-opener! Everybody seemed to be having a great time – from the Venice Beach Freakshow people and the stall holders selling original artworks, to the basketball players and the purveyors of 'medicinal marijuana' – and the vibe is infectious. Eat an ice-cream while you watch the Muscle Beach men in action, watch the enormous seagulls fighting for tidbits, then wander to the nearby Venice Canals for a peaceful sojourn. This is a must-visit place for anyone coming to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
20,Hardly worth the trip,"Not sure what I expected to see but it certainly wasn't a the cannabis infested, filthy, foggy dump with crappy shops selling garbage that I found there.The beach itself looked like it would be ok on a clear day and the skate park was interesting to watch for 5 mins but the mess everywhere, fighting drug addicts and tons of dope smokers just made it an uncomfortable place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom_skyguy
40,Nice,Nice beach. Beatiful views. It's a little dirty and there's lots of homeless. Great place for people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WIBadger10
50,Venice Beach bliss,"Biking, tennis playing, suntanning, people watching, walking, drinking, eating - you have it all there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uniqum
50,Don't miss the canals,"I had been to Venice Beach boardwalk a few times before but had never realized that Venice has beautiful homes locatedOn picturesque canals. Reminiscent of Venice Italy!The skate park and muscle beach are must sees. The place is crowded with entertainers, crappy souvenir shops and typical boardwalk food. It's a California scene and a fun place to stroll and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heleneab
50,Busy Busy Busy,"I came here for the first time a few months ago and I recommend it for the younger crowd, not so much senior citizens. There's all different kinds of people, stores and restaurants to try here. It's a great place to come to be active with an outdoor gym (you have to pay for it), skate park, basketball courts, handball, tennis courts and a few other things I believe. There's street art, music playing and lots of dogs. I wouldn't make a day of it, perhaps come by for a few hours to walk around and see the beautiful views of the ocean and watch people play ball and skate board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vavoom808
40,Beautiful broad beach with shallow approach to water,"Broad beach with lots of sand to spread your towels on. Gentle slope towards the water is good for small children. The skateboard area is fun to watch, but the bathrooms are kinda gross. Expect to see people smoking marijuana.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/259maggiep
50,Beautiful,"We loved this beach! It was free to enjoy and had lots of shopping,skateboard park, basketball, tennis and so much more! There's lots of places to park for a fee...we paid $10 for 3 hours, as we walked the beach we found parking in the heart of the beach for $6 for all day. There are plenty of different restaurants with many different types of food to choose from that were little expensive though...the street performers are amazing, and the art work is great!! Definitely worth checking out 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindy2810
50,Relaxing,Stayed within stones throw of beach. Went and relaxed and napped every day after wandering around. Plenty of room to stretch out and enjoy some quiet time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5412MTlauram
30,"OK Beach and ""Boardwalk""","Living on the east coast our definition of ""Boardwalk"" is a bit different. Though the beach was nice and we say lots of activity (skateboarders and surfers - didn't see the muscle flexers), the ""Boardwalk"" was rather dissapointing only shoppes, little food and zero amusement activities. One shoppe I was interested in, I was rebuffed by the strong aroma of marijuana eminating from within. If you're into that sort of thing, there are a lot of tatoo places there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricko293
20,Overrated,"It was OK as beaches go but all the hype surrounding it is definitely not worth paying attention to. In my view it is a tourist trap. Also, beware of the broken glass bottles along the beach. Not as clean as it could be...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33franzf
40,Active,The boardwalk is quite entertaining with all the touristy shops. The beach is clean. Sand is soft. Muscle beach has changed over the years. It's a whole area for sports now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desifoto
50,Fun & Free!,"A bit tawdry and grimy. Street vendors and artists. Fun buskers, always a show somewhere to watch. Great beach. Everyone always has a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kahan4
30,Nice beach,Nice but this is a very crowded beach since it's very popular. I found the evening time the best to visit the place. Take a walk on pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581serifc
40,A boardwalk like no other,"I've visited VB six times now, and I intend to keep returning when I can. There is a certain energy that comes from many different places; an international parade of expectant visitors, a diverse community of street artists, the ticky-tacky commercialism of a tourist beach, a history of local amenities like Muscle Beach and the Skate Park, and a culture of tolerance and acceptance. If the Boardwalk is the cultural soul of VB, then Abbot-Kinney is the new growth engine that will sustain it for the next generation. Outsiders from New York and Tokyo have glommed onto local juice bars and skate shops to form a vibrant commercial corridor from Brooks Ave to Venice Blvd. Residential possibilities abound, from cardboard shacks on the beach to balconied multi-million dollar garaged castles in the sand, to humble bungalows west of Lincoln Blvd, to reconfigured victorians along Pacific Avenue. Along a single block you can often find a huge range of prices and conditions.Dare to dive in. Be sure to allow enough time to get completely immersed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151petere
40,Venice Boardwalk,"Venice is a lovely town with great shops and restaurants. The best part of Venice is the weekend boardwalk with all the wears for sale, entertainers and food. It's a great place to go solo as a family or on a date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3763ETlisam
50,Dont miss it is fun,"Every one should visit Venice beach at least one time,it is a different world,lots of street artist and music and food with good beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianbC1862PR
20,Ain't what it used to be!,"I used to live right off Venice Beach and left because the disparity between the nouveau riche and the poverty stricken often drug addled homeless became too depressing,. It still is. Venice is the place to go if you want a quickie prescription to buy weed -- but it's seedy and depressing. There's nothing romantic about the tragedy of so many homeless people surviving just blocks from where the young male techies have taken over with their huge salaries. Skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
50,Good start for beginners,"My first time visiting Venice beach was beautiful experience, the waves look amazing there. I really wanted to try surfing so I found Fun Surf LA. Stephen is an excellent instructor, he made it easy to learn, I had an awesome time on the water! I wasn't expecting to stand up during my first lesson but I actually did. Thanks Stephen and I hope we'll play on the waves again anytime soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilyagakt
10,A total tourist trap and full of nut jobs ......,It's Venice Beach - a place where anyone can go and they all do!It's pretty much a tourist trap and hustle joint for the fine folks who live on the fringes of society .... if you don't want to work for a living and like bud and party's go for it ......Again for people watching and the free freak shows that only LA can offer you'll have a front row seat for the freak show ..... they're are a ton of better beaches around with less weirdos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davecason
50,fun in the sun,"Had a very good time here. Very family friendly with shops, eatery's, and not to mention the whole reason for being there, The Beach!!!! Did not want to leave! Beautiful sunsets with ships in the background makes for the best romantic dates ever!! Will definitely be returning very soon. KC Royal 4 Ever",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkie8878
40,great views,tons of shops and restaurants nearby. convenient walkway right on the sand. Fun to walk around and watch people and surfers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kasey265
30,Not like on the TV,"Just like everything in life...it ain't like it is on tv. We spent the afternoon here and compared it to Skegness, Blackpool and Weymouth. A beach promenade is the same in most countries. There was no muscle at Muscle Beach. There are the usual shops selling stuff you don't need. A great bar but with slightly inflated prices. $8 + tax for an Erdinginer! Beach was clean and windy which was nice. April is a quiet time I guess and enjoyable. Overall a nice afternoon but nothing to hype about and certainly not as expected but pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2398CLsarahh
40,Beautiful Beach,We choose a windy day to visit and it was a little chilly. Bring a sweater. Beach was beautiful and people were going out in scuba suits. The surrounding area of homes were interesting as there were many different style homes. There was one that resemble the condo on the beach in the Movie Sleeping with the Enemy. I was surprised by the homeless that live on the beach and have actually built little structures to live in. The restaurants were eclectic and met every taste. There were also a couple of souvenir shops there. It was an enjoyable time. Wanted to see Muscle Beach but as it was chilly didn't want to walk there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yjbonner
30,"Crowded, dirty.","Wow, a ton of people, no parking. Wanted to spend some time walking around but our friends ended up dropping us and circling in the car as there was no where to park. Street performers were cool. Guys smoking pot by my kid were not. Public bathrooms were horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdgipsy
50,Strange and rare,"Hard, if not impossible to duplicate this experience.The lab of bizarre behavior. You will thoroughly enjoy and never forget the people watching at this unique place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reiserhof
30,Venice Beach walk,Walked from Venice beach to Santa Monica Pier. Enjoyed the local skating talent at the bowl. Multiple stalls and souvenir shops. Boardwalk was lined with homeless people which was pretty disheartening to see. No one bothered us for anything. Check out the Freakshow (if your not fulfilled with the boardwalk freaks) Few hidden hipster cafes around Venice beach. Nice easy walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyG958
50,Dont get the negative reviews,"You should know this is not Beverly Hills and and the stores are not Rodeo Dr or 5th Ave. It can be campy, dumpy and touristy but its So Cal in a nutshell. Having a son who lives in LA we get out there from time to time and never get tired of walking, riding a bike or just hangin and people watching. Then can walk up a couple blocks and get trendy shopping and foo-foo eating on Abbott-Kinney",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sccrref
50,Fantastic people watching and views,Venice beach is truly one of a kind. It's beautiful but also has some amazing people watching. Locals are on the streets doing tricks hoping you'll tip them for their talent. Muscle beach and a roller rink are also there as well as lots of local restaurants lining the boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happel
50,fun beach,always end up bring in guest from out of town. crime and homeless is way up. do not go at night time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urbanleola
40,Home of the original muscle beach!,Great beach area for walking around with tons of shops and restaurants and a beautiful wide-open beach for playing in the sun. Lots to see and do---look for the weight lifters at Muscle Beach. Lots of places to bargain for souvenir t-shirts and bags.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKop
20,Ewwwwwww,My wife wanted to see muscle beach. We were able to park at the city's parking lot along the beach for $9. The walk is a dirty walk though. Lots of homeless and people strung out on dope everywhere. Not a place I would go at night. We don't smoke marijuana but its it's everywhere there including marijuana medical shops there. I felt like I needed a decon shower after leaving there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisnhso
30,"Quirky , cool and a little sick and twisted.","I found what I thought California was about , cool, laid back and bring out your inner freak on Venice beach but alas despite the fact I loved it here I also got ripped off at every available opportunity. Really cool place but also quite upsetting..... humans are a vile breed , check out the pic ........a$100,000 car on the left , a $100 with a guy living in it on the right ...... sums it up",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williec2016

40,Just like TV,Spend an afternoon at the beach and you wont be disappointed. Theres always so much going on. We went on a beautiful day so the sun was out and so were all the locals. The muscle gym is good for look. Try and get some parking for less than $10. if you look hard enough you can find it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SebbieVetson
40,Go for the poeple watching,"Fun place with some interesting people. It would be hard to stay the night at one of the hotels or home rentals here, because every block has at least one person with an amp and and microphone ""entertaining"" the visitors all day. But walking past and looking at the art and other wares for sale was a fun time. Lots of surfers in the water so it must be a good spot. Get off the boardwalk for better food at cheaper prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U805DXlisal

30,Iconic if a bit grungy,Our boys wanted to see muscle beach and this bit met expectations. Beach was nice enough but don't expect Hollywood glamour and clean Californian boardwalks. It's pretty 'raw' and unglamorous. Good to see and experience for an hour. Beware parking lots over charging. $10 seems to be the going rate in April.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9020XHjamesr

Yes, the famous outdoor gym was there, and it was fun watching people working out, but it was no different to the tackier seaside towns in the U.K. Lots of rip off tourist tat and not much else. Maybe we went on the wrong day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smallcar
50,Great place to hang out,"This is a great place to hang out and watch The locals & tourists, it's a hive of activity, skateboarders, basketball, people working out, street traders & entertainers it's got it all going on. We had a great time, we bought some souvenirs and had lunch, we even bought a joke for a dollar 😀 you've seen it all after a stroll along here, we would recommend a visit 5⭐️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5385DAmichellet
20,"Nice boardwalk and beach, but the homeless take it over","Good relaxing place to walk around the long boardwalk, and the beach is very nice, but the homeless people are all over the place. Just kind of a weird vibe. Shops and food are nice too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_and_Hedge
50,"A unique place, perfect for people-watching!",Remain open-minded and you will love this place; it's a great spot to enjoy the sunshine and watch the passing parade. There's an eclectic mix of people and activities going on (not all of them are pretty!) and it's easy to sit with a slice of pizza or ice cream to take it all in over a couple of hours. Make a day of it and walk to / from Santa Monica. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cab-80
30,"Whacky, quirky, weird, totally Southern California","IF, and that's a BIG IF, you can find a place to park anywhere nearby (isn't it odd that a state so historically bent on all types of automobiles goes so far out of it's way to make them so terribly inconvenient?) this beach is full of crazy, zany, one or many of every type of ""individual"" you can possibly imagine. Watch out for the so-called ""musicians"" offering free CD's of their music only to ADAMANTLY insist that you pay for their free ""gift"". Either refuse to take it in the first place or hand it back to them when they get belligerent about taking your money. Venice Beach is a combination of leftover aging hippies, the neo-anarchists, wannabe artists, vagrants, tripping sychophants, drug dealers and pseudo-legal pot shops. If there ever was a a human melting pot, this is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doughH8241HE
30,People People People,Ok traffic on the weekend is pretty bad. Factor in an extra hour for traffic and finding parking. Beach was great. Weather was great. Water of course a little cold - but it was the first day of April. When walking along the strip just make sure you watch wallet / purse.Great place to people watch.Great sunsets are possible on clear days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZBEN72
30,Did not feel safe,"I felt very uneasy at Venice Beach. There were guys in the beach gym acting very strange. People with ""free"" CDs but ask for a donation of $10.00. You could not walk in front of the shops with out being approached by all sorts of people selling their wares. The Beach itself was pretty, but just a short walk in the sand attracted all sorts of tar to the bottom of my feet. I am not a fan of Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungr8t
50,Unmissable!,"Certainly one of the most famous beaches in California and one of those special shots. Venice is not only the long white sandy beach that stretches for almost mile but it is also everything that surrounds it both good and bad. There is the bike path, the promenade along where you will find plenty of small shops selling everything, to the many homeless who flock to this part so characteristic of this city, the skatepark and surfers in search of the best waves and the Muscle beach (the open-air gym) that includes home bodybuilders along with the nearby Gold's Gym. Venice Beach is all of this, like it or not, but it must be visited to understand its traits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
40,Most popular beach in LA,"This is a magnet for all kinds of people. You see people biking, playing basketball, lifting weights. It's a fun spot with all kinds of characters walking around. Not sure how good the water is since it was march but the beach is nice for a walk. There are also a lot of store selling (mostly) junk and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
40,Nice place to spend time!,"I had a visit on 1st Apr here. This is a good beach with lot of local attractions and events going on.. like painting, kids play area, cycling etc., good shopping option also available. I would suggest this place for evening like around 5pm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srinipamzn
50,Iconic California,"Venice Beach is a must visit for a glimpse into California culture. The board walk is great for a long stroll, the beach is immense and the people are mixture of 'anything goes'. Stop by the skate park and watch the kids perform some amazing tricks. Soak in the sun, and the youthful vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chawt
40,Fun but could be nicer,"The bathrooms were kind of gross and many were unusable due to damage. Also, there were quite a few homeless people hanging around, which isn't a huge problem, but a few were under the influence and and acting strange because of that, which made my kids feel uncomfortable. There were also groups of people partying and drinking around the bathrooms(it was early afternoon, so that seemed strange to me). We had fun, but didn't stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1vy
40,Enjoyed the visit however was disappointed that the freak show was not open,"Was very excited about coming here I have watched the freak show on TV many times and was very excited to see it at Venice Beach . however when we got there it was not open was just extremely disappointing however we did still have a lot of fun, there's lots of shops and vendors along the beach we really enjoyed the skatepark it was fun to watch and would have enjoyed the Muscle Beach as well however we could not find it and gave up too soon. finding out it was just a smidge further as we had walked from Santa Monica . have we planned a bit better we could have turned of great day into an excellent day but that's on us",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelpage82
30,Better by Bike,"Biking along the ocean from Santa Monica to Venice was a beautiful ride. I hadn't been to Venice Beach in several years and was shocked with how much it had changed -- not for the best. The promenade was filled with homeless people, the smell of marijuana, and off-color shops. This was not an ideal family outing with an eight year old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149paulaa
40,Best viewed from a bike,"Was cool to finally see Venice Beach in living colour, but what I heard was true; a lot of homeless people, and really dirty. We hired a bike and walked around afterwards but I much preferred being on the bike and kinda just taking it all in that way especially with a little kid. We stopped at the skatepark which he thought was pretty cool, and the playground, but we didn't actually venture onto the beach. It's probably one of the least appealing white sandy beaches I've seen anywhere around the world.So yeah, granted it has a cool vibe to take in (e.g. heavy marijuana down drafts and Bob Marley on repeat), but probably best just rolling past it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/587hannahk
40,Interesting Beach,"We visited on a Sunday so it was quite busy. We did not stay long on the beach, but enjoyed the ocean view. There were many bikers along the walkway. The starving artists along the strip were interesting and the smell of weed was strong. It was our first time visiting so we wanted to experience it, but would not return. Parking can be hard to find. We were lucky enough to find parking on the road and used the parking meters. Not expensive at all!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kzonn
40,La La Land on Steroids,"Venice BeachSomeone once told me, “Venice Beach is to California what California is to the rest of the US”. I agree. As a native Californian and having been to the beach a few times I must say I enjoyed each foray into the zany strip of beachfront.One year I took my ten-year-old daughter. In our first few steps on the cement path we encountered a black man with a guitar and as we approached he looked at us and somehow made up a melodious rap song. That was out introduction to Venice beach. It is indeed a real and beautiful beach but with a long and well-kept bicycle path open to skaters but pedestrians beware.The real attraction lies off the sand inland on the approx 100 yard zone full of offbeat characters, musicians, tattoo artists (henna), jugglers, massage stands, fortune tellers, singers, you name it. On the landward side also are costume jewelry stands, sunglasses galore, hats, and restaurants; corn dogs, fish and chips, etc. I don’t know if it is still there but in the midst of this zoo was an orthodox Jewish Temple.As you continue on down (south) you will pass the famed muscle beach area. Yes, skateboarders galore up and down the strip. I have not been in a couple of years but I never felt afraid. Best to arrive early nine or ten as parking is iffy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayo1234
50,Best beach in Los Angeles,You can enjoy the beach and you can also visit mini Venice in LA. So this is a 2-in-1 entertainment.Santa Monica is good but this one will be less crowded and more fun 😀.I have included some photos of Venice replica near the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virag81
50,When in Venice go to the Beach,"A perfect place whether you're in LA the first time or live here.If it's your first time: bring water and if you plan to stay longer food. There is the Rose Cafe a few blocks from the beach, otherwise not a lot of options.But you get tshirts, skate boards, sun glasses, Buddha statues, pot, a lot of art directly from artists and if you're Jewish (or not) check out the Shul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/548florianb
40,Very windy sandstorm day,"Interesting area, can use walkway from Santa Monica pier to get here or the big blue bus line. Lots of starving artists selling merchandise on the strip of beach, unfortunately the freakshow was closed during the week days, only open on the weekends. There is a really good spot to get pizza slice and drink for 3.99 and soft serve ice cream for 2.50 right on the beachfront, was really good. Was a really windy day on our visit so was like a sand storm, water is quite a distance from the beachfront walking area, would suggest you walk with a bunch of people for safety reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickeymousemobile
50,Rented bikes on Venice beach BEST THING EVER,"At one point, as I meandered down the bike path on the beach, I looked over at the ocean through the palm trees on my left and crazy Venice beach on my right with all of its sights, sounds and scents....and thought, ""wow, I love my life.""Rent a bike for $12-15 for a couple hours and follow the path from Venice pier to Santa Monica pier. This is hands down my favorite thing to do, or show people visiting. It is an easy stroll on a bike (or skates I suppose). I'm not super athletic, by any means, and I find it quite easy.There are so many interesting things to see along the way. Stop off and into a store, or grab a bite. Santa Monica pier is neat as it is the official end to famous Route 66.Music, live performances, muscle beach, drum circles, etc.Makes a great date, or time with friends and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamazurek
30,Great Place to People Watch,"We went to Venice Beach just because we had heard about it and figured we needed to see it. I was surprised at all of the marijuana and accessory shops, but, I'm from the midwest and marijuana isn't legal here yet. There was an abundance of homeless activity and I wouldn't say this was the cleanest place I'd ever visited. All in all, worth a visit to say you've been there, but not somewhere I would visit again. Much better beaches if you want a clean beach. If you are going to people watch, you will definitely get that here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdelgawad

40,Beautiful beach and cultural icon,"I put off checking this cultural icon off for years because I didn't want to deal with Los Angeles traffic. I went on a Sunday and didn't experience any traffic problems. I loved strolling along the beach walk people watching, chatting with people, sampling the food, enjoying the wonderful weather, the music, the art, the dress, the shops and the atmosphere. The @Doors were inspired here for much of their music as were the @Beach Boys and many other artists. Indeed I was inspired to write a song and had a blast doing it. It was a fun enjoyable afternoon. I regret not doing it sooner and plan to return in the future and check out some of the many other special places such as the Sunset Strip, Whiskey A Go Go, Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive and other famous spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbW4973WD

40,"Like a music festival, without the bands.","Venice Beach is an LA staple. Come to walk around, see Harry Perry on his roller blades, check out the break dancers, beach artists who sell pieces that are perfect for souvenirs, and multiple medical marijuana collectives. Make sure to check out the skatepark, and the graffiti walls, and watch the body builders at Muscle Beach. Rent bicycles and ride to Santa Monica, or even south to Hermosa Beach. For a great Italian dinner go to C&O and be sure to get a beer at one of the places along the boardwalk as you watch the sun set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genevrav
50,"Best people-watching spot in LA, bar none","This is a funky, eclectic, wacky way to spend an afternoon in LA, almost any time of year. Every conceivable kind of person is at the boardwalk on the weekend. Plenty of places to eat, drink, just still and chill. Street vendors, rough boys with their posses, old locals walking their dogs, a weight-lifting area (it is Venice Beach), street performers, and of course there's this little thing called the beach right there with you. Keep some hand-wipes on you, take some cash for the street vendors and performers, make an afternoon of it, be gone by night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikkieser

40,"Crazy, but worth a visit","Any visit to LA has to include a trip to Venice beach. It's crowded, it's noisy and it's nuts. If you can avoid getting run down by a skateboarder or people on roller blades you might be accosted by someone from the John Birch Society or the Flat Earth society or anything in-between. If it's a warm day there will be lots of girls trying to see who can wear the smallest Bikini or there will be a bunch of musclebound guys (and a few girls) strutting around in the sand, lifting heavy things. There are some food stands and some are pretty good, but most of them aren't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman

30,Exactly as expected,"Walked the Venice Beach boardwalk where there were many shops, lots of people, the smell of marijuana and several people trying to give you a CD (and then want you to pay for it via a ""tip""). Did not accept any. There was an antique car show there the day we were which was nice to walk through. It was interesting to see the tennis courts, outdoor gym, basketball courts, etc all along the beach. I was glad we went as it is an area many talk about; but touristy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beenatna

50,i love this place,"sure its dingy - but i'll take this over the star-gazing hollywood/beverly LA any day. The beach is amazing - so close to LAX - and street after street of shops on the boardwalk. Skate park is a cool place to watch the locals. Seems like a lot of hawaiian poke shops are popping up - rent some bikes, play paddle ball, etc..Even better - going in March when the water is too cold for the locals, so the beach isnt crowded. This is what LA should be remembered by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenkJ3450IK

More people visit the Venice Boardwalk than visit Disneyland in a year, so you always see interesting characters walking by. The beach is fine, nothing unusual. It's a long walk from the Boardwalk to the water across the sand, but thousands of people do it. Not the place for a secluded beach experience, this is a more communal place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danzigroup

After getting unpacked we headed to the boardwalk and had a great afternoon enjoying the street performers, watching the skateboarders in the skate park, people watching and snacking on some great calamari. We returned early enough to the hotel to enjoy a spectacular sunset from the rooftop lounge, High. After a couple drinks we took the local free open cab, basically an over sized golf cart, down to Abbott Kinney. There we strolled through the unique boutique shops, dinner at Ginatellas and finished the evening with a Tarot card reading.

40,Watch the Freaks at the Show and on the Boardwalk (and bring your own TP?!?),"Venice Beach served as a reminder of how my boyfriend and I were just raised differently :PGeneral Observations: We made the trip because he had always wanted to see the freak show and I think now that I've seen it once, I'm good forever. I'm not one to clutch her pearls at the unusual, I come from ""Keep it Weird"" Austin, but I must say that Venice Beach is one of the few places in all of my travels where I have really felt kind of unsafe.We visited on a Sunday morning and the crowds weren't that bad. There are, of course, a lot of pot shops, a lot of street vendors, and a lot of homeless people. As the better half put it, we were in the ""beach hood"". Like, I said, I roll with all sorts of vibes and can enjoy myself basically anywhere. But the boardwalk was just so dirty and the vibe kinda sketchy. I really would not want to spend much time there. We went to the art wall and the skate park, as well, and nothing was impressive enough to make up for the uneasy feeling. Just wasn't for meThe Freak Show: Very interesting. They simply ask for a five dollar donation upon entry and it gives you access to a sort of mini-museum. A bit of a Ripley knockoff with mutated animals in jars and artistic depictions of world wonders. The space is small and can be quite crowded just before a show, so you might want to get there early. The show, itself, was pretty cool. Many self-proclaimed ""freaks"" came out and talked about their lives and how they embrace who they are (quite uplifting). Acts included a sword swallower, fire eater, electric chair, and a hook through the eye socket. If you get queasy easily, I'd skip it.Public Restroom Nightmare: Oh boy.... So. I made the grave mistake of using one of the many large public restroom facilities. The homeless probably definitely persists there. The facilities are PRETTY gross. And, in my case, there was no TP. I asked the family next to me if there was any and they were also disappointed to find that their TP was totally soaked and sitting in a puddle of water(?) on the nasty floor. Luckily I had some tissues in my purse....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink

20,Busy board walk,We came here since we had some time before our flight. Long paved boardwalk with street preformers looking for tips along with locals selling art and other items. Muscle beach with a outside gym and lots of people all muscle sizes working out. You can rent bikes. Lots of shops selling souvenirs. Be careful if buying they will bait and switch and before you know it you over paid for a tshirt. Nice beach area. People left us alone and didn't bother us at all. If you take a picture be prepared to tip them. Lots of tattoo shops and medical Marijuana shops and the the smell that comes along with Marijuana with incense. Parking at the beach for 6.00 the lots further away try to charge 10.00 so lool at the brach first. would really only go back if someone wanted to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieBandSteveB
20,Dirty and dangerous,This place needs to be demolished and rebuilt. The filth was everywhere and the people hawking their products was a little out of hand especially the people trying to sell their CD'S they were very aggressive. There needs to be a greater police presence here so families can feel safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/967hald
40,If you're a people watcher...,"This is a great place to visit. Plenty of unusual people to watch, from the muscle people in the outdoor gym to the skateboard park, to the buskers and hawkers, it's all fascinating to a people watcher.We finished with a 'ped-cab' (like rickshaw) ride all the way back to Santa Monica Pier, a great day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762craigm
30,Disgusting,"You couldn't go anywhere without being immersed in marijuana. The stench was awful. Hundreds of tourist shops and some food places, I didn't dare eat. It was sooo dirty. Don't bother going to the bathroom, disgusting! There are also tins of drifter and homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandiS718
30,Expectations were too high...overall disappointment,"We took the family to Venice Beach over spring break. After hearing all about it and reading about the history of it...we were pretty excited. Upon arrival, it didn't take us long to figure out that it was worth seeing, but not worth staying. It was dirty, crowded, and everyone knows about the wide variety of people LOL! Food selection was very weak, no stations to rinse off sand...just very minimal. Again...worth seeing, but not worth staying. Manhattan Beach was a much better place to spend the day on the beach for a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLMMMM
30,Very Crowded,"It was too crowded for walking or bicycling. Maybe go just to experience it. An eclectic assortment of tourists, surfers, stoners and sunbathers. Food seemed to be mostly fried or bar/pub. For a real meal go up to Abbot Kinney.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael3288
10,Dirty and over-commercialized - Only go there if its the first time in LA!,"The world famous Venice Beach is quite honestly not a pretty sight, except if you make it away from the boardwalk to the waterfront. The beach is quite ok. But Venice Beach as a whole is dirty, vulgar, filled with cheap goods and tragic figures. It’s a bit of a freak show if you want. It’s full of homeless people, which of course need a place to stay, however… But don’t expect the Hollywood legend about the flashy, fun, glamorous strip. If you are in LA for the first time, go there and check it out by all means. But just don’t expect anything charming or extraordinary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yviroundtheworld
30,"As expected, weird place","The people are eccentric, but there are also a lot of homeless people living on the beach. Apparently it's allowed in Venice, which is why Santa Monica (which doesn't allow it) is a lot nicer. If you have to pass through its not so bad to see but I wouldn't plan on spending too much time on this beach. Mu husband and I just biked through it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233mariak
40,Must see when in LA,Lots of interesting things going on that make it easy to spend the day here. Definitely make sure you pass by Muscle Beach for something you don't see every day! Parking is expensive but can be found close by if you're willing to pay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fuzzybuth
40,Nice Beach and Shops,"This is a nice sandy beach with shops on the way. The shops seem to be a little over priced, but that is to be expected at the beach.There is also an outside gym which includes a weight room, gymnastic equipment, and some courts.This was actually my favorite beach we visited there. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and you can collect sea shells on the shore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefee818
30,Only Good for People Watching,"There are a bunch of shops to browse and street urchins selling their crafts. If you like people-watching this place is for you. If not, there are much better places to go like Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckkeane411
20,Hmmmm....,Not what we expected....lots of shops but when you've been in 1 you realise the rest all sell the same....lovely sandy beach and the view of the ocean is amazing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chellejohnston
50,2nd Hand smoke,I had a law office there in the beach for 6 years. One Sat night I am working and my mind wanders- What has Zorro got to do with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo? If Zorro is a superhero is Batman a superhero? then I realize that marijuana smoke is coming in my window. There are a bunch of dispensaries nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertbX7577KL
50,A Bohemian side of LA,"LA has much to offer and Venice Beach is one can't miss place because of its eclectic atmosphere and people. Take a stroll down the beach walk and be amazed at what your eyes and nose will discover as an awakening to the senses of yet another part of LA which helps one see why it is a melting pot of people and things not quite known to the masses. There is a lot to take in so beware and be open and just enjoy the art, the entertainment, the food, some great and some so so, similar to boardwalk offerings, the shopping, tourist souvenirs to collectable art. It's worth checking out for something to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/premierlsg
30,DON'T DRINK LIQUIDS,"My Husband and I had a great lunch, used the facilities and went off to wander only to find the only public toilets available had no seats, half were without toilet paper and the doors didn't lock!!I'm sorry, but with what Venice rakes in on parking meters alone you'd think they would put some door locks on. A person can't go with the threat of being walked in on-despite having the door guarded by a friend.Clean it up Venice!!I gave it three dots because I found an awesome shirt today!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashmom1
40,Fun day spent on the beach in L.A.'S famous beach,"I am native to the area. It has changed since the 80's big time. It was when the third street promenade was built up. It still has some of its old characteristics, but over the years its become a mecca for tourists with junky gift shops. The old boardwalk performers left years ago to head over to the third street. So sad....Mussel beach is still fun to hang out and watch as well the skateboarders section at Winward. The food is a lot of junk. Eat before coming to her. I miss my old Venice of the 60""s,70's, and 80's:( Miss the drum circles and the prophets and swami's .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5856OOdavidg
50,A unque Los Angeles experience,"This is a great way to spend part of a day or all day, especially on weekends. Boardwalk entertainment, vendors,food, and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17gil
20,Dirty place,Completely overrated location. A bunch of rundown t-shirt shops. The people are freaks at location and doesn't feel comfortable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773careyc
10,Stay at the Santa Monica beach!,We were at Santa Monica pier and beach it was great!! Little shows like magic and guitar etc were awesome! They didn't force you to pay anything either. We decided to rent bikes to go down to Venice beach from Santa Monica. Was fun to bike down and found a wicked skate park and watch them skate board. We locked our bikes here and walked more down the shops and stuff. MISTAKE!! There wasn't really anything interesting there. Only people trying to steal your money and hustle you. HARD! I felt VERY unsafe here and there was no good food down there so if your hungry eat something on the Santa Monica Pier :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814shawnab
40,Big and beautiful beach,Venice Beach is a really big sandy beach with beautiful views. You meet some really lively and colorful people there. Be prepared to spend some time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrosenbergh
30,Hire a bike,We rode here on hire bikes along the bike track by the beach from Santa Monica. It just a beautiful ride! Bike hire is a must. MUST also ask for a lock to lock your bike once in Venice beach as it is a bit of a dodgy place in parts. It is only a 30min easy flat ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189shellc
40,Much bigger beach than expected.,Might be a little tough to find parking in the area but what a beautiful beach. Makes you want to take surfing lessons. The weather wasn't the best when we came here but had a very nice stroll on the pier and beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minischolars
30,Not good on a cold windy day,"Went to check out world famous Venice Beach, huge board walk with numerous shops that all seem to sell the same merchandise a little over priced for sure. Not to many entertainers that day as cold and windy.A real tourist haunt so quiet expensive and not really my cup of tea. Even in summer the water would be to cold for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaile1958
50,Can't Wait to Go Back,"The beach is huge. It would be awesome to hang out on a sunny day and people watch. Lots to do such as surf, boogie board, volleyball, skate, eat and drink.....Great Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daphneb970
30,It was raining so alot of the vendors were closed,"Great view, interesting the few vendors who were open, they were setting up for a tommy hilfiger fashion show on the beach, that was very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6660EIkimd
50,Too brief of a visit,"We hired a bike from Santa Monica Peir and rode down to Venice beach, this was such a nice way to finish the day. The weather was perfect, we found parking easily (just put in Google maps Santa Monica Pier Parking) wish we could have spent a bit longer looking at all the interesting side stalls. Great vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo71ey
20,disappointing,After hearing all about Venice Beach we made our way there. Very disappointed as I felt it was quite dirty along the walking path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/watts54
30,It's LA alright!,"As a long time resident, Venice is somewhere where you take relatives for lunch or brunch. I wouldn't necessarily go there for dinner as the area can be a little sketchy. Breakifast is nice on the boardwalk early in the Morning before it gets too crazy. Parking can be an issue unless you know where you're going. Visit the Canals. Those are nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmZ4014DO
40,Everyone needs to try it!,"What I love about Venice beach is the overall vibe. It's like ice cream here. A flavor for everyone with every walk of life represented here. High enders, thuggish types, gay, straight, you name it. All hanging together and walking around. From watching skateboarders at the beach park to watching street performers it's a great day. I highly recommend The Ale House for great beers, food, and a good view of the beach and all of the goings on. I also recommend packing some extra cash to grab some of the great original art work on display everywhere. Really affordable and destined to make your place look much less like an Ikea store! ;) If you picnic here watch out for the seagulls. They are a bit aggressive. DO NOT FEED THEM. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89dustinf
40,We picked a bad day,We went on a rainy day so there wasn't many people out and I am told that is the main attraction of the area. Without that it was a dirty beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmyr460
50,Fun for the Day,"Gorgeous place to visit. Go to the beach, shop, eat, and/or relax. The only down falls are: parking, homelessness (do not walk or go by yourself), and before the sun goes down you need to leave. To me it is a great place to go, just during the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351allanas
40,Great day at the beach,"Venice is a popular tourist location for good reason. If you want to dip into the ocean or shop this is the place for you. The Pacific is much colder than the Atlantic, but you can easily spend time in the water. The lifeguards make sure the surfers and the bathers are in different areas.Walking up the walk will have you see all types of people and things. You can find tee shirts, sunglasses, bags, and souvenirs as well as street performers. Enjoy the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411gennyd
30,Fun to people watch but couldn't wait to leave!,"We went to Venice ""Muscle"" Beach to see what it was about. We had fun watching the people and there was a kid about 8 years old who was skateboarding in the skate park - he was awesome and we watched him for a long time. Though this is a neat place to see, I wouldn't spend much time here. I would go to Santa Monica Pier and rent bikes to ride down to Venice Beach, see the sights, and then ride back to Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danaw726
50,Nice place to hang out in the morning,"Great place to visit on weekend morning. There are vendors along the edge of the beaches selling stuffs. The place get real busy on summer long weekend. People ride skateboard with swim outfit, boyz and gals all day on the weekend. Food is over price such like any other tourist places",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4197LXjohnc
40,Nice beach,"Lovely beach, pure white sands, no rubbish/waste on the sand which was aesthetically pleasing. Took a nice bike ride along the bike lanes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubblebath89
10,Venice beach - BUM PARADISE !,Dirty. Maybe be better on a sunny summers day but this place should be ashamed. Worst stop on a 4000 mile trip. Should be treated like a national park not a museum for the homeless,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikef854
40,Fun,To walk from pier to pier and take in the fun and interesting people there are some real characters for sure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uli1
50,Great place to people watch!,Many locals and tourists walk the boardwalk at Venice Beach every day. The restaurants and shops are so unique. There is something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/880ritar
10,"The beach itself is ok, but the boardwalk is a dump","My husband enjoys going to Venice beach to gawk at the weirdo's and freaks, but I find it depressing and pathetic. We visited on a cloudy day and the boardwalk was just filled with homeless people and people who obviously like looking weird and being on display. I'm fine with that if it is their choice, but I don't care to go to Venice beach to gawk at them. I don't enjoy seeing people eat out of garbage bins and stumbling around totally stoned. The shops are all the same - bongs and pipes and tee shirts and sub-par souvenirs. Nothing special to see or buy. It didn't feel safe at 2 in the afternoon--wouldn't want to be there at night. It was our third or fourth visit over the past 10 years and it seems to have gone downhill more and more each time. You might enjoy this environment as part of a sociological study of street people, but I would not visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suetravel2015
50,Excellent beach,The best thing is that it has rocks on shore where even kids can enjoy as tides can but do not affect to much but really a site for good view.. shops are approachable.. I can say must place to be there especially if you are a surfer..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harminderbindra
50,Very cool boardwalk,Saw the sunset at venice beach and what a sight! The boardwalk was still bustling with people out and about. Was really laid back and nice to people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lithr2015
50,You have to go,"Take a tour, take your time, and enjoy everything about Venice beach. Go inland and tour the ""venice"" in venice beach on the waterway, or walk around the beach itself for interest stores with interesting people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddD3505IR
30,Wowza,"Had a nice time at Venice beach. First time we brought our kiddo (almost 13). He found it quite amusing. Saw some SERIOUS muscles at muscle beach. Went to the ""Freak Show"". Only $5 per person. Entertaining for that price. Don't go if u get queezy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellebQ1325ZM
50,Quirky and Fun!,"I love quirky and interesting places where the people watching is at its finest... and Venice Beach is among the best for that. It's a little run-down, but it's fun for a stroll up the beach to look at the weird art and street performers. Be sure to check out the skateboarders and the bizarre Freak Show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
30,"Great or horrible, depends","Great for the diversity, the different culture, the weather, the food.Horrible to how dirty it is, for the amount of homeless around. Much drug and weird people...Fun place to go with friends, not so much with family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Italian_Reviewer
50,Amazing!,"One of my favourite places in LA. A great vibe, good restaurants, is great to rent a bike and go all around the beach, until the santa barbara pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolinaM474
50,Hipsters Paradise,"With the coolest bars and coffee shops, cutest canals and beautiful white beach this is one of my favourite places in LA. Super chilled yet so much to see.

40,Nice and Clean Beach,This beach is clean and nice. Lot of surfers we can find. Costal guards are always alert. Pacific ocean beauty can be observed from this place. Be careful with people here who will try to sell you CD's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamOuting
30,Trashiest Beach I've Ever Been To,"While staying in Marina Del Rey recently, my wife and I decided to rent some bikes, ride the bike trail to the Santa Monica Pier and check out Venice Beach along the way. My wife and I always have to put our feet in the water when we're at the ocean and this time we chose what I can only describe as the trashiest beach that we've ever been to. Pieces of trash & plastic washing up on shore with every wave...and I'm not talking about just a plastic fork or knife (which there were plenty of) but big 2'x4' sheets of plastic. I'm not a prude but this was beyond what I could stomach so we left after only a few minutes.The people watching along the boardwalk was obviously interesting and the bike paths provided an enjoyable ride although lined with homeless camps however they did not bother us. Quite the spectacle as anticipated but I won't ever go to this beach again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Legamania
40,Rolling down Venice,"First time in Venice and, although the weather wasn't helping, flocks of people seemed to enjoy the sun, stores, and restaurants. This is a good place to stroll, look around, and practice your roller skating and bike skills. Everything is better next to the ocean. Prepare to spend at least half day there if you really want to take advantage of what this venue has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allia2964
30,It's a Beach with Colourful Characters,"I came, I saw and I can say I've been there. The Beach is average compared to the many amazing ones we have here in Australia. People exercising on aging equipment not at all as I imagined it would be. With that said the characters that visit and some of the vendors are very entertaining. Walked on the beach and put my feet in the water because I could. Be careful on the boardwalk and stick to the sides or risk getting run over by the many bikes cruising the beach. Highlight - walked back to Santa Monica Pier and the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co for late lunch and drink then some great shopping near by at Santa Place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMC1947
30,Great Views from the Pier,"We were here on a cold and windy day, by local standards, but that did not detract from the views, in all directions, from the fishing pier. This is a really classic beach, not as fancy as some others, but very genuine and full of local history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acinonyx60
20,Run down and not safe at times,Lots of homeless people congregate here and the place itself is run down. Wasn't impressed at all with the place and would advise going to santa monica pier and not travelling the Venice beach end.Saw one homeless person strip naked then harass anyone who walked past him. Definitely wouldn't go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesvear35
50,Looks just like it does in the movies.,"Does not disappoint. A run down boardwalk snakes it's way along the beachfront selling the usual trinkets, Ts and treats. The beach is ablaze with families and freaks, lovers lying low and exploding with action. Watch skateboarding taken to a whole other level as the sun goes down on the freak show. Lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/My-name-is-Ann
30,Weed Galore,"Beautiful beach turned into smokers paradise. Everything here is based around smoking weed... it's pretty intense atmosphere ... worth the experience, not somewhere to bring your family and kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonsays3771
40,A California Classic.,"Venice has character. Classy? Eh, in spots it's kind of not. At times it's slightly dirty, slightly chaotic, sometimes full of roudy party goers-- but it has more character than the next 5 towns. From main street, to the board walk to Abbot Kinney, there are so many districts in such a small area, it's certainly worth a day. The Abbot Kinney is a great district full of top notch eateries and shops and occasional festivals and events like ""First Fridays"" keep the area alive and active. The Boardwalk, with its world famous street artists, pot shops, tattoo shops, glass shops and restaurants is really a California Classic. And Main Street, with some great Oyster Bars nearby, and its occasional farmer's markets and other happenings, is also a great way to spend a day. Not always the most family friendly, and definitely no suburbia, Venice is it's own thing, it's own California thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MykeC166
40,'CRAZY PLACE',"This is a happening place. So much to see and do. You can bike, rent bikes, buy lots of stuff, restaurants, music going on, lots and lots of people. A place you really should try to visit at least once. There is parking on the beach (9 dollars a day) which is cheap cause parking is hard to get. I think it is at the end of Rose Street.You can sit on the beach and just spend the day going along the promenade . There are public washrooms which are in need of some cleaning and upgrading but at least they are there if you need them. Glad we went and it should be a must do at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bailey709
40,Best place to people watch ever!,I had a 12 hour layover at LAX airport so I spent the day strolling from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Beach. Venice Beach has an eclectic variety of people from the homeless to the fitness freaks to the rich. Restaurants along the boardwalk provide open air seating with good food and excellent people watching opportunities. It's a place to see that's like no other. Don't miss the Venice Canals Walkway while you're there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imyourtallcool1
50,Stunning!,"Not everyone's cup of tea as there are certainly some alternative characters around Venice Beach but we absolutely loved it. Loved the beautiful beaches, the business of the boardwalk, the busking, the people watching and thrown in a bit of the sweet smell of marijuana from the Weed Doctor! Go experience it for yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JWoody65
40,Action beach,"Venice beach is some 2 mi south from Santa Monica. It has some more action and vibe than it's northern neighbor.The beach itself is similar, long and wide, the difference is in the action going on around it. There're many casual bars, restaurants, shops, tattoo studios, street entertainers, Muscle park with body builders, skate park,....so it's funny to spend few hours.The only downside were many homeless I saw there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1714D
50,Even the rain didn't stop me,"Couldn't control weather, it was raining. First visit, made the best of it. Lots of restaurants to choose from and parking was reasonable. Because of Mother Nature, we are planning another trip to LA to fully absorb the beauty. My son was here last year around same time and he just raved about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7558LDannieb
40,Eye opener,"A definite if you enjoy people watching as there are many sights to see from people dancing around ghetto blasters to muscle beach - which really wasn't all it's made out to be!! It's quite small!! If weather had been warmer would have been happy to spend day there as so much to see, there was a film crew filming with all their food vans and cameras.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gilllomax1
20,Let down,"This beach was a serious let down, dirty out dated and def not worth an entire day out, we stayed there for two hours and then left, boring with loads of homeless people and it was really dirty. Prob worth a skip definitely not worth h the hype everyone made.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dafischer
40,"Intersesting, funky beach","Lots of diversions on this beach. Has the classic Southern California vibe. Lots of beach action including, surfers, skateboarders, bikers, musicians, muscle heads and more.It's a great place to just walk down the boardwalk and check it out.

50,Don't Miss Venice,"Plan on a day in Venice. Go to the beach. See the famous ""Muscle Beach"", rent bikes and ride down to Santa Monica, watch the kids in the skateboard park.Then, go to see the Venise Canals.

It was fun seeing the basketball courts from ""White Men Can't Jump"", Muscle Beach where Arnold Schwarzenegger and others started, and the skate park where skateboarding started, as well as the graffiti area. We also drove around to see the Venice Canals and the Clown Ballerina (the symbol of Venice Beach). It's a fun eclectic area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEE1225

The place has lot of great vibes and is a different experience from the nearby Santa Monica beach.There are also pubs and restaurants along the promenade next to the beach. We loved our visit here and was reminded about the beaches in Goa, India. Parking can be a hassle. We drove around a couple of times, before we were able to find a suitable spot to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shibinbalan
40,Watching the waves crash on the beach is peaceful and relaxing,"We only had a couple of hours to visit Venice beach on Sunday, January 29th. So we skipped muscle beach area and stayed on the beach between the pier and S Venice Blvd. (We walked down from Venice Canals). My son wanted to play in the water and I wanted to enjoy the waves crashing on the beach.Reading Tripadvisor ahead of our trip made me very nervous about going to the beach early morning, but it was wonderful! I guess it was our location on the beach. It was quiet, peaceful, and so beautiful. Few people walking along the beach and morning surfers. We never saw the rest described in other posts. That morning was hot already and I wish we could have stayed longer.If I ever get the chance to come back to L.A., then I’d like to spend most of a day here and walk from Venice to Santa Monica and explore the boardwalk and shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib981

Be sure to visit with an open mind. Venice is the place where anything goes and you will meet people from all walks of life.Street parking is usually always full so you will need to pay for parking in the manned parking lots its usually a one off fee of $10. Venice is a long strip with street vendors, souvenir shops, tattoo shops and market stalls.

40,Always dreamed...,"I've always dreamed of coming here, seen in many movies and TV Shows...First, parking is not to bad, I found Free parking (I had a very small car) but paid paying was only 10 bucks, lots of space!Walked a few blocks to the boardwalk...All kinds of people are there, if you go early enough you get to see people setting up for the day, lots of street performers.Now with that said, many are there to make money, as I walked, I think 10 guys try to give me their CD's, I didn't stop, I politely said no thanks and kept walking...You can spend a lot of money or a little.There are a few ATM, but I had cash already, 10's 20's and lots of singles, just in caseI didn't want anyone seeing me with lots of cash or getting cash,There are some homeless people ( but they are harmless, or were to me)I stayed from Noon to sunsetHad a great time, and took a ton of pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariq819
40,Going for a walk,"This was our first time here. We went with one other couple.The view was beautiful, the ocean clean. The boardwalk itself is very interesting. A lot of different characters. Muscle Beach was okay. The shops pretty much all had the same thing to sell and the smell of marijuana was everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1770HMelenav
40,"""This place is so weird you can find two of everything""","Staying at The Doubletree by Hilton Suites we had the option of taking their free buggy around Santa Monica and decided on a lift to Venice Beach. En route the driver quoted the title of this review adding that you could get anything. see any type of person and we should not be surprised by anything we saw or heard. He was right. From the first hacky sack jugglar to the last henna tattoo booth, from the first homeless person sleeping rough to the most muscular men/women working out at the newly situated muscle beach, from the bizare lizzards on display to the seemingly spaced out fortune teller, and from the numerous T shirt stalls to the ubiquitous Santa Monica/Los Angeles/California/Route 66 baseball cap stalls we saw it all. Very tacky in parts, very sad in others but well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiskers51
40,Fun & interesting place!,Our 2nd time in Venice and it's just as quirky as it's ever been!You really feel like you're in a different world there.

A low cost option for a taste of Southern California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGF001
30,Local atmosphere and odd smells,"This place is worth a visit. Don't expect glamor or greatness. It's local people, artists with everything from trash to worth buying. It's a freindly atmosphere. A mix of homeless, scaters, basketball players, bodybuilders and foodstands. It,s an hour or two of new impressions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tigerfactor

40,A Very Nice Beach,Over the last year I have had to opportunity to go back several times to Venice Beach. It has a lot to offer including a nice swimming/surfing beach. One day last week I saw waves pumping in way over-head at about 8-10 feet with very good form. It was a delight to watch it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MITCHELN

40,Sensory overload!,Venice beach has so much going on. It was good to go and people watch but it did get a bit overwhelming with everything going on. If you're going down be sure to spend some time visiting the canals. Much quieter and very pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/426karya
50,"Must see, even for ""Locals""","Saturday and Sunday are by far the best days to go to Venice Beach since it is exactly what people envision LA in part to be. Visitors would make a glaring omission by not visiting this place because of how many movies, commercials, and references are made concerning Southern California life and culture which this location epitomizes. Although real estate has gone through the roof in the last 10 years it still is a must-see location to visit. It has kept it's eclectic and odd entertaining feel like no other Beach on this planet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willh125
50,The Most Iconic of all So Cal Beaches,"What makes Venice Beach great is that its a throwback in time. You can smell it! A lot has changed in LA, but one thing that hasn't is the feeling of walking up and down the Venice boardwalk and seeing its diverse cast of characters. A must-see for any traveler!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebMirror
30,Nice place,"We spent some time here. It is nice to see, but that is all, if you are into hippy. Walk in the streets when the shops are open, than you feel the scène.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WimvL99
50,Our day at Venice Beach,"We went here on the last day of our trip. We spent hours on the beach. There was tons of shops and restaurants and of course the bodybuilding equipment and basketball courts, etc. This was a really great place to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tzhar482
30,Nice looking beach,Nice looking beach but over run by tramps and dropout living on the seafront. There were hundreds of these people living in makeshift tents and rubbish piled up everywhere. I know these people have got to live somewhere but the amount of rubbish (their living quarters) just lying about was very disgusting. These people are then begging off the tourists during the day. Toilets on the front were very dirty as they are used by the people day and night. Would not like to be here in the hot summer as the smell would be unbearable. Los Angeles in particular is very run down as its ocupided by thousands of these people and the problems are only going to get worse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TreccoTaff

30,Scruffy,Interesting bit of the coast but a bit of a trip back in time. Too scruffy and too many people in desperate circumstances to enjoy the walk. Wouldn't return. If you like the smell of weed you'll get more from it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cricketdad
40,Nice to stroll around and people watch and shop!,You will see people from every corner of the world at Venice Beach. Some of the artist are unbelievable with their craft. There are always some trinkets or novelties to buy. Lots of bars and eateries along the way as well. There are also lots and lots of homeless. It has an awesome skateboard park to watch some of the daring folks. The beach is beautiful. It does seem like you walk a long mile from the edge of the beach to the water's edge. Have fun and enjoy the stroll.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634myrag
40,Fun walk for a sunny day,"Been there on a sunny winter day, and it was fun.Since it wasn't high season for tourists you had many people there but not too much. nice walk along the beach up to the Santa Monica proved to be a nice pass time for 2 hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaistlinMajer
40,Beautiful coast!,Rented a house one street away from the beach. Weather was still a little chilly and rain was in the forecast.We got lucky one morning before the clouds moved in.

40,Crawling with tourists,"Don't expect to actually go to the beach in Venice (much better up the coast past santaMonica...to say, Topanga) but the freak show might be worth the effort to find parking (near impossible on weekends).

40,Much improved,"I begrudgingly ventured on a walk from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach, having been there before and not leaving impressed (2012). However I was pleasntly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed looking at all the little shops and stuff. If you're staying in the Santa Monica area, I imagine it would be quite nice for an early morning stroll, otherwise hire a bike or rollerskates and go explore. Definitely don't need more than two hours, especially if you are not walking there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquel_louise96

40,Better than expected.,"We got to Venice beach quite late in the afternoon but still managed to see a great exhibition of skate boarding by the beach. As expected, there were a number of peculiar people around but that added to the attraction of the place. The body builders and posers were not out in force at this time but this did not take away our excitement at being at such an iconic place. In sense, the place encapsulates a certain flavour of the alternative California that one had rad about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5458EUbrianm
50,Loved This Funky Area.,Some or our best sunset pictures came from this area. Great bike riding and walking up to Santa Monica Pier. Interesting characters reside in the area. We felt safe at all times. Even at home with all the dogs frequenting Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lantana1953
20,Watch your step and your wallet,"Watching the trapeze troupe practice was mesmerizing - truly a unique experience. That being said, the city's celebration of the homeless and drug culture is frightening. Not a safe place for kids or after dark. There are plenty of other CA beach choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BadBlake
40,Great atmosphere,"I enjoyed visiting venice beach just because of how well known it is. Fun walk up seeing the shops, performers, muscle beach, the graffitti, skate park etc. Yes it's very busy and touristy and you will be spoken to about buying or watching something but it was all friendly and safe enough, it all adds to that venice beach vibe it's famous for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliG1620
50,VENICE BEACH ... A ton of fun,"VENICE BEACH is fun to go - if only because there is no other place quite like it! Plan ahead as it can be crowded and you will want to take your time to take in the stores, beach and fun activities (like people watching!) Many different food places makes it a cheap family tourist spot. Bring quarters for parking and come early to get prime spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
30,Go to Santa Monica beach instead,Venice has a bit of a dodgy vibe about it. When walking down the street you can smell the smell of weed. The beach it's self is allright. But if you want to visit the beach head up to Santa Monica. It's just down the road and it's nicer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98sarahc
40,mixed feelings,"The beach itself was VERY clean.The homeless were Plentiful.Our bike rentals were FUN. *we biked from Venice Beach up beyond the Santa Monica pier. Approximately 3 miles each way. The shops were run down and touristy. We'd do it again because the boardwalk was fun to ride on, but don't bother with anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sl282
50,A must visit,Me and my daughter visited Venice Beach and saw the most amazing characters .We watched the performers who put on an amazing hilarious show for free. They go around after with a bag taking donations from tourists after their performance. You can put in any amount of money but they are well worth their performance. Really enjoyed it . The beach itself is full of different characters from skateboarders to amazing views of the beach. Loved it and would go back.People are wonderful and would not miss this if you are visiting California. Plenty of eating places and the people are so friendly. Not to be missed you will get to see the local culture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneduffy
20,"Funky, grungy, not my style","A lot of people have it on their ""must see"" list and maybe once in a lifetime you should even if only to say: the thrill is gone...Lots of homeless people, tattoo parlors, stores full of junk made in China. It has a dirty, smelly, tacky vibe and if that's your thing, go for it. Definitely not a wonderful place to visit with your kids.There are much nicer beaches in Santa Monica right next door and the boardwalk there is clean and pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
50,Unique place you have to feel,"It is absolutely unique place to visit. If you are/was a skateboarder - say no more. If not enjoy the walk, those variety of people and shops. It has some awesome atmosphere and restaurants. I suggest avoiding night walks there though. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skoczmygdzies
40,A must see,"The iconic Venice Beach is a must see and there is a lot to see. There is off course the beautiful Pacific Ocean and the surfers to watch as well as sail boats and barges. The ""boardwalk"" has a separate road called the Strand to ride bikes for miles. There is muscle beach, a skate park, shopping and tons of food. There was also a number of really good musicians playing for money. That was very nice. The negatives: There are also a lot of homeless people selling their crafts, camping and sleeping and asking you to come look at their stuff. My son was asked if we wanted to purchase marijuana on a regular basis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690kime
20,Yuck,"Maybe I'm too old and uncool, but Venice Beach was not my cup of tea. I wanted to see the body builders at Muscle Beach, but was disappointed not to see any of them and instead to see a sea of homeless people, tattoo parlours, tacky souvenir stores, and street vendors. The two fun things I saw were the Hare Krishnas and the awesome skateboarders, although you had to watch them surrounded by a combined stench of stale marijuana smoke and B.O. I had taken an uber there on my own at 4:00 in the afternoon and I was careful to catch one back to my hotel before the sun went down - nothing happened there that should make me feel unsafe, but the landscape just wasn't to my liking. If you like that really laid back vibe, this is your place. I just found it grungy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLT1962
40,Must See,"Lots of interesting characters. Lots of weed shops, unique stores, and art. Venice is definitely for a younger crowd, but it's good for entertainment. Grab a snack, take pictures, and enjoy the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rccampbelljr
30,Must be better in sunshine,Very flat Long sandy beach that would be better in the sunshine .I was expecting more around the beach and I was disappointed we could even find a good place for coffee I would not retirn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4385YZsandrag
40,Funky and fun,"Venice Beach is a thing in itself , A ding on sich as the German say it. It is a testimony to Americans love of the wheel, bicycles and tricycles and unicycles , wheelchairs, baby carriages, rollerskates, skateboards, they will all be part of the mix although theoretically bicycles and roller skaters are supposed to be on the bike path . Lots of luck sometimes . Hippies from the 60s mix with Jesus Saves people. Bodybuilders and purveyors of all sorts of random artwork, shops selling T-shirts and sunglasses mostly stretch for about a mile. Eating is mostly fast food except for the Figtree Café and the Small World bookstore café. Washington Boulevard if you make it diown that far has a bunch of restaurants. The beach is great but most people don't make it as far as the water.It's a great place to go 12 months a year except when it rains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3056KAalicec

30,Really an old hippy experience,"There's a decent walk from the Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and when you finally arrive here the atmosphere changes from one of upscale dwellings to low end hostels, hotels, shops and people generally just camping out along the sidewalk.The shops all seem to have similar low end clothes, towels and head shop gear. Really not worth more than a walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dontSeattle
40,Santa Monica to Venice.,"I walked from Santa Monica pier down to Venice. It was a nice walk and I'm glad that I did it. It was a very nice day so there were lots of people out and about. This isn't always a good thing. I was getting approached left, right and centre by people wanting to read my palm, sell me their music or save kids from various diseases. It got quite annoying. However, I'm glad I visited, I'm glad I saw Venice - this is why I stopped off in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TommySangers
50,Apart from swimming and surfing so much to do on a fabulous beach!,"One of the great days we had on this beach we arrived at 10.30.am and played handball in an outdoor alley,went for a swim, had lunch, hired skates and a tandem,skated or cycled for a half an hour down to Santa Monica, had a look around,cycled back,spent ages watching the skate boarders at the skate pit,watched some of the beach performers and sunbathed,There is so much to do at this beach for all ages.It's very safe.We parked our car in the public car park on the beach -no hassle. We went a few times and enjoyed every visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airmount
40,Best people watching EVER!,"You CAN stroll along the beachfront with the waves, but then you would miss the incredible people watching. Go for the beach, stay for the fun.

10,Don't waste your time,"Don't even bother wasting your time here. Whilst I went during the winter time, and therefore it being too cold to actually go for a swim or onto the actual beach, it was definitely not worth visiting.If you do not like the smell of marijuana, don't bother visiting. Period. The smell overpowers the whole entire area, especially now that marijuana is legal in California, and the smell of urine is also strongly present. There is even a store called 'The Green Doctors' which are 'alternative medical practitioners' when really, they're obviously dealers.Just don't go, or just go down to the beach part, away from all the stores and hopefully, the smell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/156maddied

My friend had never been and I really talked it up. It had REALLY gone downhill. The cool, artsy vibe I remembered had been replaced by ""homeless-town""...Ugh. EVERYONE seemed to be homeless and drunk or high on something and I am not a prude. it was beyond horrible. It was getting dark and my friend was actually getting afraid to be there.

40,Muscles and Dr. Dank,"Home of one of the most affordable beach scenes in So Cal. Eclectic to the max. Muscle Beach is THE place for glistening muscles trying to out lift each other. Right across the boardwalk there are plenty of skaters, boarders and med marijuana clinics. Around the corner there are lots of glass shops at very cheap prices. Don't be afraid to negotiate for the ""bubbler"" you want. A little seedy but lots of LAPD foot/bike patrols through the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardfromHB

There are life guards on duty, clean public bathrooms with toilet paper, a playground for kids, bicycle and roller blades trail, assortment of shops and miles of sand to walk on.On a sunny day, it is a pleasant walk along the beach with mountain view towards the north and a view of planes taking off on the far south.Parking for the day is reasonable at $10 and situated on the first block from the beach. It's convenient!There are restaurants.Caution: The surf gear rental shop does not appear to clean their wet suits thoroughly as one of my family members broke out in a rash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElsaCL
30,Nice,Great view! Interesting that there are also alot of bums.But all in all it's a good experience to just visit an iconic location. I loved where the people where on their boards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeySL8
30,Reminds me of nyc,Walking along the strip of Venice Beach reminded me of walking past all the peddlers on 125th street in NYC. We walked here to see muscle beach only to find out it was closed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCNJGIRLZ
10,"Be afraid, be very afraid","Granted, most California beaches are beautiful but the atmosphere of Venice Beach is pretty scary. We went on a weekday when the freak show was closed but there were plenty of other freaks around. Lots of drugs, homeless people and just sketchy. If you are a woman you do NOT want to go here alone. Had I known how unsafe I would feel I would have passed on this place and the expensive parking. Shops are full of all the same drug paraphernalia and cheap touristy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GPC2
50,A real mix of everything and everybody,I live in Los Angeles and only go to this beach when I have friends in town. It is a totally different vibe so be ready for all things unusual and a bit weird in a good way. Go with a open mind a take a stroll.Great place to people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/losangelesredd
40,Great Place to hang out,We spent the weekend here. Great place to just walk or ride the beach front. Good places to eat and drink. Just be aware this is a very popular place and it tends to be AWAYS crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesUKUSA69
30,Venice beach is good to visit but you need to tolerate homeless people,This place is special: many people try to make some money selling stuff or entertain tourists. Sometimes marihuana smell is so strong over there. Police officers are always present. It is real American environment over there. A lot of entertainment but you need to be careful. Fresh air from the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/323michaeli
50,Muscles everywhere!,Love this place! Eye candy shop! Beautiful people everywhere! You can get lost in time people watching! Lots of street performers and souvenir shops and great fast food! I'm definitely going to revisit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maillady411
30,Got to see,"Visited Venice beach / Muscle beach while in LA - it was on the list of things to do. Glad we went for the experience, the beach front itself is nice with plenty activities taking place but the walk along the beach front road isn't the cleanest of areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleExpresso
40,Proper Los Angeles beach,"This is the beach if you want to experience LA. It has it all, the muscle beach posers, skater kids, surfers, street performers, tennis show-offs, lewd t-shirts, grimy shops, cruiser bikes, tours on Segway, wierd and wacky people, independent coffee shops with unique concoctions, dog walkers galore, a pier, postcard perfect sunsets and of course a lovely sandy beach.It does get busy when it's very warm and it gets eerily quiet when it's dark and cold, so if you're the nervous type you may want to visit here either in the morning or late afternoon.After sunset, visit the canals on the back streets (go up any of the streets in between Washington and say 24th Street). The canals and homes are lit up beautifully and there is no where else like this in LA. It's not like Venice, Italy, but it's not trying to be; it's an honestly cute neighbourhood that takes pride in its modern romantic feel. Strolling through here with a loved one is always very enjoyable.If you want a truly good coffee, I'd recommend The Cows End. It's on Washington, right by the pier. Amazing selection of quality coffee, served in genuine LA friendly style. Superb hang out to grab a drink and some decent wifi in a cool (temperature and style) building.For the best food, head up to Abbot Kinney Blvd, about a 10 minute walk from the beach along Venice Blvd. there's something for everyone here, amazing pizzas, independent delis, quality Asian food and some fine dining. On a Friday evening there is a good selection of street food trucks serving up tasty tacos, curries, burgers, wraps, pizzas, etc. It has a fun atmosphere so it's a great family place. Check out Toms coffee and if you get a chance try their shoes: I went there just to get a coffee and ended up buying the most comfortable loafers ever! They donate a pair of shoes to poverty children for every pair of shoes someone buys. Still on Abbot Kinney, Lemonade is a wonderful place to get a quick bite of delicious quality food.Back to Venice Blvd, if you're eating healthy, visit Erewhon - it's a bit like Whole Foods but much more boutique (and pricey). If you like juices, smoothies, kombuchas, vegan food, natural products, this is the place to spend your cash.From Venice, Santa Monica is very close, an easy bike ride away along the ocean. Marina Del Rey in next to Venice and has the full range of hotel options. This is a good base to have. It's also really close to LAX airport (which believe me is a bonus on your last day here; you'll be stressing about the traffic and catching your flight if you stayed anywhere else).My brother in law lives here and even though it costs a fortune to rent here, I totally get it why he chose here. Venice is THE quintessential LA beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonDanDan
50,Great Promenade Walk,"For about fifty years I've been heading to Venice Beach, if nothing else, merely to walk, see people (local and visitors), get a slice of pizza, breakfast or a sandwich and breath some of the fresh sea air. I've also discovered pickle ball on the paddleball courts and, of course, you can bicycle on the lane that runs beside the walking area. You might even find an unusual piece of art to take home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryk491
40,Interesting People Watching!,"If you are from out of town and want to people watch, the Venice Boardwalk is a great place to go! Take a towel with you and hit the beach, which is wide and fairly clean and usually not too crowded. When you have finished, walk over to Abbott Kinney to window shop and see how the young and hip live in Venice or walk over to see some beautiful homes located on the Venice Canals. There are plenty of restaurants on Abbott Kinney so plan to grab a bite there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyf961
30,Walk around Venice Beach,"Must go in the summer, probably now but quiet!! Alot shops and artists around. Few people teying to seel music Cd's, that is the only think annoying. Muscle beach was empty when I visit, and was one if the points of the beach. You can also easy rent a bike and go to St Monica Pier, specialy in the night is lovelly place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrasilHol
40,Cute,Cute shops and trendy healthy cafe and restaurants on Main Street. Good for evening strolls before dinner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meowmeow6060

40,Nice beach,It's a nice beach and a fun area to walk around. The fish tacos close to the basketball courts were really good!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YVR_Wanderlust
30,Correct,"Not bad in an amazing location. Good oysters and good fish. Tables pretty much closed one each other, so it is not a comfy place. Staff is French like, too altive but good food in great place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joemW8634HZ
40,Great Location for Families,"A colourful location, great dining along Abbott Kinney and plenty to see along the walk between Santa Monica pier and Venice Beach. A great spot for people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebekahJ596
50,A wonderful place to enjoy the beach!,"The Venice Pier is a great place to spend the afternoon. Parking is available adjacent to the pier for $9 (probably more during the summer). Rent a bike, stroll the boardwalk, shop the stores or stop for a beer and lunch. The pier closes at dusk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenAmma1008
20,"Overrated but visit to ""say you have been there""",Venice beach is dirty and doesn't feel that safe (though is safe). I would describe it as the Bali of LA with dirty street stalls and shops like in Bali. We won't go back but are glad to have been there and done that! Not a must see but a place you probably need to see for yourself (just keep your expectations low).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E1108FOamandat

10,Fuggetaboutit!,"30 years ago when I first visited Venice beach, it was a place for poseurs and the mildly strange. Nothing much has changed, only the smell of urine seems stronger and more prevalent.Tourists will always visit, but do yourself a favour and make it quick. Staying there 'fuggetaboutit' why would you do that?Tramps and vagabonds are the least offensive thing about this place. Drive in, stay for a couple of hours, tick the box and go somewhere else, anywhere is 1000 times more pleasant and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marklorr
20,Not really worth a visit.,"We visited during December, it was fairly mild weather, but the water was cold. This beach has a lot of hype, but not really sure why. It's a fairly grotty place with stalls selling everything from food to drugs. There are people handing out free CDs, do not take these. I didn't like this beach, it was dirty. I wouldn't recommend visiting this beach unless you've really exhausted your list of things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125pp
10,not like they show on tv,"not a place i would ever care to return. it was a little chillier day, so there weren't many people - which i think normally is part of the allure - people watching. the beach itself was dirty - lots & lots of trash. there were a few street vendors set up with items to hock - not interested. the shops across the way were mostly ratty looking. no thank you. only stayed long enough to walk down to the water - & i was nervous the whole way, watching my step for fear of used needles. ick.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howietravels
40,Good place to see Santa Monica Pier,"I really enjoy walking from Venice beach to Santa Monica Pier. It takes about 50 minute round trip and it is refreshing walk. It has great view of ocean and Santa Monica Pier. If you park in residential area, two blocks away from beach, the street parking is free. So you may enjoy good 2-3 hours including Venice beach and Santa Monica Pier. Also it is good place to watch sunset and bright Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Never2ver
50,Bohemian beach,"Fun to spend an hour walking around Muscle and Venice Beach. Beach is clean, wide and pretty (much better than when I visited years ago). The business strip alongside isn't tacky, but has a flea market vibe. Great poké! Definitely stroll around the canals. Really pretty and quirky. I'd recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasLev
40,A very cool place,Spectacular beach with that unique salty ocean smell. Nothing like it. The business side of the walk is pretty low end novelties and street food. The restaurant we hit called Larry's was good but mind numbingly expensive. There are also lots of homeless peeps around Ruth some that were screaming rants. Regardless don't miss the opportunity to check out this fine piece of public real estate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrewSandy
40,Rent a bike and see everything from Venice to Santa Monica,"Fabulous people watching. Just a brilliant activity for a sunny day. Rent a bike and meander along the path past muscle beach, skateboard park, volleyball players and many tourists. We rode as far as Will Rogers beach. Less to see that far North but in easier ride with far fewer people on the cycle path. Include a stroll out Santa Monica Pier. On a crowded sunny winter's day the riding was a little tricky with a lot of people not watching out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KookaburraMike
20,not what you think,"Nothing like TV's representation of the beach area, was quite taken back. A lot of scummy people around in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blakeherbert
20,Visit if you want to see odd things,Went to Venice beach to see what the talk was about. I was highly disappointed. It was hard to tell the difference between the starving artist and the homeless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntY3990ES
40,A must see,Even on a Sunday evening the walk was very crowded with all types of people. A lot of stores selling touristy souvenirs. Many Street performers up and down the walkway. Very big and wide beach. Great to watch the surfers in the waves. The best part about Sunday night A large drum circle out in the sand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outdoorpartner
40,Eclectic and fun,"We stayed on our first stop to the States snd then also on our way back to Australia. So much to see and do! Try and hire bicycles to cycle around it is really nice. We did a walking roundtrip from Venice beach to Marina del Ray and on to Santa Monica, almost 12 kms but worth it! There are so many pit stops to be had, shopping, entertainment, a must do and stay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annemariem802
50,Artsy beach,"Cool place to visit! It is very artsy and unique. If you have young children with you, just be aware that there may be people smoking marijuana. I'm glad I visited, but I wouldn't need to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itraveldou

With street performer's dancing and signing and skate boarders in the skate park , wide variaty of stores and places to eat. Was busy day with lots of people here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/776barryr
40,The Best People Watching,Definitely worth seeing at least once but that's enough for me. Very touristy. Filled with tacky souvenir shops. We did grab a bite at the Sidewalk Café. Interesting mix of street performers and homeless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingSoccerLoon
50,Amazing,"This is a great place to have a leisurely walk , has many stalls and shops sell clothes and souvenirs. It has an area they call muscle beach were the guys and girls pump weights in front of everyone. You can spend the whole day relaxing here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l0tusdesigns
40,"Lots to see, fun walk along the boardwalk",Tons of things to see and experience - from killer paddle ball to pro and semi-pro skate boarders to weight lifters. It's a fun walk as long as you keep your sense of adventure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DogWorld
30,Be prepared to stare,"We (family of 4 travellers) were encouraged by family to visit the hippy-style Venice Beach - I'm not sure you'll appreciate 'unique LA experience' until you've had a look around here! There are beachgoers blended with skateboarders, basketball players, musclemen showing off their physical prowess, buskers and a myriad of shack-style businesses selling a range of items and food. This place is BUSY and LOUD - worth a visit but I wouldn't want to stay there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liisa0
40,Interesting,Ive been a lot of places and this was one of the most interesting. all types of people and activates going on. we walked the entire boardwalk. great little shops for souvenirs and lots of arts and craft or home made are for sale. The side walk performers were the best some amazing some kind of creepy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobb784
40,Unique Boardwalk and Great Beach,"Venice Beach has a very unique boardwalk with good restaurants, shop and local artist selling their art on the sidewalk. Sometimes the boardwalk can be very crowed in the summer with tourist. Some of the homeless live there so it's an eclectic mix of people. The beach itself is clean and nice to spend the day sunbathing. The ocean is safe to swim in but always follow lifeguards signs and instructions. You can rent bikes and ride along the beach on the bike path. It's fun for the whole family. The Fig Tree Cafe is one our favorites for breakfast or lunch. There is public parking along the boardwalk and some street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoAdventure
30,Overrated attraction,"We went to Venice Beach with kids and walked along the beach. It is a very touristy place with small cafes and small gift shops selling tacky t-shirts and other small touristy junk. There were homeless people who had set up tarps and made little shelters for themselves along the beach. It was a pretty depressing sight to see. There are a few restaurants along the walkway by the beach, a freak show, and ""medical marijuana clinics."" People go to Venice Beach because it comes up on every travel board, but we much preferred the walk from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach rather than Venice Beach itself. Do go here if it's on your bucket list, but if you are pressed for time, do something else instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pavitralrao
50,Something for everyone in Venice Beach,"You have the famous Muscle beach , the skatepark and the boardwalk , the canals -- but there is something new happening only blocks from the oceanfront - Google just bought lots and lots of office space. With Google came hipster restaurant , wholefoods and all the stuff that comes with affluent hipsters - interesting to see how the Abbot Kinney neighborhood rapidly changes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mberlin2015
30,A must see...beware of tacky,"Venice Beach was a must see because of all the hype about the people watching, muscle beach, the artisans, etc. It is a place of polar opposites...- Look to the ocean...you see well sculpted beach scapes, surfers, biking and sand castles.- Look away from the ocean...you see ""medical"" marijuana dispensaries, crude and gritty t-shirt shops, funnel cakes, greasy shops and sketchy characters hitting you up for their reggae CD'sOn a sunny day it is a nice place to visit for 2 hours. After you go the the beach for 3o minutes, head inland a few blocks and you'll get to some good shops...find Blue Star donuts...amazing and hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenC162

50,Fun place to see but quirky!,I take visitors here usually on the way home from picking them up from the LAX airport. Walking along the path past the shops and restaurants is always interesting. There are all sorts of people you will find from people biking and running to quirky vendors and some bums as well as great shops to buy t-shirts or other touristy type things. You can also walk along the beach. There are great restaurants to grab a bite and people watch. It's always interesting for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelisMe
30,"Cool to see, but a little rough around the edges","Had to check out Venice Beach and it was and interesting experience. Pier was cool with lots of people fishing. Muscle beach and the basketball courts were fun to check out as was the skateboard park. Some nice houses along the board walk but things were a little sketchier near the main strip. Lots of poverty and open drug use on the main part of the boardwalk. At one point I was breathing in marijuana and drug smoke constantly. Seemed like a safe place to walk around during the day, not sure at night. Worth checking out, but probably wouldn't go to again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ironleague
50,Fell in love with it,"Venice Beach is a nice clean beach. You can walk or take a bike to go to Santa Monica.Lots of artists, shops, restaurants, funny people.

Sometimes the play in Venice Beach, Santa Monica or San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dith15
40,Must see just for the experience,"As far as a beach goes, we have far better in Australia by a long way.

40,A good spot!!,We've stayed in Venice Beach a few times. Certainly better in Summer (obviously) but always fun. They're cleaning it up at the moment which is good. It's a great location with lots to look at and good walks to Santa Monica and local shopping and dining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulianB155
50,free,"great site to walk around, the new blue train extention goes all the way out to santa monica and you can walk to the beach from there. lot of people selling their wears on the boardwalk, and lots of pot smoke. not really kid friendly, walk the beach during day time and the boardwalk at night. or rent a bike. go out to the two piers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justins866
50,A real slice of life!,"Unfortunately our stay here was much too short, however I found it to be just an amazing slice of LA life. Just the sort of place to relax, go for a wander around and people watch. Truly unique experience of beach culture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supaberri
30,Iconic LA Beach,"Venice is a place I take every visitor that comes to Los Angeles. It's not easy to get to (unless you are on the west side), but it's worth it for the culture. The ""locals"" prove to be interesting (yes, the people who live on the beach have their own spokesperson and are very organized); but it is also a front row seat to LA's homeless epidemic. You'll see/meet many quirky individuals along the crowded boardwalk. You may even see a scuffle.This is the place to buy art/souvenirs for everyone on your list. Venice is a hippie-dippy place, (Jim Morrison & Co called it ""home"" back in the day) - that is going through some crazy changes due to Silicon Valley moving offices up the road. Parking is difficult; especially on holidays. The pay-lots fill up quickly, as do the neighborhoods. Be prepared to pay upwards of $20 to park in private lots. It's best to visit during the week. Food-wise, Larry's has great pub grub and there are a few cafes on Windward that do not disappoint.Stop by the skatepark and you'll see lots of locals (and pros) shredding. This is the home of Dogtown skateboards after all and it is essential for any skateboarder. You can also see what's left of the infamous ""graffiti pits"". There always seems to be some sort of film shoot going on here, so you might get lucky catch a glimpse at the action. Rent some bikes and ride to Santa Monica and beyond!If you want a little more quiet, I recommend going south of Washington Street. The beach is cleaner and it's also the area where you'll find better restaurants and bars. The Whaler has a great roof deck for daytime drinking craft beers. The people watching is excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockieK

40,Chilling out location,"Had a relaxing time at Venice Beach. There was a lot to see there, and there was a really different mood that was uplifting-skate boarders, weight lifters, ""beach boys/girls,"" etc. It was a very nice change of pace for me-a person of a different generation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButaTokyo
40,Riders on the Storm,Gets sleazier each time i visit. Still great to walk the pier and Boardwalk and view the sometimes spectacular sunsets. This is the famous birthplace of the doors. You can buy every Californian souvenir you'll ever need in the many beach front stores. You can marvel at the weirdly curious buskers and performers before trying to choose where to eat all the foods venice has to offer.

Constant stream of hawkers trying to talk with you about buying their stuff. Homeless people everywhere, rubbish & shopping carts, you name it. Small gangs of punks. Wont be going back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706johny
20,"Scummy, low-life area","If you're dreaming of Muscle Beach, acrobatic entertainers, Arnold, and the golden physical culture, that's history and you won't find it here. You'll be looking for the exits pretty quickly. The area has been taken over by drugs and the homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidDavidDavid
30,Venice Beach visit,Maybe because it was windy...maybe because it was cold...or maybe because it was Christmas eve...but this was not what we expected. Lots of hokey tee shirt shops and a fair amount of fried food - and too many homeless. It was a bit sad and a bit worn down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmom2238
50,Check out the skatepark or drum circle,Depending on what activity you choose to do Venice Beach it has a cornucopia of options from skating to skateboarding even bicycling get to see you is at your own pace go grab yourself a towel get your board shorts on or tell your watch to get the bikini on because this a must-see location and you're truly missing out if you don't make the effort to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyJackson9
30,A bit seedy especially at night,We walked around at night and found that it was a bit seedy. Several young men standing by them selves (?selling drugs?). Probably more suited for backpackers rather than families. Lots of places for hiring bikes and skateboards. And a nice place to work out of you into that type of thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnfromwollongong
40,Nice area for a stroll,Stopped by and had a pleasant walmk along the beach. The area was not busy and there are places to eat and hire bikes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickB_London_UK
50,Oh My How Beautiful,"Even on a cloudy day, this was such a beautiful clean beach. Lots of nice walking with the sound of the ocean in the background. Not many people in water as it was cool that day but it was definitely work seeing. Lovely adventure down Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandlew00d
20,"Interesting atmosphere, but sketchy","We went here on a cold and very windy day, maybe that kept some of the tourists away. There was a mix of tourists, families with young kids, and then the locals. Standard low-end souvenir shops galore. Several with drug paraphernalia, which my kids (older ones 15 and 12) caught onto. We saw someone get arrested though not sure for what. We walked up and down the boardwalk, then my kids said they were getting scared so we left. I didn't necessarily feel unsafe though. No need to come back, but perhaps a more eclectic atmosphere in the summer if more people are skateboarding, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebs0303
40,Back to the sixties,"This beautiful beach at the Pacific Ocean has a great boardwalk for a stroll along all kind of small stores. The sixties never left Venice and you are embraced by hippies and the smell of weed. It is a pity as it distracts from the local artists, beach stores and beautiful painted houses. Slightly disappointed visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert-Jan1972
50,Beautiful sunset and canals,The canal views were picture perfect and very easy to walk. I saw people bicycling along the banks of the canal. We came just two days before Christmas and saw some beautiful Christmas lights. We came at around dusk and were able to catch the sunset. Walking along the Venice pier was very romantic. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoff451
40,Myriad of American Culture,"A contrast to Santa Barbara, but a great wide open beach with a lot to offer everyone. Robot statues on display, iPhone repairs, tourist T Shirts, hats, ice cream and a great day out especially on a good day with the sun out. Great views and a good experience of the LA culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WheelsUp
50,Spectacular scenery,There's something about Venice Beach that just wakes up your soul. I don't know if it's the people the atmosphere of the ocean maybe it's everything... But this place is outstanding! I actually would like to live there :-) no actually I want to move to Malibu LOL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barendinas
40,Very cool place!,"Venice Beach is a very cool place to see! It is unique and exciting, a bit dirty and rundown in some areas but it is a very cool place to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiarnaeg
30,Not sure,We walked Venice Beach while we were in Santa Monica. It's lively and quirky. Enjoyed seeing muscle beach. It's nothing like you see on tv. My biggest problem with the area is the homeless people. Venice Beach was basically a tent city in some areas. I'm not sure why police aren't cracking down on it as you can't walk 2 steps without someone wanting a handout. It's during the off season but still alot of people. It's something I can say we did and mark it off our list. We are not strangers to large cities and homeless people as we have lived in Philadelphia. But it was much more bothersome here than other places we've been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adub359
50,Totally unique and a must see,"Venice Beach is just so unique, it is hard to put it into words. The local culture is fun, exciting, outrageous and alive. Lots of original artists to see and lots of places to eat and drink. Wonderful restaurants right near the ocean. A must-see for all visitors. You can walk between Santa Monica pier and Venice Beach Pier- it's a nice long walk, 3 miles (about an hour)- you can rent bikes, Hoover boards, scooters and skates. The original Muscle Beach is there if you want to work out on the sand or watch people work out. Tennis courts too. It's historic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511annr
50,Beware of Green Docs,"The place will have recreational weed soon but until then, please don't get scammed by the green doctors who claim to sell you certificates. They will charge you at least twice the amount they tell you on the street. I have never fallen for these scams but I know so many people did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SevgiC_13
40,A must see,"A crazy part of town where anything goes. A must see for anyone visiting this part of town. Plenty of shops, stalls, bars and cafes. A very colourful spectacle indeed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willie_corcoran6
30,Always entertaining!,"There's always street performers and if not there's people watching, both entertaining options at Venice Beach. Probably not a family friendly place. Visit the outdoor gym on the boardwalk, stroll down to the water or on the beach. Browse the shops and buy a tee shirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdxballard
50,Nice Place,"Very nice place to visit. Go for a walk, ride bicycle or eat something.Depending on the weather if it's not cold can go into the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTS15
50,Interesting,"One of our favorite stops, FANTASTIC place to people watch. Incredible sunsets, cheap food and drinks. We even got to see a bicycle parade at night, they had lights on them, very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolsX6699ER
50,The famous Venice beach,This a must visit place for any traveler to LA. A walk along the stretch of sandy beach is very nice and relaxing. There are ample street parking available slightly away from the beach. You need to pay $7 for public parking close to the beach. There are shops and restaurants in the close proximity,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824deveshd
40,A LA Must See,Everyone visiting LA has to venture out to Venice Beach although there isn't much to it. But must visit to say you have been. I do HIGHLY recommend Zelda's sandwiches and mini donuts. A must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruinbabe00
40,Nice Beach,We are here in winter so there was not a lot going on at the beach. Which was probably a blessing as the shops are all filled with rubbish. Hot dogs and burger stands are a feature of the boardwalk. The beach itself is a lovely wide clean beach and I am sure in summer it would be terrific. You can hire bikes on the boardwalk and apparently there is a long cycle path. Be careful to stay of the bike path when your walking as you will get abused.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1954Elizabeth
50,Beautiful beach!,"Loved walking along Venice beach and the beach walk was an amazing experience! Be prepared to be hassled walking down the beach walk but just ignore them, if they say it's free it's not it's always for a tip so expect that! But if you ignore them and keep walking you'll have an amazing time! Definitely a place to go if your travelling to Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolekizia
40,nice walk,"enjoyed a nice walk along this beach area, taking in the different cultures on offer!You will see alot of people who love on the streets here, beach area lovely, as my visit was in the winter could not go for a swim!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElenaPablo
20,Go for the beach not the markets,"We walked from the beautiful Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach which we believed to be a must-do based on reviews from here. While the beach itself is lovely I do not recommend taking young children to the main pathway and market area. The area is dirty, smells and has homeless people set up everywhere which is heartbreaking. There was a weird 'freak show' that was being advertised which was particularly disturbing. We couldn't wait to get our young daughter out of there and despite planning to eat along the beachside we decided to not to once we arrived as everything looked really unclean. I would not return nor recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolski
40,Fun walk through venice beach,"I used to love venice beach, its definitely filled with a LOT of local culture but its not as cool as it used to be, maybe because I'm older. The artistic vibe is awesome, local skate park, drum circles, the local long boarders, its for sure a great cali vibe, however its not the cleanest place and can look a little shady, especially when it gets a little late at night, but still worth a visit, you have to go at least once! You should stop by here on the same day that you'd visit santa monica 3rd street and pier etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LianaE_13
50,Eclectic mix of people,"Come down to Venice beach to see the dichotomy of society. You have people living on the beach here from starving artists and surfers to the simply lost and homeless. then you have the hawkers and shops selling all the typical tourist t shirts etc. As well you have the Cannabis shops giving away "" medical licenses"" so be wary...not the greatest for little children. I would not let my teenage daughters wander by themselves. It was however cool to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871Pieter
40,The bodybuilders and girls on roller skates are worth the visit plus interesting seaside villas architecture,"This is a must stroll through beach which is actually a distance off the pedestrian walkways.The recent architecture of some of the contemporary houses seaside are worth observing.So are some hotels by the beach.Surfers paradise with extremely beautiful sunsets framed by the palm trees.There can be too many people at times and full lot of tourists,Parking is expensive beware!And.....no smoking please!Less people and parking space on weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CFNordstrom
30,Good beach,Nice beach to walk along. Walked along sidewalk area going back to Santa Monica. Area bit grubby and seedy. Police dealing with man kicking off. Buildings interesting enough but wouldn't go out of my way to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaB_107
50,The Ocean is So Soothing,"I LOVE Venice Beach:-D I was visiting in November, beach activity quiet. I parked at the Beach at Washington Street. You may park.for a few yours or for the entire day...there is a fee range. Be prepared in Venice Beach to pay anywhere form $10 to $25 for parking. Port-potties available at the pier that is right here at Washington...you can walk out on the pier and view the surfers. So cool. Wish I could be a surfer. I can't even swim:-( So, I navigate the walk-way, paying attention to not be run over by skate boarders and bicyclers. I stopped at Muscle Beach area to buy souvenir tee-shirts...many vendors from which to choose. A daily fee is available ($10, I think...not sure) if you want to work out at the Muscle Beach gym. Port-a-potties are available in this area, as well. Also a little playground in the Muscle Beach area, if you have children. If you are a smoker, be sure you do NOT smoke on the beach or just anywhere. A friendly, helpful, kind volunteer told my smoker friend to put out the cigarette or move to a ""safe"" zone, between 2 buildings or take the risk that a very LARGE ($300+) fine would be imposed. We continued our walk. There are merchandise shops and food stands but we only had eyes for the ocean...just walking and thinking and being peaceful. You can walk a block or two away from the beach as well and find many shops and restaurants. Lots of traffic during the weekend and difficult to locate reasonably priced parking. Plan to pay $10 minimum to park and as much as $25. Best to visit during the week. Enjoy!!! :-D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeR34
20,Touristy...,"Venice Beach is one of those iconic places you see on TV shows & in Movies so you think you should definitely visit!In all honesty though it was dirty, overcrowded and just way too touristy.It was nice to be able to say I've seen it, but we only stayed 1/2 hour (enough time to walk around and realise how underwhelming and dirty it was) and I wouldn't bother going back again.There are so many other beautiful beaches in the LA area, I would recommend checking them out instead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SG1Lincoln40
40,Too late,We arrived after sunset and many of the shops had closed and we didn't walk on the beach.Lots of characters around but it felt perfectly safe even though my teen girls were uncomfortable (maybe they are too sheltered)Loved the guy playing the grand piano on the walkway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrabO4037VK
50,Great walk,"What a great change of pace. From bodybuilders to bums, the oceanside walk has it all. A great spot to sit and watch the world go by. Don't be alarmed by the smell of the medicine that is being used as you walk by, the users are mostly harmless. You can get drinks, eats, medicine 😉 or just relaxation on the sidewalk. What a great spot to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyB991
40,V for Venice,"I hadn't been to Venice Beach for 20 years. It hasn't changed all that much - It's hard to change metres upon metres of beautiful beach line. Mother Earth works at a slow pace when she wants to. Where sea meets sand seems to go on forever. How cool is it to put your toes in the Pacific on a bright, cool November day after walking the length of the shopping street that runs parallel to the beach? The gentle fall of the waves shows up the odd surfer. Otherwise, loved up couples kiss as the sun goes down. The shops seems to be pretty much the same selling tie-dyed hippy comfy clothes, knick knacks, food, music. The newest additions are the marijuana dispensaries. Not quite my cup of tea but all the rage none the less. There's a market for everything. What struck me most as a European, were the amount of homeless people, predominantly men but not exclusively hanging out opposite the shops and under palm trees - 'happy' homeless it would seem - living just a stone's throw from the ocean and on first name terms with the local police patrolling the area quietly and relatively unobtrusively. You've got to see Venice to realise the extent to which the 'Have' and 'Have nots' reside. I checked house prices in the vicinity and you're talking several millions for a 100 sq.m 'box' house or apartment. The sun kissed 'homeless' erect a piece of scrap tarpaulin for shade or sit in a well used chair (no doubt scavanged from a nearby skip) and make art or sing or simply hang out. The houses and apartments towering over them appear unoccupied - probably because their owners are in the city trying to work as many hours as they can to pay the mortgage. Gardens are laden down with cacti which don't need much watering. Then there are the 'sporty' - cycling, walking, rollerblading, skateboarding dudes who relish the well maintained, recreational area that is Venice without a care in the world, music playing in their ears. With the Santa Monica Pier in the distance what's not to like? Keep looking out to sea but remember that the imbalance of wealth sits like a dark, heavy shadow behind you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishtaylorthompson
40,Always Interesting To Say The Least,"The Venice Boardwalk is one of the fun walks in LA. Lots of interesting characters, places to eat and vendors selling all manner of things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmwpga
30,Nice beach for relaxing,"This beach had it all - nice soft white sand, big waves for the Californian surfers and it was generally quiet away from all the carnage of the Boulevard. We enjoyed watching the skilled skaters in the park and taking in the weird and wonderful along the Boulevard. We now wished we had hired bikes to get the full experience as these were cheap and easy to come by.It is quite a walk to Santa Monica Pier if you do not want to hire bikes and would certainly be a days worth of an activity.The sunsets are also completely unobstructed here so it's worth the watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexxcx
30,Like Blackpool with sun ( and muscle),Pleasant place to stroll along in the California sunshine. Muscle beach is a big attraction- if you like that sort of thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533dar
50,Venice beach,"That is CALIFORNIA DREAM. Here you can do a lot of activities, from surf to skate and go on!You are also really close to St. Monika !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annad567
50,A must-see,"Everyone has heard of Venice Beach or seen it in the movies. You really should experience it at least once. We went late afternoon and watched the sun set....gorgeous! The characters of Venice Beach vary from gawky tourists to homeless artists to dancers & rollerbladders showing off their stuff. I saw shirtless dudes pumping iron on the sidewalk. I saw lots of tattoo shops and t-shirt shops and several medical Marijuana clinics. Everyone was pleasant and no one harassed or begged. It's a very casual beachy lifestyle there. Outdoor cafes abound and all had heaters for winter temps. The highlight came after dark when a large ""club"" of Lit up bicycles cruised down the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partera60
40,Important part of your LA experience,"For everyone visiting LA, Venice Beach should be top of the list if you want to understand LA's relaxed culture. Rent a bike anywhere along the beach and take a ride. Grab some ice cream and watch the locals do they thing. Worth riding down to Santa Monica Pier as well which is just about 30 minutes away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The3000
30,Venice Beach,"Venice Beach.. a kalaidescope of LA beach life...in a few short words funny, maybe nit so funny ,,BUT always ZANY",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mavros66
50,Feel those muscles,"Although I've been to Los Angeles many times, This was my first trip to Venice Beach and muscle Beach. It's a fun area to watch people work out, ( or attempt to climb ropes, lift weights etc on your own) , buy souvenirs, people watch, eat various foods along the boardwalk or take a dip in the Pacific Ocean. Parking can be a little hard to find, but with a little perseverance and patience, a spot can be found.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonf51
40,Most love it but not for all,"Venice beach, specifically the boardwalk (as we usually visit Santa Monica beach next door) is rather colorful as there are street performers, people selling their crafts and plenty of incense and marijuana dispensaries as well. While best viewed on Friday through Sunday, there seems to always be a few performers around. Of course there is muscle beach as well where mostly men go to show off there physique and have for many many years! One cousin of mine was horrified - the worst part of her trip - by the boardwalk but thankfully that was followed by a nearby stroll through the Venice canals which was the highlight of her trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visited49
40,A Day at the beach,"I went here with my friends and had a fantastic time. Even as a local I still enjoy coming here and looking at the ""road side"" acts and the different walks of life that come together to enjoy a good time. There are plenty of shops for tourist and on Saturdays don't forget to stop by Muscle Beach and see the body builders show off; there is a $10 entry fee if you want to work out there. The equipment isn't great so it's definitely more fun to watch than participate. I recommend for tourist and locals alike. Oh yeah there's pretty good food too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ldmccoy09
40,Very interesting,"Great people watching, very interesting all types of people. Lots of tourist and street vendors. The street performers are some of the most impressive around. I like to break a $10 or $20 into $1's and watch the street performers, dancers, musicians, live art and more. The cheapest shows you will find around, waaaay cheaper than the movies. A bit of walking and people are on bikes and skate boards around you but I liked the liveliness.A daytime, afternoon trip is best.Check out and watch the people working out at muscle beach and at the skate park.Watch out for the homeless, druggies... that kind of stuff. Just be prepared :-) there is a police station at the beach and police driving and walking the boardwalk but still be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimikor
50,Love the beach,Great just for beach sitting people watching.. swimming. Yes lifegaurded. Renting bikes you can ride on the paths. Lots of great food at the pier area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seattletraveler5
50,Just the best place,This is a great place to visit in LA. The culture and art here is amazing. All the people are son friendly.Lots of street entertainment and great food places.I met Dennis from Venice doing Henna Tattoos. He was fantastic. Great character.The beach in Venice is lovely and the graffiti on the beach really makes Venice beach what it is.I wish I could have stayed here longer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiej252
30,Avoid if you dislike hobos,"The beach itself is really nice, there are some interesting shops as well. However if you are easily impressed by homeless people, drug smells and crazy lonely hippies then this is not the place for you. Seriously, someone should definitely do something about those poor hobos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581aldoa

40,Memorable and a lot of fun!,"This is a busy activity-filled beach that seemed to have a lot of local folks. If you're uncomfortable around homeless people or people asking for money, you might not want to go here. But our family (two adults and a teenager) loved it! Run on the beach, walk the boardwalk, shop, swim, work out at Muscle Beach, surf, skateboard, play paddleball, collect seashells, play tennis, watch street artists, see seals, admire the graffiti-covered palm trees, bike ride, play basketball, watch dolphins swimming in the ocean... We only spent a few hours here, but it was wonderfully fun and memorable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backnforth2nfro
50,"Waters cold, Enjoy the sand","This is a very nice long deep beach. For being in such a populated area, it is very well kept and clean. The sand is very fine and easy to walk in barefoot. as you get closer to the boardwalk, I would wear shoes as the is debris from the homeless community near there and witnessed quite a lot of broken glass. Away from the board walk it is fine. There are public restrooms all along the beach that are easily accessible as well. Definitely bring a kite if you have one",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Airaddict
50,A Fun Beach And Place To Stay,"If you're going to Southern California for a fun vacation you must visit Venice Beach. There are many places to eat, shop, drink, and so much more.

30,Always quirky!,"Even in the late fall, this place still has its rhythm! Blocks of folks living and selling stuff on the edge. ""Artwork"" of all kinds line the street, plenty of eateries, too. Stay on the Main Street and you'll be totally safe. The beach itself is very clean in spite of the homeless people have made this a refuge. If we were not so close, we wouldn't have came - and we would have missed nothing. Come for the people watching but this place is overrated as an attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beeedell
30,Interesting place to visit,"An interesting place to visit due to the wide variety of people that are around, however after a few hours I found it a little boring.The beach is nice, but I preferred Santa Monica.It was a tick for the bucket list, as it was good to go to Muscle Beach, etc. but I wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielspada
50,Interesting,"Clean, wide beach. Fun people to watch and interesting shops to go through. Lots of security. Found a two story restaurant with great views and amazing fish tacos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttpurplern
50,Must see,This was my favourite thing we did in LA. Walked from Santa Monica pier down to the end of Venice beach and back to see the Sunset. We spent basically the whole afternoon into early evening here. Great chilled vibe. Good if you like skateboards and graffiti. Street sellers were selling hand crafted souvenirs at great prices. There were quite a lot of homeless people along the beach which is sad. This is a must if you're only in LA for a couple of days. Was the highlight of our trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josebag
40,Watching people here is the best thing to do,"This place is teeming with all sorts of characters.Watching the skaters, baller and all the other peoples awesome. The only drawback is how much the place smells of pot. It is really overpowering at times and I would hate to have that conversation with children.It is a bit seedy in places and it is a bit adult compared with Santa Monica so I wouldn't think it is a great place for kids.If you want to make a day of it, bring a bike, hire one and ride along to see more of the place.Very LA and a must see area.Parking was available;e at a lot of carparks for reasonable prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydmandi

50,Favorite part of LA,"If you like different type of people and tourism, VENICE is must have spot. I literally wanted to go every day to VENICE. Incredible energy pushes you to dance on the street. Great shops, food and on the first place PEOPLE. All kind of them. We didn't have chance to go there during night, unfortunately, but for sure, next time all vacation is worth to spend there. Dress in what you feel the best and go for walk and don't plan anything, just enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5650ODninas

30,A bit tacky,"Lots of cheap sunglasses and t-shirts. The skate park is worth a look and watch some action shots for your camera. On a cool Novembers day i think I could have found something better to do, but you may like to see it just to say you have been there. The summer is better as there will be more stalls to see, a lot had gone at this time of the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwells6

40,First time,"We all have a mindset on what Venice beach is. It's not! It is clean the beach is beautiful ,the sand warm! The city has a wonderful trail for just bicycles and joggers. There's enough stores to shop for days. Everyone is friendly it feels safe. Main Street is noisy because there's something going on all the time. They even have a organic only farmers market where they cook their organic products. We love this town and would move there in a heart beat, except it is very expensive! Well worth the 2-3 day visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1074CJmaryl
50,I just can't get over california.,I love the vibe of Venice Beach. Everything I go to California I make it a point to stop here. The views of the beach are what pictures of southern California are made from! This is definitely a bucket list stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicasJ6730TU
50,"great place, superrb sunset","The beach is very nice, clean. Witnessed a beautiful sunset on a Saturday after noon.If you try, then you can find free road side car parking (i found on grand st.).On the boardwalk, shops are not very interesting and lots of homeless people taking marijuana around. So you might not feel safe after sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pritammukherjee
50,The other side of LA,"Venice beach, unlike traditional beach, is unusual. In it, you find people showing off their muscle, tacky shops, lots of food, cycling, people walking the tight rope, and lots of crowd. If you are bored with the usual, come here to submerge into a different life. The best part - the cycling track and the fact that it connects to Santa Monica and beyond!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vipul20044
50,JRNicholson,"Lots of restaurants, easy access to parking and beaches. Lots of families walking the board walk. Enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNicholson
30,A Great Scene,"A trip to Venice beach is always a delight. The beach walk is still an authentic experience. The sidewalk vendors are an eclectic bunch mixed with the wafting smell of marijuana . Unfortunately, the main shopping street, Abbot Kinney, has become a street of main street stores. Rents have risen driving out the old real venice beach places. Sad state of affairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timtravelsabout
30,See the weird and wacky side of California,"Venice Beach is a magnet for the unusual and eccentric of CaliforniaWhilst there are many tacky shops, homeless people and a constant smell of marijuana you need to look past this to enjoy is undoubtedly characterWalking along the promenade is great fun and constantly entertaining",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike48
50,When all else fails...,"Trying to entertain two teenage kids can be tough, so I took the to where it all started, the beach, but not any beach, Venice Beach, a morphing of Long Island's Jones Beach and the boardwalk of Coney Island on steroids, truly a unique place worth visiting. The two mile winding strip of cement is a visual awakening for its cast of characters lost in a faraway land only known to them, but the deapth of homelessness may make many saddened as it did for my two teenage kids, accustomed to seeing it on the streets of NYC but at a far lesser severity. Nevertheless, make Venice Beach a high priority.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankvespe
40,Peaceful by the water's edge,"Venice Beach is a gorgeous, incredibly wide, and long sandy beach in the hip area of Venice. It was cool the day I was there, but lots of people were lounging, walking and riding bikes along the paved beach path near the busting shops, street vendors and restaurants. Only a handful of people were by the tranquil water's edge, far from the noise and commotion of the street scene. Wonderful spot to spend the day. Easy, inexpensive parking at this time of year. The nearby restaurants offer a variety of cuisines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kfitz00

50,A lot of activities in Venice,"Venice is a beautiful beach, you can see many palm trees, there is a paved road where people practice different sports such as biking, skating and skateboarding. You can actually rent those fun bikes for two or three people. There are also a lot of walls with big graffiti to take nice pictures, a lot of souvenirs, clothing stores and restaurants or fast food along the beach, there is an outdoor gym and nice showers but just a few bathrooms. So you see, there's a lot to do or you can just relax and go into the water, the temperature is perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickygarces
50,Iconic destination capturing the alternative side of LA,You simply can't go to LA without a visit to Venice Beach. Go during the day to see it at its best. You'll find every type of alternative culture LA is famous for. Large beach with great swimming and lots of good places to eat and drink while taking in some people watching. Bring a camera to capture the sights you won't see anywhere else,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfausttravogal
50,It isn't for everyone,"So if my staff rate this, it won't be a five. She was a little unprepared and uncomfortable with the area. It is a little dirtier and rougher looking than the Santa Monica area but a lot more fun. I really people watching and even though very touristy I saw more locals than anything else. Especially loved watching the skateboarders and looking at all the tagging everywhere. Very cool place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarileesTravels
40,Beautiful,"Venice beach and the adjoining Santa Monica beach are absolutely wonderful. Near all kinds of restaurants and shops and the Venice Boardwalk these beaches are a great place to spend a day. Note that the Venice beach area is far more ""blue collar"" (in a good way) than Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3427FIwilliams
50,Something for most anyone!,"Venice Beach never fails to offer a little something of everything for everyone.

50,Beautiful Beach,Fabulous beach with huge waves and a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. When we were there it was full of surfers not many swimmers but that suited us. It was not overly busy either which is always good. Changing facilities and showers there. A must visit in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227gracek
50,"Eclectic, Enjoyable, Fun with a lot of California Sun","A great contrast of have & havenot's along this promenade.

50,Entertaining,"Spent a couple of days in Santa Monica but spent most of our time here, you must try the tacos at Venice Beach bar next to the candle cafe the best taco's we have eaten, we ate lunch there twice during our stay sampled the tacos along with wings & amazing potato wedges, we had to go back again purely to try the other tacos and of course have the wedges again, sadly no wifi that works. Highly recommend this place even to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hateglazers
40,"Love it, very relaxing","We visited this beach with my parents over 86 years old , they loved it, people very nice there, beach is very relaxing, lots of activities.

30,"Interesting, but mixed opinions...","I enjoyed visiting Venice Beach and Santa Monica (which has some interesting shops to browse in). Venice Beach itself was a bit of a mix for me... so crowded with people! It really doesn't have a relaxing holiday vibe to it - it's just too high energy. The people watching was interesting (some very beautiful people, and some not-so-much). I found it really off-putting to see the number of homeless people camping alongside the walkway. I think there are safety issues, and hygiene issues to worry about (the on-site bathrooms were absolutely disgusting!! Don't touch anything!). So, although it's a beautiful place, and has positive sides to it, I was unimpressed by some of the negatives. I would not make a point of returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalgaryAlphan
50,Loving Venice Beach,"One of the most entertaining board walks that I ever been. Full of life and art in the streets, filled with interesting things to see, really bizarre and bohemian. You can find a lot of shops, restauarnts and also there's a freak show, really awesome! I really recommend, there's no place like Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sof_ag801
30,Iconic but not brilliant,You have to visit Venice Beach when in LA but once you have done it you might want to not stay too long as there are other better beaches not too far away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/x_Boots_x
50,Beautiful Beach!,"This beach was soooo beautiful! Next time I will definitely stay a whole day here to swim and surf. I loved how the beach had a local ice cream shop that also sold funnel cakes! And even water(it's extremely hot in LA you need water!!!!) also loved the basketball courts it just such a great place to have fun. There is so much to do in this beach. Beware of Venice beach at night, it's maybe not the safest place ( sketchy ppl and homeless people roaming around the streets). Other than that I can refiner understand why people love this beach so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckywtgh
40,Friends weekend,Big beautiful beach. Clean and lots of shops and things to see. A must do if in the area. Stop by muscle beach. Not much but imagine it is one of a kind,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missouritravel5

50,Great day out,"Stayed with friends in long beach, came here for the afternoon. Definitely loads to see, muscle mecca gyms, lovely beach, multiple restaurants and shops and even performing acts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebecaA1994
40,Watch the sunset at Venice Beach,"My wife, son (11) and I went to Venice Beach after the Santa Monica Pier. We got there a little later than optimal, as the sunset was almost over. It would have been amazing to watch the whole sunset from this beach. After watching the end of the sunset on the beach, we walked back to the beach walk and took in the sights. There was so much to see from the little shops, to street entertainers, to 'local characters' and we even caught (by fluke) the Venice Electric Light Parade which only runs every Sunday at 6:35pm. The evening was an experience and we're glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127davism

50,Top!!!!,"Increadible beach, very nice environment and nice views besides of the street shop as well as street shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugotamura
40,Made me smile,Only spent a few hours on the beach front whilst passing through Venice beach. The street artists and quirky people as great to see and there is so much going on. Enjoyed watching the sunset and the cyclists and skaters and the overall feel of the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bms17v
20,2 stars is too kind,I have to agree 100 percent with all the bad reviews. They were even too kind.The place is full of lunatics And pot smoking shops. With burnouts wandering aimlessly bothering you for money. Venice can not begin to compare to east coast beaches of Ocean city Myrtle Beach SC and Virginia Beach. Everything is so old and falling apart with tacky souvenir shops. Sorry to say this but they need a hurricane to improve it .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycep883
50,My Favorite Spot for People Watching,"If you ever visit the Los Angeles area, you MUST visit Venice Beach. I love spending a few hours walking the strand on a Saturday afternoon just people watching. Yes, you may have seen Venice Beach on TV, but it doesn't compare to actually walking the strand yourself and seeing some of the same regulars you've seen in movies. My favorite part, or should I say, any woman's favorite part, is Muscle Beach. Last time I was there, I couldn't resist taking a photo with someone who works out there on a regularly basis. Yes, I tipped him very well. Let me forewarn you that visiting Venice Beach is a unique experience because you'll never know who you'll see while walking along the strand. For example, it's not uncommon to come across some famous comedians surrounded by a crowd while they're trying out some new material. A majority of the time you'll see a bunch of locals participating in a jam music session right there on the sand. Then there's the skateboard park area where you'll definitely see some of the locals performing amazing stunts. I must say that it's exciting to watch them in action. I must admit that the time goes by extremely fast whenever I'm at Venice Beach because there's so much to see within a 2 mile radius. I hate to admit it, but sometimes I'm so busy people watching that I forgot to take in the beauty of the ocean or the beach itself. Also, make sure you visit some of the local shops along The Strand which sale a variety of unique t-shirts and art. In fact, I've purchased some of my favorite t-shirts in my collection from Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camrenettra
30,Nice but just a beach,"The water is deceiving. It is cold, about 60 degrees. I am from Oklahoma so it was nice to see but was hoping for water to be warmer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaustin30
50,LA culture in your face,Great place to people watch and soak up LA beach culture. Geta location to grab a beer or a snack and do some shopping for that unique piece of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenroy
40,Active beach!,"Venice beach is a fun place to be. There's a lot to do here. You can shop, eat , walk ,skateboard , get tattoos, segway or just build sand castles! There was a group of people skateboarding in the specially built pit , and they were real cool at it! If in LA its a must go at least for once. We were there till sunset and then moved towards Santa Monica. I felt quite safe there although dont know the scene after sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sohammehta
50,Best place for the suset,"The pier area is a must go while the sun is setting, great for pictures. Less crowded than the Santa Monica pier, but also less parking. Clean, until you get closer to the board walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlin8899
40,Just so you can say you went there.,"Venice beach is an iconic place to visit. Just to walk a long and look at the shops, or go out on the pier.It is not a place for families on hot summer nights, because it attracts a lot of not kid friendly people to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CentralCoastWine
50,MUST SEE destination in Los Angeles,"Venice Beach has it all for you: Colorful people, artsy creations, street performers, bike and surfboard rentals, the beach, outdoor skate park, basketball courts, Muscle Beach, Marijuana shops, paddle tennis courts, tons of eating options, bars, live music, Venice Beach Boardwalk, lots of parking options, etc. Also, don't miss seeing the Venice Canals as they are stunning (ask someone for directions as it is 2 blocks off the beach and no signage to help you find it)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543davel
50,Dogs Day,The beach is beautiful and clean. There were a lot of people in the water just wading and swimming as well as surfers out waiting to catch a wave. The smells from the restraunts was almost overwhelming after hiking along the beautiful beach for several miles. It was a perfect day for my dog Juliette and myself,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/431connieh
40,"Very unique beach, check it out","One of the more unique beaches I've been to. Lots of great people watching, great views and good paths to walk on. Nice beach too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronnie980
30,If you must,"If Venice Beach is on your bucket list, go to check it off, or take the selfie... if you want to see a collection of unusual people, then go... but note that in this case, unusual is not positive. If you want to see a beautiful California Beach, plan to visit Laguna Beach, or Malibu, but pass on Venice.. high number of homeless individuals that would justifiably make some uncomfortable, trashy environment, waves are across a very wide beach so the sense of ""coast"" is not great.. Go to El Matador state Beach in Malibu, have a secluded picnic dinner in beautiful surroundings as you watch the sunset... or go to Laguna Beach, splurge and have lunch at the Montage... but there are so many better things to do with your time, than to visit Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdBannister
30,Walk a little disappointing,"Arrived early from the airport and thought it would be a great idea to get moving straight away. Had always wanted to do the walk from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach. Perfect day to do it. Little overcast, not hot great. The walk wasn't the issue or the beach they were great, it was reaching Venice beach to find it was all closed off. Figured out along the walk why the joggers and other people only go so far and turn around. Was being cleaned from the night before. Just overall a little disappointed. The Santa Monica Pier is a great destination to visit and would recommend it to anyone. However I would not recommend the walk to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sgirl94
30,A Walk on Venice Beach,"I took my cousins (visiting L.A. from overseas) to Venice Beach, after visiting the soooo beautiful Venice canals. They did not care for Venice Beach. And I agree: it is too crazy, too many people around ( on Sunday afternoon) and too noisy. So, we walked through the main area, and soon escaped to Marina del Rey. The few restaurants at the beach have a long wait, so we went to have late lunch somewhere else. Be careful about your surroundings, esp. if you're there after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mussukisu
30,Hippie style,If you like a taste of 70's you will like it. Lots of drifters and tourists and also homeless people. It's fun though. You should see it once I think,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amirk973
50,Venice Beach.,"My kids and myself rented bikes and rode from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach along the boardwalk.We passed Muscle Beach where all the folks were exercising , stretching and performing in some way or the other. It was an experience for me since I had not ridden a bike for years. Of course I almost rode off the boardwalk a couple times, but it was fun never the less. The scenery was so relaxing . We rode by a couple artist singing while some were performing.Skate boarders were skating in the skate area which was amazing to see. It was approx. 3 miles to Venice Beach and 3 back . Had a wonderful time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraS2013
50,Lots of people watching,"Venice Beach itself if a very interesting place for people watching. You can rent bikes and explore the area. Lots of great views. We went to High, a rooftop bar which claims to have the best view in the city.I recommend going up to Abbott Kinney St for the high end shopping and restaurants. It was one of the highlights of our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackerssss
40,Picturesque and Hipster,"This really is a beautiful part of the world made more interesting by the hippy surf shops along the way. The skate park that locals can tag and graffiti adds to the charm and vibe, not to mention all the skaters and misfits with their own individual sense of style.It's such a colourful, exciting place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaTheNomad

50,A must do,"Only in LA for a few days with the family, Venice beach is a place i always wanted to see, It did not disappoint, so much going on, so much to observe, and the food is good too. Go visit and chill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pas66UKCan
40,Good for 2-3 hours before Santa Monica,"Here's the itinerary I use to show people around when they say they “must see” Venice Beach and Santa Monica! This assumes you have a car.V E N I C EPark:Park either (1) along the residential streets near Venice canals (southside of Venice) or (2) along the residential streets near Abbot Kinney Blvd (northside of Venice).Walk to the V E N I C E sign:Walk to the intersection of Windward Ave and Pacific Ave. This is where you want to start and it’s also where you can take a photo of the strung V E N I C E sign.Walk around the boardwalk:Walk towards the ocean to the boardwalk and what I consider the center of Venice Beach. Watch and tip a few street performers. From here, there are three main attractions:(1) Beach. Put your feet in the water. Notice that it’s cold in California, which surprises some people. Look to your right to see Santa Monica Pier, which you can drive to later.(2) Skatepark. Watch the skaters from behind the rails. Take a picture of the skatepark with the beach, Santa Monica Pier, and the mountains in the background. People usually love that you can get the beach and mountains in one photo.(3) Muscle Beach. Watch people work out on the gym equipment. Maybe you’ll see a celebrity.Lunch:If you're hungry, I recommend a hole-in-the-wall Peruvian place called El Huarique. It's a short, 3-min walk north along the boardwalk from the center of Venice. It's tucked in an alley but labeled with an orange sign, ""El Huarique,"" at address 1301.Venice Canals:The canals are a 10-15 minute walk south of the center of Venice. Walk south along the boardwalk, turn left onto S Venice Blvd, turn right onto Grand Canal, and you're at the Venice canals! With the drought in California, expect that they may look more like puddles than canals. The homes and bridges are still worth a look.S A N T A M O N I C APark:Finish the day in Santa Monica. Drive from Venice Beach and park in Santa Monica Parking Structure 6 or 7 because these are at the south end start of Third Street Promenade, the pedestrian shopping street.Third Street Promenade:Walk north up the length of Third Street Promenade. Enjoy the shops and atmosphere. Use the clean public bathrooms.Pier:To walk from Third Street Promenade to the pier, turn left onto Wilshire where the promenade ends on the north side. Then turn left onto Ocean Avenue and take this popular pedestrian sidewalk to Santa Monica Pier. There are clean bathrooms at the pier. There are also rides that were inspiration for the rocket ships in the Jimmy Neutron movie (2001), which I loved as a kid.Beach:After the pier, play at the beach if you have time, though I've gotten the comment from my visitors that this beach is not as noteworthy as the ones in Orange County. If you have an extra day in Southern California, head to any of the beaches between Laguna Beach and Dana Point. Better views, less crowds.Dinner:I tend to take people to have dinner at Umami Burger (get the umami burger and truffle fries) or Cheesecake Factory (portions are great for splitting and sharing, and they have a “Skinnylicious” menu for health-conscious eaters).If you have extra time, consider:(1) visiting downtown Culver City(2) eating dinner at the popular Italian restaurant C&O Cucina, located in Marina Del Rey and known for their garlic knots.Enjoy your visit to the westside of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTWTravelr
40,Nice beach,Great sand and pier to enjoy the ocean. Lots to do near the sea as well. A very large population of homeless people stays in the area. We had no issues with panhandlers etc but something to be aware of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jen14625
30,Nice enough beach but not so nice area,"Venice beach itself is nice enough and we had a good lunch at a local cafe. Unfortunately the area is not so nice. Generally dirty, smelled pot everywhere, crowded, many, many homeless people and pets, and it's impossible to walk along without people stopping you to ask for money or trying to sell you something. Public restroom facilities are revolting- avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaA907

There are also street performers, Muscle Beach where super buff men and women work out. There is also the beach and ocean to enjoy. This is a great place to people watch!

50,Beautiful CA beach,Loved walking onVenice Beach in early AM and late afternoon sunset. 10 min walk from Marriot marina Del Rey . Thought it was cleaner and quieter than Santa Monica beach- the pier there brings into many tourists. Quieter area to stay when visiting LA or flying in or out of LAX. You can walk forever! Lots of surfers early AM. Lots of restaurants on washington st. I liked the Mediterranean one for takeout. Great houmas! Step on the Beach and WOW! Just spectacular views! AWESOME scenery ! California dreaming at its best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/downhillskier17

10,Mad Max's Favorite Beach,"Looking towards the sea, lovely.Looking towards the hundreds of homeless people who have set up camp, the psychic's, the head shops, the steroid-infused musclemen, the passed out junkies, the facial tattooed gang boys, the freak show carnies and denizens and assorted tough guy wannabees makes you wonder why you are on this awful stretch of the beach.Unless you enjoy slumming or seeing homeless people begging locals and tourists who look past them as if they didn't exist... this is not the beach area for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankY449

50,cool breeze Venice,"i love going to the venice skate park, you see some of the best pros there and aspiring amateurs. the view is amazing. They cleaned Venice up 10 years ago and its lovely now. very touristy on the weekends. Go off the beaten path and explore, you will find cooler shops and cafes that way. great people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834reggiec
50,Crazy world,You really need to visit this strange place in LAIncredible people as you will never see anywhereDuring the day a lot of musicians and artists but in the night forget about it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerj367
50,Beautiful feelgood place,"I have been to Venice Beach three times now and I could never get bored with the place. It has so much to offer, a beautiful clean beach with sparkling clear water, lots of lovely little shops, bars, restaurants and street entertainers. There is also the famous Muscle Beach gym where you can watch the bodybuilders working out. The place is just packed full of character and has something to suit everybody. It is fair to say there are a lot of homeless people in the area but they do not cause any problems, we have never once been approached or hounded by any of them. A lot of them are musicians and provide some great entertainment. I would recommend this place to anybody. Also if you have time to explore away from the main promenade you can find Little Venice which is beautiful, a mini version of Venice with all the canals and bridges. If you are in LA this place should be a must on your places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/203tracyh
50,Lovely,Loved the vibe of Venice Beach. All the shops have amazing vibes. You can buy native American items and cool t shirts. Henna and tattoo parlors. The best part is we rented bicycles and it was spectacular to ride it along the beach. The weather and the Pacific Ocean is amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lamloum83
50,Lovely,"walk back in time to the 1960's where the world was freer, where people believed in magic. walk the beach and the smells are amazing. Maybe a few too many crowds, hang onto your belongings. See the freak show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirjoker

30,The beach is great but parking too expensive,It's a nice place to visit on a day. But the parking is too expensive to the point that they are charging $50.00 for the whole day. And that's at a bank of America parking lot or restaurant. Or a close business parking spot. Without Valet parking. Those parking companies are really taking advantage of the public needs. I believe that it should get regulated by the City of Venice Beach. Or City of L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wrodriguez1974
50,Very cool place!,"Beautiful beach! The boardwalk has all sorts of shops and food. We went on a weekend and there were also vendors selling crafts. The famous ""Muscle Beach"" is also along this boardwalk. Great for people watching too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaG618
20,Not sure what the fuss is about?,"Admittedly, I only spent an hour or so here, but even that was too long. I'm really not sure what the fuss is about? It's basically a strip of shops/markets along one side and the water on the other, with a skate park and various sculptures etc in between them on the sand. There was an alarming number of homeless people here which made it hard to enjoy too as I felt helpless for them.Sure, the backdrop of palm trees and people rollerblading looks great and I got some nice photos. But it wasn't a pleasant experience for me and there are so many other fantastic places to visit in the States that I wouldn't go out of my way to see this again or recommend it if you only have a short amount of time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbettyh
40,Relaxing stroll on the boardwalk,"Nice boardwalk that is not too commercialised, you will find many independent shops on the boardwalk selling anywhere from tacky t-shirts to great food such as Poke. Many ""artists"" on the boardwalk although they always look for tips even just to take pictures the work. Muscular guys working out at Muscle Beach will also want tips if you want to take a picture with them... maybe that's how they make a living? What's apparent though is the number of homeless people on the boardwalk... Make sure you leave just after the sun set, as the shops close and many other tourists leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feb30th

Theres some really cool artwork on the buildings & they all front a beautiful beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cortez48
10,Dirty and smells like piss,Walking along the shops it smells dirty and gross the fishing pier is a nice walk but over all Australian beaches are soo much better than what the movies make this place out to bed.

To walk Venice beach and enjoy other people plus all the shops, cafe's and restaurants is one of a kind, but also biking is great there. You can bike to Santa Monica, but also to other beaches further south than the airport. Don't to forget to visit Venice, when you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henson90
20,may be the year period October the beach wasn't clean as usual,As i arrive by Horizon ave. the sight was kind of ackward Junky laying on benches the boardwalk looked like a ghetto.

40,Always a fascinating alternative experience,"Come here on any LA trip - just love the beach and its activities, buskers, variety of people - so different to downtown and driving around the cities aimlessly for hours which is what happens on freeways. Much better enjoying the alternatives at Venice and Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
20,Trashy,"OK, in movies this place looks so glamorous. You shouldn't go there as a woman after sunset. The place looks just filthy and not glamorous at all. Is it worth to visit that place?

40,Another great beach,"I just love this area there are great places to run, walk, or bike. Take some time and check out the surfers and the people working out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
20,"Don't believe the hype, well maybe a little","First time to California and wanted to visit all the ""famous"" places you hear through TV and movies etc. I had planned to go anyway, but had a few hours to kill before check in at Marina Del Rey so I headed to the Venice boardwalk. In hindsight I would not go out of my way to walk here. I would have rather looked around Marina Del Rey and check out the boats. Venice Pier is cool, but so is the one in Santa Monica and San Clemente. The beach is great and has surfing. The boardwalk itself was not impressive. Muscle Beach, cool to see but not a trip highlight. I appreciate eccentric people/artists, but really this is a collection of homeless people trying to make money with homemade crafts. On the other side you have people trying to push medical marijuana, 18 different people selling the same joke tshirts and underwear(""property of"", and any show or movie slogan you can think of) and a few cool skate shops thrown in. If anything, I would rent a bike and bike the paths closest to the beach so you can at least breeze by this strange collection and see it from a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FerrTravel
20,Oh my gosh 😵,"I've heard of Venice beach and was super excited to see it on the short day tour we went on. The tour dropped us off for an hour and a half of free time. It was a long hour and a half!!The beach itself is awesome. Unfortunately near the shops, muscle beach and around there is a different story. It is very rough, we were almost scammed by a group of people who grabbed us in and tried to give us a ""mix cd"" and then wanted a ""donation"" for it quite forcefully.The ""muscle beach"" is ridiculous. Some steroid and tanning lotion abusers flexing about all over the place.Food options were dodgy, the only place we thought was safe ended up making us sick.Anyway, if you visit Venice beach, go straight past the shopping area and walkway onto the beach and you will enjoy! The international flags sprawled across the beach is a true highlight.If you need to choose a place to have lunch and explore for a tour maybe do a little research and see if Santa Monica is a better place to spend more time over Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielAiello
40,An interesting experience,"As other TA members have mentioned, Venice Beach is either appealing because of the diversity of people around, the various shops, restaurants, the ocean, beautiful sunsets, the boardwalk. OR, you might find it somewhat disgusting because of some pungent smells and different characters that hang out at this area.The public washrooms in the busy sections were not clean, but further along and away from the crowds they were actually rather clean. We biked the full length of it and found that activity very satistfying. People we met and passed were all very friendly and different from the main strip.If you've never been out to Venice Beach, it's worth a visit to say that you've experienced it once. Sometimes, that's all that's needed. We'd rent bikes here again and go along the waterfront. But, not sure that it would be necessary for us to return and just hang out in the section with all those crowds in the carnival-like setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
10,Weed and wee,"This place is a dive, it full of homeless, people living out of cars/vans in both beach and surrounding streets. Everywhere smells like weed and wee.Out of all the places we have visited around the world, this is where we have felt most unsafe.Tick the box to say we've been but never ever again.

40,Funky fun,"If you want funky, come to Venice Beach on the weekend. Lots of vendors, street acts, many friendly dogs and assorted humans. Great for the family but if you have very small children bring a stroller and loads of sunscreen. LMany small eateries along your walk. The beach is beautiful and a place for a fun picnic. Bike rentals also available so you can ride along the beach all the way to Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthC78

And I think two visits to Venice is more than enough in ones life time.But on a positive note we did actually walk across Venices open shopping area towards Santa Monica and after leaving the depressive area of Venice the walk was very pleasant and the hotels and house took a different twist .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwynag
30,We went to say we went,"Honestly, I don't think this is somewhere we'd purposely go again -- the beach is clean, the bathrooms, well half didn't flush, lots of parking nearby, but the main reason we went is to say we went there.. Muscle beach was the main attraction. Guys and girls were showing off tricks and that was entertaining. There's a few guys trying to sell CDs and the shops aren't too expensive considering its a beach area, but it didn't blow me away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cudd8622
40,Alive !!!,Venice beach has its own vibe a must see with a little of everything.The beach was clean and pride is shown in that regard.The real attraction is the boardwalk with high energy live shows street merchants restaurants and plenty of clothing stores to show proof that you were there.An absolute great place to take the whole family as I said it has its own vibe and the residents don't care if you approve or not and that's the cool aspect about Venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sho1992
20,Seedy,"I visited here about twenty years ago when there were some great street entertainers and where people skateboarded, roller bladed and it was generally a cool place to go. Now I'm afraid it's just seedy, grubby and unkempt. The only reason you would go here would be to watch the kids at the skateboard park. I asked one guy how much it would be to park and he said $36 for the day. Go to the front and it is only $6. That summed up Venice Beach now. People trying to rip you off. They need to clean this place up and get it back to where it was. They had to do the same with Hollywood for the same reasons. There weren't even any guys pumping iron at Muscle Beach. Why would they want to? Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plfara

20,Iconic and sketchy,"I have been here several times and have grown more leery of Venice Beach with each visit. The neighboring communities and sights are definitely a contrast to the local trade and sketchy characters you'll find along the promenade. If you do go, be aware of your surroundings and belongings. Definitely do not visit during the night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
40,"Nice beach, interesting beach town","There are not a lot of places like Venice Beach. The old hippy atmosphere is long since gone, replaced by a thin ""shakedown street"" veneer next to a highly gentrified neighborhood. Pleasant beach, but overall a sad experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JrMushroom
50,A window on society,"This was our first day in LA and we decided to have a day in Venice beach just watching the world go past. Great options to walk or just sit and watch. Nobody gives a # and that's why this place is so great. Yes it could be trashy, yes it has some weird people and yes I am sure many are not actually sure if it's Venice beach or Mars but if you like to people watch this is the place. We sat in a cafe and watched the world walk past while enjoying good food and drink.Would love to have spent more time here but it is a must do. Beach was lovely and if you get back into the actual village of Venice then the shops and houses are fantastic and quirky.In fact that's the best word....

30,Trashy and Touristy,"We know that many people regard Venice Beach as a local landmark, but we found it very trashy and touristy. The shops and restaurants that line this section of the beach are typical of such locations, which is to say, not very good. Yes, it's a place you can be enthralled by the variety of human denizens, but at the end of a stroll from one end to the other, we were tired of the overly touristy aspect of this beach. Other area beaches are more interesting in our mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rexflash
20,Not the Venice Beach I remembered.,"On vacation with my husband 17 year old daughter and her friend and our special needs adult son. We took a day trip to VB as I remembered how much fun it was for me when I was younger. First it is not being maintained and is very dirty. As always a lot of street vendors and entertainers which was fine until we came upon 4 or 5 twenty to thirty year old men handing out free CD's we politely said no on our way back one of them was getting in the face of our special needs son and I said he does not understand you but they kept on so my husband stepped in and they stopped. There were people everywhere smoking weed and other stuff, which I can understand as we did not see one officer, park ranger or life guard the entire time. Every alley we passed by had people hanging out in them. Did I mention it was dirty. Oh well I do have some good memories. I would not take kids or young teenagers there it's just not the environment they should be exposed to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bolivejuice

50,Worth a look see,Visited Venice Beach on a Thursday when it wasn't super crowded. I was told it gets real crowded during the weekends. It felt like a combination of a boardwalk you see at Coney Island and Atlantic City with the feel of East Greenwich Village in NYC.You do have your array of people selling artwork and rental bikes and such. The area has loads of food options and souvenir stores. I even found a Zoltar fortune teller machine which may or may not been from the movie BIG. They also had a great many and I mean a great many tattoo shops all down the area.Muscle beach that day had no one working out but it was nice to see. I didn't walk to the beach itself as I was working with a time limit. Parking is a different issue as you have to hunt for parking around the area.And did I mention souvenir stores ? They have a wide variety of bars as well. And they had t shirts like you see in the west village. All in all if you have time to spend it's worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Empire365
40,Sunny Beach day,"It cost $9.00 to park in each lot closest to the beach. As a traveler, I didn't see many public beach access areas. The Sand was very hot on the day I was there, so it was hard to walk barefoot to the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apopka1564
10,"Dangerous, Dirty, Not What It Used To Be!","The iconic Venice Beach used to be a place that you could stroll down the beach, enjoy people watching, buy t-shirts for cheap, and get a bite to eat. It WAS a great place for tourists and locals, but not anymore. People are very pushy trying to sell their items. They get into your personal space and some will even follow you to hopefully intimidate you into purchasing it. The last three times I was there, my family and I observed fights breaking out with random strangers, someone yelling at everyone that walked by, and it was dirty. A local told me that they had shooting not too long ago. Venice Beach will always be an iconic place, unfortunately it will not be a place that I take my friends and family to. Oh, and I wouldn't take my poor pet there either!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7books
50,The beach itself is fairly nice; what the beach represents is more than what can be rated.,"To me, Venice Beach almost transcends normal ratings, as if it's something that is beyond stars, because of the way it is ingrained within the minds of many of being this surrealistic, intangible (until you visit it) thing. I'm not just reviewing a beach, I'm trying to put a number on something that is synonomous with the sun-soaked LA lifestyle, with the beach bum surfers and rebellious skaters who came from that, of glistening body builders sweating and flexing in the sand. As a beach, it's fairly nice, with the skatepark and the lovely sand, but it's a little rough around the edges and there are definitely ""nicer"" beaches out there. But that all becomes irrelevant because it is Venice Beach, it's much more an idea and a representation of an idealised lifestyle than it is a beach, to me at least. That's why my review seems almost pointless. The skatepark and waves and shops and everything else are cool to explore, but the beach itself is beyond a rating system. It's like trying to rate the idea of the west coast lifestyle. But I still gave it 5 stars, because I had to give it something!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466amys

These are, of course, entirely personal, and what Venice Beach will be for you will be generated by what you want from it.Regardless of anything else, it is full of characters, from all walks of life, and superb for just hanging around, experiencing and people watching.Parking can a be a little tight, but is obviously easier first thing in the morning or later in the afternoon. We loved our visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
30,Meh,The beach is beautiful and the skate park is impressive but other than that it's pretty rundown. I didn't want to buy anything including food because I was afraid to use my credit card.

40,Beach Calmness,"We walked a long the boardwalk and enjoyed us some ice-cream, that melted so fast, it was crazy :Dwe then walked over the long beach to sit a little and enjoy the sunlight, we were so lucky, we got to see some kind of porpoises swimming so close to the shore.it was so beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasmineZikry

20,It was ok,To be sincere We didn't enjoy our visit there. Too many people looking for a penny. Is so sad to see people with addictions walking around. You don't needMore than a day to see what's there. If you're into hipster stuff probably you'll like it. It was a totally deception.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rfig02
50,Surfs up,Surfed the breakwater and down by the peer. The beach wasn't that busy... But it was also October! The sunsets are off the charts wither from the beach or from the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hashtagcrinny
50,Great beach vibes,"If you are looking for a great beach this is the place. With the miles of sandy beaches, to working out, to rollerblading this is the place to be. Going from Vince beach to the Santa Monica pier is easy on the bike/walking trail along the beach front. Cool shops and even cooler people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWaters41
50,Vacation,"Stayed at Motel 6...just for the record was very clean.and the room smelled fresh. Ate at TJ Carneys on the main strip of Venice, they have outdoor dining, Dog friendly...so pup git to go also..Sonny's BBQ also a great place to eat!!

30,Great place to people watch,"All kinds of interesting people, numerous tourist shops for those seeking t-shirts or other ""I was there"" stuff. Expensive food. Nice clean beach. Keep your wallet in a safe place. If your into weight lifting, skating, skateboarding this is a place for you. There are interesting spray painting artists working the cement structures, legally. Some of these are very good! I think for many people to walk the strip once and sit to soak in the atmosphere one time would be enough. It is definitely a unique place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bikingfarmer
30,Average,"Strange place. You have to see it, but one hour is more than enough. We didn't feel safe there. So many drug dealers during the day, used syringes on restrooms, thiefs... beware to buy CD's with reggae music there. You will buy empty CD for 5$. Really strange place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weetek
50,A lot of activities and sports,this place is very inclusive and you can find what you want there. Since sports until personal interest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eduardo284
50,People Watch,We all know this is some of the best people watching in the world...the beach is nice sand is nice and they have kept the beach clean..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelleyrtaylor
20,Dirty and weird,"Venice beach is a beautiful area with a nice walking and biking path along side the beach. However this area has been taken over by cheap shops, people peddling cheap homemade wares and many homeless people essentially sleeping and lounging everywhere. The entire shop area is dirty and rundown. I would not recommend this area as entertaining or good for shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LRC100116
50,Loved the people watching opportunities!,"Loved muscle beach, skate park all the shops and vendors! Lots to see. People on skateboards and bikes everywhere. Eccentric, artistic and interesting people to see, this is a must see beach. You won't be disappointed! Would love to go back! Must eat at one of the sidewalk restaurants so you can see all the people going by!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pup101

40,Eclectic!,"You never know what you might see - from food, to the people, skateboarders and muscle beach - we even saw Comedy Central folks on the Basketball courts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeenaT1965
30,Not What You See on TV,"Since we were in LA we had to go visit Venice Beach to say we been there saw that. First thing you'll notice there is a ton of homeless people. The ocean breeze comes off and you actually get the horrible smell of the homeless people that haven't bathed in god knows how long. The shops are typical T'Shirt type beach shops that are all very similar. There is a very nice walk along the path which is very wide. All along the path are street artists for lack of better word, selling things they've created. Most things look to be created from things they've found in the garbage. Others are very terrible paintings and sketches of various subjects. There are also a few restaurants there. We stopped in and had lunch. Again, was disappointed in the overpriced food that was far below average. Again, the destination far outweighed the actual site itself. The beach is nice once you get by all the homeless living on the beach there. View of the coast where it wraps around to Malibu is very scenic. Just not impressed by all of the vagrants and homeless that are allowed to set up makeshift camps there on the edge of the main walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royw366
20,Dissapointing But glad I went,This was nothing like what I expected from seeing it from TV shows. It was very tired and run down and did not feel a friendly place to walk around. When you walked down to the beach it self it felt a lot better once away from the crowds. The public toilets in the area we were in looked as if they had seen better days and there was over a 20 minute wait to use them. People also used them as changing rooms. Was glad when our tour moved on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL860
50,Venice Beach....What More Need Be Said???,"I love Venice. It's eclectic, eccentric, lusciously weird and different. You MUST go! I love Venice Beach. It's such a happy place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kl417g
40,Beautiful,"Another must-see in LA. Beautiful and fun. Go hang by the water if you want to relax, or walk along the boardwalk to see all sorts of shops and performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paloma_Rao
40,Great vibe,We spent our first morning in LA taking an interesting stroll along Venice Beach. Exactly what we expected and more. Good fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddiem415
20,Wouldn't bother,"Went down after years of seeing muscle beach etc through magazines and from TV. Big disappointment due to the amount of homeless people hanging around begging, checking you out and people hassling you offering music, weed or anything else is going on.Venice Beach was the first time I have seen my wife feel uncomfortable and not want to be in a location ever.If you do go, make sure you don't take valuables or make them obvious..... just be bland with no labels from Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/48damianc
40,So much to see!,It's great to just get a drink in a cafe along the beach and watch all the different type of people going past. Fascinating! It can get a little crowded though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessFi88
10,Dirty & Crowded Boardwalk,"Along the boardwalk there is a lot of cheap clothing, hats and sunglasses, tacky t-shirts, and trinkets from street vendors. Street performers (some are really cool acts - others are just beggars). A lot of homeless people and their pets. It gets really crowded on hot sunny days.Muscle Beach can be fun place to watch people working out and showing off. Ironically in the midst of all this, there are some hot new restaurants opening in the vicinity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curious_tee
40,Edgy beach,"Its a nice beach, very edgy and different from santa monica. We took our bikes so didn't walk through but there are lots of shops and stalls with graffiti so lots of picture opportunities. There is also a skateboarding rink which is really cool to watch! We felt safe, just stick together if anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fauzym2016
40,ok,we walked to here from pier not as good as i remember from last visit but if not been worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d123265
10,Not nice at all,"I have read about Venice Beach and seen it on TV and in films. It was then a mst do for me on our trip to Southern California.We parked at the Santa Monica pier early-ish on a Sunday morning and wandered down, stopping for coffee on the way. Very pleasant.We arrived at the main strip on he beach that is Venice Beach.Nasty. Nasty. Nasty.Dirty.People asleep on the street/path. People clearly under the influence of drugs and drink. People asking for money in a very aggressive manner, trying to sell you drugs, pirate cd's and ""art"".The whole place stunk of cannabis / marijuana and the unwashed. The only police to be seen were several hundred yards away, driving up and down the beach in shiny trucks.A crushing disappointment and a place to be avoided, I would imagine it's pretty dangerous after dark. Really, really horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simono440
40,Hipe !!!,"Another beach and boardwalk. Local street vendors to do some shopping. Warning if you decide to walk in the later hours of the afternoon, take a cover-up or sweater. It does get cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929lissettr
30,so many special people gathered in one place,This is a crazy Place.Many homeless People are trying to make a living by performing different acts.Y.ou can smell the marijuna smoke many PlacesBut you know it has lots its authencity when the same t shirts and same gift wear is displayed in 4 shops along the street.nice view and drinks from the ERWIN hotel roof terrace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T0mmF
20,"Disappointing, dirty and stinks of weed.","Actual beach is ok, but there are lots of buskers and scabby looking people selling mostly junk from makeshift stalls on the footpath.Lots of smoking accessory shops (bongs, pipes etc) and the smell of marijuana is very thick in the air.Alot of the buildings appear quite rundown and some of the shops/vendors seem very dodgy.A few guys also try the 'this is your free cd' scam on tourists, just like New York.Google it.There are also lots of homeless people sleeping around the place in middle of the day.Tick it off the bucket list if you must, but dont get excited, which is a shame because one street back from the beach, Main Street is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorGodzilla
20,Home of the homeless,"I had a totally different picture of Venice Beach in mind. I was thinking of I nice beach promenade and beautiful bodies being worked out at the muscle beach. Unfortunately the beach is taken by homeless people. They are more or less everywhere. For them it's a good choice because the public toilet and shower system is good there.The shops along the promenade sell all kind of cheap crap or pot smoking accessories.Summarizing, this is not the place to be . Santa Monica beach is much better and I recommend you to go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWHAM
30,You have to see it to believe it,"I can totally understand why people would be fascinated by Venice beach but if you don't like crowds or weird people then I wouldn't recommend it. I personally did not like it here at all - it's dirty, smelly and full of very strange people. Having said that, if you want an unique experience and you are up for it then you might just have a different opinion to mine.Behind Venice Beach there are some cool streets with lovely houses and shopping strips - that is definitely worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kgreenwood
20,over rated,"2nd visit...and still not seeing what the hype is about (last time was a weekend so it was a little better). The shops are full of expensive and tacky souvenirs, the street art is a bit tired. The whole area gives the impression that it's passed its heyday - so many other interesting and enjoyable beach areas to visit in the LA area. The area was full of homeless people... lots of tents on the edge of the beach - signs posted everywhere giving them warning of a ""street clean up"" in the next few days.... sure it wouldn't take long for the homeless to migrate back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5inatent
30,Nice Beach - not so nice attractions,Venice beach was okay - run down and muscle beach was a disappointment- full of flimsy shack like tee shirt places,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackTest
40,interesting place!,"my husband and I spent a week in Marina del Rey and took a walk on the Venice beach boardwalk everyday, 5 to 8 miles. The weather was fantastic and it was fun to people watch. I really see all kinds of people. There are several place on the way where you can stop by and have a drink or a bite to eat while watching people go by and listening to music. you can also spend some time watching people exercise at muscle beach (most in great shape and clearly enjoying showing off!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabperfa
40,A must for LA,"It's dirty, it smells, it's strange, it's a time warp; but it's a must see for LA - if you don't see it, you didn't come to LA. Spend an afternoon and watch the people walk by or perform!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrilliantImage
40,The real thing,"We had a fantastic day at the #1 beach! Sleep, work out, surf or what ever you want - it is there! this is a must-experience. I would suggest to bring your running shoes and just go ""with the flow"" to Santa Monica beach. You will see so many characters that you are loaded for some time - GREAT.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jorgen_fra_Horgen
10,Roadtrip,"We had been travelling most of the day and wanting to park up for the night. Managed to drive straight into a parking space near the skateboarding park. Just in time for the famous sunset. Plenty of people out good atmosphere. The sunset was beautiful. But as the sunset ended and darkness fell the place changed completely. It was like a scene from the Living Dead. Police lights and sirens started, helicopter searchlights on the beach. The drug culture of the area came alive. The homeless was also very sad to see. Not a very family friendly environment. We forced ourselves to stay for half a hour then had to go.Very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steviehillhead
20,Not so cool....,"We have visited on noon Saturday, and were a bit disappointed of this place... Not mandatory if you do not have too much time in LA...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adibrand

50,Bike Ride along Venice Beach,Reasonably priced bike rentals. Bike paths well marked and maintained. able to cruise down by the Boardwalk all the way to Santa Monica Pier without too much effort. The homes along the path were diverse in styles and interesting to see. The beaches are meticulously groomed and the views fantastic. Would this activity for any age.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gordzo57
40,"Mad, interesting and tacky","We enjoyed our visit and the beach is good quality and the water seemed clean so for a day on the beach it's good. The canal walk is lovely. Park a few blocks back to get free parking. This is also where u get some good eating places whereas the shops and eating places on the beach front are a bit tacky. There are many different and interesting people, street action that add spice to the visit. A good day for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Horracks
30,2nd visit - still nothing special,"Although a must see for any tourist to LA - Venice Beach left me feeling like it had its hay-day back 1994. My second visit - last time was winter so thought I'd give the place the benefit of the doubt. But wandering down on a beautiful summer day - it just felt.... lacking. There's some great art, painted houses but that's about it. I was expecting some great people watching, but it was just a wander along a beachfront.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kater946

50,Interesting crowds,"This place was very neat and a lot to see. It was also trashy and a lot of interesting things to see. The skate park, muscle beach, volleyball courts a lot to do and there are shops and food. So there is also people geeked up and high walking around the public restrooms is where you find a lot of them and the bathrooms are disgusting The beach is awesome. A lot of activity and they have a kid park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64joshuah
10,America's dirty secret in Plain sight :(,"I wanted to cry when I arrived-human tragedy on full display.For those of you new to America you will be shocked at the vast numbers of homeless mentally unwell men/woman/children/veterans just lying around every street corner from beverly hills to the upper east side---the collateral damage of capitalism to maintain the 1%.The beach is beautiful-wide, soft sand, stunning sunset, crashing waves... makes you contemplate life. And then .....you are reminded of profound human suffering.Venice beach is home to hundreds of dirty mentally unwell homeless men and their plastic filled shopping trollies, pimps, drug dealers and prostitutes. There is smell of urine, faeces, weed, fried food and dirt in the air. The shops looks like charity shops selling $1 merchandise and weed. There are big anabolic sweaty men on muscle beach which is actually tiny and the gym is the size of a small basketball court.Imagine old and young vulnerable homeless men-unwashed, unshaven, smelly, talking to themselves, wearing tattered clothes pushing around shopping trolleys with all their belongings-reaching into bins bear-handed to find food and old recyclable material. I couldn't believe my eyes is this America? I started crying and could not enjoy the beach. Amongst this spectacle were rich white women doing yoga or some new pseudo fad -like what was going on is normal. What has this world coming to?!Woman do NOT go here on your own and definitely not at night. Please DONT take children here-dont say you weren't warned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nolaughingmatter

50,Best muscle beach in America,"Best place for people watching. There are all kinds of weird people and events along the shore. I discover a Swiss restaurant here serving my favorite dish, Raclette, a molten swiss cheese plate eaten with boiled potatoes. Nearby you can find canals similar to the one in Venice, Italy. I like to ride the bike from Venice beach to Santa Monica beach and stop by a restaurant to enjoy a draft beer or eat lunch. The bike lane stretches for miles (~30 miles) from Redondo beach in the south and way past Santa Monica to the north. Summer is the best time here when the water is warm and the air is cool. Do not miss this place if you happen to be in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken-from-Kalifornia
40,Love it or hate it!!,Venice Beach is a great stop off whilst visiting other nearby locations. Walk along the beach front shops and take in the street entertainment. It's a fun place to people watch but probably wouldn't spend more than a morning or afternoon there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mummerduck
50,First time at Venice -- Great experience,"I've been to LA numerous times but never had enough time to visit Venice.

50,PEOPLE WATCHING CAPITOL OF THE WORLD,"One hasn't lived until walking the pathways of Venice beach and enjoying the sights. The diverse nature of the people make this a huge hit. Plan to spend some time, sit down and enjoy the many buskers and 'interesting' folks meandering around. A must see is also the beach gym. Always good for a laugh watching the tourists who drop in, wearing the pants and shirts and pumping iron. What a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho

Be-careful some vendors can be quite rude. Also watch out for pick pocket theives.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymesp2016
30,Interesting,"Was there on a girls trip. Listen, if you like people watching this is the spot for you! Lots of street performers, artists, and the unusual. It's not family friendly due to all of the marijuana you smell but it's fun and if you stay for the sunset it's beautiful. It can get very crowded on the weekends my recommendation would be to go during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HopeZ_13

50,Great place for people watching,"This is just a fun place to walk around. Plenty of things to see or do. From muscle beach, to the skate area and all the fun shops. Of course you are at the ocean, so there is that too and plenty of sand. I like that the sidewalks are separate for walkers and bikers, so much easier. It's a long walk to completely walk the entire boardwalk, if your not used to walking, so be sure and stop along the way, just to people watch, so much fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvgrumpy

It's a bit out there and mad.But it's good fun and a good place to see. Loads to see and do, mainly people watching.Muscle beach is good to see and there is a skate park that's good to watch.Worth a visit for something interesting to do or just to chill on a gorgeous beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mightyhorns

50,"Beautiful, creative space with eccentric individuals",Love walking the boardwalk at Venice Beach. The gym area is fun and the people watching is top notch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ascolovesla
20,Sadly Run Down,"The boardwalk along Venice Beach is sadly run down.... It had a few touristy shops but to be honest we didn't hang around long enough because of the high number of youth gathered busking (very forceful in trying to get our money) and a couple of very drunk older men.We simply grabbed icecreams and headed down to the waters edge. The beach itself was beautiful, no rubbish or anything and was spectacular on the beautiful sunny day we visited.Our kids swam and we enjoyed the sunshine. Just a shame the retail area does not do anything but drive tourists away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307JodieS
50,Interesting,Pretty laid back atmosphere. The skateboard park had a lot of people showing their skills. The artwork are was impressive. A couple of people flexing their muscles - apparently go later in the afternoon if you want to watch the muscles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenmZ7529IR
40,Amazing place,"Visited this wonderful place again after 9 years. It does not appear to have changed. It is a good place to people watch, there are always some interesting characters around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KHR62
40,A different world,Parking at the beach is reasonably cheap being $5-$10 a day. There are board walks you can walk along with shops along the beach for your novelty and souvenirs. There are lots of activities happening along the beach you can just stay here all day and be amused.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMonty88
30,Interesting!!,"Lots of souvenir and tshirt shops. Very interesting to walk the strip and people watch. So much to see and do!!! Interesting artisan and vendor area. On side of beach areas are marked and free for artists, musicians etc. Well policed. Skateboard arena....great to watch the range of boarders and their talent. Muscle beach gym in area.......old and rusting equipment probably due to the salt water from the ocean. Worth a visit..........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goaliemother
40,Worth a detour,This is an interesting area with a vibe that is quite different from the rest of 'tourist' LA. There are lots of small shops and cafes along the seafront and loads of very interesting characters!There are some lovely street theatre shows - the one we saw was great fun. Expect to pay for it though!Parking on the local streets is not easy to find - expect to cruise around looking and maybe a 15 minute walk in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR-Greenwich
50,Totally Nuts!,"Wow, what a place! Colourful, characterful, crazy, loads of fun. Be sure to include this place in your LA plans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrispyBing
30,Iconic Building Paintings,Definitely worth a visit to Venice and Muscle Beach if in Santa Monica just a short walk or drive away. Not a great deal to see but as the place where Arnie grew those muscles for The Terminator its iconic. If you walk round the back streets you will see a lot of poverty but there are some interesting painted murals on sides of houses depicting Arnie and James Dean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrackingJohn
50,Very relaxed and lots to do,The beachfront is beautiful. And also great to head off the beach to Abbott Kinney Boulevard for some great food and wine as well as some shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophie4059
30,Not as amazing as I expected,"Firstly, don't park away from the beach unless the beachside car parks are full as you will be charged about $20 for 4 hours or $30 all day when by the beach is $5 all day.Try not to be put off by the high amount of homeless people camping out along the edges of the beach - they seemed harmless enough but it was heart breaking to see.There are lots of arts and craft stalls and performers but one, who was perfectly capable of standing and running about, juggling, playing the piano standing up, etc, suddenly sat in a wheelchair an went off down the beach. We didn't want to judge as he could have had an ailment that wasn't obvious but after over hearing several other people, it seems he was not disabled at all and was begging off the back of being disabled further down so just be cautious of who you give your money to.We watched some surfers then some skateboarders and had a look at some art on the walls but I think perhaps it is better to visit at night as it just didn't do it for us. We had a look at muscle beach and the body builders and paddled in the water but after two hours, we were bored. Again, we may just have visited at the wrong time and didn't get a chance to go back so can't comment any more on that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolesheehan
30,"Tacky, tacky, tacky but quite interesting!","Depends what you want. Strange people, strange shops/stalls but lots of live action with youngsters particularly excelling at street dancing and skateboarding. Still we're in our 60s and would have loved it back in the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aintree9
40,Surprisingly pleseant,"I have visited LA before and hated it, but I stayed at Venice Beach this time and actually enjoyed it. The people there (that I interacted with anyway) were chill and I didn't run into many pretentious fart sniffers that seem to populate coastal CA. But, that's just like, my opinion, man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldun5
50,Alternate and amazing,"Myself and 3 friends stayed in a property about 15 min drive away. We visited Venice beach quite a few times. It's amazing. So alternate and interesting.Food: The food choices are decent. I recommend the restaurant on the promenade. Forgot the name, but I believe it begun with an 'S'. Red canopy.Street performers: Interesting. But good interesting. They don't hassle you for money. If you want to film them or take pictures, then appreciate them by giving a few bucks. Sometimes guys walk up to you to give your their CD. Just say no thanks, and they say ""no problem, have a great day"".Shops: Lots of shops. A little pricey for clothing but this is a tourist area and by the beach... What do you expect?Beach: Not windy, unlike Santa Monica Beach. Great for surfing (which we attempted). Cheap rental places on the promenade. Great sand. Long stretch of beach. AMAZING sunsets. Live bands. This is also where you find the famous Muscle Beach, which is located at the end of the promenade.Great place. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazJay5
40,You never know what you'll experience!,"Every day, is a unique day when visiting Venice Beach. There is always something exciting going on. There is always a new adventure to embark on. Always something different to see. And, a continuous flow of inspiration and energy.Highly recommend it.. For any occasion. Because, it's not what 'You think of it.. It's what you make of it.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieVance

40,Cruise the beach area,"This is a must see for out-of-town couples. But, not necessarily a must stop. We really enjoyed driving around looking at all of the great street art, little places, and the different architecture. We were fortunate to be there early on a Saturday morning. Fun to see he beach community wake up! Next time we will stop for coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MIkeW416

10,Trashy,"I grew up spending a lot of time in the South Bay area, but it had been close to 20 years since I had been to Venice I knew what to expect, but still, I was a little grossed out by the smell of urine, the carnival atmosphere and people hunting us down on the strand to give us samples of their products. We went during a weekday, which I realize is not nearly what you'll get on a weekend. If you want a real freak show, then a weekend visit is a must, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockshaun

Great way of getting s feel of CALI coastline ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayseavci
40,Camden Town with a beach,"I've recently visited Venice Beach and can't complain or say that it didn't live up to the reputation that has always preceeded it. Venice is weird and wonderful place, an eclectic mish-mash of bohemian life that's all colorfully spaced out in its little world. It's a place where there is something for everyone to take in and enjoy. Granted, it has its fair share of homelessness, but that aside we found it to be a must - see visit if you're staying in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8399QYmarting
40,promise to a lost friend,"this was a very interesting place to visit & a promise I'd made to a lost friend I had to keep, unfortunately we got ripped off buying some t shirts (need to avoid the place that has plain t shirts & they iron on designs thats for sure) but that didnt spoil our time there which was lucky, its definately a place you must see just watch out for this T Shirt place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8574EHlees
40,An Escape from the City of Angels,"Venice and Malibu provide beautiful views and warmer waters. It is always wonderful to drive out of Los Angeles and enjoy the Sun, Sand, Beach and views. There are some spots that are less populated; giving you the sense of being far away yet so close to restaurants, gas stations and the beautiful Ghetty Villa Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ncobi
50,A must for visitors,"We always bring out of town visitors to Venice Beach Boardwalk. Always aim for the weekends, as that's when most of the artisans (some are, some aren't) have their wares set up. Try to aim for noon or later, as not all of them are set up before then. We always have something memorable to see or experience when we 'do the boardwalk'. Check out the skatepark and if you make it all the way from Rose Ave to Muscle Beach, you've done well! Buy yourself some little momento. I live in Los Angeles and we always find something that is a 'must have'. Even if it's a rope anklet....have fun. Keep your eyes open...you never know what you'll see :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chachairis
50,Beautiful,"The beach is beautiful and whilst popular it is so large and not crowded.The area has been gentrified in the last 20 years or so but still oozes local culture.Do get someone to explain the fascination history dating from 1905 and the way the place developed from Venice of America and the lovely canals, six of which still exist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuncanP_12
40,One big circus,"The name Venice came from the Italian city because, similarly, this has canals that line the back of the streets which was quite a sight. Didn't know that. Heard so much about this place from long ago since it's quite famous for its beach but had no idea about the canals. Finally had a chance to see it firsthand and it was quite an interesting experience. The place is very touristy which brings in crowds from different nationalities. Adding to that are the variety of street performers, peddlers, vagrants, artists, bikers, runners, skaters, body builders, surfers, and you have one big amazing circus! It's definitely a haven for people watchers but not for the faint of heart. Prepare to be culture shocked. Personally, I am not into big crowds and touristy places but this one I enjoyed. You can actually spend a whole day here without being bored. There would always be something to do, see, eat and drink. You will never run out of choices. This is a must see especially for first timers in LA. I wouldn't mind going back here next time I'm in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cal_Mariko
40,Pretty and huge,Lot of fun during the day but without animation at night.And lot of homeless all day on the streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872lu_st
30,Walk on the beach.,"Venice Beach is something to be seen at least once. You will see and smell weed everywhere, people wearing a lot less, street vendors selling everything. Homeless as far as the eyes can see. Don't let this be overwhelming, that is what Venice is all about. The beach is very nice. My wife and I rented a bike for two, after learning to ride it, we peddled north to Santa Monica Pier and back. Very nice bike path. Along the way you will go by Muscle Beach, skate park and other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1622ZAgregs
10,Freak show,"The actual beech at Venice is beautiful but that's about all that's nice , the walkway with shops and restaurants is tacky and like LA in the whole full of weirdos and the smell of dope , my wife and I joked it was like a zombie movie when these freaks (there is an actual freak show) came stammering down the street. The skateboarders were great but muscle beach was a throwback to the 70s with the equipment rusty and old . Won't be back .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparkyott1
30,Seen better days,Great sandy beach and lifeguard on duty so safe to swim. However Venice Beach is a bit down at heel and all the seafront shops seems to sell the same merchandise. Take time to head away from the sea and the tranquil canals are unexpected and very peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB2714
40,Must see,"Must see, very popular tourist beach. We did the typical touristy thing and hired bikes, cycled along to Santa Monica beach and saw Muscle beach on the way along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133RobB133
30,Interesting,"This is a must stop if you are in the area. Walk the pier, you will see many characters and strange things. It's a busy place , so be careful, but it's safe, at least during daylight. Many restaurants and bars along the way. Nothing stood out as a place to stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Budmanri
20,Unusual,"While some of Venice beach is nice and it is great for skateboarders and body-builders, we didn't love it. It was dirty and full of people trying to sell us stuff. Not our favourite place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LateBloomer69
10,Hated it,"We were accosted here by someone shoving my companion for no reason (from the back). Also, businesses will not let you use the bathroom even if you buy something (Subway, and there were lots of signs to this fact). We went around 10 am on a weekday. Felt unsafe and was in fact, not safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vitarachel

40,Nice beach in LA,We came here a few times while visiting LA. Fun area with big crowd with many things to do. Quite a few food choices to be had there too. Not a bad place to relax on a hot day in SoCal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quangfremont
20,"Weird, Dirty & Hot","After you arrive at Venice Beach and you check out the skateboarders... there's really not much else to do.There's a constant stench of hobos, low variety on the food front and everything looked very dated and dirty.The best part of our visit was stumbling across the Venice canals on the way back to our car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikailao
50,Canals and the Beach Walk,"Venice Beach is really unique. Walking the canals after finding parking is absolutely amazing. Taking in the cute little houses and the amazing people is just part of the fun. After venturing through the canals you can then walk right over to the beach. It was clean, the view was great, the walk was nice. After visiting the beach we decided to check out some local restaurants, we first attempted to go to Gjilanos which was very busy secondary to its modern take on Italian food and it's increasing popularity. We instead ventured to a small local Italian restaurant called Centanni Trattoria. To our great delight the food was spot on, the wine selection was fabulous, and the staff was very friendly and helpful with menu selections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29baileym
30,Nice for a walk from SMA,You know it from TV so must walk here and its a nice stroll by the beach from SMA. Otherwise there is quite a few people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HexiH
50,Eclectic!,"We loved walking Venice beach, even with a 4 month old baby in a stroller. There is an eclectic group of people walking around Venice Beach. It seems that anything goes. It was crowded but clean and pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353betsya
10,Boh-Ho Quarter! Oh no!!,What a terrible place. Full of tacky shops and homeless people who seem to have created little enclaves for themselves on the Boardwalk. Of course there is a huge homeless problem in California but we didn't expect to see it so full on in Venice Beach. That's not what we read in the guide books. If you are expecting Boh-Ho chic and a funky vibe this is not the place to find it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretm211
40,Interesting,Once in a life time place to visit. Every interesting people and live shows. World class basketball and the famous world gym,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892craigf
20,SCARY!!!!,"I went because its a tourist thing and to look at 'muscle beach' ...bascially that is just a small outside gym at the beginning of the promenade...the beach itself is actually nice, but the area was horrific!!!! walking along the promenade I felt high on cannabis as thats all i could smell ( there is a 'green' pharmacy amongst all the other shops that sell lots of similar tat) and there were multiple drug users and homeless people either camped out in a fug of smoke and intoxication, or wandering about haphazardly talking to themselves, with the occasional tirade of abuse to the public, or maybe even totally out of it face down on the beach. I will never go back.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonQ144
50,A week in Venice Beach,"We had not been there in 30 years. Rented a house 2 blocks from the beach for a week. Not much had changed. Funky, fun, fantastic. First time there for our teenage son-he absolutely loved it. Beach is beautiful, the boardwalk is fun, and Venice is centrally located to both the North and South beaches around LA. Easy drives to Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Sony Studio, etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wilburman
40,Good beach,"Is amazing what we can find in Venice Beach, we have a gym at open air, side to side to the beach. The local shopping is very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47tiagot
50,A must in LA,"Unbelievable on the weekend! Nice beach, crazy people an so much more to see. From the muscle beach to the basketball courts it continues watching so many different people and of cause the actress doing funny crazy things. Relax in between at the side and eat a pizza or a hot dog. You can enjoy that area for hours without getting bored. Rent a bike or walk just a mile to the Santa Monica peer. If it is to hot, just jump in to the ocean. Lovely place in LA !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2365KMpatrickk
40,What the ..,"A simply beautiful stretch of pale golden sand and sparkling water. However, the public washroom facilities were the worst I have seen in the modern world. Interesting people watching and an eye opener with ""medical marjuana"" booths and tattoo parlours outstripping most other shops. Some seedy looking eateries but if this is the vibe you want don't miss it. As far as the beach goes it is quite stunning. Certainly a young persons place if you want to skate board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksprat647
50,A must see area in LA,Bring the family and prepare to walk and watch. From the gigantic sandy beach to the skateboard park to muscle beach this is the place to see and be seen!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanphoto
40,Good Vibe,"An enjoyable 2-3 hours walking along the boardwalk mixing with locals and tourists at muscle beach, watching the skaters, browsing the shops. More about soaking in the atmosphere than either shopping or beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9833OLpeterm
40,Beautiful beach with lots of activity,"Venice Beach is a nice quieter Beach than some of the others, such as Santa Monica beach and Manhattan Beach. Of course you can't go to Venice Beach without visiting Muscle Beach and seeing all of the vendors selling everything from Cannabis edibles to their homemade artistic creations.Venice Beach offers a nice variety of food and shopping options. Again, parking is a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724lauriew
40,Lots of characters,"We took the day to hang out on Venice Beach. There's lots to see and the beach is great. I did feel a bit unsafe at parts though. We were told that if you took a photo of a street performer or those working out at Muscle Beach but didn't tip them they might get aggressive and angry so I was a bit afraid to take a scene photo.There were some parts that were inappropriate for our 4 y/o even during the day. I wouldn't suggest walking through Venice Beach at night. Even my 6'5"" husband felt uncomfortable.Great local coffee shops and restaurants on the strip although be prepared for tourist prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107jennad
20,Skip it,Venice is not about the sand and surf. I don't think Venice knows what anything really is. It is lovely on the shore but the boardwalk is mess with homeless and street thugs selling crap. This is not a place to bring a young family. It is a great place to have a picnic on the shore though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9503BKmichaeld
40,"Amazing Beach, Not so Amazing Shops","Venice Beach was an amazing beach. The sand stretched far and wide, and there were plenty of activities to do surrounding it, e.g. Hiring a bike to take on the boardwalk, beach volleyball, etc. Unfortunately, the local shops are a bit of a bust, and detracts to the beauty of the surrounding environment. Definitely an experience walking along the shop areas, but personally not my type of beach scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8656MPsamuelm
20,Beware of the Aroma,"We stopped here so the kids could see the area. We had a nice afternoon of sand & water play, people watching and biking. Our teens enjoyed all of the activities, sights and sounds. Unfortunately, as the day wore on we began to detect a certain odor in the air, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was until I saw some skateboarders light up right behind me while we were watching the action in the skate park. By then it was around 5pm, so we decided to move on to avoid the ""aroma"". Alas, it was in vain because the longer we stayed at Venice Beach, the more people we passed who were lighting up. Our guess is that it's an evening pastime there. Especially since all the cops passing through seemed to ignore it. So, be careful and beware of the early evening cannabis festival if you don't plan on unintentionally giving your kids a contact high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texangal39
40,Venice Beach is unique,"OK Venice Beach doesn't appeal to everyone, it's true to say that if you go by appearances there could be some people you might see that could place your imagination on over drive. But the characters you see along with the vivid colours, the creativity of the street artists, the sounds, music, people working out, playing vollyball, skate boarding and just 'people' watching, this is all part of the magical LA experience.Like all destinations around the world, just be sensible with your possessions and use common sense. Venice Beach is an LA experience offering a colourful unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterpZ9093OC
40,KMA goes to Muscle Beach,"I have been to Venice Beach before, but it was years ago. This time the board walk is covered in concrete but the shops remain pretty much the same. This time I noticed the artistic homeless population that sells their art there now. Most of the art shows quite a bit of talent. This appears to be true tourist attraction, but the men and women muscles on the beach is real. WOW! I guess with the consistency of the weather, you can enjoy yourself there just people watching. Take the walk from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier and back, it is a bit of a hike, but you will praise yourself for the exercise effort. You can rent bikes and roller blades, skates but walking is better and you can stop along the way to have a sip or two at a couple of cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenA126
40,LA beach vibe,"Went surfing at Venice beach, the waves were good for beginners. The beach was packed! I saw a lot friends hanging out, not so many families. There is a boardwalk with cool touristy shops and stuff but as a whole the place was seedy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daswitty
40,"Vast Array of Sights, Sounds, Smells and Feelings!","If you want to have all of your senses engaged at once, visit Venice Beach! There is so much to see, hear, taste, smell and feel! There is a din of liveliness all around. More than the mind can imagine. There are vendors, acrobats, and entertainment galore. There are strange happenings all around as well. My senses were definitely on overload. It was one remarkable experience. Come visit and take in the experience of acquiring a lifetime memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657deirdrer

40,Fun and More Fun,"It was a great day. Enjoyed the day at the beach stopped at muscle beach bike rentals, big orange place you can't miss it,right across from the paddleball courts in muscle Beach. Honestly they had the best rates and you got for you you're what you paid was well worth it. Great crew. Did the bikes all the way down to Santa Monica pier, enjoy the international flag display, stopped at the shops, just a beautiful day you got to do it.Stayed at the Marriott in Marina Del Ray, if your military use the military discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcr1776

50,A Relaxing Stroll in the LA Sun,"Venice Beach is a must do on any trip to L.A. Just casually stroll along in the sun, with miles of sandy beaches ahead of you. It's a great place to people watch and look at local stalls and street art. There is such a relaxed vibe here and a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of other areas of LA. We walked from Venice to Santa Monica Boulevard, passing Muscle Beach just taking in the sights after a long flight from London. This should be on everybody's bucket list for LA rather than the walk of fame etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0simonc
40,Interesting place to visit for the day. Spend the night elsewere.,"Venice is a very cool, quirky beach. With the street performers, boardwalk, pier, muscle beach, skate park, and clear water, it is definitely a must-see California beach. However, don't spend the night. There is an army of homeless people who spend the night right outside some of the hotels. They didn't bother anyone when we were there, but it may be a little unnerving for some people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114sama
50,Nice place,What an awesome place !The people here are so open minded and peaceful. You can watch for hours the skakeboarder who are doing crazy things in the famous skate park or just sit in the sand with your friend or rent a skate or a bike to ride along the beach.You are 45 minutes away from Santa Monica and its famous pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elodiew408
20,Dissapointing smell of drugs and generally unclean,Very dissapointed by the famous LA Attraction. The smell of weed was extremely strong. The pieces of art on display were amazing but sellers pushy and wont let you take pictures.best part of this area is the pathway for cycling/ or other wheeled transport. Completely different atmosphere here. Good to see but I recommend Santa Monica beach/Pier way more enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fee109
40,Great location,The beach is a fun environment loads to watch an be entertained by shops an food stalls are fun an muscle beach was good to see had a nice day visit there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68neridab

50,Wanna Get Away and See Interesting People?,"I've discovered that you don't have to be a tourist to enjoy Venice. This place has something for everyone. If you're interested in body building...you can lift weights while passersby gaze at you...or if you want to skate-there's a trail for your safety or those you have the potential of running into (smile). Of course there's something for the bicyclist who trains and/or rides daily and for those who haven't been on a bike in years (such as was my case). Venice Beach is along the same shoreline as that of Santa Monica and Malibu. So miles and miles of sandy beaches will be at your leisure. There is parking within the beach...with costs being no more than $8.00 during the week; but can escalate to $20.00 during the weekend and special events. The sites are immaculate and the people, as strange or shall I say interesting as you will find them to be, will undoubtedly engage you in hours of entertainment. And as far as the presence of police, security and the like; you need not worry. they patrol the areas like clockwork. This, of course, is very welcoming when visiting Venice Beach. Relax...have fun...and remember...life is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TbSott
40,Relaxing Beach in LA,"Getting to Venice Beach can be a bit tricky, in that you should expect a lot of traffic and parking can be slim/expensive. We parked in the lot at the Venice Fishing Pier. It was pricey ($18 on a Saturday), but it was good for the whole day and we were right on the beach.There is plenty of room for everyone to stretch out and it was quieter than I was expecting it to be. There are places to rent bicycles to go along the path. Muscle Beach is a short ride away and there's plenty of people watching to do there.We would definitely come back here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MS054
50,Loveeeeed the vibe!,"Vibrant and cheerful Venice Beach was one of my favourite stops while visiting for my first time in LA.If you enjoy beaches, walking and browsing little mom and pop shops, and hanging out, Venice Beach is perfect. We were there for a few hours but I could have easily spent a whole day there.I recommend going early, especially if driving (which in LA you most likely are doing). There was free street parking in comfortable walking distance. Just read the signs very carefully. We saw lots of traffic/by law officers and they were very friendly when we double checked with them if we could park the street.We did see some 'parking lots' for $20 USD but it looked like you'd have to leave your key with them (not quite valet though) and we didn't really like that.We were advised by many people to not leave any visible belongings in the car and to be very mindful of pick pockets in that area. Honestly though, while there was a significantly more visible presence of homelessness, we were bothered by anyone. I think when you're traveling in general you've just got to be mindful of pick pockets in crowded places.Truly I adored the vibe and energy of the whole area. Super laid back. Basketball, art, shops, skateboard park to watch (really cool skaters to see in action), and lots of food stops for snacking.My only thumbs down would be the public washrooms. They were awful and creepy. Half of them were locked/out of service. The one I went to didn't lock from the inside. Lucky for me a kind, non creepy stranger guarded the door for me (and I did the same for her after). There was barely any light inside the really dirty and dingy stalls. Pretty gross to be honest.Other than that one flaw, it was a lovely morning there and I am sad we didn't get to see as much as I had hoped. I will definitely go back when I'm in LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzbreee
50,Gotta See,"Venice Beach is one of my all-time favorites. It totally Defines the beach life of Southern California in so many ways. It's the most Diversified Beach I have ever been to In My Life. From luxury beach homes and mansions 2 back houses that look like little huts, that come in an array of colors. The mood is festive and very inviting. The people are friendly and laid-back and they welcome visitors with open arms. If you want Lobster, Tacos, or just a regular old brewski from a dive bar that allow flip-flops you're in the right place. There's also plenty of live entertainment as you walk up and down a border full of local talent like skateboarders, bike riders, roller skaters, bodybuilders and regular folk like you and I. Oh yeah and don't forget all the tattoo and piercing shops!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheebah70
10,I've been coming to this beach since 2006 and every year it gets worst. It used to be my favorite beach,"Couple of years ago I would of given 5 stars now it's trashy full of the worst wannabe rappers of America that hunt you down and won't stop bugging you until you buy their CDs, and lots of homeless people and nasty bums. Used to love this place :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aarond632
10,Avoid!!,The most disgusting place I have ever visited. I've never seen so much poverty! There's loads of homeless people living along the boardwalk and its so dirty and smelly. I couldn't believe my eyes. There's also too many nutters and the place sticks of weed. I found it really sad but I've never seen anything like it in my life. I would never go here again and suggest you avoid the place. Absolute dive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shabbylaura
50,Amazing Beach,We swam in the ocean and built sand castles. Parking is reasonable and there are free showers. The beach extends for miles it's California no wonder so many people are here. Great way to spend a day or afternoon. The parking ends at 7:00 PM.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stonecoral

50,Awesome beach,"Awesome beach. More than enough room for parking and quiet. ALOT of beach for everyone. Love this beach. Pier was awesome. They have events like beach cleanup. Parking was expensive. Went Friday, paid 9$ for 8-5. Arrived at 11, left at 1. Had business to do. Went on Saturday and it was 18$, kind of ridiculous, but then it filters out the bad. Lots of eateries. ALOT of traffic. Would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosiel746

40,America at play,"Venice beach can be the hipster shops and ""pop up stores"" of Abbot Kinney Boulevard, or the sea side freak show of a two headed turtle and a sword swallower. We had a great afternoon walking through both and in between through the canal section. What a great place to see people - form young lovers, to hard pumped narcissists to brain fried hobo hustlers and everything in between.I loved it and wondering on the beach was a real delight as it is perfect for all sorts and all types",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoddyPayne

40,Quirky,"An iconic area you have to visit while in Los Angeles. It has unusual characters, street musicians selling CDs, skate boarders, surf dudes, street art as well as the famous Muscle Beach area, which posers galore, flexing their abs and other parts of their anatomy. The beach is stunning and huge. The whole area has a great vibe though despite there being many homeless some of whom appear to be ""on the edge""..... Also walk along the boardwalk towards Santa Monica Beach Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanTeddyBear
40,Nice quiet beach,"We got to our hotel late afternoon and decided to just take a walk by Venice Beach. We went in August and it was pretty chilly there, even had to wear my jacket. The water was nice & warm though. It was very quiet and not crowded at all. Just down a ways you can see Santa Monica beach and the pier, which was a lot more crowded. It's very close, probably a mile or so. We parked in a parking garage thinking there was no parking space but pull up right by the beach, there are public parking spaces. Venice beach is near a lot of cute boutiques, returaunts and shops. Nice area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saewhat9009
50,Perfect for People Watching,"We live in Phoenix, Arizona and we come out to California a few times a year and always try and visit Venice Beach at least one day. We love walking the boardwalk and watching all the people doing there thing. The skateboarders are awesome also.. Lots of shopping, people watching and quirky stuff. You can rent bikes, skates or just walk. We love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debbiea9793
50,Super,"The boardwalk is fantastic, eclectic and provides randomness all around! I love this place! So much going on, music, shops, bars and sooo many interesting people. Can't explain this place in words, you just have to experience it yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lecterit
10,Don't bother,"Never thought anywhere could make Blackpool look sophisticated. Big beach but behind a freak show, muscle beach tiny smell of expensive fried food drowned out by overwhelming smell of pot , not somewhere to take a family.Off the front, the canals where lovely, promised much delivered nothing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Woodychester1

20,An awful place a lovely beach,"This was so disappointing. I was really looking forward to visiting this famous place.This is simply an awful place. I can't understand how others have given this place such a positive view.I can only think that these people like a cross between Magaluf and Blackpool. It's a tacky, cheap (not money but look) and dirty place. It doesn't feel safe and definitely doesn't have that bohemian feel that other reviews seem to suggest.The beach is fabulous but a beach is a beach and you'll get just as God elsewhereThe numbers of homeless around the famous boardwalk makes this walk a more menacing one and extremely unpleasant.I definitely would not take kids there.I would not have this on your list of things to do on LA and appreciate I am a minority voice.There are no lovely cafe's. No lovely music or street performing as promised. Very few lovely shops. In fact very little to say for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757MartinG757

40,Interesting,"Drove here to see the legendary muscle beach. The walk here was interesting, passing a variety of people, some selling CD's others smoking interesting ""tobacco"". The gym was quiet,it was a week day, but still had the gym poser. Lots of homeless people and usual stalls/shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinrmn
50,Must be on everyone's list for Los Angeles,"Venice Beach is one of the classic tourist attractions. It is a boardwalk along the sand, wide and long. Take a leisurely stroll from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and back. Perhaps rent a bike and follow the bike path. Every type of person from homeless to rock star will find their way to Venice Beach. Favorites are Mexican outdoor cafes, Hot Dog on a Stick and cheesy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jashas2014
40,California girls in California Beach,"Iconic spot in Los Angeles, depicted in so many movies it worth to visit. You'll see some trending characters, skaters, street art and many more, also some cucus but it's all part of the ambiance. Visit the Muscle Beach gym, where Arnold used to hang out, also the skate park and walk along the boardwalk. You can rent Segway, Bikes or electric bikes too. Try the chopped fruit cup $10 and stay around to see the sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gus6
40,A perfect tourist place to spend the day,"I find that tourists like spending the day at Venice Beach, its different for them they enjoy the beautiful beach, with beautiful sunsets, many shops and restaurants lots of people walking around enjoying the local snacks and great weather, as well as funny or strange shows, there also is muscle beach where there is a great competition show of body- builders located within Venice Beach, located near Santa Monica, so bring comfortable walking shoes, a hat and a camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50marthas
40,Venice with my dogs,"I love VeniceBeach because it is so unique. It has a boardwalk where people can walk,ride bikes or roller blade. There are people dressed in all different ways; a man sprayed in gold suit and skin, guys in thongs, cowboy hats, selling art, playing music, etc. walked the boardwalk and then have lunch.You can watch guys play basketball, beach volleyball, working out at Golds Gym, playing squash and much more.The beach is nice but I never lay on it.It is a fun place to visit. Everyone should experience Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riyet
30,Only reason to cruise this boardwalk is because it's on your list,"we've lived about 60 miles from Venice Beach for some 30 yrs and had never visited. So when my wife asked me what we should do for my birthday I said, ""let's go to Venice Beach"". the muscles, the people, the tanned bodies, the sun, the lifestyle, you name it, all of those things were on our minds as we cruised up the 405. heck, the exit (90) was one of those that had never even made it onto our radar. the area where we parked (N. Venice Beach Blvd) gave us an inkling of what to expect - seedy, broken down, older buildings in serious need of some paint.okay, enough of the buildup. reached the boardwalk and headed north. we were quickly inundated with what we'd be seeing for the next half mile or so -- the typical cast of characters, the never-ending stuff (read ""junk"") for sale, just a general overall seediness of it all. the only difference between the shops on one side of the walk and the sidewalk junk for sale was the roof over the shop -- in other words, be wary of what you buy here. heck, most of it is probably made overseas. those guys using spray cans to create those instant art pieces -- don't believe it. our guess is that they haven't painted any of those creations -- they just spray stuff for show. we've seen it before in other parts of the world; it's all designed to seduce you into thinking it's a local creation.one of the things I was looking forward to the most was muscle beach, where all of those big bodies throw the big weights around. first of all, the weights are outside and for the looks of it, they've been there for a long time -- lots of rust, the seats and benches were all covered with plastic (probably to cover up the rips and tears). in a word - ick. not to mention the few guys working out weren't even body builders, just regular folks. boring! I also thought the work out area would be huge. not true, maybe 3000 sq ft.we were fortunate to be there on an overcast day. it was humid and warm, but thankfully the sun was covered. there is absolutely zero shade on the beach and on the walk. the few benches available were generally filled with people you would not want to be sitting next to if you catch my drift. so prepare to bring a lot of water. as you come to the end of the walk (where the boardwalk continues up towards Santa Monica Pier, but the shops and streetsellers end) you see a long continuous row of homeless shelters and the homeless hanging out. not a pretty sight. very sad to see how these people have to survive. we've done some traveling in Europe and have yet to see homelessness to this degree on the streets. makes you think that we should be doing something for them. oh, well, that's another subject for another day.bottom line -- if you are in LA and just have to see Venice Beach for yourself, absolutely go see it and cultivate your own opinions, just be forewarned that it is not a pretty sight. Glad we went, won't be coming back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joemontana16
30,Be careful of the scamers!,Some nice bars and restraunts along the beach. Check out the skate park. Be careful of the people selling 'CDs'....aa :/,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyj273
50,Fun Vibe,"Loved Venice beach.. The vibe was relaxed and fun.. Reminded me of the 60's and 70's flower power, free love and hippie days. Interesting art, unique shopping opportunities, good food.

40,I do like Venice Beach with,"the vibe, I haven't been down there at night for awhile, but the daytime and the evening is really great. I like the gem shops and places to eat around the beach.

30,Ok beach,This beach is not as it is hyped. There are many homeless on the board walk. The beach itself is not very clean. Overall it is ok place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyingchariot
20,But Tacky,"Really it's just pretty seedy, dirty and with cheap tourist junk for sale. It's worth a a 5-10 minute walk if you really want say you've been there to see the muscle builders and the sights. But for my money go to Santa Monica hire a bike are take a wonderful ride there give it a glance. Not for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillM232
20,Ropey,"...........trendy my *** It's a regular dump full of riff raff and weirdos. More crapola than you can shake a stick at. Keep your hand on your wallet.It's better to drive a mile to Santa Monica you're in a much nicer, cleaner, place. It's also much easier to park. There's a great play area where you can swing like a baboon til your hearts content.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbG5420YX
50,Labor day weekend at venice beach,"If youre in the los angeles area, it is a must to visit venice beach. Whether you enter and park on Washington and explore the excellent restaurants or park on venice and explore the boardwalk you will not be disappointed. This weekend, i took my wife and my energetic 5 and 8 year old. After stopping for pizza and smoothies, we walked west to the waterfront. If you walk north on the sand you will find peaceful and beautiful rocks that you can sit on, reflect on the waves and view baby lobsters. Perfect for pictures. Perfect for couples. Perfect for families. Great memories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenyattas2013
50,The REAL Quintessential LA Beach,"This place is so cool. It has tourist areas, expensive places and a beach place where the real people from LA go. Lots of art and artist on the buildings, in galleries, shops and throughout the entire place. Great little Bistros to dine and drink!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamC608
20,Not as Glam,"I was very unsure of what to expect, and didn't wouldn't particular rave about this beach, it is dirty and certainly didn't attempt to try the sea. Venice and muscle beach are combined, we got bikes from Santa Monica Pier and used the cycle track down to Maria del Ray. It is a big beach and if you fancy sunbathing make sure you use toilet before and take drinks, there are not beach bars on the beach, and public toilets are very much used by EVERYONE. The homeless live on the beaches, and obviously use those facilities when not peeing up a tree.!!!!! Muscle beach was just women and children doing handstands and yogo.. Didn't see any muscles of fit bodies. (disappointing for me), very different to the picture that is given. Tipping is a big point In California, they all want it!!!. One waiter in Marina Del Ray, followed us down the stairs asking ""why we had not left a tip""!, ""what did I do"", he asked. Thought that was rather rude, and did not go back, despite the food being rather nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAPaul1972

40,Not just a freak show...,"Sure, Venice Beach is known for its culture of oddities and ""freak show"" atmosphere but there is so much more! I found the beach itself to be far less crowded than its neighboring beaches (I'm looking at you, Santa Monica). There is definitely a lot to take in- watching the skaters, muscle beach, and art vendors galore. And if you don't mind walking a few blocks there are several great restaurants and cafés.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139kelseym
40,Surfers!,This was my first time in California and the day before I had gone to a beach in Laguna. It wasn't as clean of a beach but still a very good time for someone from Chicago who doesnt get to go to ocean beaches. It was a lot of fun to watch the surfers from the pier! I didn't realize how much I would love to watch them do their thing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2905VKjenb
40,Something for everyone,"There's lots of different reasons to come to Venice beach. If you want to buy souvenirs there's plenty of shops, if you want to workout there's the famous muscle beach, if you want to skate there's a popular skatepark, if you want to paint graffiti art you can even pain the trees, anyone for basketball? Plenty of courts, want to be hassled to buy things you don't want? There's guys for that too, homeless and need a sleep? This is the place!

30,Unique but sleazy,I guess its a must do. but its a really sleazey walk compared to santa monica proper. lots of 70's hippies there and homeless and other people who seem a bit out of it. but i guess its unique and so worth walking through it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel
20,See it once and that is enough,"Drove to Venice Beach from LAX on an afternoon to catch the sunset. Parked along the street with meter as the garage charges high rates. Walked towards the beach and immediately see plenty of souvenir shops, restaurants, bars. Plenty of people and doing skateboarding, biking, roller blades, walking with dogs... Some shady characters. There were street performers. Just stayed a few minutes to catch the sunset and then drove to the canals just adjacent to the main street. These are man-made canals and a quick stop over one of the little bridges to take photo of the canal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Junix19

50,What a great mixture of people and view,"Wow. Venice beach is amazing. The amount of culture crammed into one place... can't be beat.We enjoyed a walk through the area and ended at the Venice beach Freak Show area. The view was fantastic as the sun was setting. Beautiful houses, great scenery... Our entire group really enjoyed it. I can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/btbolt

This is a seedy place and shockingly did not live upto the image you have from the movies!Muscle beach was a major disappointment this iconic place is run down and the equipment is in tatters,Our tour guide in LA had warned us about going and insisted if we did go not to go at night, I thought he was exaggerating but he was spot on as during no the day was bad enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpH4472TF

40,Visiting friends and family,Been coming here for years as a fun place to people watch. A must place to visit when in LA. Lots of shops and good walks. The place does live in the past and isn't the same as 20+ years ago but you still get that feeling of the past which is nice as i have fond memories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1964MH

20,"Depressing, sad and frustrating","Stayed near the Santa Monica pier, walked to Venice Beach. Was quite surprised over the difference. So many people dealing drugs, selling junk or just being in need of care and support. This area is not ""great for people watching"" or ""fun"" or ""bohemian"". It's just sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardNLN
30,Venice Beach,"Crowded, usual shops attractions.Loads of buskers,street traders,street bands, wannabe hippy street performers etc etc.Anti Climax really and a bit past its sell by date i felt.I got the impression that the area is living on its past hippy era.I also heard a couple of people say that they would not go there after dark !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffd420
40,Entertaining,Fun to walk along the pedestrian walk way looking at the shops and people. Food selection is so so on the walk way but do try to make it to Joni Maroni Sausage Kingdom for the best dog ever. It's near the famous muscle beach facility. For a great off the beach break one block from the walkway there is always James Beach. Very laid back refined dining and refreshing full bar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomy857
40,canals in the back streets,Venice beach is part of the beach front that runs from Marina Del Rey too Santa Monica pier.In the back street of the Venice beach area you will find nice quant little houses actually on the canals that give Venice beach it's name.Walk over the bridge over the canals and explore the area.The Venice beach area has a big homeless people problem and you can see the homeless people and there camps all along the beach front. They sleep all the way along the sea front and in all the street corners that lead to the beach.Sea side shops are very basic cheap shops and tattoo and cannabis shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nippys
50,Weirdos every where,If you want to see a bunch of strange things then go here. After an hour of walking around I was ready to go. I had a slice of pizza and a frozen lemonade. The pizza was good...lemonade fair. Lots of art that wasn't good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StoreOwnerTeacher
40,Buzzing,"Not everyone would like it here, buzzing crazy busy place with all sorts of people but lots going on. Certainly worth a visit and look around the canals - shame there are so few these days but very nice. We liked the urban feel of the place without the polish of other places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThePowerNapper
40,Venice Beach,We spent a few days in Venice Beach in order to discover L.A. The city of Angels in itself is a bit too largely spread for our taste so Venice Beach gave us even more the feeling of a small town that is over seeable. Great walks on the beach and perfect for a bike ride even all the way up to Santa Monica all along the beach.Abbot Kinney Bd is a must see with all its shops and restaurants. We would definitely go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310manud
40,Different,"Spent a few hours here just wandering around and found it to be a bit different to what I was expecting. What with the surfers and the skaters and the street sellers and the muscle men, a very diverse place. Anywhere that has a couple of special smoke houses on the beach front will always be a bit different. Still really enjoyed it though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8678QEmarkb
20,Close to Lax,We went there to find a beach near Lax. Decent beach but the area is frumpy. Lots of riff raff. Dirty water in the canals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dolldetails

40,Vibrant Venice Beach,"Not much visual comparison with Venice but it was named thus by the millionaire who created a seaside town reminiscent of his favourite city of Venice.We visited in the morning just as it was waking up so I would expect it to get quite hectic later with vendors, street entertainers and tourists.Beware of being offered 'free' CDs, for once you accept them, you are then asked for money.But with market stalls, graffiti art and a Bohemian atmosphere, it's a fun, colourful spot and a must-see if it's your first trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedes341
40,A different kind of place,Venice beach is a fun place to spend half a day. I would consider it a tourist stop. They have all kinds of stores a food places lining the the walk area between the beach and the road access. Things to see include muscle beach where steroid type guys workout and a great skateboard park. Beware the seedier side of life exists here too with a lot of homeless types. Also have some interesting graffiti painted structures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobs448
30,Mecca for people watching good and bad,"Venice beach is one of my favourite places to hang out and people watch in LA , though I was shocked on my last visit how bad the homeless problem has got at Venice beach and California in general.There are groups of homeless people just camped out in groups hanging around the beach. Whilst they didn't bother me some people would find it intimidating constantly being asked for money. It's unfortunate that LA isn't doing something to help these people off the streets.Loads of street performers ( watch your valuables ). I got a bus from downtown LA to Venice direct took about 50 mins & less than £2 dollars .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EatSleepShootTravel
40,Weird & Winderful,"We walked down from Santa Monica Beach and passing through Muscle Beach and ended up in the weird and wonderful, hippie vibe Venice Beach. We stopped and had some grub in a bar overlooking the beach and a band jamming out some joyful beats. There's an array of hustlers, street artists and artisans selling their wares and generally showing off. It's free entertainment in the sunshine - what's not to like?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hazeangel64
30,Not as glamorous,"Not as glamorous as advertised. It is not too dirty on the streets, but not that clean either. Lots of homeless people there and graffiti everywhere. Life guards are sexy and friendly though :) It gets cold in the early evening hours though, the wind is chill.Lots of shops, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349anniea
40,Just embrace it!,Venice beach is an eclectic mix of people with a crazy beautiful way of life. You need to be there with an open mind and accept that you will get approached on the street. A polite no thank you and a smile and you can move through all the hustle and bustle. Rent a bike so that you can spot some places you want to explore from the beach path and then walk your bike through the boardwalk. We didnt stop to eat there we just went to observe and people watch. I thought Venice beach was a welcome change from the manicured santa monica end of town. There is a large homeless population on the boardwalk but they seen relatively harmless. Necessity is the mother of invention - its a very interesting community!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753jennym
50,Relaxed,Great place to visit during the day but whilst still safe you need to be careful come darkness. Casual vibe throughout,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ross273
40,Quirky spot for people watching,We walked down from Santa Monica Pier at about 10am one morning to see that the buzz of eclectic people and arts were already beginning to appear. Lots of fitness fanatics jogging along and using equipment and an intriguing range of local artists selling their work on the sidewalk. We particular enjoyed watching skaters at the skate park. We hadn't allowed time in our visit to use the sand but there was loads of space should we have decided to. Not sure if I would recommend to families as bit of rife language flying about from a few homeless people (otherwise harmless ) and larger groups may struggle to use the sidewalk with so many bikes/ runners / skaters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519kirstyj
40,For people watching!,Nothing beats Venice for all the eye can handle! Famous for counter culture folks and vibes. There's also a smattering of decent eateries to watch the fun and the sun. Parking is problematic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcalkid
10,The last place to visit in Los Angeles area,"You will walk in what was the most famous promenade on the beach of California and you will be between an unbroken series of shops selling junk for tourists on one side and the highest concentration of desperate people, tramps, homeless that you can imagine on the other side. If you are not interested in studying phenomena of social degradation but you are on vacation go elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pescespadaGenova
10,Why?? Just go to literally ANY other beach in LA,"It's amazing just how many people get duped into going here. And why? It's filthy and filled with nothing but wannabe ""artists,"" homeless people, and glorified jobless people (unless you consider a guy juggling balls in a leopard print speedo a job). The place is a filthy, dumpy cesspool. Go to literally ANY other LA beach--Santa Monica, Manhattan, Hermosa, Playa del Rey, Redondo, Malibu/Zuma--ANY other one is better than this crap-stain of a beach town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewN1905
10,Not good at all,This place has no class. Actually it has nothing to see. Some people smoke marijuana. Too many homeless people. Not a good place for kids and teens. Not recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713amirb
50,"Cool, unique, lovely","We spent a full day around Venice beach and we love it!! The atmosphere is just perfect, a mix of surf & skate, boehemien, stylish place were you can just walk, look at the people, have a ride on a bike or chill at the beach! A real sign of the new wave of LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giuliom266
10,no class,I didn't enjoy it the main front was like a back road at British seaside resorts. A bit scruffy with kiss me quack hat kind of shops,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/426chrism
50,"The Pacific Ocean, walking, shopping & people watching!","Very interesting place for people watching (skateboarding, the Pacific Ocean, street performers). Spend as much time as you want walking the sidewalk alongside the beach - just remember to bring sunscreen! An enjoyable time was spent here with friends. Great place to walk and take in all the activity going on around you. If you go in the morning, there might be fog but it burns off by late morning/early afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160JanB160
40,Character packed place.,"All sorts of people go here, arty, those who think they are arty, musicians and people who would like to be or think they are. You can literally see and hear it all even if you don't want too!See people skating to music or just lazing on the golden sands.Checkout the gift shops or art on sale or just grab and drink and food and watch them pass you by.Close to the airport so perfect to kill a few hours at whilst waiting for a flight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854DP
40,"Wacky, tacky Venice Beach","I love Venice Beach. As other reviewers have pointed out, you can get a good preview on the Showtime show Californication.The choie s up to you on how you decide to enjoy your visit: You can meander along (as we did), rent a bike and cruise along, stop and buy something from a vendor, watch the muscle guys. The beauty of Venice Beach is in its' eccentricity. Enjoy the wacky and the tacky!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecotait
50,This is an awesome beach side to hang out with family & friends,"Not a pretty clean beach but I recommend it to do exercise on a bicycle, scooter, or skates. There are many rental places. The art shops are also awesome to look & purchase. LMFAO filmed their music video here and many more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubenc526
40,Eclectic!,"Worth a visit to meander, cycle or skate the boardwalk. Beaches great and you can watch the muscle men! Hippy and bohemian ... Watch the sidewalk shoes ... Whilst good ... You're parting with your dollars before you know it! Lots of eclectic shops ..... Some interesting buys on offer if you know what I mean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickyN6259YJ
30,Quiet backwater,"Went on guided tour to the beach. Very laid back atmosphere, public toilets available, clean tidy sandy beach, some atrwork on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7864BZstevej
40,You wont be bored!,"There is enough to see to entertain every age! Whether you just want to watch the street vendors, store shopping or enjoy the surfing, skateboard park or just sit in the sand and take a load off. This is a landmark and shouldnt be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRIPBarrett
40,Cool,First time to Venice Beach. I enjoyed it. BEAUTIFUL beach. Cool little tee shirt and souvenir shops. Plenty of bars and restaurants. Muscle beach was cool. Great place to go people watching and to get lost for a little while. Well worth checking out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ludacris6290
50,Just like Californication,Watched the show and then I was there. Just like the movies - all the different characters that make up Venice Beach are amazing. A great place just to hang out and people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodiee517
10,Awful place,"Went here and was completely let down not what I expected at all full of drunks and homeless people , the whole place was grubby , not what u would think walked along the pier which was nice , the beach is lovely and the view is brilliant but the board walk is a crazy place didn't feel safe at all would not return ever",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boomn8er
40,Cruise Control,"Hit Venice Beach on Cruise Control. Get a phat tyre cruiser bike and hit the bike path. It's really fun on a weekend with more people to watch at the Skatepark, Muscle Beach and Breakdancers. Loads of hire spots by the pier at the end of West Washington.Fun to watch the surfers and fishermen from the Pier. The beach is so big you can always find a spot. It's not the cleanest but it's a city beach. Other side of the pier on Marina de Rey is quieter and cleaner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lawson2020
30,Nice walk from Marina Del Rey to Venice,"This is a lovely stretch of beach to walk along before it gets super busy and commercial nearer Venice Beach proper. Then, it got disappointing. The sidewalks got very crowded. All the shops pretty much sold the same things. The sunset was beautiful against the beach. The MDR part of this beach is a lot quieter and peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LinusL77
50,Beautiful views,"It's a landmark, a must see if you are in LA, easy access to the beach lots of parking, there are some shops around the boardwalk where you can find great things , the beach it's beautiful and it's nice to see all the places where they had shoot great movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7527XBclaudiam
30,Dirty,The beach had some trash and a lot of seaweed. The boardwalk was dirty and the body builders were egotistical. The shops were expensive and had cheap merchandise. The gyros on the boardwalk were very good. Parking is tricky and expensive. We found a $10 lot for all day very close to the boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Verlia
40,Musical festival by the sea.,"All (weird) life is here. Really, really interesting to stroll along the promenade, taking in the quirky and cosmopolitan sights, sounds and smells. Just like music festivals used to be before commercialisation took over. We went on a Sunday afternoon in August - probably the busiest time, but it wasn't overpowering. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simoncG9073HE
30,Cool,Its nice place and some attractions ther..but its not good as laguna beach area.I realy recomend you to visit the covepark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulameeda
40,Kook Ville,This is by far the kookiest place I have ever visited. Great place to watch people and eat junk street food. We saw a couple bum fights. There's a lot of eclectic street art and performers. Definitely not a boring stop. Lots to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kava-kauboi
30,Don't go out of your way,"There is a clear contrast in atmosphere between Santa Monica and Venice, with the latter being a little worse for wear. Sure it is eclectic and bohemian but once you've seen the beach etc from Santa Monica, it is downhill from there.Muscle beach, in its basic form, is no more than a collection of rusting gym equipment - nothing too exciting here. I didn't make it as far as the canals, which may have saved this review.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a67fudge
50,Enjoy it,The beach is very leveled. Love i. I really have an awesome time Everytime i go. I usually visit with my 4yr old and my hubby. But a nice beach to hangout with anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilync973
50,SCHOOL COUNSELOR,This beach is so beautiful. The boardwalk has so many shops and places to eat. The beach was packed and there was a basketball game going old timers and young players.If you are into old time cars that is a place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elw966
40,Old School Funky California,"I enjoyed my time in Venice Beach enjoying the off-beat and colorful atmosphere. There are plenty of little shops and eateries along the beach and we couldn't have asked for better weather. A unique place that is exactly what I imagined the California shore to be, right down to the VW busses with surf boards on their roofs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderD
50,A day at the beach,A fantastic experience a massive beautifully beach clean with very few other people on it. The sea was warm and although the current is strong as long as you are a good swimmer it is great fun.We were also visited by a Pod of dolphins will we where there to a fantastic experience.The prom is another experience very busy lots to see and do have plenty of dollars for all the street acts but they are great fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greg221968
50,Amazing!!,"My wife and I rode bikes down to Venice beach, what a great memory! Must do if you are anywhere near Venice .. We hope to be back very soon!Blue Star donuts are a must!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BAJ2424
40,Worth the visit,Interesting place. Good for a wander and icecream :)Lots going on and lots of stalls.Amusing to see all the muscle men working out showing off their ripped bods lolMovie set there the day we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seashelly9
30,Fun for us,"If you are urban ppl who get urban stuff, stay here. So cool. So many cool ppl and restaurants..There are a lot of dogs, urban food, homeless folks, ppl selling stuff it's just so cool. Keep your children super close and wander thru many experiences - my kid thought it was super interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissawJ5135YW
30,Great for tacky shops and schizophrenics on day release.,Sadly very over hyped. Hundreds of shops selling the same hippyfied nick nacks!One or two quite original ways of extracting money from tourists but mainly rather sad people who are clearly mentally unwell with a smattering of violence thrown in.Best are the mounted police who look cool in their Stetsons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkC8011DM
50,A neat funky experience,It is a must see but not worth saying for too long as it is too funky and not a lot to do. We enjoyed more Abbot Kinney Blvd but it was much pricier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarekM737
40,Fun Afternoon,"Crazy fun. A place to people watch, nosh, and have a beer. My favorite is the vendors and seeing the art and crafts they create. It is a take back to the sixties and a drug gazed society. The downside is the amount of beggars and street people, and drug addicts. If you can look past that... you are fine. If you want to beach it, recommend heading to the South end away from the hustle bustle but walking distance. You can drive and park. Parking is about 10 for the day, or rent a bike in Marina Del Rey and do a tour of the neighborhood to Venice beach, and toward Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727shelleyk
40,If You Love The Unusual,"No visit to LA is complete without checking out the sights in Venice Beach. We took the path from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, walking along the sand and ocean. It's a great pedestrian pathway, separated from all the bikes and roller blades. Upon arriving at Vencie Beach you will immediately catch the funky vibe here. There are artisans lining the pathway, displaying their art and musicians play their music, hoping for donations. Some of the musicians are surprisingly talented. Don't hesitate to drop them a tip if you enjoy their music.This past trip we merely walked along the pathway, enjoying all the art, music and unusual people, but there are also many restaurants and shops you can enjoy too. Our main goal while in LA this time was to see the sights without spending much money and we only stopped at Bulletproof Coffee on our way out of town. For any of you that know about Bulletproof Coffee, it's not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
50,Beach with a nice walk,"Another great beach, a nice bike path with few rental stores nearby. Mice selection of giftshops, resturant etc on the walk side of beach. Parking in neighbourhood is free but may have to walk a bit, otherwise paid public parking lots are right next to beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZFoodieMSP
10,Disgusting !!!,"What a revolting , smelly, dirty place to call an attraction ! The only thing it's attracting is the homeless, who appear to have beachfront realty without the dividends!We walked the lento of the beach and it's a sleazy ,dirty, place. The beach is about 500 meters till you hit water , no waves to speak of. I wonder why the council doesn't tidy the place up. Would not recommend anytime of the day or year. ☹️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb186
40,Gotta do it,"If you have teens, no trip to LA is complete without hanging out at Venice Beach. Best people watching, gorgeous views, big waves (well, usually). Beach was cleaner by a long shot than when we were last five years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erwinka
50,Nice beach area,Visit Venice beach if you want to see a different LA. You can combine this with Santa Monica by walking from one to the other. If you want to do it quicker the bikes are available for hire and a cycle path connecting both is available avoiding any traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeggyDoll
50,"Dreamy, perfect beach","Perfect spot for a morning run or for a sunrise yoga practice. The pier is an amazing place to people watch and to enjoy the glorious California sunshine. Tons of activity on the beach and at the pier, but it still feels open, airy and in the middle of nature. One of the nicest beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acdhuber
50,Do not miss it!,"It's not the best beach of L.A., it's not the best pier of California, it can be quite dirty and a little bit scary in the night but....it's Venice. Even if we are only few miles away from Santa Monica it seems to be in another dimension. Muscle Beach is the heart of this community. There are hippies, surfers, homeless, rich all together. Fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
50,its overcrowded,"it's kinda overcrowded over at venice... plenty of shops, restaurants, people, homeless.... do take caution for your belongings.. apply plenty of sunscreen and bring drinking water..

50,Nice Beach and watch the surfers,We stopped there and it was a great place to stop and watch the surfers. A very nice beach. Not much of a town for shopping or anything but makes a nice stop. The beach seemed really nice. I think these beaches are so much prettier than the beaches in the Gulf in Florida.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaG528
50,Everyone must visit at least once - just not with children,"What a unique and fun place. I was there on a weekend afternoon and it was just a sight to behold. You will never go to another beach like it. For those familiar with NYC its like ""the village"" but on a beach.Independent artists and musicians everywhere, street performers, little shops, great food, carnival like atmosphere. Not to mention, the beach itself is wide and beautiful.Is the place a little rough around the edges... absolutely. Are there people offering to sell you drugs. Sure. Are the bathrooms dirty... absolutely. Does it cost a fortune to park... you bet. But its all part of the experience which is not to be missed.Just don't bring your kids. It is NOT family friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metsontheroad
40,Interesting,"World famous, this area attracts the weird, the wonderful and the just plain curious (us!).The ""hippy"" influence has spread over the years to include the Bohemian and the whole area reflects numerous tastes. The first thing we noticed was the extravagant artwork on some of the buildings.The beach area has a wide area reserved for cycling/skating etc. Expect to see all types here, including wooden cycles?!Would have liked to experience the night life here, but sadly time did not allow..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334

30,Hasn't Changed in 20 Years,"The same old, same old-with the unoriginal art, musicians playing covers and roller blades and bicyclists, oh that's a change-different types of bikes and blades!

50,Spontaneous Fun,I visited with my 12 year old son. This place was fun and full of so many people watching things to do and see. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamLam3
20,Nothing special here,We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and expected so much more. The area is quite run down and the stalls and shops do not offer anything exciting. Seems to be a lot of destitute and homeless people and vendors trying to sell their wares. I guess it is worth a ride or walk through to witness the area for yourself and see some of the characters that work in the area but I would recommend a quick walk through and head further south to Hermosa and Manhattan beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duncannj
30,Friends and family!,It's Venice beach! People are selling things on the street plus street food! Just settle for the street food and do go to a sit down,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahT392
10,Just awful!,We went there because we were staying in Santa Monica and people kept asking if we had been to Venice Beach/Muscle Beach. We biked there and as we got closer the scene of homeless people and half naked bodies got more and more. My husband went into a store and I stood there with the bikes scared! A young teenage boy was going through the bins looking for food and it absolutely broke my heart! When my husband got back I asked him to look after the bikes so I could take this young boy to get food. This boy cried! He said no one has ever spoken to him nicely and did anything like that for him before. I spoke to him for awhile...he was born on the streets and had no idea where his mum and dad are because they left him there! Never judge a person situation. I have travelled to many places in the world and this area is one of the worse places I have seen for homeless people. There is rubbish and the place smells like human pee! It broke my heart and I left crying!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kozmohiggins

Some inappropriate things for little kids....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBerke
50,The land that time forgot.,Venice Beach is stuck in the sixties. The hippies came and never left. It was awesome to see. Muscle Beach is a favorite of movies and actors before they make it in Hollywood. Beautiful to see but don't hang out passed sunset as it does get sleazy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJ1015
40,Interesting place to visit,"It is definitely worthwhile calling by if you get the chance. Beautiful beach and an interesting culture along the boardwalk. Lots of shops, stalls and street entertainers to see and of course there is muscle beach and the skate park to view as well. We had a stroll through and went on to spend the rest of the day by Santa Monica pier for the more 'family' vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniew451

50,First night in Cali,My friend and I was headed to the airport and our uber drive was super nice and frye day and suggested a restaurant to try. After going to the restaurant we left to walk Venice beach boardwalk. It was cool. Weather was chilly I had to buy a sweater lol. Me and friend went to a few on bars and just really enjoyed the scenery. We were just excited about being there. So im bias. 😁,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbridgeta
50,Such a cool vibe,"This was my second visit to Venice Beach so I knew what to expect.Admittedly it can be quite intimidating as it is just so busy (both times I visited, was in peak time being July).Venice Beach though wouldn't be Venice Beach if it didn't have all it has to offer from the variety of both people and shops.I personally think it is just so cool and such a fabulous experience.I can not wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Montbour

20,Catch a buzz dude,Well this place was not my cup of tea. Flea market atmosphere infused with Bob Marley types smoking MJ everywhere. Muscle Beach was a great disappointment. Rode my bike thru as fast as possible to get to Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azdave
20,Don't waste your time,"Not at all what I expected. We walked from Santa Monica down which was about a 2 hours round trip.For about half of that time we looked for somewhere half decent to get a drink or eat food - in the end we just decided to do without.The shops are full of home made art/ crap. The promenade is full of homeless people, their tents and their stuff - very sad to see and countless people asking for money.At no stage were we threatened but at no stage did we feel safe. The skate boarding was impressive.Other than that the place is a dump. I'm sure in the past it was beautiful but it isn't now.PS don't even attempt to use the public toilets, just go in your pants like most people have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230JH230
50,Love Venice Beach!!,"My daughter and I visited several beaches along the coast from San Diego to Los Angeles. Venice was by far our favorite beach to visit. Lots of little shops with tshirts and souvenirs. Places to eat, Muscle Beach, basketball courts, lots of people for people watching. We found some really cool rocks on the beach. There was one section just for surfers which was fun to watch. You can get parking pretty easy during the week for $9 right next to the beach. The weekends are more challenging. Lots of stuff to see on this beach!!! Loved it and can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713brendah
40,Fun place to explore and spend the day,I think going to Venice Beach since I was a kid . Not only is it a good place to catch some sun but it's a great place to people watch . There are many street vendors almost like a flea market . In addition to that there are so many performers to watch and many lovely places to eat . Enjoy the day with family or friends .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LolaGirl2016
20,Don't waste your time or safety,"Very disappointing. Lots of pot smoking and homeless people.I only ventured here to see one of the famous beaches on most TV shows about LA. I advise ""do not waste your time or money."" I felt very unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665vickic
20,Venice Beach Pier-needs some TLC,"For a stroll near the beach, this pier offers s chance of getting some fresh air...it really needs to be cleaned up and freshened up a bit (many bird droppings). The Venice Beach area near the pier did not provide a safe feeling (there seemed as if there was a need for the police presence-a couple of police officers present near the small shops). If you are visiting LA for a limited amount of time, going to Santa Monica pier early in the morning would be a good option or the Manhatten Beach Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5starreview
40,You just have to experience it but be careful,"Always love visiting and especially watching the skateboarders do their thing. It's a place where it seems anything goes so would be careful with children although there are some great things. A lot of characters! Got roped into a street entrainment session, so avoid if you get asked. Took ages and it was all about getting money from the adults. I enjoyed the experience a little as it was funny but there was a clear undertone to it and as a visitor from the UK it was a little threatening at the end if you didn't seem to come up with money. But that aside it is worth a visit , but not at night .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJaneytravelling
50,Must funny beach!,"Venice Beach is my favorite beach around L.A. it's young, free spirit and funny ambiance. Everybody are nice and welcomed. There is a lot of little shop, fitness activity on beach, skateboarding...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandraGagnon
40,Very pretty,"Whole area is really nice with great beaches that were much cleaner than expected. Venice, unfortunately, has a fair number of homeless people near the shops but they didn't cause us any trouble. Venice Beach should be on everyone's to-do list when visiting LA just because, well, it's Venice Beach and you should at least see it once",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NUFCadl
30,Rent Bikes,"Ride the cool bike trails next to the ocean! Best views around. Boardwalk never changes, weirdos, druggies, homeless and tons of crap for sale. It's as always a culture shock, but fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlanetR

10,Venice beach,"Venice beach boardwalk is full of homeless people, pan handlers, mentally ill people muttering disturbing things to themselves, the public restrooms are the most disgusting bathrooms i have ever seen.

50,Find Zoltar and have your fortune told!,"Experience a little Americana! Do some people watching! Go see the body builders at Muscle Beach! Watch the skateboarders! Rent a bike!But a crazy T-shirt! Fight for a parking space and then go pay for parking! You'll feel like you are walking on the wild side for an hour or two!Remember Zoltar from the movie ""Big"" with Tom Hanks? Go find Zoltar, put your dollar in and have your fortune told. Keep your ticket for a souvenir and see if your fortune comes true?Venice Beach is a place seen many times in the movies and should not be missed. There is also a beach there, so don't forget to see the beach. You will see a lot of ""Characters"", so you'll fit right in!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm
30,"Adult setting, not for families","I somewhat enjoyed Venice Beach's eclectic and funky vibe. The smell of marijuana was everywhere, which I usually don't mind but we had our 4 kids with us. Also, seeing so many homeless people made the experience kinda depressing. Venice is a very unique experience more appropriate for adults or college aged kids looking to party and have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyp60706
40,Love me two times.,"Venice beach right next to the Santa Monica beach is a good alternative if you prefer a beach with a classic style Boardwalk. Lots of beach activities take place. People riding bikes , skateboards, scooters, etc. Muscle beach is near by where you can work out or just watch. Lots of American ninja warrior type of apparatuses available to practice and exercise on. The beach also has a nice bowl for skateboarding and there's also livemusic and performances that randomly take place. Most people mention the homeless people that gather near the Boardwalk, they are harmless and they mind they're own business. They are actually super creative when panhandling holding signs up like ""sh*tty advice 1$"" . They don't go around hassling people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rgd973
50,Wonderful beach,"In the heat of the Californian sun, this beach was just awesome. There are areas that are so quiet, while others that are jam packed. We preferred the quiet part of the beach for a relaxing break, but venturing into the busy part was also quite nice. The place just head an amazing buzz about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LothianArab
40,Carnival,"Beautiful beach with skate park and numerous boardwalk style shops - street entertainment is good but they really push for high$$$ ""donations"" - laid-back surfer/skater vibe - nearby neighborhoods seem a little ""sketchy"" with the exception of the beautiful canal region",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itscarterjohnson
30,What a lot of rubbish,"No atmosphere at all, junk food everywhere. Some weird people around - which was rather interesting. Some hot bodies, both male and female, in love with themselves (not each other). Really great skate park and outdoor gym. In general - tick it off and don't come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcekpl
40,A must see,"Venice Beach has a reputation of being quirky, left-field, out there or whatever adjective you choose and it does live up to that.The street along the beachfront is filled with eccentric street vendors and entertainers. Some are genuine talented, some a unfortunately less so. We took a few minutes to marvel at the skateboarders in the skate park. These are young guys just doing their thing but could easily be mistaken for a show.We bought a few bits from artists along the way. The sellers were very friendly to chat to and very relaxed. The whole atmosphere felt safe (mainly because of numbers I guess) and we spent a good while just people watching and enjoying the 'sights'.If you want to visit an alternative to Venice Beach then walk over Abbott Kinney Blvd. Could not be any more different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tagfcuk
30,Not that impressive,"While walking around was offered a cd but the man wanted me to buy his cd effectively but classed it as a donation. Dude i did not ask for your cd and it was whack anyways as a friend gave him a dollar. Every song was a rubbish sample and again this is a ""must"" visit at peak times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps582139
30,Nice before anything opens,I had never been to Venice Beach before and ask my girlfriend if we could stop there since we had dropped a friend off at the airport. We found a place to park next to a restaurant instead of parking in a parking lot which would cost $10. And from there we walked up to muscle Beach since I heard so much about it. As we walked many of the stores were beginning to open up their doors. Really cool homes along the sidewalk. Makes me wonder what kind of money you have to make to live in a place like that. I enjoyed the walk but did not enjoy the vendors that started to hassle us would free CDs. We did walk along the pier and that was nice. It might be fun to people watch on the beach during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scigris
50,Cool Vibes,"Ended up on venice beach due to a 24 hr layover in LA on my way to Oahu. Let me just say I'm so happy I decided to go, I was traveling alone so I was a bit scared on getting there. However while in the Custom Hotel lobby I talked myself into getting an uber to Venice Beach. I got an uber and when I got into the car there was another person, I had car pooled accidentally but it was fine we split the fare! I get to venice beach and it was so cool. There is so many different people, a ton of shops and restaurants. I walked the beach and the boardwalk (there is a lot to see) and eventually went into a restaurant. I sat at the bar and had the best chicken nachos I've ever had!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunset787
50,Great stuff,"Theres a lot of stuff to do in Venice , chill,eat,surf,play,run , whatever you want , a nice beach wirh a lot of variety, parking straight on the beach only 9 bucks the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatsN369
50,Roller !,"Famous place, and we enjoyed a lot to roller-blading along the beach at the sunset.You chill, and at the same time you meet all Los Angeles : people doing fitness, skating, biking, walking with the dog, tourists, teenagers, even some stars jogging ;)Good experience in the spirit of LA !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuExplorer
40,"Nice to Walk Around, Lots of Crazy People","If you're looking to visit the unseen areas of LA, Venice Beach is the place to go. It's a long boardwalk filled with Tshirt stores, bong/vape stores, Segway and bicycle rentals, and a lot of hipster stores, and loaded with artisan vendors. Most people are odd and seem crazy, but the people are nice and welcoming. Very touristy of an area.I would recommend Muscle Beach, the skate park, and the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanmC970CD
50,Plan a visit at least once in your life!!! A bucket list for sure.,"What a great time visiting Venice Beach. It has it's own vibe for sure. Unlike anywhere I have been. Not super perfect for young children, as it is come as you are and do as you do. Lot going on here for sure. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connies138
40,Touristy but still funky as well,"Have stayed at the Venice Beach Suites & Hotel several times, which is right on the boardwalk close to the iconic 'Venice Beach' sign over the dead end street. The boardwalk is full of tourists in summer but has still retained some of its funkiness. Lot's of interesting people about and in between the tourist traps selling crappy sunglasses you'll find the local Weed Doctors, Tattoo parlours etc. The weather and the views are typically great. Even in summer the beach is usually not very crowded and if you like a bit of people watching or a quiet spot on the beach both can be had here. Can recommend unless you abhor crowds or weird people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevendotmartin
50,Unforgettable 10/10,"We visited LA for 3 days and our two kids pestered us to visit Pacific Pier, Venice beach and Muscle beach.Well it was the best day of the 3. It was a mixture of awe , smiles , laughs , surprise and a little gobsmacking.I could not recommend it enough, you see all walks of life in all sorts of different situations.It is non threatening area and very safe. The people are just lovely and crazy. This is defiantly an experience we will talk about for a long time.Defo go for another look 10/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muzzyman123
50,Wonderful,"Lots of shops, food, the beach, and street performers. I enjoy the water and people watching so this was a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleneo_11
50,Any day is a good one,"Don't just focus on the Venice boardwalk! Venice has so many nearby fun places to check out. One could ckeck out the numerous restaurants and clothing shops on nearby Abbot Kinney, or the Venice Farmers Market on Friday's. Not to be left out are the tours if the bungalows and unique craftsman homes that line the streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
50,Fun and funky,"Went to Venice Beach for the first time and while parking was a little difficult to find, it was a very fun and funky place to go. There were some nice places to eat, and many quirky people along the sidewalk doing various things for tips. Some were playing the guitar, others had dogs in bikinis, there were singers, and yet another had artwork on display. There was an area where the musclemen were lifting weights. Lots of skateboarders performing in the skateboard park. There were people with green signs rollerskating around advertising marijuana doctors. Also several little shops. If you are in Los Angeles and want to see a quirky area, this is definitely it. I enjoyed going there for the day, it was very entertaining and relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mollyo203
40,Muscle,Must place to visit. I loved the wall graffiti at Venice beach. was amazed with the origin story of skate boarding. one of the must attraction to be in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandeepP1356
50,Dreamy & Alive,"Venice Beach is a vibrant coast line where you can have a swim in blue waters and enjoy some artistic performances. The beach is full of talented people displaying their work of art (crafts, jewelry, bags, souvenirs...) in addition to small kiosks selling yummy snacks. You can also find nice restaurants overlooking the sea. It is a memorable walk for those who enjoy walking and a sense of authenticity!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoubaE
50,Awesome,Great place full of art resturants and junk to buy! The ocean of course was more beautiful than i imagined it would be. I recommend this beach to anyone who is seeking to have a great time and experience more than the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unsatisfied19
40,Great trip and enjoyed the family vacation except for the Hotel was not up to par.,Lots to see in LA. Great trip. Also went to the Gene Autry Museum and it was fantastic. Out by the zoo. The food there was the best we had anywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzygslc7
40,Better than Santa Monica,"People are just as crazy, but they are not so much on the beach and the beach is great. Lots of strange people and shops on the boardwalk. Good place to see by bicycle. Not as crazy as expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CFred733
10,Vacation,Disappointed in the apparent drug problems that plague this beach as well as the sewage and tar on the beach. Needs a huge overhaul in cleanup efforts to bring it up to its historical grandure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599kristinh
20,Omg😵,"Venice beach is everything you see in movies. It's crowded, drugs being displayed and used openly, homeless living smack dab in the boardwalk and just Dirty Dirty Dirty!!Plenty of shops but very expensive for sun damaged stuff, can't eat comfortably because of the homeless people sitting directly across from you, not to forget the smell of urine and marijuana all over the place. It's a shame that the city hasn't taken action to rid the homeless here so they can clean up the area. Several Hundred thousand dollar homes only to have a view of dirty homeless people day in day out urinating in public, harassing visitors and smoking pot. It's definitely an experience and being able to say I've been there but not sure it's worth going back. Not to mention that lodging in this area is between 250-600 dollars A night. If I have to sleep with one eye open to ensure the safety of my vehicle those prices are ridiculous to pay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823marthab
20,"Bohemian life, not for kids","We drove out from LA to Venice to get an evening meal and take in the sights and sounds of the boardwalk and particularly muscle beach.The drive into Venice is slow and busy, congested. As we approached the beach area it became clear that parking was going to be an expensive affair with $15-20 dollars being average. The place was full as it was so there was little chance for us to find a space.We drove around for an hour, right down to the beach but eventually didn't stop. Parking was one reason for this, the other was the vast numbers of homeless people, huge numbers of people wobbling into the streets and road off their heads on drink and drugs and the general feel of it being a surf style beach community gone horribly wrong.The beach and boardwalk looked great but the people occupying it didn't. At the time, despite my really wanting to visit muscle beach, I said ""let's get out of this toilet"" and we headed back to the comparative (!) normality of west Hollywood for dinner...I won't be visiting this Venice again...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrNefarious
10,Not What You Expect,This famous beach is full of homeless and drug addicts. It made me feel not safe at all.There is a lot going on here and I don't think all of that is legal. If you have just a few days in SoCal- avoid wasting your time here.Nature- beach and the ocean are nice but you can better invest uour time in Malibu or Laguna Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677margaretap
40,Good for people watchung,As far as the beach he's in is quite busy .... Good waves and sand. And then everyone hits the concourse and a whole new vibe opens up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsitaly2018
50,Board walk,"The walk along the beach is a nice break in the big city life there is sand, sea and a nice long walk where you can see all kinds of ppl. bicycling, skateboarding and working out at the muscle beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindgaard2016
50,Great experience,"Venice beach is a great place to people watch by day. The eclectic sights are a highlight. Avoid at nightfall, atmosphere changes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateC1999
40,What's that I smell?,"My wife and I visited Venice Beach while on an all day tour of LA. Time was limited, so we didn't see all of Venice. The parts we did see were pretty interesting. If you visit the boardwalk prepare yourself for lots of homeless people and the aroma of marijuana.But there's plenty of street artists too, little shops, and folks out riding bicycles and enjoying the day, as well as places to grab a quick bite to eat. Muscle beach is a must visit (just for the history alone).If you're looking for a family beach for the kids, I recommend Santa Monica. But if you want to visit a unique location with lots of history, then VB should be on your list, just don't inhale. And stay away from the restrooms. Gross!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159christianp
50,Would have loved to visit everyday,"The place has got some magic to it. You find skaters, artists, henna, lots of shops and activities, muscle beach with a gym right beside the boardwalk.Beware, you also find a lotta weirdos and homeless people as wellBut so much of art and culture at one place right beside the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ideepakc
50,From all walks of life.,"We ended up heading to Venice beach 3 times during our 6 days in California. We took our granddaughter to show her LA, and she loved walking around Venice Beach and watching the skaters do flips and practice at the skate park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubaldy
40,Seems dodgy at first but is actually great,"We went to Santa Monica Pier before this so when we first got to Venice Beach we were thinking it looked dodgy compared to that. As we explored further we realised there was a lot more to it. Lots of food options and vendors selling fresh fruit, gifts etc. We hired segways $50 each for 1hour and went for a ride along the bike paths (lots of bike for hire too).The place where we got lunch had a venich beach checklist with a list of things to check out.Yes there are a lot of homeless people but they generally keep to themselves and some were selling artwork they had painted. We didn't find them threatening being there during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelomufo

50,Brilliant cultural hotpot.,"What an awesome place. So much fun, lots to see and do. We were passing through on the start of our coastal tour. Loved the beach, had breakfast and viewed all the little beach shops. Of course a must do there is to tick the 'muscle beach' box. Really great place to walk through for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113andym
20,A slum,"Terrible boardwalk filled with homeless, drug addicts beggars and a crowd of tourists.Very disappointed.The beach is wide so you can find a cleaner spot closer to Rose avenue, but avoid the rest of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fpny
50,Full of culture,An amazing location full of art and culture. A bit of a stretch from major freeways but well worth the trip! This can get pretty crowded during peak season,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcosv341
20,Amazing!!!,Not in a good way for me. Read up about it and really wanted to go but to be honest - I was a bit scared! It was like walking through a young people's world and at 50 I don't consider myself old! I'm glad we went and I'm sure some people absolutely love the vibe and atmosphere - just not for me!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonhadley
40,Good beach,Venice is a nice beach to visit in the LA area. There are a lot of restaurants along the beach so you can easily have a break for food at any time. The beach itself is long and has a nice white sand and lifeguards at many parts of it. There are also many toilets and showers along the beach which of course is good. It’s a long beach and it looks a bit different depending on where you are but in general I think that more or less the whole beach is good to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joky80
50,❤️❤️❤️,"My last visit was in June, shortly after the massacre in Orlando....and I don't know who was responsible for it but....they had an amazing tribute to all the victims.....not just some flowers but a picture of everyone and a short biography of each person.....and I read everyone of them and cried with strangers....and embraced that, even in a city of 20+ million people, there is still humanity in this world.....and then I ran into the ocean and cleansed myself of all the sadness and looked back at the Palm trees, and my mom and dad, and smiled when I said a prayer for everyone on this earth....and I'm a cynical person....but Venice Beach is just calming for the soul! I bought a big, huge sunhat with a bow (think Audrey Hepburn) and I wear it because it gives me that feeling......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nopicop
40,"Alternative, great for people watching","Muscle beach is a must go if you are in Venice - and take a little time to admire the muscles and agility of the 'performers'. Would not be out of place in the Cirque de Soleil. We were lucky and saw some amazing performances. Along the promenade there are many tourists but also many creative people. The quality is 'in the eye of the beholder', and in any case it makes for great people watching. At a minimum have an ice-cream and take a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francesca_in_London
50,Still one of LA's best beaches!,"Family from Holland was visiting and wanted to go to the beach since they don't get much sun in their neck of the woods.August is perfect weather on Venice beach. Besides the ideal beach conditions strolling along the promenande is lots of fun with plenty of art to look at, food to eat, and people to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaFoodTravelGuru
40,Madness,Venice is as exciting as it is beautiful. The beach is spectacular and hosts a cycle path along it. The area is dynamic with great murals and examples of public art. The street entertainers are brilliant too. Certainly worth a visit. I would suggest avoiding the piblic lavatories... yuck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jubilee-jo
50,A must go - picturesque,"For the ambiance colorful people, muscle beach, just enjoy the board walkNo nice place for a drink or a lunch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierrec577
40,Get what you expect!,"I enjoyed seeing this famous place. The beach is great, there's fast food around, street performers were really entertaining (although they put the hard sell on in the end to get your money - understandable but it took ages for them to do this and then do the finale), tourist shops, people on bikes, skateboards and buskers.However, if you don't know - there's some seedy and rough folks walking about and quite a few homeless - so if you don't like that, bear it in mind. One homeless guy took half a burger out of the bin in front of us, smelled it and then ate it. Sad - but you will see stuff like that. Santa Monica would be a better option for you if you want to avoid things like this if you have small kids etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9412VIsteves
40,Cool place with lots of people watching,"Safe parking right by the V beach entrance we want in the early afternoon had less people but filled up quickly. Fun people watching, cool skateboard park you can watch also walking the board walk up and down. Shop's everywhere, local vendors with crafts, art and just stuff lol. Lots of food to choice from we had a great lunch from a taco place and ate right on the boardwalk. Very cool everyone should chk it out but not a full day for us",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nolaboy70

40,A must see....,"Of course, everyone knows about Venice Beach....or do they? I know what I see in the movies - hmmmm, I was a little shocked about the 'real' Venice Beach.We parked close to Santa Monica and walked to Venice beach along the wet sand. It's beautiful. We walked a little way along the walking path first before getting our feet wet.When you get to Venice Beach, there is a pier, eateries, a skate park and a row of shops along the walking path. This is where the true and not so pretty side of Venice Beach is. There is a path with ships on one side and homeless people lined up along the other side. Let's just say it's a little confronting and not something I would go back to Venice Beach to see again.... It's not the most pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nat0716

50,"Great day, full of variety and interesting people","Really enjoyed Venice Beach, there's lots to do, and lots to watch if you don't like to do. We walked from Santa Monica along the boardwalk with the cyclists runners and skaters, all the way to the canals at the end of Venice. The snake on a bicycle was a bit of a surprise and some of the characters are interesting, but it is fun place to be. I do recommend going round the canals at the end as well, very tranquil after the energy of the seafront",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianHReview
30,Nice beach,Nice beach. Less busy than Santa Monica. All depends on what you're looking for. I prefer Santa Monica. It's good for those that want a quiet day on the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suz_merhi

50,"Step right up--Daredevil skateboarders, Muscle Beach, and street performers...","Venice Beach has a little bit of everything, and provides a unique window on LA pop culture. You can find everything from chainsaw jugglers to Michael Jackson impersonators, an electric bass player on roller-blades, or a Carnival barker with a two-headed turtle selling tickets to a Freak Show. It can be very crowded on weekends, but that's also the best time to see performers. Yes, parking can be a challenge, but this is LA, after all...Not a place to go every day, but well worth at least one or two visits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A725JDjeffs

40,Different!,"I had high expectations of Venice Beach and was a little deflated when I visited. I found it to be crowded and a little 'cheap' looking, yet the shopping was not cheap.

50,Not fancy but free fun and entertainment,"Some people might say the pier at venice beach is a bunch of freaks and sideshows but I have been to similar beach piers before and loved them for all their tackiness. The actual beach in Venice is nice and very roomy but people tend to gather together in certain areas (could have been closer to lifeguards). The sand leading to the water was on somewhat of a steep decline maybe 25%. The pier at Venice Beach was not only a great stroll for exercise but also chock full of fast food eateries and cheap souvenir stores. There are many people who offer free entertainment in terms of dance-offs, sing-offs and other impressive skills. I had a great time there but didn't love the decline to the water and for me the water was to cold to swim in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247
10,Skip it,"If you like a grubby sea front, smelling of weed with a lot of people who haven't washed, fill your boots! Otherwise carry on to Santa Monica beach and pier which is the other end of the spectrum and has all the muscle beach stuff going on as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natsprat80
40,The People's Beach,"Venice beach is very busy, parking hard to find and expensive through Valet, wait go street parking...The restaurants have long waiting times and the public toilets are at third world levels.. Take loo paper...The saving grace are the people who are chilled out and like to chat. I met residents of all types who were friendly and it felt like we had known each other for years.The best views are from the end of the pier where we saw people fishing and just watching the world go by and spending there days. As with all the beaches on this coastline, you get beautiful photos as the light is so good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JYOTINA65

50,So Much Culture!,"It was definitely straight out of the movies with skateboarders everywhere and theatrical performances. The graffiti on the beach was just lovely. It is definitely nitty gritty and not glamorous at all, but it makes you appreciate it that the much more. I walked along the boardwalk with my friends as we absorbed the scenery, took photos and bought souvenirs. Everyone is just trying to make a living by hustling talents to products. Do not get fooled by the ""Medicinal Marijuana"" stores - it's all a scam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/datdpb

50,"Crazy, Wild, Packed and Fabulous","Venice Beach is everything you imagined with the boardwalk filled with Green Doctor clinics, muscle builders, skateboarders, music, partying and crowds. It is not for the faint hearted - go there with an open minded slip into the mood of party, party, party. The beach is long and beautiful and quiet - a nice transition from the boardwalk. There are games going on, but it is an enormous beach. If you have time wander to the backstreets of Venice and enjoy the canals, the frescoes on the building walls and that other part. It's a total experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanneg550
20,Trashy,"It's been a while since I was here last, and to be honest we were done in less than 30mins. The parking is insanely expensive and when you get to the boardwalk it is just pure junk and trash. Great place to go to score weed, but that's about it. We went, did not buy the T shirt and moved on. Santa Monica is much nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlbalTrvl

40,"A classic, lots to things to see","If you have grown up watching Baywatch like me Venice beach is a must see (all though it was filmed another place along the beach you will recognize it from different scenes or maybe other series) a lot to see, weird people, street show etc. Try some delicious fresh fruit from the beach stalls! Check out muscle beach. Take a walk or rent a bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917elineh

40,Boho meets money,"Staying just up from the beach, you begin to appreciate how this is not only a gorgeous sandy beach, well tended and supported by the chain of lifeguards, but also a Mecca for fitness folk at Muscle Beach, artists, performers, sun worshippers and people who just enjoy a good time. The boardwalk is a great walk by day and evening. The stalls and shops offer everything from tourist tat to really unusual things. I walked up and down (and ran it) several times - it's a great place to be",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonl379
50,Great beach,I love this beach. I know that Angelinos go to other beaches but for me this one is gorgeous. Be aware of some bugs in the sand though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFC15
40,5 Days,"We rented a little appartment for 5 Days at Venice Beach and had a really great time. The beach itself was so far as we´ve seen it very clean and it was very relaxing spending sometimes the whole day there. Prices at Venice are pretty high and like other people said there are some scammers who try to sell their music to you but on the other Hand you have a lot of street artist and little handmade gifts. So you will probably see all types of different people and some may seem crazy but so far they were all harmless. Only thing that might make you feel uncomfortable are all the homeless people at night building their little camps.Nonetheless Venice was a great place with nice little Shops, Restaurants, bars and a beautiful beach. If you can deal with some crazy people and a bunch of homeless camps you should definitly give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimK3440

If it's heat and beaches you are after this is the spot for you. Great people watching and the history of Muscle beach is exactly what you expect. Scantily clad lads living weights and flexing for the cameras. The shops, art and eateries along the walk way are interesting, vibrant and varied. A great place to soak in LA life and there will always be a camera crew on location for some star spotting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trionad577
40,"Too many people, too much traffic","Went to this beach, thought show kids. It was mid day, it was crowded, traffic, hot. It is interesting place for one time to visit.

50,Good grief he's still here,"What can I say but I love Venice Beach. No matter the time of day , year or attitude this place just keeps on entertaining.

You owe it to yourself to check it out , weekdays are less congested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeytd
50,Spectacular place,"Venice Beach is one of those unique places where eclecticism meets in all levels. Beautiful beach, surfing area, a very multicultural place that offers plenty of things to do and see.

Venice beach is now ""Out"", not ""in"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magisa02

50,A real must see!,"Reading some of the reviews already posted I have to agree there are a number of strange people here and it wasn't perhaps as clean cut as other places you might visit. However despite this it was one of my favourite places. There was so much character there, the people are so energetic and there was so much going on - everywhere you looked there was something different happening.We had a great time just wandering around taking it all in - watching the basketball games, the outside gym, the skateboarders... It would have been great to sit and enjoy some food and see what the place became as the sun went down (I got the impression it had a good bar scene), but unfortunately we were restricted by our tour bus timetable.We also took the chance to wander around the remaining canals. This is a lovely place with such a relaxed feel to it - unlike anywhere else I visited during our time in LA. Beautiful little houses where you could get a cheeky looking into back gardens and how the locals live.This is a truely iconic place and so familiar from different films and TV programmes, you have to visit, even if just for a few hours - personally I'd like to go back for much longer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StraightOutOfKansas
30,Great boardwalk - not like it used to be,"I was concerned about my teenagers going to venice beach by themselves but no worries, it felt completely safe and is loaded with tourists.

Gone are all the girls in bikinis on skates, musicians, artists and all of the interesting characters - mostly families and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieanndurkin
40,Well worth a visit,"We walked up and down the broadwalk to Muscle Beach and the other way, there were lots of people selling interesting things and many shops along the front. The beach is beautiful and seems to go on for miles and looked very clean. Took the opportunity to watch the stakeboarders and they provided great entertainment as they were so good, also there was breakdancers and tumblers providing entertainment and they were very talented. I enjoyed the experience of going there as you see it so often on TV these days, but I wouldn't rush back again. Would also recommend everyone is vigilant and looks out for pickpockets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueC768

20,Keep your eyes in the beauty of the beach,Our tour bus dropped us off here. It isn't a great place for families with young kids. Lots of super skimpy bathing suits. It is a very odd and every place. The ocean is beautiful so just keep focused on it if you wind up here. Keep your kids close!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/631kristelf
40,Must do at least once.,"This place was jumping at 5 o""clock in the afternoon, I can only imagine what it's like at night. Would recommend sturdy shoes as the ground is filthy, you wouldn't know what was lurking just under the sand. The side show alley feel of the small shops tempt you down the crowed spaces to see what is available. Thousands of people playing ball games, hanging out or people watching. Keep a close eye on very young children, it would be very easy to lose them, and watch your step. Ground very uneven. Glad I have seen it, but no desire to revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candy-Stewart
30,A bit scarey and very very busy,We rented bikes and cycled up and down the beach which was nice but the main walkway was incredibly busy and we felt like someone would pickpocket us so were super observant. It was quite downmarket and definitely improved as we headed towards Santa Monica. Abbot Kinney Boulevard was very cool but also incredibly busy. Maybe we went on the wrong day. Having said that we did catch Rachel Platten (Fight Song) in a free concert so my teenage daughter was thrilled.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JN40

10,Not worth the visit,"Stopped here on a tour and was happy to check it off my list of places to see but would not recommend at all, especially exposing children to it.

Save the time and go somewhere else, maybe north to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpmba

40,Good Beach and Boardwalk is a Trip,We went to the beach and like many of the beaches of Southern Cal are long and broad. The parking is hard to get and expensive like it is elsewhere but gping to Venice Beach provides some color. The boardwalk contains lots of souvenir stores and local flavor with a few good places to get a beer. It is fun to stroll through.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10
40,Teenager loved it more than everyone,"This boardwalk is truly incredible to walk down for the variety of people there. From artists to musicians to colorful beach goers. There are dozens of shops with funny t-shirts, tattoo parlors, massage parlors, gift shops etc and also many take away food booths. There are less bars to actually sit and drink or eat at and they are all busy and lively. The muscle beach is also worth visiting along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrscatalano
50,Surfs Up and the Skateboarders are Out,"Get that California Feeling! Walk the Pier, the boardwalk, the beach. Watch the skateboarders perform amazing things in the bowl, take your shoes off and dip your toes in the ocean, watch the muscle men ""exercise"" and experience a look-back at a counter-culture of days gone by.

40,Not for everyone!,"Don't go if you don't want people trying to sell you their music or you have an issue with marijuana. But I found it fun. Lots of interesting people and some of the music was pretty good. Our cab driver told us not to be there at night but it seemed safe enough to me. Lots of shops. Even a doctor's office that had people outside hawking prescriptions for marijuana in 30 min. for $40. I was a little disappointed in muscle beach but only because there were only 3 guys. However, they were certainly well built! We enjoyed it and got jackets and shirts for really good prices once we got to the northern end of the strip. The beach is very pretty and wasn't too crowded when we were there. Beware of the public restrooms! Not only are they dirty but I had some crazy guy knock on my door and then try to carry on a conversation with me the whole time I was in there. I treated it lightly and went on my way without any issue but it was a little unsettling. All in all, I found whole Venice Beach experience different and fun but it wouldn't suit everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenP413

20,Very tacky,"A short trip to Venice beach convinced me never to go back. At times I did not feel safe, with plenty of unsavoury characters around, in particular in the side streets leading to and from the beach.

Along with Hollywood Blvd. I am embarrassed to be a southern Californian, based on these sought after destinations. Please don't judge us by these tourist driven trashy artists.

20,One of the worst beaches I've ever been to,"I don't want to seem like a pessimist, but this was probably the worst beach I have ever been to. I guess I may be biased, I'm from northern California, so I'm used to the rocky beaches we have hidden beneath cliffs with beautiful turquoise and aqua blue water and all the tidepools that we have up here. This beach is completely different. This beach is bleak in comparison. Very flat, dirty and littered with hundreds of people. I guess it's worth seeing at least once just because it's been featured in so many films/tv shows, but other than that it's not exactly nice or fun to hang out here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svictoriaf
40,A Must See,"I'm sure somewhere along the line you've seen Venice Beach on a TV show or in a movie. There's nothing like walking the length of the beach with the shops, the muscle area (my favorite) and the energizing vibe of the place. It's a must see if you are in the area.

The only downer were the beach bathrooms, very unsanitary and disappointing. Parking fee was $10, which is reasonable. Will definitely be returning with my family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Araceli_559
20,Venice Beach,"We hired bikes and rode along the bike path then had a short walk around venice beach. To be honest I was quite disappointed with Venice beach, quite dirty, tourist trap shops and a lot of homeless around. Was good to tick off the list but I won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martyd240
50,Great,"Great place to visit and enjoy the ocean, seems to be more low key than Sana Monica beach and less busy, maybe not quite as family oriented as Sana Monica beach, little harder to find parking also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigsR5910ZP
30,Crowded but particular - A must see,"I was there with family but I've already visited Venice beach. It is always the same.A lot of Tattoo shop, a lot of weird people performing a sort of ""arts"". A street market with things for tourists (T-shirt, masks, painted stones, skulls, woods....). It is colorful, with different kind of music along the street. Nice to visit. There is the possibility to rent a bike and stay between the beach and the street all along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaperogaArchimede
40,Interesting and well worth the trip,"I took my family to Venice Beach during a recent trip to LA. My daughter and I particularly wanted to see the world famous freak show, which was amazing and awesome. The television series ""Freak Show"" is on Netflix and highly recommended. There is too much pot for my liking and people are constantly trying to get you to part with your money, but it's all good. We also enjoyed a bike ride, which was affordable at $7 an hour. Parking is an absolute bear, but we got lucky and scored a free place. The street performers imo were a considerable step above those in Hollywood. Also had a nice lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBCard1
30,Good to see but be careful.,Venice beach was on my to do list from the start of planning out my trip. It lived up to expectations with the landmarks but you have to watch out for people trying to con you. Don't accept anything from people even if they say it's free they expect a large tip. Apart from that enjoy the sights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackr763
50,Venice Beach and Boardwalk,"The most awesome place we've ever been. Wide range of people from here and afar, everyone themselves and not worried about the other guy is doing. Skate park, boutiques, restaurants, entertainment and best of all, the beach and the wonderful sunsets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mobile635054
40,Very interesting walk down Venice beach,"Venice beach is certainly a stop you should take while you are in Los Angeles, however many way think it is sketchy and scary. Lots of activity including a few people handing out their music or ""mixtapes"" and many people with signs saying who knows what. Also a few people that will walk up to you and ask for money for weed. I would definitely say this is a place you don't want to take your kids due to the marijuana usage and amount of homeless people, they may see some sights you don't want them to see. With that being said, Muscle beach and the sights you see will be something you will remember forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whw2217
40,Just hanging out,"It was cool walking along the boardwalk. Lots of art, street performers and shops. I guess Monday afternoon is not as wild as the nights. Also not as many performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelr575
50,Fun in the Sun,"Nothing beats the Venice boardwalk on a hot summer day. Every weirdo in Los Angeles is there to sell you something utterly useless you'll no doubt regret later or extract money out of you in some other semi-legal fashion, and it's all done in a friendly and convivial manner. Jugglers, storytellers, dancers, drummers, exhibitionists, hopelessly bad musicians and open air cafes serving overpriced, awful food and drink all beckon you and your wallet. If you get tired of the crowds, you're right next to a huge sandy beach, one of the best in California, perfect for a barefoot stroll in the warm and gentle surf or a near-instantaneous sunburn. Bring your sunblock, leave your good taste and sophistication at home and check out one of the wackiest and happiest venues LA has to offer. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProPhotoLA
30,Not Quite What Expected,"The first time we had come to California, we did the tour. We stopped by V.B. and it was very brief and before a lot of the places had opened. While nice, we had to come back later and check it out.Well, we have been back several times now, and still make a point to swing by there for best fish tacos place and what not. There are endless bums and panhandlers bothering you, so brace yourself. Tons of t-shirt and pot dispensaries, along with black dudes trying to get you to listen and buy signed CD's. It is really annoying.On the bright side, the police are around if you should need them. But there is a lot of just hippies and bums everywhere. It is not glamorous at all. The gym location there smelled like urine. Not sure what is up with all of that.Would I tell anyone to stay away? No. But I would say brace yourself for the filth that will approach you trying to sell you things the whole walk up and down the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,很有活力的地方！,"Many great shops and restaurants. People at the beach are doing all kinds of activities: surfing, listening to concert, skating, rolling skating looks interesting!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854nicolel
40,Nice beach,"If ou want to rest, relax and enjoy the see this is a good place to be as it is not crowded as the Sant Monica Beach. However, Venice beach as two different areas, one more alternative and one more posh. It depends what you prefer to do and to see but I recommend to walk around and to explore the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvcardoso
10,Not family oriented,"Walked the Venice Beach walk. A lot of people selling trinkets and shirts and .... Not a family oriented location. Many people smoking weed. While I did not feel in danger, I did not feel safe either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveHawaii13
30,Lots to see,Great place to people watch if you into that sort of thing. Many small touristy shops. Parking can be difficult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleomissy
40,One of my travel wishes,"I wanted to walk along the beach and visit the santa monica pier. The beach was busy. Several people out and about biking, skateboarding, and tanning. Venice beach is uhmmm nothing like home. I enjoyed walking through but the smoke shops and stuff are nothing like home back in my bible belt bubble lol. My kids kept asking what that smell was and I was honest. There was a man on the beach who growled at us but we just kept walking. When we got home and family members would ask how Disney land was venice beach was the first thing they talked (and still do) about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyhh2015
50,"Great place to walk, people watch","This is a great area to walk around, people watch, shop and eat. Lots of performers. Lots to see and do. Beautiful beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252ering
50,White men cant jump,Awesome place to chill. Played some b ball on the courts from the movie white men cant jump. Heaps of places to chill. Can get you green prescription there too if you are into that. There were a lot of people smoking weed there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenHancock
40,Must see promenade in Venice beach,"Forget Muscle Beach & 3rd St Promenade in Santa Monica, explore the Bohemian Chic Abbot Kinney Blvd in Venice Beach. Enchanting design in clothing shops, scrumptious cafes, organic restaurants, and busy wine bars.Must see !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean_GuyD_12
30,Good to see,"It's good to see the famous Venice beach, but I wouldn't want to stay there too long. It was super busy, and not the cleanest place I've been to. However, it's an experience to just walk around and take everything in; try and find an impromptu street show/performance as it makes the visit seem more worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themikeKsmith
50,First time to the beach!,"Taking my 15 month old son to Venice Beach was better than I expected. Not too many tourists this time of year, and the when the waves hit his feet for the first time he fell back! It was beautiful, clean, and there were many places to visit and sight see. Loved passing by Muscle Beach as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArmyButton
50,Surprise!,"Beautiful, wide, clean, eventful beach! Ignore the reviews. Take a chance to see this gorgeous place full of personality and pizzazz!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64pennyj
30,St Marks Place on the beaxh,"For those from NY or anyone who's been near an ocean before, don't bother- unless you want to see the Pacific Ocean because it's a series of smoke shops, tattoo parlors, and stoners and crack heads. But there are better places to see the pacific- Santa Monica or Malibu.. There is a skate park where the local kids with talent show off their skills.. But other than that, it's a bit degenerate and a complete tourist trap and not in a positive way but rather a cheap souvenir way. Skip Venice and go to Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minx1290
30,Go to see the Pumpkin People!,"Venice Beach is kinda seedy, with tacky T-shirt shops, and refreshments, but the highlight (?) for us was the scary pumpkin-coloured people working out at Muscle Beach. If these are what people who work out aspire to look like, I'm happy being a couch potato. What a weird colour! Nevertheless, very entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972jennym
40,"Great hang out, although quite busy","We stopped by here and hired a couple of bikes to just nip up and down the cycle path that hugs the beach for several miles. Apart from having to dodge quite a few other people on bikes, blades, boards, foot, along the path, it made for quite a pleasant bike ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoyo237
50,Bohemian magic.,"We hired bikes and cycled along the route from Marina del Ray to Santa Monica.The best part was through Venice beach.The boardwalk is an amazing collection of Hippy/Bohemian fashion shops and of course tacky but addictive souvenir shops.We wished we had more time here you could spend at least a whole day just watching the fantastic street performers many much better than I have paid to see.The beach itself is long,wide and with beautiful clean,golden sand.It is an unforgettable place and just goes to demonstrate the diversity of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jomac151
40,It was just like you thought it would be.,"Seriously. It was exactly the type of beach I always thought it would be. Bicycles, skateboards, graffiti, sellers of things, ice cream and t shirts. All types walking around and enjoying the sun. It was perfectly lovely to visit if you avoid the public restrooms, which is also quite normal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363krystald
30,Great Beach but a bit of a dump,"We stopped here for about an hour and a half as part of our full day tour of LA and that was about an hour longer than necessary.Our driver/guide described it as being like Blackpool on speed and that's a pretty good description except Blackpool is significantly cleaner nowadays.The beach is lovely but just further back are many stalls and shops selling tat and numerous ""street entertainers"" doing their thing to a greater or lesser extent.It was fun to see the skateboarders but the place just didn't have a great feel to it. Well we've been there, seen it and wouldn't have any desire to re-visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prefdavid
40,Fun beach,"I have to admit I wanted to hangout at this beach to get a good look at some of the LA celebrities ;).. ( had seen some check-ins on Instagram )Lots of fun options exist on Venice beach like surfing , skateboarding , cycling , people watching! Live music!! Do take a stroll on the boardwalk, grab a drink and enjoy the sunset!We walked up to Santa Monica pier and it was beautiful after sundown :). It was a day well spent on our last day of LA trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twotravelisseurs
50,Fun boardwalk,"Here with teens, fun to people watch. We went in shops, played chess, watched skaters then swam in the ocean and walked to Santa Monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972LizC
50,Nice beach - hire a bike and explore!,"Lovely and clean, lots to do. We hired bikes and explored the promenade. Muscle beach was interesting and the little restaraunts were lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angiecK2271VX
30,Seedy but worth a visit,"So many homeless people which was very sad to see particularly as they were ignored totally by those going about their ""normal"" lives. We stayed in the area so a walk down the beach was essential - if you are not close it probably isn't worth a detour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EFPV
50,Loads going on and an excellent visit.,"Loads of activity and worth a visit whether for a day, a long weekend or a week on the beach. Beaches are excellent, loads of skateboards, skaters, skate park, Muscle Beach, and art stalls. Car parking free in streets adjacent to boardwalk and easy to find a space a few blocks back. Good restaurants on Washington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christW4739LP
50,Tranquil,A walk along this beach is something else. You can hire bikes to travel from Venice Beach along to Santa Monica. Lots of unique things to see and do. Well worth the stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaysI7849ER
50,Fun place to see.,Venice Beach is a must see in LA. So many different kinds of people. The people watching is the most fun. Lots of junk to buy and I mean junk. Very clean and a place to say I've been there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883nickih
50,Nice views and amazing beach front,"Enjoyed a great day in Venice Beach!! The views were awesome, the beach was amazing and the Muscle Beach area was the best part!!! Very nice looking men and are willing to take pictures with you!! The volleyball courts were packed full and the beach was busy. Great views of watching surfing and the ones attempting to surf. The rock area is a great spot to take pictures!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
30,What an experience!,"Visited around Sunset with family. The beach and streets were clean. A lot of people smoking pot openly, it was everywhere. Glad I visited, but wouldn't go back. It was fun seeing the sites where many movies were filmed. Lucked out with street parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTraveler052
20,Didn't Feel Safe,"I went to VB during the afternoon. It's a dump and there are a lot of homeless people. One man yelled at me as I walked down the boardwalk and continued yelling at me as I walked on my way b/c I ignored him. It has a very hippie feel and you can sometimes smell marijuana as you walk the boardwalk. There are a lot of shops and bars. It was like a VERY VERY rundown version of Santa Monica. If you are into the young hippie scene and want to interact with some local homeless people or young college-age kids, this is the place for you. If you prefer three star services or better, you might be a little nervous here :-P I was traveling solo and did not like the vibe of Venice Beach. I didn't like the neighborhood around there either. I had to walk two blocks up to the main road to get an Uber. It's not a nice area. I won't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen31373
20,Dirty and unsafe!,We visited this beach while on a tour. If you want to spend some time on a beach--head to Santa Monica. We felt very unsafe while walking around (we were there around 11am).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txtravel021
50,It is what it is!,"We went here on our second day in LA as a part of a guided tour. When I gave our teen children our last day to revisit anything they wanted, they unanimously said Venice Beach. There is truly no place like it. Kind of like New Orleans in a bathing suit. Sure there are homeless folks and guys pitching their music (don't ever accept a CD from anyone, thank you tour guide!) but everyone's cool, the beach itself is never crowded and the souvenir shops are pretty reasonable. Now if they could just make the water warm!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilMC64
50,Perfect for a beach and city break!,"We stayed on the beach in a rented condo and really enjoyed our trip!There's lots to do and see-golds gym, bike rides, good restaurants and good transport into LA which means it's the best of both worlds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diddles1990
30,Visit just to say...,"Visit just to say that you did! It's a place that you must see. The shops are very reasonably priced. The beach is nice!! My sons friend put his shoes down and walked a few steps away and went back for them and they were gone...someone stole them!! Other than that, it was a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khbarrilleaux
20,Not your quiet relaxing beach,"If you are looking for a more picturesque beach that is more quiet, try along the Palos Verdes coast. There are many beautiful beaches that most tourist miss. Sure Venice can be zany but also very crowded unless this is the experience one is looking for, I would go south to Redondo or Torrance beach. From the Terranea Resort in Palos Verdes one can walk down the public pathways and see some lovely sites as well as the Point Vicente Lighthouse. There is also a beautiful view of the Palos Verdes coastline from the walk along the coast from the lighthouse area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/900diane
40,visit once and never again,Embrace your weird side with a quick stroll down the beach. Quick otherwise the homeless will ask for money. Plenty to see and do. LOTS of homeless and people trying to scam you with the CD trick. Check out the canals which are a short way inland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412teganm
50,Venice Beach,What a great place to spent the day. Walking through the stores in the boardwalk and sitting on the grass for picnic with a breeze from the sea made our time there enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmirY249
40,Fun place to visit,"After spending a disappointing time at Santa Monica Beach, it was a breath of fresh air to make the short drive to Venice Beach. Fun and vibrant atmosphere and the beach had good parking and was nice and clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevesGoingPlaces
40,"Great sites , food and fresh air","While walking down Venice beach's Boardwalk, you are constantly entertained by people watching, watching various groups performing, eating in the sidewalk cafe and strolling passed houses along the cement Boardwalk. There's so many different kinds of people to see that if you do like to people watch you'll be entertained all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx
50,"Amazing sites, every walk of life, safer than you think","Venice beach has every type of person you could think to bump into.The beach is great.The hotels are reasonable.Restaurants are ok, not the best.Overall this is a place to people watch and take in the atmosphere of the true Californian. Bring a camera!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SexualTyrannosaurus
50,"Breathe in and say ""Ahhh!""","It was great getting to Venice Beach and being in the sand and the ocean. It was filled with families and friends just enjoying a beautiful day. We purchased some of the seasoned fresh fruit (watermelon, pineapples, coconut and mango w/chili powder and lemon/lime juice) which was refreshing and delicious. We were able to see a celebrity basketball game and Ron Artest was playing. We saw a man carrying a HUGE yellow snake. There was the muscles on the beach working out. So all in all, Venice Beach is all they say it is! It was a little difficult finding cheap parking and the bathrooms are horrible but the fun was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AstroSoulGoddess
30,Nothing Too Special,"Venice Beach was fun to see, simply because of the fame of the beach. However, it wasn't anything ""wow"" worthy. There were a lot of tourist shops but for the most part, it wasn't anything that memorable in my mind. I say it's fun to go to say you've been there, but I didn't feel the need to spend a lot of extra time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KDM00
40,Beautiful clean sands and water,"The beach is lovely, big enough to not be crowded after lunchtime (before which it would likely be too hot to enjoy anyway). The boardwalk is of course dominated by typical beach tourist stalls and is much busier. Parking lots are available, but generally range in price around a $12 average",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8643LNmatthews
40,A Lot of Fun,We had a great time in Venice Beach. Our favorite part was the Venice Beach Freak Show! $5 admission and well worth the price. They run shows about every 15 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays from noon until 6:00 (I think). There are many artists selling their works up and down the boardwalk. The public bathrooms are disgusting so make sure you go before you get there. Plenty of places to eat. It was a long walk from the boardwalk to the waterfront. We found parking in a garage for $20. It's definitely worth a trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ufgirl76
50,Venice beach,I always enjoy going to venice beach! This beach is beautiful and it's only a walk away from Santa Monica beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorifurey5655
50,Venice Beach,Beautiful sand and water. We didn't swim much cause it was cold. The only negative was all the homelessness/street people. So sad to see so many. The walk and bike along the path was enjoyable as was the shopping. Some good deals to be had. Lunch was delicious at a restaurant right on the path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jok76
50,Clean warm and busy,"The water is very warm, and shallow great for surfing. No rocks on the bottom. Very clean sand and beach, but extremely busy. Tons of shops, performers, and things to see. Very safe friendly atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290vickyd
50,cultural experience,"Beautiful, wide beach. Be sure to stroll the boardwalk. Lots of souvenirs, and great for people-watching. Sometimes you'll see a movie being filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815jamese
30,Kind of dirty area bad parking options,"I preferred Santa Monica because it was so pretty. Venice seemed dirty and I just didn't feel like it was a ""wow"" beach. Kind of disappointed. The shops and food seemed high priced for what you get and there wasn't anything that stood out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8965XNmichellem
10,I do not know why anyone would visit this beach,"I'm not sure where in Venice Beach people visit that love it but the waking path along the beach that we walked from Santa Monica to there was not impressive at all. I was soooo surprised by the vagrants and homeless people. They are allowed to set up tents ALL along the paths and you smelled the trash before you saw them. I am originally from NYC so I get the homeless environment, I was just taken back that the city would allow such trash, garbage, furniture and tents there. I can understand allowing the people to hang out there not just all of their trash. I would not go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197christinem
40,Just like the movies!,"Neat place to walk. I'd advise sticking to the daylight hours if you're traveling with kids as the sights and smells change after dark. The pathway was loaded with people skating, biking, walking, etc. just like you see in the movies. Got to see Muscle Beach which was cool - they even have stadium seating for spectators.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tlrcia
20,Not that exciting,I was disappointed in Venice Beach. The area was somewhat of a hang out for derelicts - not impressed. I thought there would be more creativity but it was just henna tattoo stand after the next.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKOvacation
30,Interesting and unexpected,So we walked from Santa Monica Prier to Venice Beach and let's say it's like two different worlds. Let me just say I'm not really a beach person unless it's the Caribbean and don't really get in the water. From a distance it looks lovely and pretty much like any other beach. What is interesting is the diverse and mixed group of people you will meet along the way. Remain open minded and take it all in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmzD_12
40,Nice beach to watch the ocean from.,I sat on the beach and watched the ocean and other beach goers. The ocean breeze made it comfortable to sit for several hours. There are many sea birds on the beach. The birds are fairly tame. I had several birds eat crackers from my hand. I hope to visit Venice beach again next summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crescent98
40,Stunning Beach,Busy area with lots of activity going on. We visited on a beautiful sunny day on the weekend and the place was hopping. There were a group of dancers there putting on a show and performing several acrobatic flips and jumps. They were very good. The beach area is white sand and clean with lovely tall palm trees. Glad we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesat2013
50,Great place for people watching,Entertaining place with lots of people form every walk of life. Always very sad to see so many homeless people but they do not bother anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h0nestcritic
50,Loved it,"What a place, smiled the whole time I was there!The beach was gorgeous, we cycled through it, the buzz was amazing, can't really explain just so nice!Loved the whole work out places around the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turner022
40,Full of Character(s),Smellier than on previous visits (urine & weed!) but the characters and location are just as interesting. The beach is clean and we ate at a really good & healthy all-dayrestaurant (forgot the name),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trailflix
40,Ignore negative reviews,Was apprehensive of what to expect reading so many bad reviews but the area is an enjoyable slice of L.A life . Great just to stand and watch the eclectic mix of people. My son enjoyed the Muscle Beach area. Cheap souvenirs if that's your thing otherwise go or cycle through and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianme97
40,nice day trip for the family,We enjoyed walking the boardwalk and taking in all the local art and the laid back California vibe. The beach was well kept and great for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sh610
30,Beach Only review,"I wouldn't call it a destination beach. If you like waves, they are much better in southern Orange county. If you don't, the water is rough and no place for little kids. The beach is 200 yards long which on a hot days means walking over hot coals. Otherwise just a long way to the water. Bringing kids and kids stuff is outright annoying. The sand was a nice texture and clean. Yes, they have bathrooms, but none of them flushed and they were filthy, no actually worse then that. And there were homeless people all around the bathrooms. I live in Oakland, when I'm at the beach I want a break from reality. Sorry, for those that only want to hear good stuff, but just because it's a trendy town, doesn't make the beach rate as a good beach. I do suggest Flake on Rose Avenue for coffee and a breakfast burrito. Top notch espresso. Also head up Montana in Santa Monica 6-10th ave for some nice quiet restaurants off the busy beaten path.steve",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6311AYsteveng
30,Not What You Think It Is,"Every tourist says they want to check out the infamous Venice Beach, but it is full of homeless pot heads and people trying to give you their mix tape and for the most part is fairly scumy. That being said it is a Los Angeles trademark and truly on of a kind. No matter how disgusting it some how makes for a fun and unique walk down the strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dstreeton
40,Different...,"Very glad we visited but compared to Santa Monica it is very different, it is good to go for a walk along the beach and see what people have made and are selling, I even saw a man with a snake and another with a parrot on his shoulder!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay8991
40,"Fun,inexpensive day","LOTS of people (watching)! Beach is nice and there are lots of free entertainment. The boardwalk is fun, inexpensive souvenir shopping...great for teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel2202
50,A must do!,"Keep an open mind and you will have a great time!We went twice during our stay in LA, the weekend is busier but in our opinion better as there is more to see and more stalls.There are local authority run car parks at both ends of the beach offering cheap day parking.The place is so diverse it's hard to describe. Rollerblader/skaters dance and work out to music. The skill of all age/ability groups in the skateboard park is a must see. Muscle beach...speaks for itself! You will find all walks of life are here, be respectful and you will get along fine.A couple of words of caution, if you are handed something and you take it, expect to pay for it!There are street performers that, whilst very entertaining, will drag you into their shows, be aware at the end they will expect money and will shame you into parting with quite a lot!Have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieS632
50,You will always run into...,You will always run into interesting people on the boardwalk . If its someone trying to sell you CD or the funist wino on the beach. This was a trip well worth it. Oh the beach is nice too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidaE7048SV
50,Go people watching on a beautiful day at the beach,"A definite must for people watchers. Blots of eclectic fun stuff...funky shops, handmade goods. Rent a bike...or just stroll. Wear comfortable shoes and get a little walk on while you enjoy the sea breeze. Tons of little restaurants for a bite to eat. Muscle Beach...skate board performances ......sometimes you might catch a drumming circle at sunset. Lots of street performers. It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCMCLover
50,People watch,"Be careful what you expect. Your kids will see some crazy things but it is a great place to people watch and get some ""fair food"". The temperatures are always good and the breeze is great. You could spend one hour or all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acahillmd
40,Must see,"Fun and quirky: a definite must see if in the area. There are all types here. We were time poor and would have loved the opportunity to explore. Lots of stalls, vendors, entertainment, skaters, joggers and so much more line the boardwalk and surrounds. The beach itself is pristine. It's a very long beach; you have to walk through a lot of sand before reaching the water. We got to Venice Beach via the hop-on hop-off bus in LA (green route). Have been told not ideal to visit at night but we had no problems during daylight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901charmaineh
50,Amazing Beach!!,Make this a priority to visit during your stay in Los Angeles. The weather was perfect and the ocean waves are definitely a lot different than the Atlantic. Make sure to visit the Muscle Beach gym while you're there. Lots of shops and unique items to purchase as souvenirs!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinac728
50,Thrilling place to visit!,The biggest plus for me is that it's on the ocean! The other best aspect of this beach is the shops/vendors. There are many unique items to see and purchase.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
40,Venice Beach in July,"It's everything you'd expect a big, touristy boardwalk to be at this time of year. Tons of people, both tourist and transient. Tons of shops and many miles long. Weather was perfect in the 80's with some wind to make it more comfortable. Tons of walkers and bikes on the paved trail along the beach.Spent time both browsing shops, vendors and time on the beach. A crew was filming a commercial which we watched for a little while. We also enjoyed skaters of all ages in the skateboard park until after dark. Great sunset and view to Santa Monica and beyond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bstrbrwn
50,You DON'T Miss This!!,"If you're visiting Southern Calif...this is a must -see. Venice is a fabulous cornucopia of people...You want diversity..come on down! I assure you...you won't know WHAT to look at first. In the summer months you'll see skaters, runners, bicyclists...some clothed...some..not so much. But, HEY this is California. There's the famous Muscle Beach...cafes and restaurants galore. Shops, a museum of the exotic...AND the ocean in sight the entire time..You will DEFINITELY be talking about your visit to Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507bethanyf
50,Fun Afternoon,"My daughter (28) and I spent the afternoon walking along the boardwalk of this iconic beach. After walking out the pier, we enjoyed the various shops, places to eat, watching the skateboarding, the buskers and of course the eye candy of Muscle Beach. This is a great way to spend a day. There was also something being filmed the day we were there. Definitely something for everyone and would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMcFadyen
30,Venice beach,"Venice beach on a cloudy day is still Venice beach, from the throngs of people mulling from shop to shop. VB is home to thousands different walks of life, from small business owners to homeless people sleeping under King palms after their acting career went belly up",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/810ovidium
40,Just what you might expect!,"Tacky but colourful businesses (beware, some of the merchant stands don't like photography), all kinds and manner of people, Muscle Beach section, skateboard rink and wide beaches. Something you need to experience at least once. My advice would be to use the washroom immediately before going here - the public ones provided are incredibly filthy. Park at either end and allow about 2 hours to walk down and back for sightseeing (more, of course, if you want to participate in recreational activities).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnTheBear

40,People watching at its best!,"Sunshine, ocean, music, people, food, bikes...I can't think of enough good things to say. At Venice Beach you can participate or watch, but there is fun to be had. Watch skaters, or basketball, or drum circle. This place is BUSY so if you don't like crowds this isn't the beach for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LOOKHIGHER
50,Fun Beach,"Venice Beach isn't as safe (especially at night) or as clean as Santa Monica Beach, BUT it's great for young adults or the party-type crowd. Lots of good roof-top bars nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharkInAFishTank
40,Joe Gold Wouldn't Believe This,"As a former competitive bodybuilder, a visit to ""Muscle Beach"" was obligatory during my first visit to Los Angeles on business. With a day off, I had visions of bodybuilders working out in the outdoor gym I remember reading about in muscle magazines 30 years ago. What I found was quit different. The beach itself is great with wonderful views of the coastline. The ""gym"" is now being turned into a bodybuilding museum. Not open yet, it might be a future attraction worth seeing. The outdoor gym is there with all the equipment, but the bodybuilders seem to be no longer present. The place looks largely abandon of people working out save for a couple of fitness guys. The boardwalk area was a paved surface roughly 12 feet wide that had various ""interesting people"" lining both side of it's 1/2 mile length. Musicians, fortune tellers purveyors of various trinkets, junk and otherwise worthless touristy items; it felt like you were walking down a gauntlet. Various eating places lined and retail shops lined one side of the boardwalk while the vendors, et al were on the other. A very interesting mix, if you're in to people watching. Once again, if you've never been, it's worth to time to say you've been there. Beyond that, there's probably better places to spend your time and money if you are so inclined",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greghY283TX
50,Worth experiencing at least once!,"Visited Venice back in March solo to visit a buddy, it was really cool. I'm from TN so it was really different the traditional FL or any southern beach scene. Like waaaaay different. If you visit GET A BIKE!. First day or so I walked miles and didn't really get any where. A bike helped get me to Malibu and Santa Monica effortlessly. Very very cool place!! Taking my 8 y/o son back with me end of July for a week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ben0118

30,Different,Wow...lots of unusual people not a family oriented place. The area we were in was a little on the dirty side.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieblatz
40,The beach & the boardwalk...,"It's a 3mile beach, but all the action is on the Boardwalk, which isa cultural fenomenon known for it's eccentricities. During the summer there is street entertainment like, musicians, singers, jugglers, acrobats, magicians, fortune tellers and others. It's a virtual sidewalk circus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1trekky
40,Different perspective,I read all the reviews and I wasn't sure what to expect.The shops along the back of the beach are not glamorous but I found the beach to be quite beautiful and clean.We went on a Friday. I'm not sure if weekdays make a difference.There were families on the beach and the whole experience was really good while we watched all the surfers.Had a real nice time on a real nice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
50,Not what i expected!,"Being an hours walk along Santa Monica Beach, I assumed it would be very similar. But when you enter Venice beach, the vibe completely changes! The atmosphere is great, and has a bit of a 'hippy' feel to it! If I go back to LA, I will definitely come back here!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophie1988_06
40,Always entertaining!,"Venice Beach Boardwalk has been an iconic landmark for years and it still delivers. Muscle Beach, paddle tennis and skateboard park are all unique spots for out of towners. There are still many homeless people and street performers, but still a spot to see if new to Los Angeles sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathrins364
50,Worth a visit!,Venice beach in my opinion is not as family orientated as Santa Monica beach but is worth a visit. We saw some very drunk people while we were there. Hiring bikes from Santa Monica beach and cycling to Venice beach (about 15/20 mins) for some food or drinks is a nice thing to do but I'd rather stay in Santa Monica than Venice beach area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikkim2014

50,Don't Forget NZ!,"Definitely a very nice beach and I'd recommend anyone who is in the area to see the beach. Very wide strip of sand, and the entire beach is very beautiful.There is an area with flags from quite a lot of countries. Except for the New Zealand flag. They even put the Australian flag there, but completely forgot NZ.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McCabeNZ
40,Venice Beach - seedy but worth your time...,"First off, we live the area and it is great to eat and shop and people watch but they have a real problem with junkies and homeless folks. This trip the area along the boardwalk was jam packed with beggars and junkies and folks wall to wall along the beach edge. After a while I suppose one can overlook this human tragedy and social problem but within striking distance to the beautiful beachfront views,..it makes you pause. We had a 6 year old in tow and she managed to entertain herself and the parks along the Santa Monica border are fine for some diversion,...but the area is a bit edgier than one might hope for. Otherwise, vibrant and worth a visit - but just be prepared....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDaddyAlan
40,"Venice is a freak show, but worth visiting and lots of good places to eat","If you are going to visit LA, then you must go to Venice. This is the tourist trap of LA, but it is pretty interesting. You can check out ""Muscle Beach"" where Arnold used to work out, and more interesting, you can watch the buskers juggling chain saws, and some world class skate boardersI personally love Jody Maroni's for their sausage, but there are some poke places that I want to check out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734mikem
30,Better looking on TV than in person,"To be fair, our visit was in the morning on a charter tour, but Venice Beach was grungy looking and generally unimpressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srobby
40,Something for everyone,"A great place to spend time, even if it's only to people watch. A great stretch of beach, with hot sunny weather. Plenty of stores, places to grab a bite to eat, bike path, or just stroll along the boardwalk. It was extremely busy when we were there, with a strong police presence, but it was the 4th of July long weekend. Plenty of public transport or Hop on Hop off buses go there. Somewhere you could spend the entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm05060
50,A little bit of everyone! Diversity! Great beach.,"That's what you will see. A great place to people watch. We stayed on the beach at Venice Suites hotel and met some great folks. Convenient to local restaurants (not chains), walking distance to shops and the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tj_ncinci
50,Nice,Visited here whilst on our travels and whilst there is a lot of homeless people and people walking around with boards asking for money etc they do not bother you. The broadwalk is full of a variety of shops. The beach is worth visit but its quite a walk on the sand and the sand was quite hot as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinac492

40,People,"From Santa Monica to Venice, a walk on the beach is worth experiencing. People watching optional. Many come to work out or practice their juggling, acrobatic or physical routines. Stores tend to be tourist traps. A few blocks off the beach (main st) and value improves. Personal preference is moonlit nights or dawn contemplation on the beach. Bring a towel if you plan to sit down",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMJ11

20,"Dirty, loud and crowded area","I heard so many positive things about Venice beach and was looking forward to seeing it but unfortunately we didn't enjoy our time there. It was dirty, loud and intimidating. You couldn't feel safe or comfortable there and there were a lot of junkies and homeless people wandering around. It was crazy to see so much poverty next to million dollar houses only meters away. Was not impressed although the views of the sunset were lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crystalarts
30,Good people watching,Area is a bunch of touristy shops but go to walk around to just see things. There are some interesting characters if you are into people watching. Do not take any CDs from anyone. They are not free. They want you to pay for them. They are all over the place. Be sure to park on the side streets and walk to the beach through the canals. It is very pretty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1988GGsandys

40,Great Boardwalk,"This boardwalk has to be the biggest and best one we have ever been on. Parking cost only $9 for the whole day. Tons of shops and interesting people and things to watch. The smell of weed is common so be prepared to explain that to your kids,lolThe beach itself is a rather wide beach so make sure you pick the area near the parking area so you don't walk 200 yards thru the sand to get to it, by parking it maybe about 50 yards,,, huge beach! Worth the time there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srmccracken
30,Variety the throughout the walk,"I have been down the Venice Beach walk a few times, but is alway great to see the different offerings and types of people, which make up the different walks of life. Is worth spending a day strolling down the strip and looking at the different things on offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorBurchell
40,This is not a beach for swimming and relax!,"Wide beautiful beach. Attractive to stay on the coast. But it is not good for swimming. The surf is very strong. The waves are too long. Good for surfing not for swimming. During the day, the homeless are almost absent, but at night a lot. You can find free Parking in side streets nearby. The perfect place to relax and breathe in the ocean air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Elena108_108

50,My Favorite Place on Earth,"Cant say enough about Venice Beach. It was eveything I imagined and more..the view of the sunset was amazing, the boardwalk was alive with people and sound, and the experience was priceless. After visiting this place once I will be back again! You must visit Venice Beach at least once in ur life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennethm31
50,Fun & Sun,"Go to Venice Beach. Walk along the shops. Walk along the beach. It is very interesting, very safe, and great people watching. All different kinds of folks, all enjoying the day, all seemed perfectly happy. The outdoor music was great, the oddballs were odd, but the energy and free feeling made it a great day at the beach. I am glad I made it to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonGoes
50,Beautiful clean relaxing,"We stopped here for 4/5 hours bought a few towels chilled out on the very clean beach , I didn't swim but by all accounts the water was lovely I did get my feet wet.Had a beer at the many cafes lining the roads and had a great spot to view the people the palm trees and the water. Well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizlolies47
20,I guess if you want a bunch of cheap tourist stalls and some muscle,"At this point, I think Venice Beach's appeal to visitors is just to catch a quick view of any body builders in the beach area and check it off your list of stops you have made. Really, there's not any other reason to go, in my opinion. Well, you could go for the actual beach. Of course, you could also go to Santa Monica or numerous other beaches that are nice and roomy. And you could go to Venice Beach to look at all the tourist trap shops selling their junk. But if you really are looking for a pair of yoga pants with ""It ain't gonna spank itself"" written across the rear, then this is the spot for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougmendoza
20,"Awesome sunset, but..","Had to stop at this beach to see the sunset before getting back on the road, this place is crowded with homeless, beggars, and want to be artists begging for attention, the whole place smelled like urine and there was a lot of trash around.. On our way back to our car we saw some rats coming out of some food vendors/restaurants. So sad, been to this beach years ago and it was so much prettier. Not family friendly..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B4000DGandreac

20,Total let down,"15,000 miles of travel to see this stretch of concrete, bad manners and hype.

40,"Not the cleanest, but lots to see","We took the boys to Venice beach last week and met some friends there. They brought a basketball which was perfect. For boys, it's a must to bring a basketball. So many courts to play on. They played basketball and then headed to the ""muscle beach"" playground. Tons of workout things and just fun things to do. Then, to cool off, they jumped in the ocean. Nice and cool waters, plus not too crowded. Fun watching surfers catching some waves. Overall fun beach. Try avoiding the bathrooms at all costs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skimmilk09
20,Venice Beach,"Visited Venice Beach today with my husband and kids. It was a freak show, there were a lot of bums, and one bum screamed out that he wanted to kill someone. My kids were scared and there were freaks and bums everywhere we went. Plus the boardwalk was very dirty. The only positive thing I have to say is it was entertaining, but definitely not a place to bring kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubbarocco
50,A nice day for the beach.,"Our last full day in California and of course a trip to Venice Beach is a must. My wife had never been. We arrived and parking was no problem in the beach lot. There were plenty of spots. We decided to walk along the boardwalk at first and then cut over to the bike and walking area on the beach. The crown wasn't to big but there was a nice mix of people. The beach had a few people but mainly only the kids were in the water. The water isn't too cold for California standards but after being used to East Coast South Florida of Central America it was cold. not too cold to go in, but not warm enough to want to stand around in the water. We then continued walking down the bike/ walking path and at the end returned walking along the boardwalk checking the shots and then eating at Figtree's. We thought about stopping at Muscle Beach and the outside gym and doing a workout, but decided we were on vacation and we could take it easy. They also have paddle tennis for those interested. There is plenty to do for the whole family. There is also a play area for the kids. A nice way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/risitodeplata

20,Old and overrated,"The beach is lovely and great for surfing as the waves appeared to be there all the time.An unusual mix of people but felt very uneasy due to the large number of homeless, most are ok and just having a hard time but on our visit we saw several aggressive beggars and unusual behaviour indicative of drug use.There is a constant smell of cannabis and the shops are old and very tacky.The muscle beach itself is small and old.Overall, depends what you like, the beach itself is nice and there are lots of tourist but go to another beach if you have the option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesocks1101

50,A happy hippy dippy wild time,"It's like a movie here! Roller skaters, weight lifters, artists, magicians, hustlers, surfers and incense! Take it all in and laugh with the joke-- that it isn't a joke... Laid back California is as hippy dippy as it seems, but it is also sweet and colorful, loud and crazy, kind and boho, all the while accepting of most while looking good in the eternal sunshine sipping on something yummy while cruising the boardwalk and chilling to the good vibes. 🌷",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubbly_sunshine
40,Nice beach - weird in the early morning,"Had the opportunity to stay ""steps"" from this beach this past week. It's clear that a huge amount of effort is made keeping it clean and safe. LAPD are visible in cars, on foot and overhead in helicopters. Early morning brings beach cleanup - with something that looks like a giant kitty litter scoop/rake being dragged by a tractor over, and over, and over the sand. Works well - beach is made clean and well groomed. The sound from the machine, however, is catastrophically bad. Homeless people sleep in the alcoves under beachfront properties and use the early dawn hours at the local public bathrooms to wash up before the tourists arrive. Regretfully, many of the homeless are caught in the snare of substance abuse and the mentally ill are also well represented. A slight odor of urine permeates the beach itself when the wind is just right.Further down near Muscle Beach and the Venice sign is a total carnival atmosphere - safe in daylight, but I have no idea after the sun goes down. People are selling hats, shirts, bathing suits, tattoos, henna, medicinal marijuana licenses - you name it. Crazy performers, too. I did see 2 men having some very adult 'private' time in broad daylight - so heads up if you have kids. Not what I expected. To end on a positive note, I will say I had the best Gyro I've had in years there. Glad I've come - glad I've stayed to see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorktownTraveler411
10,Custom shirts 3. 1921 ocean front walk,We recommend not buying shirts from this company. It is a huge rip off. They do no post their prices and we got ripped off for 100.00 for two tshirts. They do not do refunds or exchanges and that is not posted clearly either. Do not shop here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769connieh
30,Not my cup of tea,"Very crowded, loud, and felt like a bit of a tent city. 'Artists' selling their wares line the walkway and performers attempt to entertain, but there was an extreme lack of talent. Given time constraints, I would opt for a different beach personally.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GR8TravLs

30,Worth a visit,I got the hop on hop off bus here from Hollywood. It's a place full of activity. Took a few pics on the beech and on the boardwalk. Some good dining options. Only spent a few hours here as didn't feel there was an awful lot to do. Is an interesting place just to visit briefly in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMN1986
10,Worst Beach I've Ever Been To,"Homeless everywhere! They're all tweaking out on something... meth maybe? The boardwalk isn't really enjoyable at day or night because of them. Tent cities everywhere. I decided not to take a late night walk to the ocean because I saw many drug addicts walking the beach. You can't even enjoy a drink at night outside at a local pub because of the homeless yelling, blocking views, and begging for money & cigarettes. Boardwalk basically shuts down at 830 and there are only 2 or 3 pubs to buy beer, no liquor. I'm an east coaster and am extremely disappointed I flew out all this way for this crap hole. Gave 1 star, would've given lower if I could.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesH9036MZ
20,Ugh,"I guess if you've never been you should walk the boardwalk at least once. But man, dirty, smelly, junk filled. The beach is gorgeous and the homes are fun to look at.

40,The beach for the masses,"The beach itself is really beautiful. And there is a lot of people watching to be done...A real mixture of cultures and people on the beach, boys playing strange games, Asians rehearsing an act...interesting, but not peaceful, at least not during the day, and even less on a Saturday or Sunday.

If you are unsure about your safety, then leave valuables at home. Having said that, the beach is wonderful on a sunny day. Clean sands, awesome waves. The only nuisance being the overly protective lifeguards.The area behind the beach has a nice bike path connecting to Santa Monica beach which is also perfect for jogging. There are plenty of eclectic shops, however, I would stay away from them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GourmandTrashPanda

40,A True Los Angeles Experience,"Venice Beach has its own special charm. So much to do and much to see. Hawkers selling their wares, beachfront cafes for a leisurely latte to the ubiquitous roller-bladders etc. Venice Beach affords the visitor an enjoyable and fun day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
50,Street Performers or the ocean-Venice is the Best!!,Venice has a very different vibe than it did before Google came here a few years ago. It still has the boardwalk and homeless people but now it has a lot of Tesla cars on the roads too. It has always been an unusual beach town but now it has an incredible mix of all layers of society. You just can't miss visiting Venice!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54aliced
30,Crowded and Dirty,"The only redeeming part was Venice Ale House (which was amazing) and that I was at the beach. But it's crowded and has lots of homeless people. Plus it's just one tourist trap after another. The parking was ample and not that expensive and I did like that I was at the beach, but not much else I can say about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98shanas

I have been there every time of the year at different day times.I honestly don't like it, is ultra touristy, very dirty, homeless people smoking marihuana everywhere. When I took myFamily or friends there they all have been very dissapointed because is not like how they imagined.

40,Venice beach,We stayed on Venice on the beach hotel. It was excellent to access all areas of Venice beach and San monica beach. The walk down is definitely an experience lots of people watching and street performersThere is one section where homeless people live but they don't hassle you and you have this where ever you visit in the world.I personally don't think I would bring young children here due to the crowds however the top end where we stayed was OKThe beaches are clean and patrolled nightly by the police.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4827KDsaral
10,Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!,Having read about this place I felt we just had to visit despite it being a little off the route of the California road trip that we had planned.What a mistake!This place is nothing more than a centre for the most drop outs in one place that you can find.If you're planning on calling in - do yourself a huge favour & drive on by.Nothing to be seen here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJHNottingham

30,"Checklist item, but I wont go again.","This is the first place since I've come from Asia that I have been heckled so much. Honestly, every other step someone had something for sale, to listen to, etc. It was sad. Also, the amount of homelessness on this beach, truly heartbreaking. Other than that, get a few pictures, have some food, but this place is not really a place I've heard any local react to in a positive manner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/structureofzero

50,Average beach,"Not the most beautiful beach but it's definitely very popular. You can hang out with the homeless, smoke ""medical"" marijuana, and workout at the muscle beach all at the same time.I would not swim there, not because it's dirty or pollution, but it's water is cold and wavy. No sharks to worry about here but mind your personal belongs.Go further south to marina del Rey you can rent motor boats and cruise around the Pacific Ocean.Go further north is the Santa Monica beach.More north is Malibu beach. I recommend paradise cove beach there.There is a lot of restaurants and shoppings around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc

10,Beware of parking at the beach - it could cost you a $63.00 Ticket,"If you park at the Venice Beach, be sure you have someone stay by the vehicle until you place the parking ticket reflecting that you paid to park. Make sure you have change for the parking meter because there are no change machines, no attendant on duty and if you have to find change at one of the shops and don't have someone waiting at your vehicle, you'll be ticketed. You aren't given an opportunity to pay for parking and get the ticket on your dashboard. The Beaches and Harbor Patrols lay in waiting ...

30,Like any other beach,"The beach is of course enormous. The waves are huge compared to where I come from so be careful. The lifeguards had a hard time when we were there due persons underestimating the power of waves. For those who surf this is of course a nice place, but probably not that good as in Laguna beach.The area around the muscle beach is full of novelties and rather shabby. Many homeless seems to have this area as their ""homes"".The skate park is huge and there are many good skaters that you can look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926andersm
30,Different,"I always had this image in my head about venice beach. Creative people expressing themselves in numerous ways. And that is exactly what it was like.

50,"37 years, some change!","Once a parent, always a parent, and I helped my favorite #1 daughter with her relocation from AustinTX to Culver CityCA. The apartment she co-habits with her significant other is just off Venice Boulevard/CA187, which is nice because I was able to enjoy it all. What made the difference for me (other than quality time with them) was borrowing his upright bicycle and pedaling.Venice Boulevard/CA187 is a relatively flat, broad, multilane, divided roadway, going West (& East), terminating (or beginning) at Venice Beach CA-USA, on the Pacific Ocean.Pedaling early am is my favorite time for cycling, whether in El PasoTX, here, or anywhere on Planet Earth, and I was soon witnessing Sunrise with the water behind me. I was pedaling the same (I think) broad beach sidewalk, looping West of the main drag and ocean that I had pedaled with two companions some THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO, July 1979.Back then, I had just separated (honorably discharged, of course) from a 5-year hitch in the Navy. To ensure that I wasn't tempted to re-up, one of my brothers, a woman I was involved with, and we attended ""Coastline '79"", an annual convention held by the League of American Wheelmen (now League of American Bicyclists). From there, we biketoured North, along the Pacific Coast Highway/CA1/US101. We skirted LA slightly by ferryboating from Huntington Beach (I think) to Santa Catalina Island, then back to the mainland at San Pedro. From there we pedaled North as previously described, with a significant stop at thus fantastic Venice Beach.The name obviously comes from the numerous bridges over a canal/floodway/ spillway. It was then, and still is, charming; beachouses, small businesses & eateries adjacent to a wide brown-sand beach. Perhaps one of my strongest memories is that of Muscle Beach, an outdoor gym for public use--and display (did the ""Terminator"" begin his USA stardom here?)--along with a population of semi-permanent 'campers' in their tents, enjoying easy access to the public bathrooms. I really liked finding Vivian/nameonrice.com; she had my most desired item: picture postcards.Venice Beachouses a fantastic site, free to all (but if you have lots of $$$$, you can rent one if this lovely beachouses), and certainly has my ""Wheel if Approval""! But don't wait 37 years--I've gained a pound for each years absence!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juanito_Hayburg
30,Venice Beach - lots of over priced souvenir shops. .,"Lots of tacky overpriced Souvenir shops along part of the boardwalk, great beach and skate board area. .

40,More interesting than Santa Monica,"Almost anything goes here. It is a very diverse group of people that come to the beach. Amazing people watching. There is a skate park where the kids/young adults board. The stores along the beach is also as amusing as the people there. This beach is a big contrast from the other uppity, nice beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexWorldTour

40,"Surf, sand and the greatest free show on earth!","Miles of sandy beach, decent surfing and swimming alone would make this a good spot, but the boardwalk jammed with local color and tourists from around the world make this beach unique. I highly recommend just grabbing a bench and let the show begin. Musicians on roller skates, a guy riding by on a bike with a couple of boa constrictors, it's Venice in the summer! An added bonus just a few blocks from the frenetic craziness of the beach is the beautiful and tranquil Venice Canals; a sharp contrast to the beach scene. It's all good, all mellow, it's Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plubifer
30,I'd say a must see,"While all the shops are the same, and there are a bunch of weirdos (harmless) I would def recommend going. I would recommend strolling the shops and then renting a bike to cycle over to Santa Monica. That was fun. But Venice is good if u like people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coley1973
20,I expected more,"We're definitely not conservative in nature but I really thought that this would be cooler. I expected more of a grateful dead/surf culture sort of vibe but instead it was pounding rap, pipe shops, homeless people and piles upon piles of what must have been homeless people's stuff that has piled up over years. It was not as good as I wanted. Also sketchy in terms of safety. Wallet in the front pocket kind of place.The one highlight was the skate park! The tricks were great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1RobM1

50,The people watching can't be beat,"This funky neighborhood has everything. Food, cheesy t-shirt shops, medical marijuana, dogs in costumes, cops on horseback, hipster coffee shops, overpriced souvenirs, skateboarders, weight-lifters, gorgeous houses on little canals, miles of bike and walking paths, and even the beach. I could spend days here. No stop in LA is complete without a visit. You've seen enough pictures, you know what you are going to get. It delivers on the pics and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyWW
50,No place like it,"this is the most laid back beach i have ever had the pleasure of visiting. The beach and pier are great, the shopping is cheap (very close to Santa Monica if you like the high end vibe) and you will see some of the most unique people and art, definitely worth a day trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346jessicat
40,Venice Beach is ve nice!,"Apologies for the pun, but walking down Venice Beach is always nice. Sure the ice cream and pizza is pretty subpar and the smell of weed is strong, but it's always a nice walk up to Santa Monica.Check out Muscle Beach and the skatepark and you can cross this off your LA bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvanEdinger

40,Nice restaurants on the strip,Typical small beach. Some basic watersports and some good restaurants on the strip. Somebody the open air lounge bars are good place to hang out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RohitM296
20,All kinds of strange on Venice Beach,"I had been to Venice Beach once before more than 20 years ago. I don't recall the all kinds of strange that populate Venice Beach. Not for the faint of heart. Also, the number of homeless and other beggars, bums, and moochers is really off-putting.Further, the ""Boardwalk"" is littered with concessions selling all varieties of keep merchandise plus the medical marijuana dispensary advertising $40 ""evaluations.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
10,Homeless town,"Should change it to homeless beach. Thats all that lines the boardwalk, they have forts and tents. Recliners and mattresses down there. They do have a lot of talent some of them in their paintings. But its just not what i expected. Next time will do it during the day instead of early evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ginson22
50,Character!,"This beach has character, I went to Santa Monica beach and it was nice but I personally love Venice Beach. The food trucks, the basketball (and 1) games, the music, the environment. They are all different and you should visit them all and I'm sure you will have a favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pagesinadiary
40,Beach with a lot of souvenir shops,"We wanted to see the places you see in the films and so came down to Venice Beach from LA. You can park right on the front so take my tip and don't pay to park far away on the back blocks, you'll pay more and have quite a long walk.The boardwalk/pavement is the place to be and we saw all kinds of people wearing all kinds of exotic gear. There are many many souvenir type shops all pretty much selling the same generic things, but the stalls outside are more interesting and sell jewellery and art that is much more original. There is an actual Freak Show but we didn't care to go in for that. It was a dull day when we went weather wise, but very colourful otherwise. Really enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheladyLisa

50,A unique place for family fun!,"Enjoyed five days here- what a great place for all-around fun in a spectacular beautiful beach setting. We loved our beach view hotel room- right in the center of all the action- yet as active as the area is in the day- is as quiet as it is at night- people turn in around 9 or 10 pm - this is a place to enjoy day time outdoor activities- as a spectator or participant.Son loved the skatepark and we appreciated watching the amazing skateboarders. Watched a great game of Venice Beach basketball team on a Sunday afternoon. Curtsied seats- so much fun right next to the beach. Priceless - and free!The biking opportunities are endless- and rentals are only 20.00 a day or 6.00 an hour (same for skateboards). There are great bike lanes and one may ride north up to the Santa Monica Pier or Palisades Park or south all the way to Redondo. We did both.Yes, there are vagrants and homeless in the area- but they are nice people and we felt safe at all times.Venice Beach is a gem- so happy we visited. We had debated staying in Santa Monica- having read reviews of the homeless. We are not interested in shopping etc. So glad we chose Venice- loved the street performers, muscle beach, watching surfers, swimming and just watching life happen. Nothing like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chabrro
40,Great people watching,"I visited Venice beach a number of times. Very interesting. Lots to look at and the best people watching can be done here. Really cool skate bowl, and street art.

50,Perfect for people watching,Venice Beach was my favourite part of my LA stay. There's so much to see and do that's different from the norm. Its like Camden on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelcarfoot
50,Visited in June 2016,Parking was my only issue. Some lots charge up to 30 for parking. I found a lot that was 15 but when I came back to leave the price dropped to 10. The beach was beautiful. You can rent bikes and hoovers. There is a bike path. There was a skate park where a bunch of locals put on a show for tourist. They are very talented. And a bunch of street hustlers dancing for money. Tons of vendors selling some very unique items. Overall I'm glad I visited,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misstillisa
30,Interesting snapshot of America,"We were expecting glorious sun but during every day we visited the California coast this June it was cloud and colder than we'd expected, muscle beach was quite quiet but we saw a few sted heads working out, the basketball courts were entertaining as were the street performers & skate park, definitely worth checking out but don't expect to be able to sun bathe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gurnico

30,If you like tourtist tac and people watching this is the place for you.,"We only managed to get to Venice Beach early evening. Stall holders were packing up and homeless people were all starting to set up their spots for the night. Tourist shops were still open and Venice Beach is a shopping mecca for tourist tac. Lots of restaurants to sit, eat or drink and people watch. Altogether it was a rather seedy place at night. Probably better to visit during daylight hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieClogwog
50,Never-ending fun!,"This is must when in the LA area! Never know what you may see on Venice Beach! We saw movies being filmed for You-Tube, and low grade movies. Plenty of shops to visit, including food and drinks. Rent a bike and ride up and down the strip that goes on for ever. Fun to watch the skate boarding groups do their thing and the muscle men group do their thing. They also have racket ball and basketball courts. If that's not for you, cruse to the beach and watch the waves....absolutely beautiful view of the coast! Can see Santa Monica from Venice Beach too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimM67
30,Always wanted to visit.,"The beach is amazing, so much room and very few people because of the size. Loved the cycle lanes, and the paved area for pedestrians. Bars along this area very busy. Lots of people just strolling. Some odd characters, some begging for money which is never nice. Realized this place lives off its name from years gone bye, actually was disappointed, most of the shops are selling tatt. Nothing worth buying. The street vendors selling nothing anyone would ever want. Sadly was Iike an 18-30 place for the not so wealthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MavisB801
50,Interesting,"Venice Beach is very pretty. Lots of beach to choose from. There is a skate park, a graffiti wall, muscle beach, street performers and lots of stores and food. Be careful with young kids. Some street performers use crude language and suggestive behavior. Lots of homeless people. Very busy with bikers on the bike path. Be careful when crossing the path. Fun place to hangout and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pr0ject0ne
20,Famous beach but it shouldn't be,"This beach is often depicted in movies and shows sunshine and roller-bladers. Guys pumping iron and people running across the beach.Having been there I think people are running from someone or something. The town council has really let this place go, it's decrepit and graffiti filled.Noisy buskers seem to entertain the crowd but they bait and hustle and you never feel at ease.I would avoid this place on my next trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bansheeman
40,Staying at venice beach? Think Santa Monica,"I do not recommend staying at venice beach. There are very many homeless people around and it takes away from the tourist value of the area. It also takes away from what could potentially be a really nice market place boardwalk. It is much better towards santa monica if you're planning to stay on a holiday. Venice Beach would be a nice place to walk down to, not to stay. Also santa monica is much easier in regards to public transport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thachkaza
40,"Stunning Beach! Great paths for walking, biking, roller blading!",Stick with south side of beach. Less touristy and less chalky stores! Easier to get around b on weekends with bikes! Very windy. Soft long sand. Stunning views!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356gayleg
30,A beach but hardly Venice,"Just after 10 am we set off on the walk down to Venice Beach from Santa Monica. There is a great walkway along the beachfront, there was a nice gentle breeze but it was still quite warm. It was forecast to be in the low to mid 30 degrees today. There are separate paths for bikes and pedestrians, which is great. It was a very pleasant walk if a little warm. We passed the site of the original Muscle Beach, just a few pieces of exercise equipment and a few men using it. Lots of volleyball courts set up on the sand.After about ¾ of an hour we got to the start of Venice Beach. We were greeted by a shantytown of homeless people against a small wall. They were in the throes of packing up. We have noticed that this happens near our hotel every morning with the homeless people packing up their belongings around 7 am in the morning.The whole are is pretty seedy with dodgy stores, graffiti on the walls and lots of homeless and other dodgy people. Being a long weekend it was quite packed. What was disappointing was the lack of street performers you are always hearing about. We kept walking and eventually came to the new Muscle Beach. Quite an impressive setup with exercise equipment, lots of older guys showing off their prowess on punching bags, half court tennis etc. We ordered a coffee from a small takeaway store and a traditional lemonade for me. We sat and watched the athletes for a while before heading back.Quite disappointing as a supposed major tourist attraction unless you are into looking at the most socially disadvantaged members of our society. I am glad I saw it for real rather than the glamorous and sanitised version you see on TV shows but definitely not a highlight, just really sad. The walk was however a great piece of exercise on what was quite a warm day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeH1949
40,You Have to Experience It,"Venice Beach is full of interesting people and things to see. There are lots of little shops and food stands, many very unique (I had cricket sauce on pasta and a firecracker raw juice shot!). It is home to Muscle Beach (Arnold Schwarzenegger fame), and you can witness people pumping iron. It has a really cool skateboard park for kids of all ages...mesmerizing and entertaining to watch these talented skateboarders. It's something you just have to experience when you go to the L.A. area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142yvonnem
40,Water temps cold!,"We were here in mid June and the temps were freezing! It was also very windy. We heard people say beware of getting black tar on you at this beach and sure enough we did, not even sure how! The shopping area was ok. Honestly not as ""freaky"" a I was expecting.

30,Venice Beach VE Venice Suite A,"Stayed as part of our honeymoon, using a company that owns the apartments called globe homes and condos, all booking done online and via email, easy to use and understand as it seems to be quite frustrating booking anything yourself if your planning to go to the states with resort taxes and hidden charges for room and cleaning of your rooms/apartments, having said this it was easy to understand right from the off, the apartment was clean and tidy, loads of space, washing machine and tumble dryer in kitchen as well as everything you'd need if self catering, bedroom was modern and bed was comfortable, good sized dinning room and lounge, TV in lounge and bedroom both had internet and cable facilities, bathroom, needed a lick of paint but had everything you'd need including a shower, they mention that in California it never gets above a certain temp so they don't provide air con, well we must have been there in a heat wave as it was never below 30+ degrees every day ..... This is lovely and I'm not one for knocking the weather as let's face it that's why we go in holiday, but after a lovely day at the beach where you've had nothing but sun sun sun, the last thing you need to be coming back to your room/apartment and it being the same temp inside as out, after opening all the windows and doors for a bit, it cools down, as I mentioned they were having a heat wave so it was very hot and sticky at night, there was also free wifi and parking at the property rear, the property was located just behind the trendy abbots Kinney Blvd which has shops, bars and restaurants on, it's about a 10 min walk down to Venice beach and then 10 mins walk along to Santa Monica beach/BoardwalkAll in all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7349QTpaulb

40,vibrant beach,"This is my favourite beach in LA. It radiates with energy and reflects the spirit of LA! The beach and the sea itself are not much, but it is people who make this beach a great place to visit. Their activities and energy makes the the beach so vibrant, you won't forget it. Also sunsets here are really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishii_mis

50,Lovely beach...........,"It's a beautiful beach . Walking along it was quite as blissful as an amble.One can enjoy street shows , food , shopping along the beach . Skate park is also there where one can see many skaters performing..and at last I would say one can relax his/her mind body and soul at this beach . Its really a soothing experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyankaK826
50,"Fun, but weird","You have to understand that Venice Beach is unique. There's great weather, lots to see , good beaches, play areas, all sorts of places to eat.Also, a large homeless population, marijuana dispensaries, and some very determined sidewalk vendors",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momel1
30,Choose Santa Monica every time,"A pretty short walk from Santa Monica Pier, I would not recommend going here solo. It may be worth a see if you are in a group, but definitely not the safest-feeling most family friendly part of California. Lots of little stalls selling cheap trinkets and shirts. The street art was pretty neat, and there was some skateboarding stuff going on if you are interested in that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450joya
30,Interesting,"Venice Beach is interesting. Great for people watching. Depends on your mood & where your interests lie. Some interesting T-shirt shops and lots of on-street vendors. Walking is a must so that you can observe all the small shops and the array of humanity. Be aware that there is a large number of homeless, although there seemed to be little to no interaction with tourists. The day we went was overcast, so there was only one bodybuilder working out. If you are a gym person or just follow bodybuilding, pay the $10 as I did to go lift a few weights. Don't expect good equipment, but the experience of the doing is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheles955

30,"A dirty, crazy, fun beach","Tourists: I have lived one house down from this beach. It's safe, fun, dirty-with trash and such, has lots of homeless people, and a lot of trinkets, a beautiful view of the ocean, a nice breeze in the air and it's a great place to people watch. DURING THE DAY. At night, it is not so safe. There is a lot of drug activity, there are gangs, the homeless people are up, active and will approach, and it's still good people watching. But it isn't nearly as safe. Go during the day, have a some fun, take in the views and buy some trinkets. But don't stay too long after dark. Seriously. And if you're female, be aware of your surroundings if walking alone after dark. During the day though, it's a fun time! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgrimmer

50,Street performers were bomb,"Just got back from Venice Beach. Super fun just to walk around and check out the stores, the dudes oddly working out while tourists take pictures of them, the skate park....which was amazing, and mostly this street performing group. I can't remember their name, but it was a troop of about 10 dudes who did tricks, engaged the crowd, told provoking jokes, and included every race and age (literally) into their act as possible. Must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123aprilc

30,Biked through from Redondo Beach,"Its a must do if you have never been. It was the weekend so it was busy, not as big as you would think. Definitely great people watching, a very Eclectic mix so have your wits about you. There are artist showcasing their work, street performers of all sorts and low budget shopping and semi-decent food choices. Most likely you will have to walk a block or two to get to beach from most parking areas which is mainly in a suburban neighborhood. Oh p.s. Muscle beach is next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StonedTraveler

If you don't like seeing a semi-seedy but friendly sea of humanity, don't bring your bad vibes here. Get your henna body art, a t-shirt, or ankle bracelet here. Get assessed for your need for medical marijuana. Sit in a trail-side pub, have a beer, and watch the crowds and listen to street musicians. Tip the street musicians. Peace out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoosier1959
30,Interesting people watching,I went while on a tour. It is interesting and I am glad I had the experience but will likely not go back. Some of the things I saw were a little overwhelming for me. I heard individuals yelling profanity in the streets which I did not care for. THe people watching is interesting. I did like seeing the artwork and where Jim Morrison got his start.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hj99

There are many people there, In other words, VERY CROWDED! break dancing, music, someone playing a grand piano on the boardwalk, artists painting portraits, and more! It was an interesting afternoon. Parking is very difficult to obtain and VERY expensive. Buyer beware! My suggestion is to go early in the morning to get a good parking spot and enjoy a less crowded beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynS943

The interesting thing about Venice is circular and go to surpeendendo with things that go up in your face. There are all kinds of people. The name comes from its artificial canals - the houses have two entrances, one for road and one for channels with boat in the back - reminiscent of the Italian city of Veneza.Venice Beach stand painted murals, the palm trees ladearem track bikes and runners, small shopping streets with colorful facades and a very relaxed atmosphere. It is a place that easily identified by the terms already seen both films as American series.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabio-Cipolla

10,Sorry what is this about ?,Well I have seen some beach and I have to say this is one is part of the worst I have visited .The beach in itself is lovely with white sand and nice waves but it is the boardwalk I have a BIG problem. Stink of piss for the 20 first minutes and so dirty does LA doesn't have any money to clean their street . The shop are so old fashion I feel I was going back into the eighties. Felt very sorry for the homeless people who seem to have made camp there. LA you have disappointed me big time . It is not good to have all these famous people leaving in your town and you can't be bother to do any thing about Venice beach .Sorry sort youself out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierC229
40,There are two Venice,"The last review is rather unflattering of the place, understandably if one only seeks the beach area, it is for teenagers and is a tourist trap. On Main Street we ate at a decent tapas bar bin 73 probably the best flavors in that area. All others offer typical fried foods if this is what you are looking for. A few blocks away you can walk around canals with wonderful homes until you get to abbot Kinney street with all it's hip stores and restaurants. Worth the walk or drive away from the cotton candy tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ross086
40,Fun Visit,"We visited here on Memorial Day and the place was filled with interesting shops, people, artists, people, vendors, people and again, more people! I'm not saying it was crowded...in fact I was pleasantly surprised that we had plenty of room on the boardwalk! What I marvel at is the diversity and flavor of the people we encountered all along the boardwalk.  People watching was the highlight of our ""hike"" along this beautiful stretch of beach.  There are dedicated recreation paths for biking, roller skating, etc.  There is also a separate dedicated paved lane for walkers.  Just beware of bikers when crossing over!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnW57
20,Venice is deceiving.,"Venice is traditionally and mistakenly known for being a nice tourist place. People fail to ""see"" the crime rate created by the local gangs and visiting gangsters from other parts of the city. The homeless population also harbors some criminal element who are themselves victimizing the tourists. This is not very well known because after tourists are victimized, they go back home and either do not report the crime or do not want to bother with having to return to go to court. They simply decide not to return, and the rest of the public do not hear about their ordeal. This is how this situation is perpetuated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandoacero
40,Nice place at day time,"This place was filled up with shops, street-art and other fun stuff. but this is a place you go to in the day time! 8 pm everything closes and its time to leave the place. Can be cold and windy there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niconex
40,Worry seeing once in your life,Venice Beach is a very diverse mix of people. Enjoyed the people-watching there and the eclectic nature of the area. Tons of flea market type of places and plenty of eating and shopping available. The area as a whole was rather seedy but for us that was the interesting part. The beach itself seemed clean and decent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
20,Nasty,"Brought my daughter here early on a Saturday on our way out of LA. I was taken aback by the smells of urine and feces that we kept experiencing as we walked around. It seems a lot of homeless individuals use this place to sleep at night-so they have to use the restroom somewhere. We walked around the beach, skating areas, and tourist shops, and bought a few t-shirts from the local vendors. The vendors were really nice and funny. Considered having brunch as we did not eat breakfast and were hungry but honestly the smells of that place made my lose my appetite so we left the area and found a McDonalds. The graffiti is really neat to see (we did not see the veterans memorial that got defaced that weekend) and is on everything on the beach-including the trees. The beach itself is very nice and pretty. In my opinion its worth the trip if you want to be able to say you've been there and got the t-shirt but I probably won't be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I7307ZLjamesr

Down there we rented a bike for 9$ per hour, from there bike (I ran) all the way little further than StMonica pier, and back, and then walked back to the parking lot.

Famous Muscle beach gym was great to see. Very fun day at the board walk on Venice Beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tnfn
50,Sun and fun on Venice Beach,Walked here from Santa Monica beach and enjoyed the tacky zaniness which the artists shops and street sellers give to the place. Good place for late afternoon strolling and enjoying an ice cream. Plenty of choice in tee shirts and souvenirs. Public Restrooms on beach. Felt safe and people mainly friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewForestView
30,Riding the beach,We hired a bike for two hours and rode around the bike track viewing all the sights. The pacific was too cold for swimmers. We saw an HBO film going on at the waters edge. Parking was ridiculously expensive as we had to pay for parking for the day. We saw a sea lion swimming around. There were lots of markets.

Don't go in the rain, its not worth it (luckily on our last day the sun came out!) There are so many different things to see and do. There are lots of little shops along the boardwalk selling all different types of products - personalised tshirts, food, crafts etc. If the bodybuilders are at Muscle Beach you have to check them out. Heaps of sports to get involved in or just watch: basketball on open courts, handball, tennis, kite surfing, skateboarding etc. If its a nice day, hire a bike and have a ride around the beach and boardwalk area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraswanderlust

20,Interesting,"Well, not sure what to say about Venice Beach. You get all of what you'd expect at Venice Beach. It was pretty calm and a nice stroll in the morning before the gremlins crawled out of the cracks. Things you never thought you'd see will be seen. Don't take too many deep breaths unless you want a lung full of marijuana. They have a real 'freak' show theater that made my stomach turn and heart sink just walking past. It is truly and sadly overrun with people who seem to actually live on the beach. On the bright side, the crowds, tacky shops, beautiful Pacific Ocean make it very entertaining. The actual beach is very clean. The bike path was wide and beautiful. The skate park was fun to watch. Muscle Beach was hopping. Found a great place for breakfast and a clean dessert shop. Glad we got to see it. Will make a point to never go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAB_VA
50,Wow,I always wanted to visit a beach in LA and decided to visit the Venice beach.. It was a weekday and the beach was not overly crowded.. It was a perfect day with great weather.. The water was cold but not enough to not take a dip.. I walked miles and miles enjoying the cool breeze and water.. It's a must visit place for some great sea food.. Clear water.. And for some quiet time if you are solo..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762swatis
40,Typical Boardwalk,It was a cool morning when we went. So we did not venture onto the beach or into the water. Just walked along the boardwalk. The majority of the stores selling the same t-shirts. Some vendors on the beach side of the walk selling original works. Some very odd people. Was not crowded on a Monday morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108kerik
30,Cool place,We walked around for about an hour. We watched the skateboarders and then the basketball players. We also stopped by muscle gym and walked along the beach for a little bit but it was way too cold to get in. I couldn't believe there were actually people swimming and laying out. The surfers in the wetsuits I can understand but the people in the swimsuits O cannot understand.FYI - I visited in May. Weather was in the 60s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mailoha
20,Nothing special,"This visit worth just because of its fame. People smoking marijuana and amateur singers will bother you to buy their CDs. I recommend just if you are so decided to go there. Otherwise, spend your time on another thing more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egonkutomi
40,I'll Come back in summer!,"This was such an alive place, but I was freezing!! - that's just me - I saw people in shorts and barefoot, but i'm a tropical bird and could not manage the cold despite being bundled up. But we saw the most magnificent sunset!! That really made it all worthwhile! We saw the skateboarders, musicians, cyclists, acrobats and more, in addition to the numerous shops and vendors. We wanted to walk down to the ferris wheel and see it all in lights, but unfortunately I was the spoiler... that's not to say you other travelers cant do it!! You should! So I will have to try and come back when its not only sunny, but warm...then I'm sure I'd be there all day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenwb
50,A must see,"It's located close to the Santa Monica beach. Beautiful waters. And a lot to do on the beach. Biking, skateboarding, watersurfing, or a stroll along the boardwalk. With many small shops around, it could turn out to be a shoppers paradise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShabbirBaldiwala
50,Best beach ever,"The beach is very wide and the sand is amazing too (no small rocks or seaweeds and stuff). I've been to a few beaches on the west coasts and the Caribbeans, but this is the best I've ever been. Also venice has a very different vibe with a lot of young people and very interesting shops. You can easily spend a day there, enjoy the beach, walk on Main street checking out the shops and grab some food and drinks too. (check out ale house, they have a good collection of craft beer)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyceycy
10,Skid row,"Tons of homeless and drug use, the police walk right by but don't do anything. The homeless are lined down the boardwalk. Not like what you see on tv",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snihalfuad
30,A bit let down,Went here for a few days weather was hot but the sea was cold. It's nice to walk along the front but I have never seen so many tramps they are every where. The place is clean enough but quite a few unsavoury people hanging around. And once it's dark I would avoid all together. The prices to hire bikes skates surf boards etc are quite expensive. It's worth a 1 day visit to the pier and a walk around but that's about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thesaint73
30,Go to gawk,"The tents on the boardwalk and the unwashed bodies of the homeless on the beach and by the boardwalk are a sad statement on the country's economic and social welfare policies. On Venice Beach, homelessness is a given. Keep in mind that tourist traps are common in places chockful of visitors, like Venice Beach. Forewarned is forearmed. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying the beach which is well-patrolled. We did appreciate that food and alcohol are outlawed on the beach. Less litter too. Gawking is free... but photos of the boardwalk's denizens may cost you if you're not discreet about taking snaps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingC0mpani0ns
20,Got ripped off,Watched a street performance. They pulled people from the audience and made fun of them. They asked for donations at the end and didn't do what they promised.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jellyfishking
50,"Food, Folks and Fun","We found Venice Beach to be a great way to spend a Saturday. The weather was beautiful, sunny and 70's. It did not take a long time to get out there. The fun is in the people watching and there is an abundance of interesting folks roaming around lifting weights, selling things you probably don't want or painting themselves gold and holding an unnatural pose. We found the area to be clean and a minimum amount of people asking for money but not aggressively. The public restrooms are like any public restrooms at a beach, you know what I mean. Bring your hand sanitizer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdxtraveler52
50,Always FUN!!!,"My other half and I love Venus Beach, there's so many things to do and DIFFERENT people to see from the one man band on roller skates to the tin man and multiple performances of groups or individuals.Never a dull moment when we're there, just imagine walking along the long strip where there's different vendors, outdoor restaurants and smaller places to grab a smoothie and various international foods. It's also cool to every once in awhile see celebrities😊; once I was there in one of the many clothing stores and saw the recording artist, ""Coolio"", I mean your really close to Hollywood so that's bound to happen. My final and most important thing is that you'll only be small steps from the beach. 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856sonial
50,Beautiful sand and surf!,The large stretch of soft sand from the boardwalk to the water is simply gorgeous as well as being gentle on the feet. The waves were nice for boogie boarding as well as learning to surf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DG23-TTown
10,What a hole!,"Walked to Venice Beach from Santa Monica pier and beach. Well you knew you made the transition from Santa Monica to Venice. Homeless people line the boardwalk, smoking drugs, begging and hassling tourists. Sleeping in the public toilets. People shoving CD's in your face asking you take a copy of their music. Numerous stalls selling all sorts of tat and other services like palm reading. It's the sort of place you walk with your hands in your pockets, clutching your phone and wallet for fear of having them stolen. Seeing as it's famous and contains muscle beach, it was nice to experience but wouldn't return or want to stay in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy_d_c123
40,Fun Place to visit.,"Really crazy area. Lots of vendors here along the boardwalk. Food and drink as well. Very busy place. Great for people watching. Don't recommend staying to late after dark. The homeless start pitching their beds for the night and its kind of a ""shady"" area after dark. Muscle Beach is fun to see. I also recommend taking a walk through the residential canal area. Great to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolB856
50,Lovely.,Nice area. Beach was beautiful! Went early so it was very quiet. Take time to walk area and see the area if never visited..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babycandybeloved
50,Always something to see!!,"We love running the stretch of beach between Marina del Rey and Santa Monica. Parking is easy at the beach off of Rose Street, plus you can end your sight-seeing at the Venice Ale House. Take some cash if you want to purchase some of the local artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1860QPmarkf
30,Visit but don't stay too long,"Venice beach is a must visit because of all the hype it's received over the years but it's a bit tacky. Quite a lot of beggars and people clearly spaced out on drugs. Not a place I'd want to bring kids nor stay for any length of time. The beach itself is actually not bad, white sand and massive. As a whole I'd recommend a fly by visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M15KY
30,Nice beach with a lot of surrounding activity!,We weren't able to get into the water because it was cold that day but a nice walk or bike ride will allow you to enjoy the scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691nickyl
30,Not impressive,"It is worth the visit though, but it is not impressive. The restaurants along the walk have food below average and the toilets are not clean, especially the public ones. There will be lots to see and experience, that is for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbirViews
40,Nostalgic,nice shopping. very artsy. need to clean the place up though. some of the homeless people were violent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bj970
50,People watching heaven,"Walked from Venice beach to Santa Monica pier and back, it's a lovely walk with loads to see and do, plenty of cafes and eateries, great little souvenir shops and of course loads and loads of eclectic superficial show off people!!! But fun to watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismE5291OE
40,Venice beach love it,Amazing long is the venice beach 30 km !!! There are so many things to see big skate park graffity walls people are everywhere skating running fitness... Must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxsF4062WU
40,Was on My Bucket List,"After visiting Santa Monica Pier we took the hop on hop off bus to Venice Beach. I knew it was going to be funky but didn't realize just how much. Very interesting assortment of shops, restaurants and people. Especially the people. It was fine during the day, lots of tourists about. WOULD NOT GO HERE AT NIGHT!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsdolittle
50,Great place to visit,"Sweet entertainers and artist showing their ware were in full force the Sunday we visited. Great place to hang out and enjoy the sun, beach and just hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochump
30,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed to see so many homeless people here and those drugged out of their minds. Shops which catered for the ""discounted sale of pipes"". These people kept to themselves and I did not see anyone being hassled by them but it was an uncomfortable feeling especially if you wanted to use the public toilets etc.A good range of souvenirs, tee shirts etc for sale. This end of Santa Monica a lot busier if biking on the pathway because of the stalls selling goods. Biking in the other direction more enjoyable and quieter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondy36
40,Venice beach pier,Amazing views of the sea. Strumming guitars. Busking. Quiet time. If you want to enjoy down time and soak in the sun this is the place to be.Much recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RahulGeorge
40,Venice Beach was Fun,A great way to spend a couple of hours. The beach itself was great. Warm water ( for Canadians:) in May. The area is full of kiosks/stalls for shopping if you want to do that. Lots of eclectic people here. Fun to talk to them. Sometimes a bit seedy with some ok places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveKINNS
20,Interesting Vibe,"Took an evening ""fieldtrip"" to the beach during a recent trip to LA on business. Venice Beach may not have been the best choice for me. Had a very interesting vibe with an ecclectic group of locals. Attempted to grab dinner on the ""Boardwalk"" but not an abundance of decent choices. Lots of hippy-types, and free spirits. Beach was beautiful, but the atmosphere was not my cup of tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDough14
40,Great California beach,"Loved walking here on the beach, on the pier and around the neighborhood. Lots of great places get a good meal or fun time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruth250
50,Venice Beach,"This is one crazy but fun place. Lots of good people watching. It is a good place to shop for souvenirs from the Los Angeles area, as well as lots of other unique items. It can get very crowded sometimes which can be annoying and there are quite a few homeless people around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12judyi
50,A Unique Los Angeles Experience,"Located on the beautiful Pacific, Venice Beach is a one-of-a-kind, a must se for all visitors. The home of the famous muscle beach, Venice has evolved into a circus, where you will see and experience things that will expand your experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
30,Over bearing peddlers,"The area itself is beautiful -- stop and enjoy the small stuff like flowers, palm trees, ocean and beach. We got some great fresh lemonade (the heat and ice cold lemonade were spectacular). We watched people working out on the rings and did some shopping.The thing that I did not enjoy was the people pushing ""free DVDs"" into your hands and the ""medicinal pot"" pushers.--- they got to be a bit much after a while. We walked from the south extent of Venice Beach up to the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR942
50,A Must When in Los Angeles,"Venice Beach is not the most beautiful, it is clearly not the cleanest, you won't be surfing there, you will be walking the Boardwalk. Venice Beach has had it ups and downs. Once a place for all tourists it became dumpy and dangerous at one point. It still has a large homeless population and you will put your wallet in your front pocket and no you will not give money to the homeless there that will use it to buy meth, heroin or booze (there are lots of places for the homeless in Venice). You can go swimming or lay and tan (what is a little skin caner between friends), but take the day and walk down the boardwalk. There are also some good eateries there. Parking is fee based but easy. As you walk North you will find vendors, artists and musicians all having a great time. The police presence is there so you will be fine. But do not walk the boardwalk late at night. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,One of the widest and cleanest beach in California,"Big, wide beach facing Santa Monica Bay. Starts at Venice Pier on the south and up to Santa Monica Pier on north. In between is Muscle Beach and an amazing stretch of very casual, 60's fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phineasfogg25
50,Colourful beach,"This is definitely worth a visit for the colourful characters that are there. From street artists, muscle beach meatheads, musical moments and all the random characters in between, it worth a visit. Go in with an open mind and be prepared to chat with all the various people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alicehelena1208
50,Nice attraction!,"For beach lovers, surely you will enjoy it. But we haven't gone swimming because the water was so cold. We just went to shops to shops, stuffs are affordable but some are kinda pricey. Try the bicycle riding, but we end up not renting one because there's a lOoooooooot of people roaming around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GorgeMaine
50,Awesome beach and great waves!,"Loooooved this iconic beach! The vibe is excellent, came here almost everyday for a swim in my time in LA. Pretty cool waves too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoBilal
30,Surprisingly Average,"We drove here with our hire car, the first problem was trying to find parking, we drove around for about 15-20 minutes then finally found one, most parking is timed so you have to pay with coins or credit card & display your ticket. We then set off on foot for a walk, I didn't' like the feel of the people around, the shops were like market stalls reminded me of Bali, lots of buskers & people dressed funny & some a little intimidating. The beach gym was interesting to watch - for 5 minutes, there were basketball courts, paddle tennis courts but the highlight was probably the skateboard park. We stood & watched that for about 1/2 hour but that was the highlight. The beach itself was long & wide but the sand was dirty - I am comparing it to the beautiful beaches we have in Australia though! It was a beautiful sunny day, lots of people on bikes & roller skating out enjoying it but I just didn't like the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73Chelle73
10,Dirty and Smelly,"The Uber driver really didn't want to let us off here, he asked didn't we want to go to Santa Monica instead. Anyway he let us off and advised we walk in the direction of Santa Monica and once we stepped out of the vehicle we knew why. It smelt like we had just stepped into a urinal. The beach looked ok but the board walk was smelly and dirty and lots of homeless people laying on the benches with their belongings around them. Very sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trish962015
50,MUST SEE if in LA,"I've explored so much up and down the southern coast of CA. I lived in OC for a bit. Venice has seriously cleaned up, I kind of prefer the old Venice, but it's a great tourist spot. AMAZING people watching. GREAT FOOD! Friendly locals for the most part. Be ready to get bombarded with loads of stuff you don't need, as expected in a tourist destination. I go visit every chance I get. I love Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blairs41
40,Nice walk along venice fishing pier,"Big waves, saw people surfing, people fishing from the pier, birds, bikers, people swimming. Nice view of white sand beach. It's windy and cold for me, consider bringing your jacket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoneynLemon
50,Something else,"All California beaches are nice but there is something I love about Venice Beach. Parking should get better, kinda tricky at first, it's best to just pay the high prices at the parking spots there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williama125
20,Not a place I'd visit again,"We went to Muscle Beach/Venice Beach and I was shocked. It was early in the morning so things were just opening however, it was very dirty! Lots and lots of homeless everywhere, pot stores along the row of stores, strong pot smell and even encountered a few high people that were interesting to try and move my kids away from (ages 13 and 11). Even Muscle Beach equipment area was very run down and a disappointment. In places there was strong urine smell as well! I'd say the only nice/ clean part was really the skate park. The further you walk toward the ocean, a little more relaxed we were however the dirt and trash deterred us from hanging out at the beach.....at least not there! Oh yeah, and you can see the building from the ""Freak Show""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/issang
20,DANGEROUS PLACE,"You can go during the day, and even bring your children, but keep an eye on them, on your purse, and on your person. This is a fun boardwalk with entertainers, body-builders, and aging hippies. There are lots of shops selling marijuana, and lots of users around you. Go and have a Jody Maroni's hot dog and look around. Most shops are filled with tourist junk and sub-standard products. But, this area is famous, and you should see it. Just do it quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
50,"Loved everything, cant wait to go back!","This place is so cool. Everything everyone had told me was true. Loved the people, vendors, music, beach, biking, everything. So great. Seriously considering living there someday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstinv2014
10,Not a Nice Place,"Born and raised in So Cal and a surfer in my early years so I know the beaches. Filthy dirty beach and the water. Trash floating around my legs as I walked out. Nasty people on the boardwalk making sexual comments to a female in our party. Snide rude shopkeepers, dangerous homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryS269
30,Same old Tshirt shops,"The beach itself seems nice, but there is T shirt shop after T shirt shop all selling the same things--kind of a turn off. Interesting to watch the skate boarders, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100db
30,Very crowded with tooMany fringe people,"I lived in Venice for many years dating back to the 1970s when Venice was a place where starving students, artists and senior citizens coexisted. Unfortunately, over the years Venice Beach has become a zoo consisting of tens of thousands of local and out of town visitors mixed in with way too many drunks and drug addicts. I suppose that it's fun to watch the street performers and people selling their crafts but, be prepared to get hassled by the less desirable elements. I would not recommend bringing children to Venice Beach, especially on weekends. Also, forget about walking the boardwalk after sunset, it is not safe! If you are looking for a beach experience, there are many other beaches that are cleaner and safer just about 3 miles north or south of Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPG625
40,Yes its Venice Beach and Nostalgic,But let's face it. Venice beach is old and a bit dirty. It is a part of the flavor. Just remember this is no Hawaiian clean sand and clean beaches. The botthe and vendors are fun and lets not forget the do have the best People watching in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lancew1219
50,I love the craziness that is Venice Beach,I always enjoy going to Venice Beach just for the variety of people here. Yes there are a lot of homeless people here but they are not pushy and they are not In your face. There are a lot of mentally ill people as well but again none of them approached us or got into our faces they generally keep to themselves.For the most part I found the beach clean and the bathrooms were clean for being a beach bathroom.There are always entertainers there and there is something for everyone down in Venice Beach.We went with my friend and her kids and the parks were clean and basketball courts are maintained and cared for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/675kimberleyb
40,Great! But not what I expected,"We arrived early Monday morning, we couldn't check in to our hotel so we went for a walk. A bit terrifying to say the least. A few drugged up abusive individuals made it uncomfortable at first. Come lunch time the mood was much better, tonnes of people and a great atmosphere. Great little shops and cafes. Muscle beach was funny and the skate park was brilliant. I suggest to hire a bike, good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sack0001
40,Interesting,Cool place to people watch. You will see street performers and strange folk. The shops were nothing special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneA246
50,"Nice, bustling beach","Venice Beach a very busy place with the people in the water surfing and the sunbathers along with the skateboarders at the huge skateboard park and the path for jogging or biking. Lots to do but had a few section of homeless people who were asking for money. Also, shops expensive. $9.99 for an ashtray is way out of my league. Nice to visit and see the shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellymN5692VU
20,Same old SAD AREA,"I had read,they had cleaned up the area. Sorry, I was here 30 years ago and it looks the same. Dirty with a lot of homeless. We were warned UNSAFE after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66JudyD
50,Colder than expected but nice,"The water is FREEZING.That being said, the beach itself is quite warm, and a lovely view. You get a great view of the santa Monica pier, along with a great place to people watch.Volley ball, and muscle beach nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmeyer71195
50,Great experience!,This was a awsome strip to just walk down and grab a bite to eat or enjoy the local art culture and skateboard culture.Always a lot going on and a very fun place to be in the mix.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itellthetru
40,Great on a sunny day,"Fabulous beach, & muscle beach has great views aswell 😘 Hire a bike & you can pedal to Marina del Rae or go the other way to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7570QZanitag
40,Different beach scene,"Definitely not your normal beach scene or crowd. Very eclectic type of place and artsy. Many homeless people all over but they don't really cause any problems and little begging. As everyone says great for people watching.The beach itself is HUGE, so wide!!! And not crowded at all on the weekend we went in May. It's been to too many beaches to count and it's by far the widest I've ever seen. Nice and clean and good sand. Not many people actually hangout near the water and it was cold since the pacific. The boardwalk that runs through the area was great and connected us to the Santa Monica pier area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banny9949
50,Beautiful and serene Sunday afternoon beach visit,"While visiting my daughter, we decided to spend Sunday morning/afternoon in and around Venice beach. We had a beautiful walk along the beach, while sipping coffee and watching the sailboats and surfers. It was a beautiful afternoon listening to the waves on the Pacific...... Don't leave without taking in a few hours at the beach and doing some shopping along Abbott Kinney Blvd..... Great shops and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MsBrendaGale
40,A different view of life,"Venice may not be to everyone's taste, but I think it has a very interesting vibe and I love a wander along the beach. Venice presents you with all walks of life and doesn't judge. If you do visit, remember to wander inland as there are some great shops and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedFoxRuby
10,Go to Santa Monica instead,"This is one of the most over-rated places I have ever been to. The beach itself is great, ok, but the rest looks like a scene from The Walking Dead. And why anybody would want to use the run-down gym at muscle beach is a miracle to me. This place lives from a hype long gone. It promotes a shabby chique but it is only shabby. Don't bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiamP5195WD
30,Cool tourist spot,"Being a huge Doors fan, I enjoy coming here. This is where they got their start. Of course, visiting with my kids was a little weird.

Lots of strange people and lots of people selling prescriptions for marijuana.The beach is pretty nice and the vibe is cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalep524
40,People watching!!!,"Ok we had heard lots about Venice beach but nothing prepared us for the strip of chaos! We smelt pot from the moment we arrived to the moment we left lol!We saw all sorts of people and behaviours some entertaining and some sad (lots of homeless & disabled). Lots of places to grab a bite to eat and a drink but very busy lucky if you can sit outside at a table and people watch.We saw muscle men, had a giggle bit touristy but we looked anyway - great bike / skate tracks. We had a great walk and lots to see and smell!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simone_Neil
30,Seedy,It's a place you have to visit if you're in LA..but in all honesty it's not that cool anymore.The numbers of street people have grown massively in recent years and while there are a few decent eateries and bars..it's a place to spend a couple of hours and no more.When we were there one of the shop owners was stabbed almost in front of us.Overpriced tshirts and little else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philbern
50,Great place!,"I loved this part of LA, was so relaxed and chilled! The eateries nearby are divine, parking easy too, prices are not as bad as you'd expect for parking or dining...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sawadee_1
50,Must see when visiting LA,"If you visit LA and enjoy cultural or artsy stuff this is a must see. We really enjoyed walking here, drink a glass of wine at one of the bars and see al the artists with some actually who had really nice things. A very unique cultural and creative visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m3ph
50,Awesome,I've been coming to visit Venice beach my whole life and it really hasn't changed much and that's actually a good thing. There's something about the atmosphere that's just tough to get anywhere else. I love it here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arunroo
30,Interesting,Visited for a few hours and watched the muscley men pose and work out. The area might appeal more to younger people It just seemed a bit hippy and cheesey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elinorheasman
50,Bikes R Fun!,"We randomly rented bikes after lunch on Sunday afternoon and it was so much fun! We rode from Venice Pier to Santa Monica Pier and back. Next time, I would get a bike lock from the rental place and stop to shop and eat and drink along the way and stroll around the entire afternoon. Fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherH127
40,Worth a visit - great people watching mostly,"Lots of characters, plenty of public bathrooms, seats, playgrounds along the pathway between Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach. A big walk but worth it if you are up to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB1374
30,Venice Beach....meh...,"I have to say I was a little disappointed with Venice Beach. We were there in winter, so the atmosphere was probably not the same as in the summer time. It was looking a little tired, with cheap trinket shops lining the boardwalk. Maybe visit when there is better people watching, but a bit of a let-down in winter when it's quieter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamahoz
50,Venice Beach - a lot of fun off the beach!,"Venice Beach is not about the beach, after all you have Muscle Beach and a promenade of quirky people and stores that make the area worth the visit. It can be a bit of a freak-show, but that is obviously what is wanted and attracts the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robsT9648IO
30,Possible not for everyone,I would not recommend this for families with smaller children. The sun and sand are very nice and the views to the Santa Monica Pier are also. The crowd is very unlike where most of us came from and my children were not happy. Muscle Beach was cool though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josemartinez3171
40,Bus ride to Venice,"Caught the 33 Metro from downtown. Took about an hour but we had no parking worries and the bus stops just a block from The beach. Walked to the skatepark, saw Muscle Beach, watched some street dancers, and ate at Poke Poke (recommended by trip advisor). It was a short time there but next time I'll rent a bike. Worth the bus trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvettevalero
50,Favorite beach,"Venice is so vibrant and artsy, there are so many random wall paintings and artists selling their work. Its just great to take a stroll down the board walk and grab a drink or some food and hang on the beach later. Lots of skaters and other than that lots of diversity, a lot of different people. You can easily spend a great day here, its my favorite beach in Cali so far!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450clairev
50,Crazy,So many crazy people ... muscle beach with the body builder and the skater park. A lot of people walking along the beach and different artist performance. Just a cool place to hang around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ina_Swiss
40,Relaxing and beautiful,"Venice beach is one of the most awesome beaches in America that ive seen so far.A stroll along the beach is highly recommended.You also have the pier and at the other end of the beach the shops and amazing and interesting people.This is a really relaxing and enjoyable afternoon.One recommendation, if you take the freeway there DON'T MISS THE EXIT!What would take you an hour will end up as a 3 hour journey to get there. It's an LA thing! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuscleDog
40,Classic beach scene in LA,"You have to walk the beach and see the carnival. The muscle men. The bikinis. The rollerbladers and the punks. And off the beach, it's just as interesting with the canals and the architecture. Best place for people watching in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonL40
40,Great For People Watching,This was our third time to visit this beach. If you dislike crowds then this is not the place for you. There are cleaner and less crowded beaches in the area but this one is great for people watching. We found free parking on a side street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angleTexas
50,Eclectic bunch of people,Out of all the places I have been Venice Beach is my favorite. From the shops that all sell the same thing to the artist on the street I love walking down there and people watching. If you do go make sure to check out the skate park and rent a bike as riding around the bike paths is a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3616MVsamd
20,Too cold this time of the year,"Is a beautiful beach but I was freezing. Is hard to find a place to park, so good luck! I couldn't go inside the water and was too windy unfortunately. waiting for the next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissasN9025LT
40,Beautiful beach that is certainly worth a visit,"Venice Beach is definitely worth a visit. Yes, it can be seen as being run down and there can be some questionable people hanging around, but it's certainly a spot worth visiting when in Los Angeles. That's what gives the area its character. Sure the food and drinks are overpriced but aren't they always when you're at the beach? This won't go down as the most gorgeous beach you have ever visited. It's just a cool beach that's not that far away from the city and is worthy of a visit even if it's only to cross it off your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssy24
50,Great experience,"From having a relaxing bike ride on the long bike path, watching the talented skaters at the skatepark, shopping at the thrift stores, to having a Corona while listening to live music right along the beach on the board walk. This is a must see area if you're visiting L.A. Don't let the homeless people ruin your experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisfO5922OG
40,Cool place,"Loved being by the beach! Seeing all the homeless people broke my heart, there were a couple scary moments when a couple seemed to be not themselves and there were yelling and cussing, but we never felt threatened. Police were very well placed. The performers were amazing and fun to watch!! Muscle beach is fun to watch all the buff guys and girls lifting!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hauk66
30,"Hippy vibe, touristy, good for people watching","I decided to check out the beach and boardwalk having seen them on travel programs.I found it much the same as portrayed on TV. Busy spot, real laid back and welcoming. Shops on the boardwalk weren't very interesting; typical touristy products, many made in China.Skate park was pretty cool. There was a women's competition the day I wandered around.Muscle beach is colourful, but not super active and none of the huge specimens shown on travel specials lol.Lots of street art and basic graffiti to be seen all over. Many interesting locals to talk to.The area reminds me of a friendlier version of Port Dover, Ontario with many places to eat and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QARoadie
30,Freak show,"Be prepared for anything when you visit Venice Beach. We walked there from Santa Monica Beach, and found it a bit ironic that the first venue we came to in Venice was The Freak Show. That was only the beginning. From head shops and wasted locals to over-crowded cafes and surly servers, Venice Beach was not for us. Maybe it was the long walk on a warm day, but I expected to find crazy and unique and instead got bizarre and unpleasant. We originally went for the food, which got higher reviews from locals than that in Santa Monica, but lost our taste for the town by entering via the beach. I think the better restaurants are more inland; we should have gone directly there.The bike path from Santa Monica to Venice was filled with people on bikes who seemed to be having a great time. Looked like fun. I would highly recommend biking over walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaR379
50,First time visit,Loved Venice Beach. Very cool place. Lots of people watching. Cool graffiti pieces. If you are in the area it's a must stop. We would definitely go back. But once it gets dark area becomes sketchy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/racheleh423
30,morning stroll,early morning stroll as our flight was early. Not too many people about. The area looks more run down than i expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniqueh490
30,General theme of boulevard is Weed!,"Ok, yes loads of homeless gathering in various locations along the strip but stick to main tourist area's and it is a fun walk. Full of diverse and interesting views on life, the universe and everything out there somewhere ! We went to see Muscle Beach, not much action there. It did look run down but it is only gym equipment I am sure I wouldn't have been looking at the age of the dumb bells had there been more activity ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarao135
40,Very funky,"The beach is beautiful - and goes on for miles! - with volleyball nets, places to rent paddle boards and bikes and restaurants dotted along but on the boardwalk I loved all of the cool shops and bars, lots of artists and dogs and buskers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeganWalters
30,Don't believe the hype....,Went here after seeing it so many times on to and magazine etc.... But well it's so run down and shops are tat trying to sell overpriced printed tshirts and smokes and all the stuff you don't want where are all the independent interesting stuff!!!Muscle beach is run down why you would train there I would never know all in all I would have rather not gone I can get the some experience back home at Blackpool beach..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snapiesworld
30,Did not live up to expectations,"Went to see muscle beach as it is part of Venice Beach but found it looking dirty and run down.Venice Beach itself is lovely but let down by the sight of so many homeless people and their belongings all around the edge of the boardwalk, we were put on edge by the strong smell of drugs and this was early in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnc934
10,Grubby,"Beautiful beach but the whole area is full of homeless spaced out people, it's quite an intimidating place to be the public restrooms located there according to my husband he walked straight back out more feaces & urine on the floor he was disgusted. Weirdos & wacky people even with the police monitoring the area they don't appear to be doing anything to move them on! Do not waste your $6 to park there not worth it utter filth!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karen123308
30,Lovely beach,A very nice beach but the shops look slightly run down but I think this gives the place character. Lots to do and see and a very nice walk that can take you down to Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gogs42
40,Venice Beach Freakshow!,Pretty average beach complete with overpriced snacks and drinks. Lots of marijuana shops. Interesting walk to people watch. Highlight was Venice Beach Freakshow! Loved meeting the cast and taking pictures with them. Parking can be difficult but wasn't impossible. Definitely very different population so must stay alert and watch your surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandT875
10,"NOT A FAN, NEGATIVE ENVIROMENT","A complete shock! Breathing pot the entire 30 minutes we were there. Aggressive locals. Washrooms were filthy, and witnessed 5 police cars approach a group of men, making arrests of several individuals, and cleaning out their ""drug stash"". Worst 30 minutes of my life. Waste of time to visit. Do not let your teenagers wander by themselves here. On the plus side, Beach is pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Okanaganflygirl
40,Great atmosphere and entertainment,"Interesting day out, many different street entertainers on the board walk next to the beach. At first sight seems a little run down but good atmosphere and no trouble. Beach very clean, just sit and watch the characters passing along the board walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndySmith1967
40,Crowded but entertaining,"The beach is nothing special but if you want an entertaining day, it is worth visiting. I prefer Santa Monica Pier, which is just down the boardwalk. Good place to take your kids for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tushita02

10,No Just No!!,Unless you want another strip of hockers and pedlars and homeless just stay at Santa Monica Beach.Trust me not worth it even for the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3442RMmarks
30,Not bad for a walk,"It's pretty nice for an afternoon walk waiting for the sunset. The skateboard wall is pretty interesting, something that I have not yet seen in other beaches. When it's not too crowded, it's quite nice to just sit on the grasses or by the beach to get a bit tanned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fluffyplo
40,Mr C Thomson,"Very nice to visit. Very busy beach. Theme park on the promenade aslo very busy, can queue for the rides for a long time. The food court is busy but walk a few hundred yards up the street and there is a shopping mall with alot more choice of eateries. Lot's of park but be prepared to walk to the prom and shows. Well worth a day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigt710
20,Not my cup of tea!,"I found the broad walk pretty dirty, tacky shops, loud music, litter, do yourselves a favour and go to Santa Monica next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cy1978
30,Quite average,"The board walk is terrible to walk through but the beach itself is quite nice. Saying that though, there are a lot of nicer beaches in other parts of the world. Its nice to walk across, we didn't swim though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam_Cassaniti
40,Historic home of oceanside weirdos and surf subcultural,"There is so much to see when you visit Venice Beach it can almost be overwhelming. There are surf shops where you can buy flip-flops, bikinis surf wax and even ""smoking accessories."" There are lots of shops and vendors for carnival-style food and beverages. There are always street performers doing urban dancers, handling snakes and exotic birds and singing and dancing for tips. It's a zoo, but that's why America loves this place. Nice beach. There are public restrooms but they are awful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcduncan2001

50,Where fashion meets fusion!,Whether it is the sweet smell of herb that attracts you or just a walk along one of more eclectic areas of Los Angeles this place is for just about anyone and all ages. People watch and sample some of the local flavors at one of the strand restaurants will not disappoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billsK9646SI
40,Quick trip to Venice Beach,"Quick trip to Venice Beach during a 5 hour lay-over at LAX.This was recommended as it is close enough to the airport via taxi.The beach and promenade are large and a lot to see.Certainly can see the weird and wonderful. Very many 'street acts' and people trying to make a living doing almost anything.Many places to eat and souvenir shops - but beware, they are pretty much all the same. Cheap. Definitely a place to see. Cannot comment on the beach or water as didnt go for a swim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilCa86
30,A quirky place but fun.,"We had a good walk up and down the boardwalk on the evening, there are plenty of people out selling there wares and there are lots of places to eat and have a cold beer.There are some strange people out and about there but everyone was harmless and it was a fun evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360
50,So much culture in one little beach town,So much fun to see all the artworks and buy some trinkets. The beach is beautiful and the skate park is alot of fun to sit by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bekibanana
30,"Odd, eclectic beach full of every type of person","Venice Beach seemed to be the opposite of Santa Monica Beach -- surrounded by cheap t-shirt and trinket shops, crappy food places, and more tourist trap type shops. The neat part to me was muscle beach - there was a mini gym, boxing area, rings, basketball courts, pickleball courts, skate park and more. There is even a place to rent any balls needed to play at any of the spots. The beach itself was beautiful. But the odd part was all of the types of people - there were a lot of homeless around, musicians playing for money, druggie types, hippy types, tourists of all types and some scary people too. Quite the melting pot. Now that I checked the box, I don't need to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctaylor0159

40,Unconventional LA...!!,"Hi guys I have been in Venice Beach during my stay in LA for the honeymoon..At first I would like to say that Venice is very far from the city..We decided to go to Venice after the Hollywood trip so we started from Hollywood Blvd around 2pm and arrived at Venice after 1h and half..LA is definitely crowded!! ;-)) Anyway the long car trip had been payed back..Venice Beach is a really wonderful place. For us looking at the huge ocean with big big big beach had been something amazing..In Venice you will find many many guys working hard at the open air gym, the skaters, the surfers and so on..I think it is the unconventional area of LA and to be honest in many reviews we read that this area after the sunset is not too safe but we did not feel uncomfortable. I think it is a stop-over that you cannot miss in a visit in LA.. ;-))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabriGra
40,Fading charm,Used to be very quirky back in the day and increasingly Ticky Tacky touristy. The Muscle Beach bit is still there though less frequented than in the past.The roller skating section is more lively and fun to watch. The main drag itself however is now filled with t-shirt shops with little of the original charm on offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesR787

40,Great fun if you're up for it,"Great location by the ocean for sunset, quirky Boardwalk (if you don't know, check out before you visit), amazing walking around the canals, high end shops a few minutes away on abbot Kinney. Do have a coffee at groundworks on Westminster avenue, and a smoothie from the place next to it. Also beer, burger including fish options at Venice ale house. If you are tempted to get a tshirt pressed, make sure you carefully check full final price before, at least in the shop by Venice suites hotel- you've been warned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/proukakis

40,Great for people watching,"This is a very touristy place, don't expect anything high brow. But a walk down Venice beach is a freak show worth seeing. Well worth the trip if you are in LA , especially in the summer on a Saturday. We have been many times and have never had any problems and always feel safe. Yes, parking is tough but that is a given anyplace in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230tp
10,"Rundown, Tired & Sad","In stark contract to the image we see on television, Venice Beach is a real eye-opening experience .. Being my first time in the area, I was amazed by the number of homeless people .. Despite the presence of the police, pot smoking was rife & what should have been a relatively straightforward task of walking down the road using a pavement became a complex task of navigating the maze of makeshift homeless shelters & shopping trolleys adorning most sidewalks .. Despite being an interesting day out (LA is a sad, tired place that's angry & aggressive), it's far from being a place I'd recommend to people nor visit again ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201edl

Plenty of places to pick up snacks or a meal. It's a very interesting place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdreiling
10,"Dirty, crowded","The city of Venice should really clean this place up. I was really actually disgusted with what I saw. This place used to be the place everyone wanted to visit. Dirty, homeless people trying to get a buck, street swindlers trying to get a buck, garbage, homeless people everywhere, pot smokers everywhere. We wanted to walk down and visit some shops, but didn't because of all the above. Don't waste your time. Visit Santa Monica or any other beach. seriously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xjarlind
40,Great Place for Tourists,"Venice has always been a little unusual. At the beginning of the last century it was developed with canals (many of which remain) and gondolas plied the waters, just like that place in Italy. Then, in the mid 1950s it became the haven for Beatniks, those young lads and gals who discovered espresso, berets, black garments and occasionally a bit of weed. By the 1960s, lots along the canals, with their small bungalow homes, began to appreciate - what once sold for $4,000 was now $10,000, and so on.Trendy Marina del Rey came along in the early 1960s and gave some gravitas to the region, however Venice proper remained poor, gang ridden and just not the place where you wanted to live and raise a family.Then, in the 1970s, Venice took off. Property values skyrocketed, the poor were pushed out by exponentially skyrocketing property taxes (before Prop 13 set in) and those little bungalows sere selling for the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now they are in the millions and celebrities like Frank Gehry and Tom Hayden live in those renovated homes.Venice Beach, however, maintained its quirky reputation as many homeless and drifters found it hospitable, warm in the winter, near the ocean, public bathrooms available (currently a point of controversy, as the city is locking them at 10:00 pm and the homeless are finding other locales to relieve themselves),All of which is to say that today there are street musicians, panhandlers, food stands, assorted street merchants selling T shirts and sunglasses, mediocre restaurants, pizza and gyro vendors, beautiful people biking and skating along the wide walkway, and clusters of homeless with their shopping carts full of their worldly possessions.So, Venice Beach is definitely a place for tourists and for those wanting to enjoy a beautiful beach, get their allotment of rays and play or relax on an endless field of sand. Venice Beach is different, beautiful, historical, and, as noted, quirky.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimvogt
20,"Not what we expected -- hippie town, homeless people everywhere.","The beach itself is beautiful and fairly well maintained, and the pier is nice. But for such an iconic landmark beach, this place is sad. We didn't mind the run-down beach shops and weathered, un-maintained restaurants, and even expected the rest rooms to be dirty. But we simply didn't expect the homeless and poor who were everywhere. When we parked, which costs $6.00 for the day, a homeless man immediately approached our car. After we told him that we only had water, he began throwing out all the trash in the bin in front of our car, eating whatever he could find. It was so sad, but when I told my husband I was going to get him something to eat, I turned around and he was gone. Then there were two more -- one collecting the glass and cans he had thrown on the ground, and another searching farther through the trash can. Within a few minutes, they were gone and more were at the same trash can. As I looked down the beach and at the trash cans, I realized that there were possibly more homeless here than there were cars -- or so it seemed. We took a quick walk out on the pier, where we found a wagon that appeared to have been filled with snacks for the homeless who ventured there, and most of the snacks had been picked through and eaten. I felt a little better, but was so saddened by the huge number of needy people I saw that we left before we had even walked out on the beach. A film crew was there working with costume trucks and lots of lights and cameras, getting ready to set up. I asked what they were filming, and they said, ""A commercial."" I'm sure it wasn't true from the sheer number of trucks the company had lining the parking lot, but they obviously didn't want to tell me. We left, and went up the Pacific Coast Highway. There are so many nice beaches that are not only nicer, but where we didn't have to feel so sad and out of place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dobergirl2
10,Not at all what I expected,Walked here from Santa Monica pier with my family. It was a bucket list thing but I would definitely not recommend it to anyone. It was dirty and smelly. I was shocked by the amount of homeless camps actually set up on the sidewalk. One camp even had a bbq! I didn't feel safe in the middle of the day. It's definitely not what they depict in the movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyaw384
40,Lots to do,"The beach is not that nice. But if you wan to have fun and people watch this is the place to go! I love Venice beach i love how ""hippie"" it is.

50,A laid back trip,"Walking Venice Beach is always a laid back experience, and you meet to many interesting characters. We visited on a Tuesday, so it wasn't as crazy as it usually is on a weekend. But it was still really fun! I definitely recommend!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OchoaA03
40,You can see anything,"First visit to Venice beach and it has anything you want from street entertainers to applying for a medical pot license. Went on a Saturday, busy but not crowded. Fun people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanL516
30,Chaos,Venice Beach is beautiful in photos and in person... The difference between the two is that in the photos you can crop out the chaos. Lots of people... Expected. Parking is either a joke or expensive... Expected that the boardwalk full of tourist and little shops selling nothing but souvenirs. I will say that there were some people independently selling craft type of items and those were unique and neat to see. Overall it was a fun experience but not a place to go to relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanieR895
50,A fun way to spend the day when you're visiting LA,"Venice Beach is a wonderful way to while away a sunny day. Start at Washington Pier (there's a big lot there, and you can have a great Chai tea latte at the Cow's End Cafe before you get started:) )Start walking along the boardwalk, past the upscale condos (some of them are really interesting to see) Enjoy the view on your left of ocean and beach, and on your right of little beach shops and restaurants. There's a walking path, and a bike (and other wheeled transportation) path. If you walking pick the walking path...it's clearly marked though that isn't always obvious to the people using them:) Stop when the spirit moves you to have a cold drink or a cup of fruit....sit and have a coffee and bread pudding (yes, that's all one place sells...every flavour imaginable:) ) and watch the waves:) If you fancy a stronger drink you'll soon come to that too, and there will most probably be musicians playing for your pleasure as well....and tips:) If you can afford it , and enjoy it, please drop a buck in their bucket:) There's also artists, sculptures, and performers of every ilk along the strip. Browse, even if you have no intention of buying.....don't be afraid to strike up a conversation, or, if language is a problem a smile always serves:) You can walk this way all the way to the Santa Monica Pier, and ride the Ferris Wheel at Sunset. There are some interesting places to eat there as well, though from that spot it's easy enough to pop up to Main Street Santa Monica where the restaurants might be a little less crowded. If you don't have children The Galley is an interesting choice for food and alcoholic refreshments:) If you're into a hike you can keep going to the Back on the Beach Restaurant (quite a hike, but nice view and you can't get lost), and then on to Will Rogers Park...but all that might be best done on a bike or roller. However much of the Venice Beach Boardwalk you choose to do I'm sure you'll enjoy the colourful sites, and even more colourful personalities you'll find there:) Good for couples, families, friends, and on your own:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynm124
50,Hip Place,"If dirty hippies isn't your thing, I feel sorry for you. We loved this beach and the atmosphere.

We really loved this beach and came back a number of times even though we had gone from Laguna to Santa Barbara. I truly enjoyed everything about this beach and felt welcomed. We both did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyJ140
40,Nice beach with parking and restaurants,The sea was very cold but the waves looked great and there were lots of people surfing to watch. Be aware of the odd sun bather who thinks that it's ok to bathe topless so keep the kids eyes towards the sea! You get a lot of people just walking their dogs or playing with the kids so it's not somewhere I would like to flash my boobs!Be aware that the restaurants have signs saying no toilets so after eating in a lovely restaurant we had to pick up and go to the smelly public loo!

Got to LA and the family wanted to visit the famous Venice beach. Banged in the location on the Sat nav and headed out. On approach the area looked extremely run down imagine Berlin summer 1945 ish. Incredible number of homeless people wandering around, I was under the impression they were filming a scene from the Walking Dead, but this turned out not to be the case. In all seriousness why aren't the local government doing something to get them off the streets into housing. Bitterly disappointed. Parked up had a quick look around used the disgusting toilets and left sharpish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamieg84
40,One of the best beaches along this stretch of coast,Visited a number of the beaches along this stretch of coast and found this to be the best. Wide golden sand beach with a good selection of shops along the promenade. The only drawback is the number of usual hawkers trying to con money out of tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewwQ6516MO
40,Good Times!,"What can I say, this beach is so near and dear to my heart, many memories growing up here in the area. Every time I come back to visit I always spend a part of my trip down here at Venice Beach it has something for everyone, the whole family can enjoy! Enjoying the boardwalk by walking, jogging, renting bikes, skates, segways, and then you have the beautiful beach for swimming, picnics, walking or jogging, just kicking back watching the waves. You can walk to the Venice Pier and the Santa Monica Pier, music, entertainment, great restaurants, and shops to enjoy along the way. I love this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sday2014
40,Really beautiful beach with a great sunset view,I went here with my husband on a saturday evening. The beach is really pretty with a kot of things happening in tge briadwalk. There is a skating area where a lot of people were skating n it was superb to watch them. There were a lot of people playing music and dancing. All these things end around 7 pm at the time of sunset and hence the area which had a party atmosphere became quiet so that you can enjoy the sunset with the sound of waves.We had a great evening. Its just tgat parking was a issue as all the parking liys and oarking spotrs on the street were full and we had to drive around for about 1/2 hr to find parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJain2805
40,Beautiful beach,"The beach is beautiful. There are also shops and restaurants nearby. We went there on Sunday morning and there was a Sunday Market which sells very nice food, bread, vegetables and flowers. We have a great time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ekyloh20140804
10,Neighborhood ruled by violent gangs,"You can go to the beach, but just don't walk around in the neighborhood surrounding the beach. It is very poor and ruled by gangs. Muscle Beach is just full of bodybuilders showing off, so unless you're a gang member or a body builder - don't visit this place....not worth the risk of being robbed or killed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelGorm
50,Best Beach in LA,So much going on here. There are nice shops to stop in and look around. There are dancers and other street performers. It is very busy and vibrant. The best thing is seeing the graffiti walls and the muscle beach area. Be sure to carry cash so you can get some eats because most shops only take cash. I ended my vacation in LA at Venice Beach and I could not have been any happier watching the sunset over the Pacific. Epic spot for beach lovers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754dianeh
40,Beach: Carnival sights & zoo smells that will produce uncomfortable thoughts. Abbot Kinney: Good eats/drinks/people.,"Ready to bombard your senses with a plethora of stimuli that range from the grotesque to the mildly stimulating (more of the former)? Hit the beach path & get your fill of chainsaw jugglers, hemp product peddlers, gang bangers, and voyeurs from the Midwest, trying to make sense of it all. If you're in the mood for a more highbrow cultural experience, walk away from the beach toward Abbot Kinney for great bars & restaurants and much prettier people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8p8p

50,Quintesential LA,"If you come to LA, you just gotta go to Venice Beach. Where else are you going to see a guy juggling chainsaws? Or a hippie Sikh who looks like Jimmy Hendrix rollerskating while playing a battery-powered electric guitar?I take all my out of town guests there. Once, I had a friend visiting LA for job interviews. I took him, still in his suit, straight from LAX to the Venice Boardwalk -- and everybody was staring at HIM! Venice Beach is quintessential LA.

10,Stay away!,"The area around the beach is very dirty. Homeless people are everywhere begging for money. The bathrooms were disgusting! Parking was $30. We paid walked around for 5 minutes then got back in our car. We couldn't enjoy ourselves at all! Don't bother coming here, just go to Santa Monica beach 15minutes away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabby101
30,Interesting mix,"The town is lovely however parking is always a challenge. If you are curious about Venice, you should take a few hours to check it out. At the beach area,the athletes are fun to watch and the people who are on the boardwalk are certainly unique.Abbott Kinney is another story with great places to eat and chic boutiques",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201heleneh
50,Sunday Funday,"Colorful, Eclectic, Loud, Fun!Great place for a stroll on Saturday or Sunday morning. Get breakfast/ brunch/ lunch at any of the casual places lining the boardwalk, Do some fun shopping from the multitude of vendors selling clothing, gifts, original art. Be entertained by street performers or just enjoy a lazy day at the beach. A great way to see a different side of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaG1969
40,Very in your face!,"Rarely have I come across such a concentration of weirdos doing wacky things as on this stretch called the boardwalk. We took the 733 bus from downtown L A (35 cents for seniors) and for shear entertainment value, it is hard to beat. From the skill of the skateboarders to the artists, musicians and other performers, it is definitely a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jin6x
30,Trashy place,"Been to many beaches over the world and was very disappointed by this one. Cali people are so proud of their beaches but this is def not one of them. Lots of homeless people, very trashy surroundings and everybody was smoking weed. What happened California?!Will definitely not come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnnoFL89
20,April,The ocean is always beautiful. This area is not well kept. Many homeless on the street. Older buildings and it is very busy. Parking is terrible and expensive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKAGG
20,Tacky and dirty,"Couldn't wait to see VB, what a disappointment at least the boardwalk is. It is probably OK for the young otherwise only allow yourself a short visit, once you get away from that part the rest of VB is quite nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarleneRay
30,Stayed in the middle of it all.,"Stayed for one night near the boardwalk. If you want to experience the best and worst of LA, heres the place to stay. Tourists everywhere which was fine, people trying to sell their goods to everyone, but certainly has the culture of arts, crafts, and alterative lifestyle. Do not stay out too late, as the homeless people start to move around and causes some trouble.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brett2323
50,Beautiful place to spend the day,"I have spent many fun days going between marina del Rey and Venice. You can enjoy swimming or surfing, sun bathing, people watching, strolling Venice pier, renting bikes and riding along the bike path, or just relax at a local cafe. It's not a pet friendly beach but if you have a little dog they may enjoy a bike ride in the basket like mine did. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SafetyNinja
50,Love the beach,Wow what a awesome beach. Lots of great restaurants in the area. The weather was perfect and the views are amazing. I Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgraceb
50,Highlight of the Trip! LOVED IT,My favourite part of LA. The culture and the stalls everywhere. Not to mention the buskers and the skateboarders. The colourful graffiti and muscle beach where awesome. I liked all the small stalls selling everything. I'm from little wee New Zealand but have gone more than 4 times and haven't gotten sick of it. LOVED IT!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shauns_Travels
40,Wonderful beach,"I was out in Venice Beach for a few days and wanted to share my experience. First of all, the beach was wonderful, if a bit cool for this time of year. There's just nothing better than the crashing of the waves of the Pacific Ocean and the pull of the tide on soft sand. If you go, do so and enjoy it.One caveat: unless you're paying for day parking ($10 a day), it can be difficult to find a spot that's anywhere near. Very popular places shared with local communities mean lots and lots of parked cars. If you find a spot near the beach, count your blessings. Also, make sure you don't park on a street that's scheduled to be cleaned or you'll come to find a ticket on your window.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mechafredzilla
50,Great place,"Much preferred this beach to Santa Monica. We walked along after parking and the weather was glorious, the beach was quiet and the sea calm. We stopped for coffee before heading back and looking in the shops! Will definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahtM3053GR
50,This is a must see,If you are near LA on a nice summer day you gotta stop and check this place out a lot of fun and people watching at its best,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalec676

20,Perplexed,By day the place seems cool and alternative but there were posers everywhere. By night I walked back from Santa Monica pier and regretted it. Felt very unsafe as a solo woman. There is not enough lighting and there were groups of people hanging in the shadows. At one point I hung behind some others so it seemed I wasn't alone. Was ecstatic to get back to the hotel. Shame the reception didn't mention when I said I was walking to dinner. Just go to the pier IMO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbor_10
50,A true California experience,"Venice Beach is one of the ultimate SoCal experiences. Great beach, great people watching, Great bike path, Great shopping An absolute must for first time LA visitors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randipop
50,"Fun, Crazy and Unique","Venice Beach is probably one of the most fascinating places I've ever been... I'd recommend to see most of the boardwalk then head to the canals, after walking around there and seeing all the nice different houses they have head to Abbot Kinney boulevard and chose a nice place to eat, I recommend a place called Lemonade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atraveler111

50,beautiful beach a must,beautiful beach very different can walk up to santa monica on the beach about a hour away. paintings on trees,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aegh91
40,People Watching At Its Best!,"I recommend walking along the beach from the Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach, then back from Venice Beach to the pier along the board walk. Oh the sites you will see: street performers and artists, amazing skateboarders, slack line walkers, acrobats, brass bands, and who knows what else on any given day! And the people, of all sorts. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
50,Cool Beach Vibe with plenty of entertainment,"If people watching is your thing, then this is the place! Visitors from all over the world come to Venice Beach to shop, eat and watch the other people visiting Venice Beach! If you are there on a Sunday afternoon, head over to the drum circle and dance on the sand. It usually starts around 3PM and grows to a big crowd by around 4:30!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifetimeAdventurers
50,Venice beach an la institution!! GO!,The beach has lots to do beside sun worshipping. The boardwalk provides hours of free entertainment and people watching. The freak show is the only activity that costs money ($5 I think). Aside from food and souvenir shoppes. The sidewalk vendors are very entertaining and personable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132williamb
50,Chaotic in a good way!,"Venice Beach has such an incredible, buzzing atmosphere! Feels straight out of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet! Wouldn't recommend it for shopping (mostly smoke shops and trashy graphic tees) but is an exciting way to spend a Saturday. The street performers are excellent - we saw the Calypso Tumblers, who were hilarious and incredibly talented. Watching the skateboarders was also surprisingly entertaining. If you're into sports, there's plenty of tennis/basketball courts and weights equipment. Of course, there's always the beach itself - you can rollerblade, stroll, swim, surf, bike, lounge around getting tan - whatever you like. Strong smell of pot and quite loud and crowded, so if you're not up for that, then I would recommend Santa Monica instead. All in all though, highly fun-filled place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christmas-enthusiast
20,Meh,I went to Venice on Saturday and was not impressed. I was hoping for more art. The highlight was the Freak Show. Otherwise it was a larger version of Hampton Beach back home with the addition of visible homeless people and Pot Shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/y0da1974
50,Fun in the sun!,"It changes before your eyes. Never the same visit.There's the regular performers, tourists, bars, good restaurants, bike path and shops. You don't have to spend money, just watch the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
30,Interesting but carnival atmosphere,"The beach has lots going on especially for younger people,but it is run down,with lots of graffiti ,public bathrooms disgusting, lots of tattoo places",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/breingan
50,Another beautiful beach,Fun for our group of teenagers to see and walk in scenes that they have seen in movies and commercials. AND to compare this to the home ground of South Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M23rdPWR
50,Best area in LA,"A MUST SEE when you're in LA. I'd even say you should pick your hotel in this area and check out the rest of the city from there. LA is huge in any case and travel times are long, so you better stay in a laid-back area. Freaky people, Muscle-beach or the beach itself are just some of the attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E449QIpeterl
50,Venice Beach: Exactly as I imagined,"Took the Metro public transportation system to Venice Beach, a glorious expanse of sand and surf just beyond the jumble of kitschy beach shops. The surfers were catching waves while others waded into the ocean in a calmer bay created by a rocky barrier. Not crowded on this hot and sunny afternoon, although there were lots of people out: couples, families; groups of high school students enjoying down time. I avoided the boardwalk with its cyclists, roller bladers and skateboarders in favor of strolling in the surf. Great walk along the beach to Santa Monica pier, where the beach is much busier. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyg995
50,Exciting!,Lovely way to spend an evening wandering through the stalls etc and watching the world go by. The smell of cannabis is a little strong here!! But a lovely place to watch the sun go down.The skateboard park also very entertaining,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeLinda23
40,The beach full of pipz. ...,"The beach was so crowded. ... but it's still nice. ... There lots of things to do. ...Like biking, tennis, gym, watch the street shows, surfing, swimming, and etc. ...All kinds of people are there. ... make sure go the beach where there a lot of family friendly place. ... The stripes is mostly adults . ... A very different crowd. ...My son played for hours. ... we did enjoy our day. ... nice weather. ... cold water. ...FYI. ...It's also near the walkway vinice canals . ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224phiav
50,Didn't disappoint,Venice Beach was as I expected. Even if you went just to people watch it would be worth it. Lots of vendors to buy souvenir items from. Muscle beach was a bit smaller than I imagined.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auntylene
50,Beautiful and Clean!,Me and my husband went here on a Tuesday for the day to chill out and enjoy the sun! You can walk to Santa Monica Pier on about half and hour but the boardwalk is full of homeless people and the occasional street seller. Tee further you get from Santa Monica the nicer the beach. It is very clean and safe and there is ample toilets which is always a bonus! As we were there in March the sea was a bit cold for dipping in but that didn't stop some people! Overall had a very nice day and there's some very interesting shops on the boardwalk and you can hire bikes/skates/segways to go along to the Pier on!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferb454
10,Save yourself the visit!,Save yourself the trip! Venice beach was not at all what we expected. It was full of homeless people and obvious drug use.It is very dirty and the restaurants are not at all appealing. We made the mistake of visiting one of the restaurants who charged our credit card a second time a few days after we visited!Waste of $10 parking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KobiW
50,Muscle beach,"Fun, relaxed and lots to see! I've always wanted to see where Arnold used to flex his muscles. We were there on a weekday, so it was kinda quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romyr940
40,"Nice neighborhood, large beach and beautiful sunset!","I'm glad to have made a visit to Venice Beach. Didn't have to fight crowds and enjoyed and nice walk through the canals in the neighborhood back to the parking lot. It was nice to see so many people there walking and exercising. Funny visiting a beach where no one is in the water. It was my first time in California and at the end of March, so...good times!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnekaMaia
40,Between LAX and Santa Monica,On a clear day you can see up the coast to Malibu. You also can experience great sunsets from the beach and the pier. Parking hint - drive right past the valet people and enter the beach parking area. Lots of restaurants here as well as in the nearby Marina del Rey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowpixels
40,A fun stroll on the beach,"We walked up Venice Beach on our way back to Santa Monica, after taking the boardwalk south. There were plenty of sunbathers and families enjoying themselves, and a plethora of sports being played--ultimate frisbee, flag football, volleyball--along with sand castle-building, kite-flying, surfing, and playing in the waves. The beach itself was clean and safe, and did not have the constant reminders of homelessness and drug use that the boardwalk had. For those reasons alone, it is worth the time to take off your shoes dip your feet in the surf as you enjoy a lazy stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
40,A sight to see,"Fabulous sea frontage and definitely a eye opener. The board walk right up through Will Rogers beach down to Marina Del Rae passes through Sainta Monica and then through Venise.Most of the unusual sights are here with many homeless though harmless begging and making the place look a little untidy.Watch the fanatics pump iron and the skate board park is good to watch for a hour.Many of the shops are typical seafront type selling memorabilia of the location towels key fobs fridge magnets etc but back from this area there are some good local bars, restaurants and shops.Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628philb
50,"So Corny, but You Just Gotta Go","I lived in LA years ago and used to walk along the boardwalk at Venice Beach with my roommates. It was a sight to see then and not one thing has changed. There are so many kooky characters, so many odd sights, sounds and smells (smoke). We went early in the morning before things got too weird and walked all along the boardwalk.Yes, there were plenty of tourists, but we also saw a ton of locals who were running and cycling. Keep Venice Weird :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandBAtlanta
50,Very interesting place,We spent some time on Venice Beach. It was clean though there are a lot of homeless in the area. My son went swimming in the ocean there. He had a great time. Lifeguards were plentiful just in case.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1496FFtimh
50,Must explore while in LA area!,"Whether you are an LA native or just visiting you have to go walk along Venice beach. It's just one of those experiences that you will regret if you don't! Plus, so many artists and buskers out to entertain you! One of my favorite spots on Venice beach is definitely the Venice Beach Freak Show. They do performances daily and you can see fire eaters and performers in a really intimate setting. My other favorite are some of the long time famous characters of Venice beach, look out for a guy on rollerblades in a speedo and a magical staff. Plus, the sunsets are really nice here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merandacarter
40,Always good people watching,"Fun environment. Excellent people watching. Great for eclectic tourist shopping. Don't miss Muscle Beach where you can watch body builders sculpting their muscles. Also, for fans of The Doors, you can see the apartment building where Jim Morrison was staying when he met Ray Manzarek and began forming the band.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponderosa72
40,What you see on TV is real!,"We were there on an overcast day so it wasn't real crowded, but it was wonderfully Venice Beach. You should know it's not just muscle beach and scantly clad women, it's home to a very large homeless population. Some just outright beg, but others perform services...such as one guy offering $hitty advice for $1. My 15 year old son went over and talked with him. He was funny and well worth the $2 we gave him. If you have kids know they will be exposed to things you may not want them to be exposed to. You will have to make that decision. But we never felt unsafe. There were a lot of cops around. We did have a lot of left overs after our lunch and took them with us to give out. I can't imagine throwing away food when people are going hungry just a few feet away. So go and meet all kinds of people. It's a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
50,Clean beach with lots of facilities,"Venice Beach is a combination of recreational facilities, a lovely clean beach and a boardwalk full of varied shops.The shops are a little pricey, as you can imagine in LA, but you can pick up reasonably priced drinks and snacks.Even though it gets windy, don't underestimate the heat of the sun and wear plenty of sunscreen. Also, if you decide to go into the sea, stay clear of the surfers and watch for rip tides, though the place is full of 'Baywatch type' lifeguards who are geared up to spot if you're in trouble.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brummymum
30,"Neat place, but I wouldn't go there after dark.","Venice Beach is full of art, neat little shops and restaurants, but also tons of drug addicts, homeless and people who look very desperate for money. The beach itself is incredible and it is something to see, but be prepared to be approached for money and to see people using drugs during the day. I had to have many conversations with my 7 year old after visiting this beach. We saw a man who was on drugs with his pants pulled down without underwear, we saw people putting their tents up and a lot of street performers there were aggressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieB886
50,So Much Fun!,"My husband and I had breakfast on Venice Beach Boardwalk, Bloody Mary's, Lox and eggs toast and Jelly. Very good. It is very interesting and fun to walk along the boardwalk however there is a huge disparity of wealth in California and it is evident in Venice Beach. We rented bikes and road to Hermosa Beach, about 15 miles south. Beautiful ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taprat
20,Lots of activities,"There was certainly a lot going on here. Basketball courts, handball, volleyball, skate board park, bike/running walkway, weights, beach, street performers.With all that sounds like would be great place. Problem is there is a marijuana store, guy peeing in alley at 4 PM, street performer cursing. Just not a real family environment. Neat to see but not with kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wfdeacon
50,Vibes!,"Health, beach, sports. Who wouldn't like this amazing place. Walk over to the pier in Santa Monica. Shoot some hoops. Love life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8315DTandyr
40,Interesting Beach,"My trip was a short two hour walk on the beach and boardwalk. I was impressed with how clean the beach was. With the trash cans available on the beach, the residents and tourists keep the beach area clean. The boardwalk, if you want to call it that, has a larger than normal number of homeless people, but it didn't make me feel uncomfortable. City parking was $6 with NO in and out privileges, but that was cheaper than some of the off site parking two blocks away from the beach. Venice beach is something everyone should experience when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravlingTexan
40,"Well, it is dofferent","Venice beach is kind of exactly what I expected. It's filled with characters, and it smells like pot smoke. Sadly there are no cocktail bars dotted along - so it wasn't what we were looking for at the time. Also - the public loos looked a bit dubious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinkelpoops
40,Must see in Los Angles,"We walked on Venice Beach. Very touristy. If your into very eccentric crowds and cheap souvenirs this is the place for you. Go ahead a lay out on the beach and enjoy a fresh coconut. It makes a nice memory. If your in LA, stop by just so you can say you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahfrazier
40,Hire a bike and go on a nice day,"We travelled from West Sunset Blvd. Easier than we thought using public transport, and cheap, will go through Beverly Hills etc. Hire a bike or its a huge walk. plenty of attractions feak shows and the like, food, shopping. Start at the pier, ride too and from and see the Canals as well......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan1961
40,"Love Brazilian Beaches, but Venice is THE BEACH!",If you love the ocean... people... rollerblading... gotta love this place! Worth to visit! Spent hours and hours walking around there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perr0tinha
30,Must see destination,"We walked to Venice from Santa Monica Pier along the path/boardwalk by the beach. The Santa Monica area was very nice, quite a feel of a local holiday area, with schoolchildren going onto the beach for a surfing lesson and a nice relaxed vibe.The Venice part of the walk was disappointing after our anticipation of our visit. It was very busy with lots of tourists on the hot, sunny day we were there. But the majority of shops and the hawkers on the beachside of the walk we passed, were selling predominantly cheap and tacky souvenirs which lowered the character of the area. By the time we had got to Venice we wanted a drink, but it was quite difficult finding anywhere to buy a decent cup of coffee or cold drink. On the other hand it was a great walk for people watching, particularly seeing the eccentric characters who frequent the area. Also Muscle Beach is a must see. I appreciate we did not walk on the beach (very Baywatch) or explore the streets behind the front.If you are visiting Los Angeles for the first time, it is a must go to destination, but for us once was enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5042FYanthonyp
50,Great people,"Venice is always worth for a visit. Park straight at the beach because it is the cheapest parking lot there. They ask for 9 USD meanwhile the other parking lots ask for 15 USD or higher. You can rent bicycles right beside this parking lot and go up the beach on a walk way direct on the beach. Don't miss the crazy people walking over glass shards, the skatepark or dancers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freakassault
50,I liked it,"If you don't mind the faint smell of weed drifting over from the skateboarders and a massive amount of tourists, it's a nice beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeyflannery
50,Beautiful but not safe at night,Definitely enjoyed the time spent there. Cute gift shops. Loved the beach it's a little ghetto there weed is definitely in the air. I would say tourist should go at least once,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIVElifeTravel2018
40,Great place to visit,"The beach is long and very wide. Yes, the shops are cheesy but there are lots of things to like: the beach and the walk and bike paths are surprisingly clean, no dog poops or litter; the beach is lined with low rising houses--no high rise hotels or apartment buildings; the area feels very safe even at night (though one shld obviously be careful). And there are some food shops and restaurants sprinkled among the more touristy shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UE_DC64
50,A Fantastic Day Trip,"Venice Beach is a fantastic place to visit, it is a fantastic option for some absolutely stunning pictures, there are some great graffiti murals on the walls and the whole beach front has a great vibe.I would recommend hiring a bike which you can hire for around $20-$40 and ride up to the Santa Monica Pier, it is a fantastic bike ride and you can take it at your own pace and take in all the beautiful sites you will ride past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glyn1989
20,NOT WHAT I ANTICIPATED,"A big let down as Venice Beach was one of the places I looked forward to visiting and is glamorised on television without a doubt.I had painted this vision in my mind of being sat outside enjoying a drink watching all the wealthy people walking around with there dressed to death pooches, a place of care free happy go lucky people, how WRONG WAS I.This stretch of a walkway is aligned with drunks, drug addicts, homeless down and outs, heckling you as you walk past for you to buy literally anything they can palm off on you.Theres a few stalls selling tacky items, drunken couples fighting, then if that's not enough you have the constant harassment of the medical marijuana people trying to entice you into there huts!!! You politely declined and they still shout after you as you walk on.Its unclean, unsafe!!!! and as for needing any bathroom facilities whilst your there its a public brick building surrounded by the most dodgiest looking people, I was actually scared for my own safety to even contemplate using it.That being said there is a skater park set back from this where we sat and watched all ages of very talented people it was a enjoyable experience which is more than I could say about Venice Beach itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jojo7292
40,Fun place. Great for people watching!!,Lively and very busy. A bit like Blackpool (for those who have experienced it in UK) but with lots more muscle and roller blades. Lots of cafes and shops. Nice beach area to enjoy burgers purchased from the fast food shops!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chasyj
30,Beware of tar,"It's a beautiful beach, but our feet were covered in tar after walking bare feet along the water (should've kept our flipflops on!). My husband and I had to throw our flipflops out cuz of the tar (they were covered in tar top and bottom).Also, there was a small part of the water where it looked like sewage (brown foam from the waves).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammys949
50,"""Freak show"" too strong, worth a look","This place is just too fascinating to pass up. We cabbed in from a nearby location and soaked in some sun, the skateboard park participants, hoops games, a few weightlifters and a daring parasailor on a very windy day. Granted, the T-shirt shops and other tchotchke places got a bit redundant, but this is what outsiders probably come to Southern California to say they saw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amesman96
40,Fun day trip,Lots to see and do. Entertainers to see and lots of vendors selling stuff along the way. The beach is also huge. We also enjoyed renting bikes and going up and down the board walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmarkpatton
30,"Beach is incredible, vendor area is a skank hole",Everything you've read so far is true. The beach is huge and awesome. And the homeless don't go there. Up by the shops and vendors it's a freak show. In a 10 minute walk we saw two people arrested and scores more that could have been. It's a melting pot for low life's. You've got legit vendors and then you have tarot card readers. And of course everywhere the homeless. It's nasty. Blow by all of it and hit the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyle7692
50,Hire a bike or tandem and cruise along the foreshore.,"Great day out for the wife and I. We walked along the footpath looking at all the little stalls and shops along the way. Heaps of things to buy if you have room in your luggage. Plenty of entertainers around to keep you amused, head over to the outdoor gym and get that classic photo. Lots of people out and about enjoying the sunshine which is nice to see. The are plenty of places to eat along venice beach and heaps to look at. We had lunch at a restaurant overlooking the footpath which had great food and was good to sit and watch the entertainment walk past.We hired a tandem bike and rode all the way up to Santa Monica BLVD and headed back.There are a lot of homeless people about but don't really bother you for anything.check out the many shops offering medical marijuana and medical certificate for approx $40.Walking along it was obvious a lot of people in venice beach have glaucoma as the smell of weed wafts around freely.Great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benbencor
30,Theres better beaches out there,"If you are dead set on visiting Venice beach do yourself a favor and rent a bike from Santa Monica and ride in instead of walk.Venice Beach can get kind of sketchy in places and all the cool stuff is further in than the boardwalk. So a bike ride is perfect because it allows you to see all the cool Venice stuff and bypass the crazy. Some of it anyway.Highlights include the skateboard park, the graffiti wall, roller skate park and muscle beach. Theres playgrounds all along the bike route if you just want to chill with the family for a bit. Also bathrooms. Pretty clean for the most part.If you want away from the tourists and smell of patchouli for a bit I would suggest Abbot Kinney. Its a nice little shopping district filled with boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants. They also have art galleries and vintage stores. Just a cool place to hang. You might even spot a celeb or two. Okay, and maybe smell a little patchouli.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaezaJay
40,Not what we expected,"Very good to be there at people watch but it isn't what we expected but still good, many restaurants and shops for souvenirs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632joshc
50,"Fun, Entertaining, Fun!","There is So Much to see, do, and Be at Venice Beach! In the morning, the beach is Beautiful, not many people were there at that time, later during the day the people were there and Everyone Fit! It's So Exciting with people, music, art, vendors, stunt people, etc, you name it-they are there! No signs of not nice people Anywhere! Just people from Everywhere enjoying Venice Beach! I would Love to Live there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVisitors2016
50,So much to see,I stayed 2 blocks from Venice beach. Walked to the beach in the morning could relax or join everyone. Great people watching,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ausjaz1234
30,Disappointment,"Unbelievable how much trash is found on the beach; gloves, straws, paper and Starbucks cups😞. There were lots of people who seemed to be homeless, asking for money and selling things. There was a skate park that was fun to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyK781
40,Chill,It was such a chill and funky atmosphere. I loved it! Everywhere you see its something entertaining and there's a lot of shops along the side walk. The best part was watching the skaters practice their tricks and to even see little girls up there with the big boys lol.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gigi_love715
50,Fun!!!!,"Venice Beach is by far one of my favorite places to visit! I love the eccentric and eclectic crowd. Everyone is usually friendly. If you're up for anything, check out Venice Beach. If your a ""home-body"" or don't like crowds, don't go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teachmama
10,Nice bike ride,This place could be so much more but it was very disappointing other than the bike ride down from Santa Monica and back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730dalem
50,Fabulous exciting place,"I love Venice Beach. So much to see and do.I have been many times and it has never disappointed me. There is such a wide variety of talent displayed along the board walk, many many fun places to eat, caters for all types of diets and is a microcosm of the world.Fabulous long beach and glorious sunshine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/totallynoname
50,A necessary stop over if only to get your medical card?,The Drum Circle is the big attraction at sunset and quite remarkable.....reminiscent but only faintly of the summer of love.....The FREAK SHOW is only 5 dollars and its worth it as the Val Lewton like characters are friendly and the samples in bottles intriguing....Muscle beach is a show off place and maybe the freaks are outside more than in the place where they are housed......in fact the s is a symbol of the complete degeneration of all the hippy ideals and the few genuine people that are not selling SOMETHING are now few and far between. There is a great guy selling masks and other good stuff (Tim I think) and is very knoweageable and I make a point of going to see him every sunday when I am here....The BOOKSHOP on the beach is excellent and the food in the various places varied. Most people go to get medical cards that allow them to carry small doses of sativa and hash and the placard says 40dollars but you end spending around 150 for everything. If you are going to smoke the card gives you some protection and access to strong stuff....but you can also just breathe the air at the week end....!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldr645
10,Creepy and sketchy,Don't know what all the fuss is about. Only fun thing was watching the skate boarders. Everything else seemed old and sketchy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butterflytravellor

40,Cool walk,"It's a good walk to go to, lots of live music and art. Not a really good place for kids cause there's lots of homeless and people showing lots of skin.. But a great place for teens and young adults! Good vibes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darynkag
50,Venice Beach reflects the diversity of Los Angeles,"One of my favorite places to hang out. Venice Beach has something for everyone, paddle tennis, weight-lifting, gymnastic court, bicycling, roller-skating, skate-board park, surfing, swimming, racquetball, handball, basketball, volleyball, apparatuses for children, etc. There are plenty of restaurants & bars and numerous street performers and vendors are out there on the boardwalk. Tattoo parlors galore and plenty of places to sit and people watch. Black, white, red, brown or yellow, rich or poor, real estate developer or homeless, it doesn't matter, you'll see it all in VB.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arejaydoubleyou
30,Honeymoon,"Stayed in a VRBO on our honeymoon within walking distance from the beach and Boardwalk. Interesting place! We loved walking, stopping into the stores, or kiosks on the boardwalk. Great art and other unique collectibles. Loved being able to walk to Santa Monica pier which wasn't too far from Venice.LOTS of homeless people sleeping on or near the boardwalk and beach who often asked us for money or a cigarette. It was sad (and often uncomfortable) to encounter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinastinabina
30,Venice Beach,A lot of people walking around.Enjoy the sun and the smell of sea while you are drinking your coffee.There are many things that can still upgrade but its a nice experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwilliams1979la
10,Unsafe! Shady!,"Please don't go by the name of it. It raises your expectations and then these expectations come crashing to ground 0.Unfortunately most tourists like me stick to the popular must visit places and get tricked into visiting places like the Venice Beach.The beach is lined by tacky and shady looking shops. We reached there around 5:30 PM and could feel unsafe already even at sunset wondering how bad it would be after dark. The crowd was rowdy.Best avoided, especially after early hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51rashmim
50,Enjoy the Freak Show,"I love this place. It's like a swap meet, street carnival, and freak show all rolled into one. Lots of things to see and do. Shopping is fun, and the people watching is the best! If you've been to Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas you will understand what I am talking about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BazisGirl
10,Tacky,"Why waste time on this cheap and rather nasty place/ the only virtue is that It does not feel unsafe but the so-called sea front shops are, in fact, little messy shacks with cheap,tawdry products . The beach itself is OK but the much vaunted graffiti park is bettered by many downtown walls. The few hundred remaining yards of the old canal are the only attractive feauture in this souless area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chidham
30,A little underwhelming,"Always wanted to visit this much talked about place... very nice sandy beach, roller bladers, walkers, runners, bike riders are what you see here... the street vendors selling fake knock-offs of everything really cheapen the whole place, a bit dirty for my liking too and just wasn't what I thought it would be - i did love all the cool street art and murals that dot the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBrank
40,Unique Vibe,"Venice is a nice beach. Its got its own unique vibe going on. It's fun to see all the artists that are set up selling their stuff. You can find crystal gemstones, native artifacts & the traditional touristy items for purchase. You can even watch people work out on the beach if you don't find that boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maxxxines
40,Nice but also very touristy,The beach is great and it's fun to walk around watching people - especially the bodybuilders area. It is kinda crowded and touristy and not a place I would choose to come just to relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CasperH
40,Nice Beach,"...if you ignore all the homeless people and the horrible toilet facilities.The beach itself is very beautiful and clean. It's very long so bring comfy shoes if you want to walk all the way from muscle beach to Santa Monica Pier like we did! Lot of shops selling very similar products, and some good food stalls along the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swannifer
40,Californian Spirit,Venice Beach is a very popular place to go to. It can get quite crowded during the weekend but the boardwalk is filled with shop and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreTheFoodie
20,Not all it's cracked up to be,A lot of homeless people and druggies wandering and it kinda ruined the beauty of the area. The stores are all selling the same things . Not such a great area to just walk around. Very hippy area. Wouldn't recommend bringing children around here . Beach was quiet and not dirty but the bathrooms were really gross. Can tell the homeless use them. Expected a cleaner area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52jeria
20,Nothing like the photos but worth a visit,Went to Venice Beach with the family as the adds and the pictures make it out to be a wonderful and beautiful place. A real shock.... The beach is nice and the sand white but the only good thing to do is people watch and walk through to see the crap people are selling.Enjoyed the visit but to say to people I have been there... Only wish I could have seen it like the adds show it. This is one of the sights you need to see to say you have been there and that's it.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoutheastStar
50,Great Life on the Beach,"Venice Beach is filled with lots of shopping and people. There is a variety of street entertainment and beautiful sunset views. Public transportation from Union Station is Red line to 7th Street Metro Station, Expo to Culver City, Bus 733/33 to Grand & Main.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750terrencec
40,Not as good as it use to be,"While neat place to visit for short time very hard to find parking place and what little entertainment I saw was set to raise money. Food vendors were a little pricey but then I am from the mid west. However, 6.00 for a small funnel cake? Still it is worth going bye to say you have seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teetermom
40,A touch of LA Beach Life,"As an LA resident it is always fun to go there. Out door eating- bike rentals, skaters, skate boarders and beach volley ball is usually visible. If you walk far enough there is the muscle building section. Plus vendors of cheap fun souvenirs , hats glasses etc.There is always an assortment of sidewalk entertainers and just colorful folks. That situation is pretty much year round",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneg28
50,THE Eternal Carnival...,"A trip for anyone of any age to the Los Angeles area should not be considered complete until they walk the boardwalk at Venice Beach.

40,Playing in the water is awesome!,"We were lucky to find street parking at a meter, which was just $.75 for 2 hours. I made my way straight to the water, in my normal clothes, and stood on the shore. My clothes were wet for hours but it was totally worth it. I haven't seen waves and shoreline that crazy in a long time. Watch out with the little kids as the waves are fast and strong. Otherwise, have fun dodging and running in them and prepare to get wet. The pier was nice and long, tons of fishing at the end. Didn't make it to the muscle beach /boardwalk area during peak time, but it was an amazing place to sit and watch sunset. The parking lot at muscle beach is $4, while closer to the pier is $6.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dree411

40,Free attraction to pass a couple of hours,"Simply walking along the beach will stimulate your senses with the street entertainers and the array of shops selling food, souvenier and experiences. Muscle beach is there too but its not always full of hunky men as the movie portrays it to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/machofairy
50,For Beach Lovers only,If you are a beach lover then in LA thats a point to go. Enjoy the sea and beach walk and sea side restaurants. I just went for an hour around but over all a happening place specially in evening. However if you want real beach fun then go to Carlsbad just an hr and more from LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvnishS1975
40,Fun in the Sun!,Perfect for everybody. A lot of activities happening here. Lots of restaurants to choose from. You can walk or bike on the trail along the beach all the way to Santa Monica beach. Fun and happening place always!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoomieT

50,"Often missed, but one of the best LA attractions","The venice canals, especially in spring, are a beautiful sight to behold. It is often missed by tourists and sadly by people living in LA as well. Many people have commented to me that they haven't heard of it or haven't been there; but when they do they are quite surprised at how they missed this. So don't ignore it. Walk around, admire and enjoy the gardens pf peoples homes and the peaceful waters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ria20142014
40,Venice Beach,If you like to people watch this beach is great. The boardwalk is fantasitic and there is never a dull moment on the boardwalk. Don't take your pets there between memorial day and labor day as they are banned. Plenty of places to eat and lots to enjoy. Remember the water is cold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496davidr496
40,Great place to bring your out of town friends and family.,"What can I say about Venice Beach that has not already been said? Its not a beach for everyone that is for sure. With that said, it is my favorite beach in CA. As a musician and artist myself, I appreciate everything Venice has to offer. It is not uncommon to find musicians and other artists on the boardwalk that easily rival any commercial artist on TV or radio. With that said, Venice can be enjoyed by anyone, but if you are looking for more elegant and ""aristocratic"" beaches, then maybe beaches like Huntington, Laguna, or Newport might be more your speed. If you are adventurous and looking for something a bit ""different"" and ""edgy,"" then Venice has a wide array of that. Lets sum up Venice beach: You never know what you're going to get, and its slightly different every time you go. Those interested in food and drink, music and art, colorful crowds and excitement not found elsewhere...Venice will not disappoint. Lots of great hotels right on the boardwalk too. Walking distance from virtually anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtrumA
50,Visiting The Boardwalk in Venice is a MUST DO. People watching and fun at its finest,"Venice is iconic LA, a throw back to the 1960's with an urban edge. It is not unusual to see street talent, basketball stars, wild roller skaters all happening at the same time. It is so much fun. The weather Easter through November is AWESOME. Its on the Beach. Its LA vibe in real time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,Very Eclectic,"It is fun and an eclectic place. Skateboarders, street performers and vendors selling their goods to tourist and locals. There are little diner/cafe places to eat where the food is good if you get really hungry. It is always full of people except in the morning before the shops open. The last time I was there a group of 10 to 12 drummers were on the beach close to the water's edge playing an almost hypnotic rhythm as the sun was going down. A very cool place with a lot to see and plenty of history....you will never know what you are going to see at Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PCourt2015
20,Sleazy,"I avoid Venice beach at all costs, but visitors always have to see for themselves.Teens might like it for the t-shirt/head shops, but otherwise its tourists and the aggressive street performers who prey on them. If you must go, rent some bikes there and cruise north to Santa Monica Pier, or south around Marina Del Rey to Manhattan or Hermosa Beach. Get a map for this second option as navigating the marina can be tricky.Inland a bit is Abbott Kinney for trendy star spotting, or Main Street in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennydonut
50,Always a scene,This is people watching at its best. It really hasn't changed much in 30 years. On a nice day you can even spend a little time on the beach and then have a drink if one of the sidewalk cafés.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12345rover
40,Venice visit,"We brought out of town visitors to Venice beach. It was very crowded on a warm sunny weekend. Most of the visitors there are from out of town looking for weird Los Angeles. There are lots of cheap souvenir stores along the cement board walk and street performers. The classic street performers are the man walking on broken glass and musicians, and sometimes break dancers . There are many medical marijuana dispensaries along with henna artists and jewelry sellers. We like to watch the advanced skateboard park. The classic Venice outdoor gym is also popular with the tourists. Some bodybuilders will let you take a photo with them. It is a gym for people who want to be seen. It is a unique scene.Although the beach is wide with lots of sand, most come here for the weird boardwalk scene. There is a great bike path next to the pedestrian walk that goes for several miles north of Vence. You can ride your bicycle north to past LAX airport and see the different personalities to each beach. South of Venice are canals so the bike path goes inland for a bit. You can rent bikes at Venice which is fun. I like to eat at cool places so check out the Abbot McKinney neighborhood within walking distance of Venice for upscale trendy small shops and restaurants. There is Venice parking right at the beach that is cheaper than the lots nearby but it fills up. Sometimes you can find street parking for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbiLyn1
50,A Blast From the Past,"If you missed the 60s and want to get that vibe back again, take a walk through Venice Beach.

Always very busy, packed with dozens of different types of people - locals and tourists.The locals here are probably the most interesting people I talked to - from break dancers, skateboarders, rollerbladers and surfers to graffiti artists and painters, shop owners and traders, Venice Beach is a hub of activity and there is always something crazy and interesting to look at!Definitely not to be missed, I'd recommend going around sunset as they're really the most stunning sunsets I've ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomcottam

40,It's Much More Than Muscle Beach .... Best People Watching in CA.,"Ye gads, this place has to be the best people watching area on the planet.You simply can't make up what walks around this place. Nice beach, with easy walking areas and street entertainment about every four blocks. Do yourself a favor, stop by, although parking can be an issue, and pick out a spot to sit and just watch, the weird, the obnoxious, the natural, the talented and the outrageous walk by you. For a couple of hours, entertaining to say the least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/undertaker01
50,FUN!!,Nice relaxing Wednesday afternoon. Lot to see. Loved the graffiti trees and skate park. I have been told that Sunday is even better. Must visit if visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128leighw
40,A must see when visiting L.A.,There's a lot more to Venice beach than the pot smoking craft vendors.It boasts one the best skate parks and the home of open air gym Muscle Beach (open to the public).There's also a pretty good beer garden where you can catch sports on the big screen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean_MarcR183
20,Be careful,"Beautiful spot but harassment by local homeless cut our visit short ... we were followed by a disturbed man shouting profanities at us for no reason...this place was a colorful happy spot to visit years ago, but I couldn't recommend it today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawR9945MK

30,Tourist Insanity,"Had an unseasonably warm day so we decided to visit Venice Beach. Amazing how many other people were there on a Thursday in March, not the prime Spring Break week but must have been spring break for many. If you want a huge beach, tons of tacky shops then this is the place for you. If you want serenity this not the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hagemannj
50,Friendly people beautiful place,"Passed by this beautiful wonderful beach near LAX. Ideal for anyone any age. Just be prepared for the high cost parking. But all so worth it, best to spend a day there and I think the $25 or so parking covers the whole day. So worth it! God bless America! Such friendly people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenthebem

50,Awesome!!!,I loved this beach.. So multi culture here. Walked the strip and can go walk along beach. Watch waves roll in on go high surf day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc302015
50,Excellent for people-watching,"Venice Beach attracts all sorts of characters: weight-lifter, roller skaters, bike riders, street vendors, skate boarders, sun worshipers, a melange of people out for a stroll or hand-out on the pathway which parallels the ocean. Stores and concessionaires line both sides of path and are filled with things and services for a fee. To name just a few, there are paintings, photos, jewelry, palm-readers, masseuses, t-shirts, sweat-shirts, beachwear, shoes, handbags, sunglasses, It is a hodgepodge of sights, sounds and things to buy, touristy and otherwise. It is a wonder place to spend a few hours or the day. There are places to eat almost anything you can think of as you walk along, enjoying the sights; my husband and I always eat at the Sidewalk Cafe which is always packed with a line out the door. The food is pretty good, plentiful and very modestly priced. Inside there is a full bar with some sporting event on TV. Dress down, wear sunscreen, sunglasses, flat shoes and or a hat. Leave heavy handbags at home. Plan at least 3 hours. It is easy to spend the greater part of a day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCD2
50,Beauty,I am here now and it is clean and sunny and it also has easy parking i just payed $6.00 .beach looks clean as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/378vanec
10,Very disgusting!,"The place is riddled with homeless people - or should I say, they have built their homes on the beach, which makes it very unpleasant surroundings. We walked down there from Santa Monica. On the great Boardwalk Trails and thought we might go stop there for lunch. The beach area is disgusting with very tacky and tasteless t- shirt shops, unclean looking people and small take-out food stands. Couldn't wait to get out of there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwmv65
50,Need to visit,"We arrived 1 hour before sunset. I think this was a good timeing, cuz you can visit the stores and also see the beautiful Californian sunset from the sandy beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalmartato
40,People watching outstanding here!,"This is the home of Muscle Beach...very interesting and colorful people here. Unfortunately there are also many homeless. Go and enjoy watching the surfers, skateboarders and those working out at Muscle Beach. It will be unlike anything you have sen before...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682margaretq
50,Venice Beach... iconic beach mile and tourist magnet,"It is very difficult to say anything about Venice beach that hasn't been said a million times before.It is one of the most iconic and famous beaches / beachfront walkways on the planet, featured in countless Hollywood movies and other popular culture.The beach itself is probably not the most notable thing - the beachfront walkway is.Full of small shops, colorful people and tourists wandering about, fitness enthusiasts jogging, cycling, inline skating, skateboarders and people who just hang out - it's an abundance of interesting stuff to indulge in.Obviously also very touristic...There are loads of bars and restaurants around the strip, including a few rooftop venues which offer stunning views for the Pacific sunset.I have been there once in 1994 and now again over 20 years later - not much has changed.It's definitely worth exploring the strip all the way towards Santa Monica and enjoy some time at the Santa Monica Pier.For anyone visiting LA - this is a must-see spot in my opinion...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideman1
30,Weirdo city,"Interesting place, but it has too many weirdos, freaks, and homeless people. Good for people watching but for a pure beach visit I'd go elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davo1234999
40,stopover,"this is a great place to visit and stay in what is otherwise a boring city - once described as ""32 suburbs in search of a city"". In the only major city in the world without an iconic city centre or significant landmark (forget the silly Hollywood sign) the beach offers a point of reference where no other exists. it is also long , sandy and full of restaurants, great shopping and Angelinos showing off in the sun; a great place to hang out after a long trans Pacific flight and to preparer for the long flight home",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gesr2016
50,Superb beach,"The beach is very nice. Clean with nice sand. Very large. Skip the boardwalk (see my other comment) and spend some time on the beach. However, not very different than Santa Monica so if you don't have time don't spend time coming to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me74126500
20,Filthy and seedy has changed since 70s,"Visited Venice beach after some many decades ago and the place has gone to the dogs. The filth, dirt and crusty ambience makes me not want to come back. Too bad really because back in the 70s it was quite the hipster fun place to be and so much cleaner. I get it, that was decades ago (38 yrs.) and things change but it's just too bad this place changed in the absolute worst way. The beach and ocean is, and always will be, nice but the promenade/boardwalk whatever you want to call it left me creepy crawly and sad. The city really should clean up this place because from what I've seen now it has become a disappointing cesspool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Picstar
40,Wacky fun,"This location is a must visit for all of your out of town guests. It has a full compliment of wacky performers such as the guy who juggles chain saws. It also has more than its compliments of t-shirt stalls and other souvenir shops. There is also muscle beach, which is an area set aside for both men(mainly) and women to demonstrate what weight lifting can do for your physique. The whole scene is probably unique in the USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisman2016
50,Unique California beach,"Without a doubt my favourite place in LA. Venice offers the visitors tons of things to do: see the skaters perform amazing tricks, shopping, observe the bodybuilder a in muscle beach, eat a great variety of foods or my very favourite: chill in the sun.Venice beach is a must for tourist. Besides, there are people always performing magic tricks or dances in the street, which is great to see and a really nice memory to every trip to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/874jesuss
50,"Venice: always funky, never boring.","I moved to Los Angeles from Minnesota almost 4 years ago . I have always loved the funky energy that exists in Venice . You have everything from bodybuilders on muscle Beach, two basketball players playing on the local courts like in the movie white men can't jump , you got a fantastic skateboard park that has a variety of people who could skateboard at a very very high-level . You have a myriad of different shops and restaurants and bars that are along the beachfront . You can rent a paddleboard's you could get a surfing lesson , you could people watch at the vast assortment of humanity - from homeless people to the Uber chic . Oh yeah and all you have is the Pacific ocean and the worlds biggest sandbox right there .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rugbyrn60
50,Lovely experience,The performances were entertaining. I enjoyed watching the pickup games.There are many shops and food to choose from,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nmontague
30,"Venice Boardwalk, a must see for tourists","Venice Beach & Boardwalk are a one of a kind experience. Street performers, local crazies, lots of shopping/touristy type souvenirs. A must see for tourists. I would suggest Malibu for the a nicer time....but this is sort of a circus on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bijou59
50,Remember to keep an open mind...,"Warning: Venice Beach is NOT for the faint at heart or someone looking for a usual beach experience. There is nothing usual about this place at all! I've been here twice now and took my friends to experience the madness. We took a nice leisurely walk and (including the pier) strolled more than 3 miles.You have to be prepared: for great sidewalk art and creations (woodwork, paintings, etc.). For crazy contortionists or dare devils who do handstands on two boards held up by plastic solo cups while teetering on a metal post. For street breakdancers. For artists pushing their music (a polite no thank you and keeping it moving will do just as well, they're used to it). For random T-shirt (and underwear) designs, cheap sunglasses, jewelry, and even incense. For greasy spoon type food (including funnel cake, churros, hot dogs, burgers and fries), and even fresh fruit sold by multiple vendors. For multiple medical marijuana doctors (if that's your thing) and vape/smoke shops. For VERY interesting people watching. For heavily (and not so heavily) muscled men working out and snapping pics with tourists (looking for a tip of course, everyone has a hustle, and I'm not mad). For street basketball. For crowded walking. For patrons on bikes rolling through the path from Santa Monica.This is NOT the place to be pretentious. Venice is truly an experience in and of itself. Worrying about ""icky people"" and smells (look it's a public place full of people) is not going to do you any good if you can't let go of that, relax, and enjoy the experience. If the boardwalk isn't you're thing, walk much further down toward the fishing pier (which has great views but is very plain) to view the beach houses and see the nicest part of Venice. Walking up toward main street are a number of great restaurants (plug for the Rose Cafe).Parking: plentiful and less than $10 ON THE BEACH. You will see multiple pages blocks before the boardwalk with $20-25 parking. Be warned. You can look up the state beach lots before you go. We used the one right at the end of Rose Street which seemed to be right at the beginning of the action, but not super busy. You have to dodge pedestrians crossing the boardwalk to get to the lot.Overall, I love this place. You never know what you'll experience, see or who you will meet. Just keep an open mind and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOneiricTraveler
40,Cool beach,"It's a cool beach to visit. There's a skateboard rink, muscle beach (gym on the beach) and strip of souvenir shops. It has cheap food spots to get a quick snack. Iconic beach to visit once for a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colourpop
10,ZERO STARS,"YUCK YUCK YUCK!This place is not what it seems on TV!It's dirty, Rubbish everywhere. Don't forget the smell of Dope! Over powering.There were needles and lots of hustlers wanting money. Think I walked up and back down and left.Would not waste my time here, plenty of nice beaches in LA, just not this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anderson2023
30,Beach OK but,The area is a bit run down.I did not find it as picturesque as I imagined.Lots of movies had scenes shot here in the past but those days have been lost.Nostalgia might make the visit worthwhile I suppose.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMAN1951
40,Nice,We came here towards the end of the day. Great place to walk around and have a drink. We walked of the beach seeing some of the beautiful houses they have with a beachfront until we found a great little spot with the best margaritas! Probably the place where I encountered less homeless people in LA.Great place to spend an afternoon having a drink or some local food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscX4398ZK
20,Pick your day to visit here,We didn't know about the Santa Anna winds until we visited Venice Beach. We were seriously sand blasted as we tried to have a look at the beach and the muscle men. The beach was empty as the wind storm made it unbearable. There are what seemed like hundreds of shops selling tacky souvenirs or ordinary food. Not in a hurry to go back. Think they are living in a time warp on this one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OutofAfrica46
10,Seen it twice now ...,On both occasions this place has gotten worse for harassing people trying to peddle their music ... 1 goose said here is my free CD I do not take money I just want it promoted ... I was reluctant to even go this far ... He put the CD in my hand than said I need a tip ... I gave him the CD and gave him a tip P off and peddle his crap elsewhere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevHoltham

50,Beautiful beach,"This is a wonderful way to spend a day or two. The water is very pretty, there is a lot to do so you won't get bored, many choices of food. It was too cold to swim when we were there but we enjoyed walking on the beach, watching the surfers and the planes taking off from LAX",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janb3321
50,Iconic Experience,"Venice Beach is a crazy mix of tourist mixed with locals loving their beachside location. Heaps to look at, a variety of holiday gifts to choose from and graphic mural art on buildings. There are activities available to all like hiring a bike, bring your own inline skates or walk the area at your own pace. Venice Beach draws you to visit every time you go to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cazcatz
40,It's like being inside a Hollywood Movie Set,What I like about Venice Beach is that it attracts people from all kinds of backgrounds. It's a very open minded place with lots to do. i rented a bicycle here and rode it all the way to Hermosa Beach and back.There are lots of things to do here and there's some really nice real estate too.A lot of the action is along the promenade and on Washington Blvd. For an authentic Southern California Beach experience don't miss out on Venice Beach. It's like being a character on the set of a Hollywood movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdriannaA_12
50,Wonderful Wintertime Bike Ride,"Drove to the beach at the end of Washington Blvd, parked on the side street, rented a bike and rode to the north under the Santa Monica Pier and further. Great ride, low performance bike. Lots to see along the way. It is more crowded south of the pier, less crowed to the north. Plenty of places to stop and get a snack. Actually clean restrooms along the way with places to lock your bike. As there were two feet of snow on the ground on the home, this ride was even better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mntraveler35

20,Very Run Down,"It was a super sunny day that we went but crazy windy. The beach didn't look too bad but also seemed like every other beach. The shops were disappointing. Few restaurants, tshirt souvenirs and tattoo/smoke shops. That was basically the whole walk. Was quite disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittyBoo88
30,venice beach,"you have to rent a bike to ride right down to santa monica pier, 40 mins there and then 40 mins back, the beach is huge and lots of restaurants nearby, parking is easy to.... and marina del rey is just 5mins away...if you get lucky you might even see seals,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnp55555
50,Great way to spend the day,"In this three-mile stretch of sand you can bike, walk or run along the trail from Marina de Rey to Santa Monica. I did all three. For less strenuous activity you can stroll or sun on the beach, eat or drink at one of the many ocean-facing bars and restaurants, listen to music by any of a number of impromptu artists camped out on the beach or shop at any of the dozens of stores and vendors along Ocean Front Walk.There is no shortage of opportunity to do something, or nothing, nor is there any pressure to choose. Bike rentals are available at several places along the beach. That's a great place to start. Or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S0Lsearcher
20,Been there... done that... even bought the t-shirt ... but won't do it again!,"I was under the impression that Venice Beach would be a cool, eclectic, funky little hippie haven that would hold all sorts of interesting shops and venues and be a fun people-watching spot. Wrong! Cool - NO! Eclectic - sort of. Funky - ABSOLUTELY in the stinky, ugly way! People hawking cheap clothing at exorbitant prices, food that smelled, tasted and looked like it came over on the ark! And people watching? Well, THAT was an unforgettable experience! Really and truly- if you want to fill your people-watching cup, THIS is the place to go! Other than that, it was a profound FAIL!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zippy1955
50,Love this place!,"Venice beach is not only a beautiful beach but it's a very entertaining places visit.Yes there are a lot of homeless and mind altered people here but they are all friendly and it makes for super awesome people watching!There is a lot of great food options around with a lot of stores selling the beach side classics like hot dogs, chilli cheese fries and burgers. I recommend finding garlic fries!The shopping is great, perfect for anyone with a hippy vibe to their life.You can haggle with the stores as there are lots of options so often you can get what you want for cheaper.There are also a lot of ""green doctors"" around if you want to try the legal medicinals.It's a short walk from the Venice canals, Santa Monica pier and Marina Del Ray.One of my favourite places to visit in California and would defiantly recommend to visit on any Cali trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coca7103

50,Best way to spend a day.,We spent a whole day at the beach before catching our flight back home and I most say my other guests wish we went there every night... it's Raw entertainments!! Although the restaurants are a little expensive there's a lot of vendors there that have juicy meals for any budget. From 1.99 pizza to a cup of fruits for $5 I love every minute of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilittef
20,"Splendid destination, but the homeless ruin it","This is a usual stop for tourists when visiting Los Angeles, but the influx and number of homeless and various other ""nomads"" tend to put a damper on Venice for giving people a quality experience.MIsfits abound in this sunny playground, and there's no let up in sight for any solution to this problem----as the local governments continue to cater to these people, which simply keeps them where they're at, both geographically and their soci-economic position.I'd pass on this, and head to Orange County.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnCA784

20,Disappointing,"Another iconic place to see however this one was not up to sniff. Many homeless and indigent people everywhere. Stores were primarily tattoo parlours, marijuana joints, some fast food restaurants and t shirt/sunglasses and souvenir shops. Go and see it for yourself if you are into this. It was a bit of a cool day and overcast so it was not crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seeshell_10

Everyone reasonable, even the homeless people on the benches (offer them your carry away boxes after your meals - they could use them)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959gailc
20,Meh,Went on neighbors recommendation. Arrived about noon on a Friday. Very dirty area & the public restrooms were unusable.

Very disappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulo27
40,Eclectic California Beach,"Destination beach for all tourists. I always take friends and family to Venice beach when visiting LA. Super artsy and laid back, Venice beach is always a lovely day on the beach. Rent a bike and ride the boardwalk to Santa Monica Beach.

50,Wow,"Just like the movies but older and more worn. Still a great stop and beautiful scenery. All the chachki shops and street performers are overwhelming but worth the stroll.

We woke up early one morning and decided to make the 4 hour drive to the west coast since we had never been before.

That was definitely the highlight of our Vegas trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcanzanella

50,Camden Lock by the Sea,"Those of you who know London will know of Camden Lock , a bohemian market where all life is parading by.....transport that to California , add a few more hippies ,beats ,punks and general colourful souls and you are at Venice Beach , one of the worlds best people watching spots.I first visited Venice in 1977 when it was in the midst of a renaissance. In the sixties Venice was a sad failed enterprise , the concept of building an copy of the Italian city had failed long ago although a couple of canals still existed. Most of the original architecture had been demolished and the area was pretty run down. Because it was cheap the survivors of the hippie generation moved in and gradually things took off . My favourite eatery The Sidewalk Cafe was an accident when the owners of Small World Books bought a run down building on the front when the moved from Marina Del Rey. To supplement the the bookshop they started a small cafe which became the iconic eatery it is now. Food is great by the way . Venice is now buzzing ..the weekends are hectic...if you can visit during the week it is easier to park and a little less hectic, but to catch the best of the street performers the weekend is a must. If you have the stamina you can walk to Santa Monica ,or hire a bike. Look out for Harold Perry known as the Sikh on skates ,sailing by playing electric guitar, he was there in 1977 he is still there! Venice is one great big sunny smile , a hugely life affirming place, of course as in any large crowded area watch your stuff but I have never felt threatened and have always loved visiting. No trip to LA is complete without a visit to this mad place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonPeterB
10,Dirty,"Was very disappointed as the beach was dirty with litters and cigarette butts everywhere. I was told it is one of the most expensive place in the world for properties however, people who live there don't seem to be interested maintaining the place. What a shame..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helen591

50,Beachy,Venice is a little on the dirtier side for beach patrons but I have to say that's what I love about it. Don't get me wrong I love Manhattan Beach or Santa Monica but if you want the indie experience this is the one to go to. They have colorful street vendors and performers. The shops have cheap little take aways and the beach is actually very clean. Love this for the down earth beach vibe. You have to be in the mood for that though...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayla044

20,not what it used to be,Brought my daughters to Venice beach very sad to see it changed so much. No more muscles and seems to be all drugs and homeless. Very sad.

50,"loved, loved, loved this beach!",I went on a recent trip to California with my son and visited this beach. I went during the week on a Tyesday and it was not busy at all.

40,"Avoid at night, t-shirt scams","Great place! Do not go here after 6pm the locals say this is when the gangs come out. I noticed a strong scent of weed on the beach and by people working at the shops especially the graphic t -shirt stores. My advice is browse around all the t-shirt stores to find the best quality. Be very careful and watch prices at the graphic t shirt stores where they iron-on designs the guy tried to rip me off by $40 dollars I had to argue with him until I got the right price. His breath also smelled strongly of weed. Be careful your 4 t-shirts can end up being over $80 because the tax is high. The t-shirt store to the left of muscle beach is the best quality out of all the shops. There's a lot of 3 for $16.99 deals. Great muscle beach hoodies and shirts! The beach is beautiful there's lots to do such as tennis, bike riding and you can rent all items :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sportygirl1772
40,Great place to visit,"There are shops alone the Boardwalk. You won't get bored with the street performers. If you don't have a bike, you can rent one by the hour or half day. The bike path from here can lead you North to Santa Monica Pier and beyond. There is a skateboard plaza where you can see people showing off their skateboard jumping styles. You can easily spend a couple of hours here. Parking lots alone the bike path and close to the beach is $10 flat rate. If you bring your own bikes, you can have ice cream and lunch alone the Boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelL667

40,Young at Heart,"Venice Beach is a part of California Lifestyle. I was there at a younger age. My daughter loved it in her 20's.

It s a great place to see and take a walk through with all the little shops and friendly people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinem503

50,Skateboard park and people watching,Everyone should go once to say they have been. Too many homeless for my comfort but def something you check of your to do list. great place to people watch.

Great to spend an hour and buy something that says venice beach on it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anabellepaulino
20,Beach with abit of urban decay,If ur after a beach experience go somewhere else. This is one of those areas u stop by just cause its on the travel books and u want to see the boardwalk and or see muscle beachThe beach is abit dirty and u find quite a few homeless hanging around there. I suspect u wouldnt want to be there at night time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoGGnyne
50,Great for people watching,"If you visit LA, Venice Beach is a must. So many sights and sounds, from Muscle Beach, to the street entertainers, artists and musicians, there is a lot to take in. Its a must see, an experience. For something a little more serene than the brash boardwalk, wander off the front and discover the delightful canals and the beautiful homes that line the waterways. Look out for the super cute hummingbirds :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lissy2904
40,Spring break was lit af,"Beautiful place, pretty warm and lots of people's alway celebrities out and just a marvelous atmosphere. Beach was clean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintshay
10,Go to St Monica Pier- dangerous place.,"This is the beach version of skid row. Be more safe and go to St Monica. Only due to strong police presence, where we able to walk briefly and then quickly left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indiansummer64
40,Beach walk,Nice beach...lots of activities...beautiful beach sand. Nice bike / walk bath. Bike rentals everywhere. Lots of shops to look around in. Bathrooms are well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnF442
40,Interesting!,"An interesting place, great for people watching, a good place to walk your dog and to play with other dogs. beautiful sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAL7777777
50,I love this beach,"I found this place with so much energy, the wild, the youth and the fun.. I enjoyed walking along the beach and see different shops. So much fun to see people doing things there. This is a great place to experience youth energy and the wildness of people here. would love to come back visit again..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifecity
30,ride a bike,Your typical LA scene that you have to see and experience.Lots of street merchants and weird people arround. Recommend renting a bike for an hour ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188germana
50,Always interesting,Venice beach.... Ahh always interesting for sure. Interesting place to people watch. Sometimes there's cool stuff to buy from local artists and shows from street performers to watch on the weekends. Fun stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pepper297
40,Tacky but...,"You know you want to see it. So go. Everything's tacky but the people watching is first rate. Excellent walking, biking and running path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenT116
10,Too many other beautiful beaches without the homeless influence,"I was stunned by how many homeless people are here and that they are allowed to keep all their stuff, tents, etc. right on the main promenade. The beach itself is beautiful but the shopping is pretty crummy and every third store is a shirt shop. Won't be back for quite some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legsbell
40,Fun andvibrant,Popped in here for a couple of days when I arrive in LAX to rest up. Buzzing fun evening atmosphere with loads of places to eat etc. Cool beach and nothing to stressful. Easy place to chill and unwind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewe949
50,Ecclectic and beautiful,"First time pacific coast beach experience and we'll worth returning. There are plenty of shops and restaurants for each taste. The people watching is splended. There's plenty to do whether you want to weight train, play basketball or volleyball, run, play with the kids or simply soak up the sun. The beach waters are beautiful. This is a must see if ever in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeavenlyRN
40,Fun for a day but after that move along,I have been going here for about 35 years. You can really see the place in a day so if you are visiting LA one day in Venice beach is about all you really need. Food quality and price on the boardwalk is about what you would expect from a typical tourist trap. Main street has some places to eat and drink too. The boardwalk can be tricky at night after everything closes down so be careful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSexyBeast
10,Nothing worth seeing,"Venice Beach is seriously grim. There are huge numbers of homeless people sleeping with their collection of furniture and it's better that they're sleeping because some of them are loud and aggressive when awake.I saw a guy running up and down screaming loudly that he needed a dollar right now or he'd ""explode his head off"".The paths are paved with really untalented artists and charlatans pretending to be psychics and all of the food options look like you'll be paying $10 for the privilege of having chronic diarrhea.It's all a real shame because the beach between Santa Monica Pier (rubbish) and the bit where the shops are on Venice Beach is actually a beautiful piece of beach. Stay clear of the pier and the muscle beach part and you'll have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyZB1
40,Rainy time at Venice beach,Visitor to LA should spend a day at he Venice Beach. It is one of the largest span of Beaches I have ever seen and I live in FLA. Find paid parking and stroll the beach. Many shops buy a tee shirt but keep the rest of you money in your pocket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longshadow
50,One of the best place to go in LA! Beautiful.,"One of the best place to go in LA! Beautiful. There's a Frank o Gary house on the seaside. There are many wall paintings of famous people! Eclectic and naif area!Very interesting to see! I suggest to rent a bike and have a ride along the seaside on the bikeroad!There are many places to rent, some of them really cheaper than others!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertoD324
50,Venice beach,We took the family to Venice beach one day while visiting the LA area. Its a very nice beach and highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenl484
40,Great Place for an Outing,"We, a group of eight (8) friends and spouses had gone to Venice Beach Boardwalk on a Sunday afternoon. Along the boardwalk, actually cemented walkway, there are a large number of shops, cafes, restaurants and ice cream parlors. The place had an interesting mix of regular shops and also shops on the walkway itself selling a large variety of items such as T-shirts, paintings to souvenirs. The place was full of people, including tourists, artists, musicians, singers and a few ""odd-bthere balls"". The beach was deserted - the water being cold, but between the boardwalk and beach there is a cycle path - which was quite busy. We found this to be a great place for an outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler-O-World
40,The walk!,"The beach is always amazing! Especially with your family. I love going to Venice beach. It's always full of surprises, you never know what you will find out there! I love seeing the different booths they have out there. There is a lot of different things for sell. It varies from hand made jewelry, head pieces, rocks from the sea, sage, and all other kinds of things. The food is pretty good. There is different places to eat along the board walk. You can go to the beach and then stroll down the board walk it's always a fun time going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adayanag
50,89° in February,So I happened on this beach on the most perfect day. The water is cool and clean the sand is soft and white. I highly recommend the speech some areas of it are quite wide from the boardwalk and some are closer. You can see the Santa Monica pier easily from the northern end. This is the perfect time to be here as there were very few other people. The boardwalk whoever had more people with delicious fruit sold from vendors freshly peeling it. This is definitely one of those places to people watch a lovely way to spend five or six hours or if you have less time one hour would still be enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethanyB827
40,It's Venice,"What can I say, yes it's touristy. That said its great people watching, unfortunately the homeless population can be a problem so you have to be aware. It's a fun walk or bike ride along the paths. When we do ride we go south along the bike path, I think it's a better ride, less crowded. There are lots of places to eat, although nothing really stands out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911sandrak
50,Never a bad time at the beach!,"Venice is an eclectic beach as compared to places like Huntington Beach and Laguna. It's got a more bohemian vice to it with the street venders. Just stop by muscle beach and see the guys and gals getting pumped. Also worth a stop is the skate park. Good for some good photos. Most of all, stake yourself out a good spot to witness the great southern California sunsets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReyV979
30,Definitely Interesting,"Full disclosure: My apartment is a 20-minute walk from Venice Beach. Therefore, I usually go to Venice Beach to play volleyball or bring friends from out of town. I've noticed my visiting friends often get a bit overwhelmed when we arrive at the boardwalk; it's extremely crowded (especially during weekends/holidays) with other tourists, street performers, folks selling trinkets, etc.Until fairly recently, Venice was considered a sketchy area (affectionately nicknamed 'ghetto by the sea'). In the last few years, Venice has experienced a lot of gentrification, thanks in large part to an influx of tech companies (Snapchat's HQ is on the boardwalk; Facebook, Google and YouTube all have offices within five miles). As a result, Venice has a very eclectic mix of residents - from homeless people, to gangsters and bikers, to hipsters, to Silicon Valley ex-pats. If you enjoy people watching, Venice is definitely your type of place.Overall, I'd say Venice is an essential stop for any adult tourists. For families looking to hit the beach, Santa Monica would probably be a better option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/js3126
40,Nice place to kill a couple of hours!,We took a uber pool ($12 for both of us) to Venice beach and spent a couple of hours browsing the shops and then watched the sunset. We did not have our swim suits as we were in transit so did not get to go into the water but there is so much to do and see..people roller blading and some funky stunts...and some people singing..and if nothing else browse the shops..there are plenty!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rikiroy
50,A WEEKEND ON THE BOARDWALK IS A MUST,"Anyone visiting Los Angeles who hasn't been on a walk along the boardwalk in Venice California has a real treat in store for them. Venice used to be called the place where the sewer meets the sea.Now, on Saturday and Sunday, you see every type of local merchant selling their wares, people roller skating and walking their dogs, great food to grab on your walk, outdoor restaurants with fabulous food and the most amazing characters from all over the world.Plan to spend the day and bring your camera because it is the best people watching in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiemF3752SN
40,Gritty but always good!,"I live near Venice and often cycle from Marina Del Rey to Santa Monica in the early morning. It is what it is, in the morning and through the day you will see a lot of transients, but they generally keep to themselves. Good cafes and bars near the pier and as you walk towards Santa Monica you will encounter a wide range of people. It is best to follow the guide books advise and don't venture to far after dark and just be aware of your surroundings. In summary what you see is what you get, don't miss it as an experience when visiting LA, but just be smart about your trip. Also don't miss the Venice Canals, just back from the ocean, but a must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smasher1
40,Quintessential Los Angeles,"Good time and a great snapshot of what represents so much of L.A. ...Beach, boardwalk, all 'walks' of life, crazy street acts, shopping, eating, drinking...tons of action and amazing people watching. If you are uncomfortable with crowds and dizzying diversity, Venice may not be for you. If so, Peaceful and quaint Marina Del Rey is just South of the Venice Pier (walking distance)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HansAbroad
40,To see the real thing,Venice Beach is an interesting place from what i thought it would be to reality. It is interesting to see but the same ol tourist shops and t shirts gets old after the first 1 mile or so. But maybe because it was winter the actiacti was very light it didn't have the vibe or eclectic mix of people i have seen in tv shows or documentaries.Glad i have been t shirt to show for it i will go again in warmer weather to see if more street artists come out but one group we watched were brilliant and had a very large crowd and great show. Well worth the visit tho if you have time but probably in warmer months.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glennb164
30,Great Adventures...,"I liked it better 45 years ago...it is too crowded & uppety...I use to call it home...I would rather remember it like it was...good-bye old friend...hello 'progress'?...oh well, just get in there & hang on & take yourself a stroll up the Venice boardwalk...there are still hints of nostalgic places & friendly faces & the warm feeling of acceptance that flows with the spirit of this historic beach. It's changed alot but I still gotta love it..rock on yall...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzanneg271
20,It's fine.,"Venice beach is interesting in a grungy dirty kind of way. The beach is the beach. Beaches are nice. I feel like Venice is stuck between the real toughness and attitude it used to have and the commercialism it has now. So, if you like guys playing bongo drums and slateboarders, a fun place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcalibanh
10,Homeless everywhere,"Homeless are lined up with carts and belongings on beach. What an Eye-opener. Furniture piled with tents, calling out and smokingPot out in open. Don't take your kids and find any other beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869reginag
40,Great Place to People Watch,"Was staying only a few blocks from Venice Beach. It's a beautiful beach with a nice walkway where people watching is the main thing to do. Plenty of places to eat while you walk, California's version of a Boardwalk. Beautiful beach, and of course the basketball court from the movie ""White Men Can't Jump"" Always great to stop by for a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomg344
50,Chilled out,We visited here just after sunset (missed it by an hour due to the horrendous LA traffic). Nevertheless we had a nice wander around and soaked up the chilled out /hippy vibe that was abundant! If we didn't have the kids with us we'd have had a couple of beers and joined in a little. Instead we went for a walk along the pier and watched the sea lions swimming after fish in the surf; and people watched some locals fishing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danksy_uk
30,Great large beach with a lot to see,"The beach itself is very large, clean and nice. We saw lifeguards on duty on a weekday and several police patrols, although we always felt safe. There were quite a few families on the beach. Along the walk, are a lot of ""Medical Marijuana"" dispensaries and T-shirt shops as well as some street performers and sellers. While it felt safe, it also felt like the kind of place to hold tight to your purse and remain alert. Also, bargain at the shops. One guy told us a sweatshirt was $35 and as we turned around and started walking out, the price dropped to $20 by time we got to the door. Muscle beach is there - which is just a weight lifting area near the beach plus a basketball court. Towards the far end is the pier with several restaurant choices. If you are in the area, Venice Beach is worth visiting. If you are not in the area, it is probably not worth the extra drive - given other more famous beach areas in the LA/Orange County area. If you decide to visit, you may want to park near the pier in the $6 parking area at the end of Washington Blvd in Marina Del Rey. You can walk along the beach or along the walkway to get to the Muscle Beach/Venice Beach area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
40,Great People Watching,"I spent a couple of hours on the Venice Beach boardwalk and enjoyed watching the tourists, body builders at muscle beach, street performers, and local artists. Parking was $9 at a lot right beside muscle beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brentoni9
50,Absolutely classic!,"I've been going here for decades. Back in the day it was a pretty trippy place (yes, pun intended) but now it is highly populated by tourists... particularly international types. But that's not a bad thing, it adds to the color... and there's LOTS of color. Ultimate people watching and strolling down the Boardwalk for about as far as you want to go. My preference is to take the time and stroll down to the Santa Monica Pier stopping for a few beers and lunch along the way... I used to walk back as well but now usually Uber it. Oh, there's a beach too. A LOT of beach. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backpackluxury
50,Iconic Beach and Pier,This is an iconic place to go at least once. Tons of activity in the day. So many people and places to eat/relax. Plus the beach/pier/views are amazing. Glad to have been here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulyo83
50,BEAUTIFUL!!!,I'd been to Venice beach years ago and it's a beautiful as I remembered. We rented and rode bikes the entire length of the beach. The views were amazing and the homes along the beach were really nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kibabadgirl
50,electryfiyng!,"hipster, hippi place - music everywhere. Beautiful beach and amazing sunset! Legendary place - must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maddpariss
50,Morning at the beach and surrounding area,"I love visiting Venice beach for the eclectic array of restaurants, shops, and even architecture.. I am a real old home buff, and love to see what people have done with their gardens and homes. I also love the juice bars, and the plentiful 'healthy' places to eat and things to do.I think the newest addition is the hulu bikes .... haven't noticed them before. We have that here in Montreal .. Bixie bikes. Greatest idea ever. Loved to be able to pick up a bike and drop it off at a different location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annamaria3242016
50,Must see beach with eclectic mix,"Stayed in a great hotel (Erwin) in the area and found it very interesting area with a mix of people - all sorts you could say! A bit scary at night, but during the day the beach and area were excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9664BJdavids

50,When I think California....,This is the perfect beach to visit in California. There's so many vendors to buy from and you'll meet all kinds of cool people with a story to tell. You can go for a bike ride or dip your toes in the ocean. Warning: The water was freezing! I had SO much fun at this beach and it wasn't over crowded at all. The boardwalk is awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mexilovee
40,"Very cool place - stay in Venice, not on beach","I had a great trip to Cali including riding a bike from Santa Monica to Venice. You should do that bike ride, by the way! I stayed in Venice right on the beach. There's nothing to do on the beach at night. (Noise ordinances I guess.) Although I had a great dinner at one of the few restaurants open on the beach. Check out my other reviews for that recommendation.I had a great visit seeing all things fun, crazy and very California. But if I were going to stay there again, I'd stay in Venice instead of on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingjaners
50,Fun weekend activity,"We always enjoy walking near the beach, especially on boardwalks. There are tons of touristy shops to peruse, snacks, and people watching. There are vendors with their own creations, street performers, and the mesmerizing skate park. Don't forget Muscle Beach! A favorite is the bookstore with cafe attached. You can make a trip to Venice Beach as long or short as you'd like, but it's always good exercise! Definitely worth the $20 or so it will cost to park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5918PUelizabethc
40,nice place,good beach! lots to walk around too! there is a long stretch of shops along the boardwalk - food and things to buy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benjamint2411

50,"Funky, fun and weird in a good way.","Venice beach is such an interesting blend of tourists and long time me locals. Artists, homeless, suffers, tourists, bodybuilders, families, skateboarders converge on this area south of Santa Monica. Along with Koreatown and little Tokyo, it's on of my favorite places in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rugbyrn60
50,Walk I the sunshine,"I love to people watch, so this was a perfect way to spend an afternoon! We walked up and down the boardwalk and passed some beautiful homes, muscle beach and a half pike arena. We watched as artisan's showed their wares and clowns entertained strollers. The entire walk is handicap accessible and parking is available right by the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx
30,Nice to have seen it!,Was here for couple of hours since if you are in LA you should have been to venice beach.I am gla I went here - lot of entertainment onthe street inciding artists and lot of people skateboarding. You find all kind of different people here.If you are looking for a beautigul and quiet beach I would recommend Hermosa. If you like some excitement and lot of different peoples and cultures you should take a look here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanderwallus
30,A good beach.,"This beach is good, however there are some odd people, and a lot of homeless people. I would recommend you go to Santa Monica beach just a couple miles up the road. You could even walk there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700jakeb
20,Didn't feel safe here.,"Obviously famous for various reasons we thought this would be a cool place to visit. I must admit that I didn't feel safe here as a traveller. Seemed like there was a lot of homeless and unfortunate people hanging around, and wannabe rappers trying to push their promo tracks onto you. If you stood and listened to one you would get a bunch of guys pounce on you to listen to theirs. Just didn't really enjoy the place at all im afraid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665benh
40,A Must!,"If visiting Santa Monica or nearby, take a trip here, it's well-worth it.You won't find a place like it anywhere else!The different characters you will find wandering around, the different street entertainers, the quirky little shops - you'll think you'll have stepped into a movie or a show from the 90's!The bodies on the men and women walking around are crazy-toned! They must spend their entire days working out on the beaches - again, you won't get this type of experience anywhere else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereToTry
40,Lively,Amazing day out. Took us a while to get there on the bus from where we were staying but was well worth it. Miles of sand and there was a good atmosphere when walking up and down the promenade. The skaters are incredible if you walk far along enough to see them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3893ODtoml
50,Lots to do... Enjoy!,"You cannot get enough of this beach.You can eat, drink, shop, swim, bike, skateboard, dance, watch others dance, suntan, listen to music, watch people going by, entertainment never ends.Lots of people enjoy showing off their talents here, so if you want to relax, you can have lots of fun.One wish: it needs more puplic washrooms. Not that it doesn't have. They just have long line ups. Be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happike

40,Venice Beach,"They say that the USA tilts slightly downhill towards the West and that all the Nuts roll that way. If you go to Venice Beach you will see that this is true. It is at the end of the Contenient and here they all are! Worth a stop for a couple hours to browse the kitchey shops and gaze at the characters.Be sure to check out the skate park just north and west of Windward avenue. Some sound dudes ripping it up there. The food is all just OK but our favorite is the Sidewalk Cafe. Try to get a table at the ""window"" so you can eat and peoplewatch at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144sidm
50,Lovely place to visit.,Loved Venice Beach. went on a tour of LA and ended up at Venice Beach - lots of lovely shops and bars and places to eat. Beach was marvellous. very clean. had a lovely walk along the Beach and promenade back to LA. quite a walk but well worth it. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yvonne68
50,Cali visit,"Venice Beach is absolutely beautiful. We walked around it, rented bikes and rode around the beach and ate at the hot wings restaurant right in front of the beach. It's a must to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetcynt65
40,"Paddle Tennis and Boogie boarding,Venice Beach",Every Friday a group of my friends meet on the Venice Beach courts to play two or more hours of Paddle Tennis. It's free to the public and located at the end of Venice Boulevard directly on the beach. This year we went boogie boarding there in September and October The water was delightfully warm because of El Nino.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shipofsails
50,The best people watching you'll ever do,"I love Venice Beach. Yes, it's dirty. Yes, there are some questionable characters that hang out there, but it's as unique as it gets and I never have a bad time when I visit. If you've never been to Venice Beach, get ready for extremely quirky street performers, interesting street art murals, fun and quirky (though often touristy) shopping, and funky attractions like muscle beach and the freak show. It's a fun walk up and down the boardwalk, and of course the beach is there as well so that's always nice. Venice Beach is as funky as it gets so don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherh0p
40,Great people watching day,"I was contemplating whether to come here or not after reading some reviews on this place however I'm glad we went. Yes, you will find people selling all sorts of things, homeless people begging for money, guys giving out 'free CDs', drunk and high 'bums' but you will also have a great time watching people from all walks of life, street performers, skaters, muscle beach workouts, the venice canals are nearby and I feel it's something you should see if in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodsieJ
30,Does not warrant the hype,"I decided to visit Venice Beach based on many things that I've heard/read in the past. I have visited many different beaches in Hawaii, Florida and abroad so had a pretty good baseline of comparison.I visited on a Monday morning, which made parking easy to find although I can imagine this would be quite different on a weekend. The boardwalk seemed run down and substandard compared to other beaches I've visited. It was filled with lots of homeless people, beggars, weirdos, etc. and this would certainly not be a family friendly atmosphere in my opinion.A few miles down the road at Santa Monica it was a completely different story. Maybe it was just the wrong time to visit, but I've been to many more places with much more to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375christopherk
50,Fun!,My hubby and I went to Venice beach in the month of January and it was very beautiful the weather is perfect not too hot and not too cold! I love how different every person is there everyone has there own personality so walking around the boardwalk is pretty fun you can see all the shops and there is also muscle beach which is pretty cool to check out . Don't hesitate to visit Venice beach you will have a blast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cvh3
30,not a place for familes,"I've always wanted to see Venice Beach, for the skateboarders, muscle man court area, basketball events, however when I went to check out the place it seemed like I was walking Hollywood BLVD, walk of fame, so many homeless people in the area, but other people still manage to enjoy the other parts of the area, such as the stake park, basketball courts, the BEACH view of course. trend setting of young adults and hippie go'ers. defiantly a place to people watch, with a lot of shops to chose from",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeandraM_13
40,Fun and interesting,"You never know what you're going to see here. Sometimes it's depressing, other times just fun. This time it was fun, lots of good street entertainment, shopping and the skate boarding area for the kids to practice was really fun to watch. Some very young kids (4&5) really great skate boarders.Pay to park in the lot right by the shops. It was $8 and worth it to not have to drive around and try to find a spot on the street.I live in this country and don't find the homeless people ""normal."" Some are really in bad shape and it's very sad to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyandretired318
40,Trendy Vibe,"Loved Venice Beach and Venice in general. It has a real grubby, quirky vibe with a lot of little artsy shops and plenty of places to eat and drop in for a coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlannaP938
40,Awesome sunset views,"We got here right before sunset. The boardwalk is definitely an interesting place to see and experience. Great place to people watch for sure. The sunset on the beach was spectacular, and am glad that we got there just in time. Parking is expensive, especially since we were there such a short time. It should be based on timing like when we went to Huntington Beach. There may be spots where it is, but one place charged $15 and the one we went with charged $8, which was still high considering stuff was starting to shut down when we parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lmbtrfly
40,Lots of Things to look at,"Venice Beach was an experience of its own. They are many people who are doing the most for attention, and then want to make you feel like you have to pay for looking. It was very interesting. The skate park was filled with kids/adults doing tricks. There are 420 doctors on every corner for Florida residents in need of their weed card. There were many shops to buy trinkets from. I enjoyed it overall and would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kemoyd
40,Foreigners. Haha,"You out of the country people don't have homeless people? You don't have to be afraid of them, they are just normal people. I admit some homeless people out at venice look ""shady"" but don't generalize or prejudge..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6296QDchrisb
50,Multple Experiences in One Place,"I live locally and we go often. Be prepared to pay to park, the busier the day, the higher the rate. Most are lots with flat fee, very few metered spots.(1) The '0cean Walk' is a paved 'boardwalk.' It is very crowded, but that is the excitement of it and the busier the day, weekends and tourist season, will have more zany street acts and people to watch. (2) Ocean Walk area includes food, some shops ranging from trinkets to nice, and sidewalk vendors- only a few are artistic. (3) A short walk from Ocean Walk is the skateboard area. It is amazing to watch the local talent zoom around the rink and up the walls. There is always a well deserved crowd watching. (4) Still in the Ocean Walk area, there is a rink that is primarily used by Rollerblade dancers. The talent and entertainment varies a lot visit to visit. Sometimes people there will be using hoops or something else interesting. (5) Oh, did I mention this whole area has a paved bike path you can go along the coast for miles on. And, of course bike and segway rentals. (6) There is a drum circle that meets. They are there Sundays, not sure which other days. (7) Stop and sit on the bleachers to watch some basketball!! (8) Watch pumping iron at the outdoor muscle Beach? (9) Check it out - a restaurant might have some live entertainment. (10) And . . did I say there is a great, long, and wide Beach?? It is much more crowded the nearer you are to Ocean Walk. If you want it quiet and room to spread, keep on walking (left when looking to the Ocean), the farther, the quieter. You can watch the surfers and swim yourself. Lifeguards are on duty. (11) Be sure to check out the Venice Canals while you are there.The reason Venice Beach is a FIVE? You can go and only have a great day at a quiet Beach. You can see the 'amusements' of the Ocean Walk. You can take a bike path ride for miles, even to other beaches. You can take long walk with your toes in the water. Depending on your style, any one of these could be a 4 or 5, since we can do them all and more in one place . . . it's a 5. Venice Beach is so much more than the crazy Ocean Walk, firstly, it is a great Beach, which is why the rest all followed!! Try it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneDJ2
30,"Good, but pick your time...","Went here to kill some time and watch the sunset with our son so we were there in the evening and in winter. Beautiful sand and sunset and we were glad we did it because we got some lovely pictures, but there are lot of homeless people around and a lot of weed being smoked! It was an interesting experience for our 11 year old, to say the least. I would hold on tight to your bag and just keep wary of those around you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jugs59
20,Overrated beach,"Not sure what the attraction is for this beach as muscle beach has more to offer, and Santa Monica Pier has more fun as the beach sand and waves are the same. Venice beach have stands with art running along the beach, but despite it being independent artists it just looked like junk or art you can buy most places these days anyway. It reminded me of Camden, London, but this place just have so much more to offer in both arts and cafes. Be mindful as well that the cafes along the beach do not have restrooms (public toilets) but these are located on the beach. I guess in the summer it springs to life with beach goers but I have to say people did swim and surf when I went there during autumn/ winter 2015. Having said my piece, I want to highlight that the three beaches do have a beautiful sandy beach and nice water, although for me it was too cold to join in the beach fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitao455

One of the spots to visit is Windward Ave @ Pacific..used in many movies, TV shows and commercials. The hard part is PARKING.

40,"FOURTH OF JULY, THE PLACE TO BE","My family visited this beach over the holiday week-end. There were hoards of people--singles couples and familes enjoying the water, vendors, and evening fireworks. The traffic was a bit much to tolerate, but if you were fortunate enough to get in early parking was available. The fireworks display was worth the wait. The grandkids particularily enjoyed it. Word of warning: lots of adult activities abound alcohol etc.Hold the young ones close and pay attention to the area of the beach you choose after sunset. Otherwise it was a wonderful extended week-end family vacation. The area outside the beach was pleasant to stroll, clean, and felt safe for a late evening stroll to watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/exhaustedtraveler79

10,Junky and Unkempt,Muscle Beach needs a make-over. It was nasty looking with many homeless and bums lurking around. The canal area is pretty but not worth the drive. Do yourself a favor and head for Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697pats
20,Oddball Place,I'm probably too old to appreciate the wackiness of Venice Beach so if your over 50 go someplace else with your time...the place looked gross with unsavory people. No interest. We drove there but didn't even get out of the car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJJA1969
50,Beautifully maintained,Although visiting on a day trip in January the weather was beautiful. The area is immaculate with interesting points throughout. Muscle Beach (outdoor weights gym) and the Skateboarding Area are worth seeing and definitely bring a camera. The usual beachfront shops line the area but there's little hard sell so browsing isn't an issue. When we visited parking wasn't an issue but I would imagine in summer that may be a challenge. Worth a morning or afternoon visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47
50,Cycled at winter sunset,"The sunsets here are huge, particularly when the sun is already low in the sky and this December day didn't disappoint. We hired bikes for the final hour of the day and took the meandering path along Venice Beach. There was something magical about the sea, sky and people that made it a very special hour. We stopped to view the amazing skateboarders but all agreed that the star was the beach itself. Biking it made it memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hairygreek
40,"Lots of Swag & a Hip on Venice Beach Boardwalk, LA","Follow the palm trees to the corner of Winward and Pacific and reach the heart of Venice Beach – affectionately called “Dogtown” in sunny LA. If you like high octave action all around, a vist to this beach is a must – skatepark with skateboarders, bike-paths, hundreds of street vendors and performers; break-dancers to jugglers, from drummers, mimes to musicians, fortune-tellers to tattoos and Muscle Beach with body-builders, [made famous by California Govenor Arnold Schwarzenegger]; Have your name written on a grain of rice, purchase souvenirs / cheap t-shirts with all sorts of messages. Check out the graffiti along with the wide selection of restaurants / bars. The performers work very hard, so do leave a tip. Carry plenty of $1. Bills. Fun just people-watching or just hanging out. If you’re lucky, you may spot dolphins frolicking in the water!! Though there’s so much of buzz and vibrancy during the day, the streets are empty at nights. Also has its dark side - homeless drinking from brown paper bags selling weed / crack & coke, pick-pockets – avoid venturing into the alleys and side streets that are not very well late at nights",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
50,A melting pot of interestingness!,"Venice Beach is where folks from all walks of life congregate. You have skaters tearing up the skate park, guys playing basketball at the 'White Men Can't Jump' courts, Muscle Beach bodybuilders showing themselves off, amongst a backdrop of music, shops and of course, Venice Beach itself!It is very easy to wander along, observe and take it all in. It's a fun place to wander, particularly on a Sunday when it is at its busiest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdmiller83
50,Amazing Diversified Experience,"Stopped here as part of the ""A Day in LA Tours"". So much to see. An amazing skateboard park is close to the water and you can watch the skateboarders ""do their thing"". The waves were big and there were many surfers. On Muscle Beach, there is a workout/outdoor gym with spectator stands around it. Most of the body builders come in the afternoon and put on a show. The equipment is rather old and rusty but evidently this is where Arnold Schwarzenegger first started his career. It was cool in Jan. (62) so no one sunning on the beach. Many small shops to visit. You can easily spend the day here. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryA511

40,"welcome to America, Venice at night","Venice beach at night is a real eye opener. most of the shops were shut but people everywhere, homeless people that is. America likes to give the rest of the world the impression that it is a land of opportunity, but a walk along Venice Beach at night tells the true story. Homelessness is a massive problem and poverty is rife. I felt completely safe walking at night and I was comfortable with my kids there as well. I work with the homeless back home so feeling comfortable was not a problem. But if you are the type to be scared of those with mental health issues or substance abuse problems etc... don't go. or if you just want to gawk at those less fortunate don't go.

The people that get here are from all walks of life which makes it so unique! This is a blessing to LA which can sometimes seem overrated! I would spend days on end here if I could fit it into my travels. From Muscle Beach made famous by Arnie, you can watch the boys and girls in the outdoor beachside gym. The buskers who put on amazing shows! The stalls where you can buy some great gifts and keepsakes. Clothes stalls are great for tourists wanting some gifts of Venice t-shirts. The restaurants to one side of the boardwalk to the characters on the beachside... Did I mention the beach? WOW so much sand!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953carleyb

30,not for locals,"I live in Southern CA. I never go to Venice Beach. This is a beach reserved for tourists; no one I know who lives here goes to Venice Beach. If you are not from Los Angeles and want to see something busy with color , in addition to out of character people roller-blading, perhaps you would like to visit Venice beach. (I can say the same for Santa Monica ""Beach""--touristy).However, if you are more into nature and are looking for a beach that is pleasant to look at and will ""awe inspire "" you and make you think of California, don't waste your time driving out to this place.I will say that one pro is if you want to look for gifts at unique shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435kellya

20,NotNot,"I was there early morning, all the shops hadn't opened. I thought it was dirty and smelly. The shops that where opened along the boardwalk didn't look inviting. Only spent a short time there and left. I thought it was a waste of time. I did like the art work on the side of some of the buildings.

10,Unpleasant and Nerve Racking,"Personally, I did not enjoy much of my visit to Venice Beach. I found it dirty, unpleasant and at times fear inducing. Reading other reviews there seems to be a split between those who thought it was terrible and those who thought the place was amazing. I think there are patches of nice spots throughout the area but on the whole I don't plan on returning here. It definitely did not live up to the hype and the whole place put me on edge. I was travelling with my family and the drugs, homeless people and overall feel of the place was not at all what I expected.

50,Fun to do nothing,"We stayed in Venice beach for 4 nights in September 2015 and we would honestly go back in a heartbeat. The atmosphere is mostly friendly. Everyone wants to say hi which is lovely. There is a terrible homeless situation in the whole of California from what we saw on our trip however, I did not feel unsafe at all. We had our wits about us of an evening but found the previous reviews slightly exaggerated but maybe we were lucky.The beach itself is beautiful and well protected of course by the lifeguards.

The boardwalk however is full of a lot crazy people and I have to say I didn't always feel safe. Be cautious on the boardwalk. Santa Monica is a lot nicer so walk down to there.

SHOPPING lots of t-shirt shops selling pretty much the same thing. Lots of ""drs"" prescribing medicinal marijuana and lots of beggars needing smokes or spare change.We found a great place to eat and had the best nachos at the cafe (can't remember what its called but its like a pub on the beach) got to watch my ManCity boys win on the tv screens and enjoyed a great smoothy as well.Walk far enough supposedly you can walk to Santa Monica but I was still a bit Vegas lagged so we headed home after 3 hours.

You can sit on the beach, play in the water south of the pier for less craziness, shower off at the outdoor showers, then slip on flipflops and cruise over to one of the local restaurants. My fav is C & O Trattoria, because their Italian dishes rock, the garlic bread knots are all you can eat, and you get a small glass of house chianti (on the honor system to mark down your refills), which meets my needs for wine with dinner.I love this beach, it's always clean, and no one harasses anyone south of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahsha57

It was tacky ,seedy and most of all did not feel safe there appeared to be lots of people who appeared to be high on what ever. It was not a place I would want to visit again. We have been all around the world including China, Hong Kong, Bangkok South America . But this is not a good place to visit or promote.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentf342
50,Venice Beach Bike Ride,"Over the Labor Day weekend my family rented electric bikes and ""toured"" the Venice Beach and Santa Monica area. This was so much fun. The whole area is relatively flat so riding the bikes was easy, but knowing that you could use the electric option was great. The boardwalk wasn't too crowded so we were able to ride along and stop to see all of the craftspeople selling their wares. The beach was beautiful and the graffiti was amazing. When we went off the boardwalk into the adjacent community we got to see a slice of real life in the area. The architecture was wonderful and the communities were clean and friendly. We were more than entertained for over 3 hours. If you can ride a bike, enjoy the outdoors and are a people watcher - I recommend taking the time to do this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisehM5346QA
40,good to get this experience,Interesting place and a must to visit but to many homeless people. Use the parking place inside beside the beach that is much more cheaper.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonC8664ZK
50,Super fun!,"This is a full day activity, just browsing thru all the crazy stalls, just sitting sipping on some juice, watching all kinds of fun happening around... this is people gazing at its best :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chubbyswami
50,COOL PLACE TO SEE,This is a must see. You see anything and everything. A great place to people watch. Very diverse people. Tourists mixed in with locals. Fun to watch the people skateboard and how some people make their daily living. Pretty cool / fun place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ankemom
40,Great Place for a Bike Ride,Venice has a lot going on and a great way to see it is by bike. The bike path will take you from Marina Del Rey through Venice and all the way to Santa Monica. You can stop anywhere along the beach and hang out or get a bite to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anthony_Requia
30,A seedy commercial strip that is bound to disappoint you unless you are a teenager,"Wow, Venice Beach is really seedy. What do I mean by seedy, I mean the quality of life that goes on at Venice Beach isn't for your average tourist. If you are looking for the old Times Square, the one with drug dealers, hookers and thieves, well you can find it in V.B. On the positive side, there are a lot of police and many free attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RowerXX
50,Worth a Look,"We went here late afternoon with 3 young children. The atmosphere was cool, ppl everywhere! Riding bikes, scooters etc. street entertainment and market type stalls. Wouldn't stay after dark with kids though. Worth a visit and look!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juddy1982
20,Disappointing,"Venice Beach was extremely disappointing. The boardwalk area resembles a faded carnival and it is very run down. If you do the Strand by bike, then it is worth biking through, but I would not make the beach a destination in and of itself. Abbot Kinney Boulevard is a much better experience for me in Venice Beach – lots of funky shops and a great mixture of people from all over. We enjoyed a 40 min walk poking around the various establishments there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dupetersentravel
50,It may surprise you!,"Street performers, local artists selling their pieces, shops, restaurants, and of course...Muscle Beach where there is major working out going on.Yes, there are some people who still think it is 1969 with tie dyed clothing. Fun to watch. You can bike, skate, jog.Try C & O for great Italian food. When in season you can even go right to the water's edge to watch the grunion run...seriously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveler2020
50,Stroll along the ocean,"Even though it was winter, there were still the die hards out and about, hanging out at the beach. It was fun to watch all the athletes doing their thing. I enjoyed walking along the beach and seeing all the fancy ocean side accommodations. It would be nice to visit here in the summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metrukj

30,Not my cup of tea,"Venice beach, probably one of the most outspoken beach area at the west coast. Here you see street performers, street artists, colorful personalities, but also drug attics, weird creatures,... It was a one-time visit for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family-van-den-Berg
50,Great beach,"Love Venice beach , went and had a walk around the Venice canal walkway, and the shops and watched the sun set. Great shops and love the fruit the atmosphere. Even though there is tramps nobody bothers you but if you do start looking at keepsakes along the front, they do try and make you buy. Plenty of bikes, surfers, muscle beech just a all round great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monkey2009Cheshire
50,Funky Beach culture,I loved the vibe at Venice Beach. Muscle beach with beautiful people rollerblading and beautiful sand beaches. I could definitely get hooked on this beach culture if I lived in LA. The kitschy shops along the concrete boardwalk were totally cool. Hippies chilling on the beach. Way fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethkrug
50,Far out,"Love Venice. Crowded and wild. Very artistic and open-minded. Lots or art stuff, hand made jewelries, gems, paintings. You can find all kinds of random stuff there as well as people. Make sure u check the weather. Cause if u are going from Hollywood and the weather is nice where u are its not sure it is as hot by the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radhakrsns
50,Never a dull day at Veince Beach,"I walk the entire length of the Venice Board Walk (Ocean Front Walk) three days a week all year long. There are many ""fixtures"" on the Walk, people who have been there for years and years. Also, there is always something new. As we say, ""never a dull day at the beach"". Food and attractions, colorful people and artists. Fun for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenGregg
50,People Watching Paradise,"Venice Beach is a place to see people from all over the world from all walks of life and all ages. For kids the beach is amazingly clean and the water is safe, yet fun. For adults, there are street vendors with all different kinds of things to buy. The food is your general non chain fast food with a few sit down restaurants. Everything is very reasonable. In the summer I go at least 3 times a month. There is a bike and skate board trail that keeps you away from pedestrians and you can go as fast as you like. To stay fit, the walk from Venice to Santa Monica and back is quite an adventure. Finally, you still have California Girls, Gold's Gym and the public basketball, hand ball ,and platform tennis courts. Great for locals and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forresth142
50,Make sure you visit this spot - rent a bike and cycle the broadwalk,"On a visit to LA, we were fortunate enough to be staying with a friend in this area. Loved it. The vibe is very cool, lots of good coffee spots.I definitely recommend renting a bike and cycling down the board walk.We visited at the end of December, so was very quiet. I'm told this place changes completely in mid-summer, so I can't comment on that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpatrickedwards

50,So Much History Here,"This is where the rock group the Doors got their start. It's still got that grittiness -- lots of bums and unseemly characters -- that it probably had in the '60's. Too many tacky tourist shops, but it's still a fun place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemh333
50,Beautiful historic Venice Beach,"Took a walking tour of Venice including the Boardwalk. It was a spectacular day, the architecture of the buildings is amazing, many movies have been filmed here. The boardwalk has an array of people from every walk of life. It is definitely a destination spot for any out of towner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romance2016
50,Fun with the kids!,"I have just recently spent a week at Venice with my family and had a great time. My kids are 2 & 5 and they loved it. Venice beach is more than just the boardwalk.We spent a good chunk of our time on the beach in the afternoons and spent the morning exploring.When we turned left from our accommodation we saw the Venice we all know- guys selling everything, many stores with the exact same touristy stuff you can find anywhere, however there are some gems in there. Don't rush or you'll miss out. When we turned right we found some awesome cafes, and a nice stroll with some great houses to look at.We hired a bike and trailer for the kids and took a ride to Santa Monica. Checked out the iconic Gold's Gym. Explored Abbott Kinny Bld. Once you hit Rose Ave/Blvd (I can't remember) along the board walk toward Santa Monica, follow it a few blocks back for some funk cafes. It's. All within walking distance of you don't mind a 20 min stroll. Take your stroller of you have small ones. Every now and then we had to fold it up when at a cafe, but most times it was easy to get in and out of places. I was nervous after some of the reviews on here, but I am glad I checked it out for my self. Yes- there are homeless people, a few people asking for donations for charity- but that's everywhere! I hope to go back and stay for longer than a week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMLGI
30,A spectacle. An oddity. An American circus culture.,"You go here to see *it* — that honkytonk carnival scene: buskers, free spirits, skateboarders in wetsuits carrying surfboards, teens doing (and talking about doing) drugs, kids shopping for custom airbrushed t-shirts, bumper stickers with crude jokes, knock off fashionable sunglasses, pizza by the slice, a mango on a stick, ""Hey mister, you need a $5 massage?"" Hey, that guy can get you free tickets to a Hollywood talk show. You know the deal.You'll get whiplash of you look everywhere to take it all in. Just walk to the skateboard park. On one side, the carnivalia — on the other, The Pacific Ocean. And there, in the concrete middle you can watch dozens of tweens, teens, young adults and epically banged-up old dudes skate, flip, kick, push and fall. They're all so damn happy.They don't mind the photographers. This is fun for them but it's practice. It's relaxation. It's community. It's time away from school and work and child care. We watch the few, compressed moments of physical exercise and pride on display for these people. These athletes. They bring many generations : sons, daughters, nieces and nephews, cousins and friends. But even if you aren't related, you're with a family of sorts here.We saw a lot of drugs there. For that reason, I'd keep small kids away. Otherwise we were safe watching from right on the ridge of the rink/park.Public restroom close nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelredcard
50,Seeing is believing,The is an old disco song that says 'the freaks come out at night'. Well on Venice beach they don't wait for the sun to go down they are out there in the broad daylight.

50,I love Venice Beach,"nice walk at Venice Beach, lots of good live music, painter, artist etc., this place still has character, but new apartment buildings are built and will be build, so in latest 10 years it might be gone, so hurry see, explore and enjoy Venice Beach, take your time to make a walk...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDHanke

40,Groovy Venice,"Venice is a unique place to visit.All types of people, and lots to do.Figtree café is a great little inexpensive place for breakfast right on the boardwalk.Venice is great for those who love the outdoors, people watching (almost to a whole new level:), walking, jogging, bike riding, beach-going.Bike rentals are under $15 for the whole day and a great way to see it all.... from Santa Monica to Marina Del Rey or however far your pedal-power goes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kartins
40,wild and crazy Venice,this is the place to go if you are a people watcher - there are so many different kinds of people here! from super beachy casual people to tourist families there is something for everyone. if it is a nice day ( usually) it is really fun to sit at any of the cafes and watch the world go by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonsZ257NT
50,"Clean beach, great entertainment","The beach is really clean, and stretches for miles. We walked quite a bit of it and it was interesting to see the houses, restaurants and shops along the way.They have a bike path that can be used for cycling or rollerblading and they rent out equipment by the hour for you to use.We actually went up the ""canals"" as well where they have gorgeous houses right on the water.There's a main area of the beach where most of the shops are located. We were there on a Saturday and they had street performers out as well. They have outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, etc. Even if you don't play it's fun to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raykz
40,"A Nice Trip, But We May Have Been Early","We visited Venice Beach the day after Christmas. Our hotel did not serve breakfast, so we were looking for something to eat in the morning. It took us a little while to find an eatery that was open, but things were starting to open as we walked. For a location in Los Angeles, there seemed to be a decent amount of parking for not that much of a hit to the pocket (we paid $10, but saw prices ranging from $9 to $15).As we continued to walk, more and more vendors were arriving with art and some entertainers were there as well. The worst part is the over-aggressive attempts to sell things. I am not a big fan of this, and it probably prevented me from actually buying some things, because I wanted to escape the aggression.The beach is a little more ""middle-class"" than some of the other tourist attracting beaches in Southern California. I do like this aspect. People seem to be having more fun than being tourists. There are options to pay for the day to participate in some athletic endeavors. There are trails for biking, rollerblading, etc. There seems to be a lot of space on the beach, as well. In addition to those things, the boardwalk has a number of stores and eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAB40AZ
10,Very disappointing,It appears to be a place facing some social issues. I wouldn't feel safe there after dark. As it is I really couldn't recommend it to anyone. Hopefully things can turn around for the folks there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philst1

40,Cool little place,"If you want to people watch, this is the place. Very relaxing off of the pier and very fun on the boardwalk. Dirty and smelly, but you see a lot of living here! Wouldn't take the family unless we rented bikes and did a tour that way. Too chilly to go down by the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1435EWangieh
20,not crazy about it!,"Venice Beach is a place of many homeless with their dogs!

30,Ok-ish place for a daytime walk,"Great place to see locals and tourists. The place is a bit hippie. There are ""green doctors"" selling weed, independent shops and cafes.

50,Love love love,"Venice Beach is one of my favorite places in SoCal. Great place for people watching, entertainment, snacks, shops, and walking, running, biking, Etc.

40,Perfect bike tour in May,"Well, we rent a bikes and drive through the beach. It is very nice and easy trip to ride a bike across the beach. We started in Santa Monica and went to the end of Venice beach. Just be careful of sand on the sides of the paved road, if you hit it by bike it can be dangerous (it slows down you speed and bike just stops).On the road and around you can see many performers, it was not best weather when we were there but anyway there is a lot of performers on the beach, musicians and artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slavohodul

50,Great for people watching and the view,"We brought our teenage kids here on our trip back after moving away over 17 years ago. They've never been to CA. They really enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere, people watching, smelling the marijuana in the air (that was new to them and they thought it was just crazy), view of the ocean, muscle beach, and food.

40,"Calm, broad and beautiful sand beach","Enveloped in cold & windy weather and a cloudy day, this beach still looked so nice and attractive. The pier is a must visit as you can have a superb view of the ocean, beach and shops. It is worth spending some time on the pier especially during sun rise and sunset. Broad walk is (nothing different from other beaches) lined with shops (for trinkets, souvenir etc) and open-air restaurants & cafe which sell affordable food.From the pier, you can either walk north toward Malibu, or south toward Venice. Nice family beach (sand, not pebble) and despite strong wind and cold weather, many enthusiasts made it to the waves. Parking was convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suchig06
40,A Must,"If you visit L.A. you have to come to Venice beach. The vibe is unlike anywhere else in the city. Relaxed, trendy and bohemian, Venice beach has restaurants, bars and loads of shopping. Plus it offers the best views of the beach. There's quite often live music from buskers on the main footpath as well as plenty of stalls set up by people selling all sorts of interesting things. We parked near the Venice Whaler and walked along the path on the beach at sunset to the Santa Monica Pier (takes an hour). It was safe, fun and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firey3

40,plenty to see,We were staying at a nearby hotel and had a spare day. Decided to visit Venice Beach.The beach itself is fair. What sets this place apart is all the interesting people who hang around here. It is possible to walk from Venice Beach to Santa Monica pier taking in all the interesting sights along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ondfre59

40,Full of life. Interesting. Many homeless,"Beautifull beach. Place to walk, to run, to use bikes, rollers etc. you can find many stores, mainly for tourists. But.. You will see homeless, drugs, people fighting and shouting, and you will find it hard to park on sunny days. Most of the public parking will charge you 20$. Even if it for 1 hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boazsharon
40,Touristy but not too much,"You'll see tons of different kind of people here. There are a lot of tourists but somehow this place is not too touristy and I'd say there's still a lot to see for the locals too. The little shops on the boardwalk are fun to visit and the street artists are extremely talented! The beach itself is beautiful and on Sundays around the sunset there's a drum circle that I'd suggest for you to visit. The atmosphere here is relaxed and fun. Visit before sunset because I noticed that once the sun had set, the atmosphere changed a bit and I didn't feel too comfortable anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summeri94
40,Sit on the beach,We spent a lovely day at the beach near the pier. Cool morning so coffees were the go. Went to Cow's End as our little favourite but there are a few others. Restaurants to the right (looking at the path from the beach) are a little quieter and has a few good bars too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greenbunnie
20,"Beautiful natural beuaty, but we were driven off by the riff raff","Venice beach was beautiful. Seemed clean. Ample public facilities. But at one end was a tent city and homeless people were residing in the public bathrooms (locking everyone else out). Nearer the boardwalk there were still homeless (California homeless yell at you and one waved his fists in my daughter's face...not the quiet panhandlers you can easily ignore), but there were large crowds of young men drifting along and the smell of weed hung in clouds for blocks. We didn't stick around long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmaFL
50,"Nothing changes here, the crazy is a constant!","We've been visiting Venice Beach from the other side is the world for years now, and it serious when I say that the crazy is a constant! So much so that some of the weird & wonderful characters that give Venice Beach it's vibe are the exact same people we've been seeing here on every visit for over 20 years. I always wonder if they're there every single day, because we only visit for a day or two every few years & yet we always encounter the same people. Of course, there are others too on each visit, who we've never seen before, which is part of what makes it so fun to visit.We rarely buy much other than food & drinks as most of the shops are pretty crappy souvenir shops, but with very high prices. The boardwalk, however, makes for a great & interesting walk with lots to see & even some street entertainment & the pier is a great place to walk and watch the ocean on a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
40,About as LA as it gets,"I have lived in LA and I have visited as a tourist and I still enjoy Venice. It is a palpable hub of the weird and unique. Just going for people watching alone is worth the trip. I would say if you are going there for the first time, you should hit up the Whaler for your first stop. It is visited by locals and tourists alike so it is a good way to start your Venice experience.After the whaler walk around and sample the food. C&O is a classic stop for Venice style Italian.Finally, rent a bike and ride the boardwalk and the city aimlessly.Or, just go with the flow",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samwZ1082YE
50,Quintessential LA Experience,"Going to Venice Beach is one of those experiences that is unique to Los Angeles. It is jam packed with tourists so the best time to have fun is during the weekdays, during the winter, when all of the tourists are gone and you get the feel of the neighborhood. There are a few cafes along the Boardwalk (at the beach) starting at Rose Avenue and going south. It is fun just to sit outside and watch the cast of characters stroll by. One of our favorite places to go is The Figtree Restaurant on the Boardwalk. It is just a comfortable place to sit and have breakfast or lunch. None of the restaurants on the Boardwalk have outstanding food, it is more of a place to hang out and enjoy yourself and the atmosphere. There are all sorts of vendors selling everything and it is fun just to browse -not much of quality to buy, it is just an experience. If you want, you can also walk north along the boardwalk towards Santa Monica. There are beautiful and expensive hotels along the way -one of our favorites is Casa Del Mar. They have a beautiful lounge where you can go for drinks and watch the sunset. If you are looking for restaurants to eat at, there is a whole assortment along Abbot Kinney which is a few blocks off the boardwalk. It is a fun street to walk down and there are a number of hip restaurants along the block. It is a great neighborhood with cool boutiques, hip restaurants, and interesting architecture. Be certain to walk down some of the streets just east of Abbot Kinney where people have redone their houses and have created these little gems. Enjoy -there is so much to see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravelersJD
40,eclectic beach,"This is not your grandfather's beach. Wild, eclectic, energetic and wonderful all rolled into one. I live walking distance to my favorite part of the beach, the venice peninsula. Here at dawn neighbors walk their dogs, jog on the beach and arrive for pre work surfing. Where else can beach have so many diverse elements? North of the Washington pier is more commercial but unique. My advice is try to explore some of the less commercial areas and find off hours and moods. I love the Washington pier at dawn especially weekdays. Winter is great with big waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran

Worth seeing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magz1
50,Expect the unexpected,"Venice Beach is one of my favourite places to visit. The diverse array of people, sounds and visual artistry makes the place one with an incredible vibe. There is always something G different happening and some of the buskers there are top rating. It is a quirky place to visit but somehow when you leave it you will take with you,some happy memories and incredible photos. Well worth the visit. Some tour buses may not stop at the beach area because of its diverse nature and what they regard as a seedy area but if you treat the place with respect you will not find it any different to other tourist spots. Connecting two buses from Hollywood is an option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rbcrystal
50,"stonerville, but still fun to stroll by","if you have no problem with the smell of weed, this beach is a fun filled beach with artists and surfers, shops and street performers. I did see some action as LA Police arrested an African American vendor because he smoked some 420 which was weird since i myself saw at least ten people smoking a joint and no one was arrested besides him, but maybe they already had a past with him it seemed that they all knew each other. in any case it is a fun beach and I would go there again when visiting. but I would not sleep there at night. it is completely different at night - not ideal to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2travelthevelt
50,Venice... California Style,"It's Venice Beach... it's eclectic, it's funny, it's entertaining, it's sad, it's footloose and fancy free, it's phoney, it's pathetic and it's real, but most of all it's something you must see for yourself. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TooAmigos
40,"For a local, great place to run, exercise. For tourist, lots to see","Venice Beach is nice, lots of eateries. I live local so it's always a good place to come run along side the beach. During the weekends, lots of street performers. Many vendors to fit your shopping needs if you're a tourists. Parking is not always the best, but you'll find some and walk to the beach. There's a parking lot and I think you pay $5 for like 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janet0728

40,It's a cool place,We took our 13-year-old twin boys here. We spent a few hours just walking around. There were a lot of vendors and artists. Also a lot of musicians. We were amazed at the amount of people willing to sell you medical marijuana prescriptions. LOLI am a huge doors fan so this is a verynostalgic place for me.Wish we had the money to rent the segues.

I always look forward to walking venice beach boardwalk and enjoy the sights. Its a nice way to spend an afternoon. You actually see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allen5903
10,Creepy and not something to do alone,"I was in Santa Monica on my own and decided to walk from the pier along the pathway to Venice Beach having heard about it for years. The walk itself was fine, it's about a 40 minute gentle stroll. I was alone and not worried about being alone......that is until I was in Venice beach. It felt like everyone was a little buzzed on something and I felt very self conscious like I was about to be mugged or attacked, albeit 1pm. I literally could not find my way out of this promonade quick enough. It might have been me and a little jet lagged but I'd not go alone - in fact I wouldn't even bother going there. Santa Monica pier - yes Venice Beach - no",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charmayne72

50,I can't get enough,"I absolutely love this place, there is so much to see, I mean you can literally sit and people watch for hours, the beach is clean, lots of places to eat. I feel like it's a culture down there, skating, skateboarding, dancing, singing, art, clothes, and the list goes on and on. Make sure you wear good walking shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81lashawnb
10,Yuck,"We went on a cold afternoon and it was disappointing and depressing. We did not see any of the famous bodybuilders but what we did see was ALOT of hustlers, drug dealers, shady looking groups of young guys and homeless people. The latter is quite unsurprising considering LA has around 65000 homeless people. It can be quite overwhelming- they aren't bothersome or dangerous but you feel like an absolute poo of a person walking past so many and not being able to give money to them all. Some tourists were asking to take pictures with them which I found to be really insensitive and exploitative.There are lots of tacky tourist shops down here and shops selling those gross hippie psychedelic clothes so if that's you're scene you will love it. I would recommend hiring a bike to travel down and back from the first rental shop beside the pier. You can get in and out faster. The beach was immaculate though because it was cold we couldn't use it which was unfortunate. A few buses service the area from Hollywood and they are very inexpensive though not always on time but it will take up to an hour to get down and back up and there are plenty of crazy folk on the bus who will try to engage you in their colourful world so just be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dibdabbidbad86
50,Should be on you West LA must-see list,There is nothing quite like the daily parade of people and attractions on the promenade that extends from the Santa Monica pier to the Venice pier. I suggest you rent a slow moving bike to take in the sights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeTheHighRoad
30,"Must see once, not twice.","It's a crowdy and unusual seaside, Definitely it is a must see for first time visitors in LA.A batch of street artists perform daily and variety of colours and sounds is guaranteed.Personally I don't feel that safe by walking in the crowd and I would not go to Venice by night even for the cool nightlife events and clubs. That's why I choose alternative beaches such as Santa Monica or Malibu.The best way to reach Venice Beach is walking from Santa Monica Pier , it takes about 30 minutes and it is extremely relaxing such as not that hot even in Summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahSergio

There are a lot of shops all selling the same thing t shirts and souvenirs It's amazing they make any money . There were a lot of homeless and people begging . I would not rush back but saying that it's probably better on a decent weather day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcL1021CR

Must see during the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mckillion23
50,Bring the right 'mind set' and you will love this place,"I love this place, but I've had conservative friends who came in a little 'stiff and afraid of the environment', set them at ease, this is a place to relax and hang out. Join the drumming circle, get some anxieties out, its funky, but as safe as any public space. Especially during 'off-season' Venice beach is a great place to people watch and interact, enjoy some shopping, and above all get into the vibe. It's less crowded, but not dull. More authentic Venice folks around (relative to tourist numbers), adding a bit of the 'old' hippy days flair (alas also the homeless, who have a real housing shortage in LA). Rent a bicycle, skate board, motorized device, and cruise the bike lane (my favorite), cover the entire stretch from Marina del Rey to Santa Monica easily, and enjoy the various 'scenes'. Stop and watch the graffiti wall being spray painted the skate board arena, the surfers, watch the boats head out from the Marina, hit the Santa Monica Pier (rides, food, old style games, etc), cruise past the dancers on skate boards and other devices across from the arena, muscle beach, gymnastics, volley ball, shopping, great cafe food, street art/performances, etc. How can this not be a top choice if you want to enjoy and understand LA. The diversity of languages, lifestyles, politics make this a world city, see it in 'unscripted action'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrugDoc

Get a bike map to navigate the areas with traffic, but after that it's mostly riding on bike paths along the beach. Venice is especially fun; one section sold home made items not from China and we saw 2 guitar players and another guy on an Austrailian type instrument and had hot pretzels.

20,Creepy,The beach itself is not that bad. The surrounding is. I was almost scared to walk by the streets and stores.

Most are harmless enough but some can be a little intimidating if you are with a young family or on your own.You have to go away from the beach if you are looking for something to eat. Not far though just one of the side roads.There are also several Green Doctor shops selling ""medicinal marijuana"".The promenade doesn't get busy until a little before lunchtime (Our visit early December.

50,Strange Experience!,"Venice Beach is a strange mix - stunning beach and lots of shops selling tacky souvenirs. It's full of hippies and there's a number of places offering 'health checks' and trying to sell you 'medical marijuana cards' which I'd avoid if I were you. There's a lot of info on the internet saying it's a scam.While we were there, they were filming for the new Cal Scruby Ft Chris Brown video so we watched that for a while. Apparently Venice Beach is the venue for several famous pop star videos.All in all, an interesting place and well worth going for the atmosphere, the fabulous sunsets and the overall quirkiness of the place.

30,An eye opener for sure!,"We are a family with 2 young children who travelled from New Zealand. We visited Venice Beach as part of a Hollywood Tour with a Tour Company. The tour guide told us to expect some bizarre people, but you have no idea! What he actually meant was there were heaps of homeless people everywhere! Not experiencing this to this scale in NZ, made it quite a scary visit. I held onto my handbag for dear life, and my children clung onto me! There are people smoking marijuana everywhere, and people pestering you for 'weed cards' as there are shops there you can legally buy it from. The homeless and their belongings were fascinating to look at. Interesting characters included the homeless drinking/smoking and mentally ill talking to themselves. Also, ex crims doing balancing/dancing poses - don't watch for too long, as they pressure you for money and don't take no for an answer. Lots of shops/stalls selling tourist stuff and homemade art type stuff (by the homeless). Would have enjoyed more if I didn't have young children or my handbag with me. Could have stayed a lot longer observing these fascinating people doing what they do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Demchyclan

50,A very special place,There is a huge cast of characters and things to see while visiting Venice beach. Food on the beach is pretty good but who wants to eat.

Took a little while to get there due to public transport issues but we made it with plenty of time.When we got there, the views was absolutely stunning. So much golden sand, clear blue skies and lovely blue sea. We walked up and down the boulevard, stunned by the entertainment going on, all the bike riders, the rollerbladers, the skateboarders - not a single person with frown on their face!We stopped off for lunch at one of the many restaurants and sat outside to take in the view!

30,Inauthentic and fun eye candy,To me Venice is west LA's version of Hollywood Blvd. Nothing about it is real. It's a show. So if you only have 20 things to do and see in LA then skip this. But if you do want to see your own version of a funny circus show then certainly visit. It's a good laugh. The surrounding Venice with the canals is much more interesting than the boardwalk. If you do visit the walkways around the canals then look up the history of why they are there. It's an interesting story and will make you appreciate it more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation

40,"a Beautiful Beach and the Boardwalk is fun, but be cautious",One of the most beautiful places in America. the problem lies in the fact that it has been overrun by the homeless and the pot smokers. you are guaranteed to be panhandled and asked if you want medical marijuana for your glaucoma. I didn't even know I had Glaucoma. The stores are fun and fully negotiable.

However, if you're more into nice, clean secluded beaches with sparkling turquoise waters, do NOT come here. If you don't like the smell of marijuana, and if you don't like the sight of graffiti and homeless people, and you don't like big crowds and weird, annoying people on the boardwalk, then definitely do NOT come here! I mean, it all really comes down to your own perspective... There are definitely some nice aspects to this place: basketball courts, lots of food, lots of shopping. But I highly doubt that I would want to come back to this place again. I love the clean & less crowded beaches in OC way too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xannemaex

Along the pathway is the board walk that has cafes/restaurants/bars.Nice selection. You can eat before or after you get a piercing and/or tattoo-which this area is known for.

There were a couple of screamers who seemed deranged. The beach and walkway were clean, the beach itself is lovely. We wanted a reasonably long walk and got that along with some oddball entertainment. On a warmer day the beach looks like it would be great to hang out. As for the rest, well, once you've seen it ... it looked to me way different, more commercial and touristy, than what I remember from the '80s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimhU8610DH
40,Unique Beach Front Homes Meet Honkey Tonk Strollin,"Venice Beach is many things to the many people and.........characters that stroll or occupy the ""Boardwalk"" (made of concrete not wood). There are interesting residential architectural sights, beachside artists & musicians, Honky Tonk souvenir shops hawking all kinds of tchotchkes. Tattoo parlors, typical Beachside restaurants, Muscle Beach Gym, and the roller skaters. And yes, but there is a beautiful, sandy beach, the blue Pacific Ocean and nicely spaced public ""comfort stations"" for convenience. Just one block east, find lots of unique shopping venues and very affordable dining options. It's a great way to enjoy California's coastline and get a sense of a uniquely west coast lifestyle. Let your hair down, leave your inhibitions in the car and just enjoy the low key vibes while listening to waves rolling in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgkmarkr
30,"It's a must see, but it's more dirty than I remember",The board walk is nice to look at and see. If the weather is good it's a really nice walk. If your up for a long walk you can even walk to Santa Monica pier. the boardwalk can be frustrating with all the people hassling you for donations or to buy their rap CDs before they make it big time. It is a big hang out spot for homeless people and people on drugs so be prepared to be bothered and see some weird things. I wouldn't say it's not child friendly at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6413NGjackb
40,Venice Cool,"Caught the bus from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach.This beach is very cool compared to Santa Monica Pier which was a bit lame. Outdoor basketball league with DJs competed with Gold's outdoor Gym.Plenty of unique shops. Bought a great pair of shades with frames made from pine. Lots of souvenirs but not what you would find in normal tourist places. Beach is like most LA beaches, white sand and sea.Area is not as up-market as Santa Monica. Very backpacker and student friendly. This is not a criticism but some are not as comfortable with this as they might be in SM which is more touristy and cafe set.I loved the vibe of this beach but it is not for everyone.

40,A Very Interesting Place,"Good Day all Happy Travelers!!!Welcome to Venice Beach So. Cali. USA. There is a lot of ground to cover not only on the Board Walk at Venice but also surrounding areas of Santa Monica, Marina Del Rey, West Los Angeles and the very famous Beverly Hills. Do you research ahead of time to plan you trip accordingly.One thing you will need to know and remember is TRAFFIC and LIMITED Parking in most of these locations. Venice Beach at the end of Washington there is a Public Parking about $20.00 per day. Well worth it if you get there early and or it's not busy.From there you can either rent a bike(s) or walk North on the Board Walk. You could also go South, however, the Boardwalk ends and it turns into residental with no public restrooms, resturants etc. Also at the end off Washington are a lot of Boutique Restaurants, Bistros, Bars and connivance stores. Safety is always a concern be vigilant look at the surroundings and if something doesn't look or feel right simply don't proceed or confront. On Busy days there are a LOT of people here from locals, tourists, freaks and sometimes people that want to cause problems. Be assured the Los Angeles Police Depart has a strong presence on high volume days and most likely you visit will be fine.When it's busy you might not want to take older people and or small children that you can't hold on to. A lot of pedestrians, skateboarders, people riding bikes and people just walking around with no purpose in life.If you can plan your trip mid week even better less crowds. Winter, Spring and Summer are always cool with some exceptional days in there. Most of Summer months are foggy, cool and gray. When the fog is not too thick you will get some sunshine by mid day. My favorite time of year is after summer season and crowds have gone in Fall late September through early November. At this time the winds change direction it is warm, clear and water temp will be at it's highest of all year.Walking or Riding a bike on the Board Walk to Venice, Santa Monica Pier and beyond is very challenging when it busy. Venice Beach has it's own unique identity with many tourist stores, places to eat, street vendors, skate park, Muscle Beach and of course an amazing natural white sand beach that is at least a couple hundred yards deep with easy access to the water with sandy bottom and no rocks.Once you get past Venice Beach you are on the way to Santa Monica Pier which also has a lot of activity, carnival games, restaurants and of course the pier it self which you can walk out to the end.Once you past the pier still heading north you will come across some residential homes, more Board Walk and Beach's. At this point you will be paralleling famous Pacific Coast Highway. This is actually my favorite area with WIDE sandy beachs, parking, snack bars on the beach and more of a calmer area then your starting point.You will not find any tourist stores, street peddlers etc. in this area.In about 2 miles the Boardwalk will end and really can't easily go to much further.In this area there is also parking and bike rentals you could start you journey to Venice and return back to this location. Traffic on PCH can be REALLY BAD depending on whatever. Also Pedestrian and Car traffic at the end of Washington is also very crazy at peak times. Be careful many bars and people walking around without a clue as to where they are....Pedestrains have the right of way...Bring your pataenice because late afternoons, weekends there are a lot of ""pedestrians""..You could easliy spend a day doing what I just described and possiably a second day if you like the beach and want to jump into the Pacific.There are Public Restrooms and showers located adjacent to the Board Walk some nice, some not so nice.Have a Good Trip and be Safe:)John b",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92johnb

40,Day at the beach,On the weekends check out the yoga class at 10:30 for 15.00. Doing downward dog and looking at the ocean in the horizon upside down is really unparallelled to any other yoga and something you must try if you enjoy yoga. The beach was quiet and it was a nice way to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maceystars
40,Surf and a show.,"If you are traveling to LA this is one of the places that capures the Spirit of LA. from the sun and surf, to Muscle Beach, to the street performers, to the Medical Mariuana Cards (i dont think they sell the stuff but I didn't go in.) A walk on the boardwalk offers the repetitive Tshirt and souvinere stores but the real treat is the people, from the beautiful people to the freaks and homless. stop for at least a snack at Poke-Poke.

Venice has it all!When I have visitors, i park in Santa Monica or near Rose Cafe, have great breakfast/brunch there, and walk down. If you walk from S/M, it's a lovely mile or so walk along the cycle path - but watch for crazy roller-bladers/cyclists - you'll save money on parking and not get caught in all the crazy Venice traffic..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806

50,"Do the boardwalk, Abbott Kinney and the canals","While I wouldn't really go to the beach here (there are far nicer local beaches), Venice has a vibe that shouldn't be missed if you are visiting. Taking a walk along the boardwalk is a unique experience. It helps to appreciate it for what it is - a collection of anything goes. The people watching can't be beaten -- from street performers to the unintentional performers just strolling along. There are several people selling things from booths as well, and I've gotten some nice jewelry pieces down here. As long as you don't expect a clean, posh area and are willing to experience something (very very) different, this is a don't miss.While in the area, you can also drop over to Abbott Kinney where you'll find more upscale shopping and a variety of great dining choices. If you're in the area, why not...?To complete your adventure, you might google the Venice CA canals and take a walk along the canals that many people don't know about. The canals are lined with beautiful homes and cute cottages. It's close by and a very different feel/vibe/experience. If you are visiting the area, I suggest you build this in to your plan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiSavitz

40,Eye Candy,"A fun place to people-watch, eat, swim, play, whatever you like to do. The promenade is incredibly busy so I kept a tight grip on my son. There were street performers there that blew me away and then broke my heart when they DEMANDED ""donations"", going to far as to shame a couple that gave ""only $1 each"", even calling them ""greedy"" and ""cheap"". This left a sour taste in my mouth, but then we went for a walk down the promende, checking out the shops and kiosks, and admired the VERY wide beach, with the shore glittering in the distance, this beach is huge.

20,"Run down, terrible traffic, stinks of dope",Really not very nice. Doesn't live up to the hype. Maybe it's fun if you're a stoned 20-something who likes to hang out on the beach. Everyone else should give it a miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PF2UK
30,Eh',"I have to say I've certainly been to better beaches. It is kinda cool for people watchingThough. If your there for relaxation and sun, probably look else where. I actually thought it had a very fishy smell. I guess I'm used to the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Lots of shops, like your typical t shirt shop and tourist traps. We didn't stay long but at least we got to say we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CruisinNurse
50,"Used to live just south of Venice Beach on the Marina Penninsula, always enjoyed ambiance of the boardwalk.",A very fun place and always full of colorful folks. One of the more zany places to visit in Southern Californa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1jjarecki
50,"You'll need to pause, to take everything in...","Its hustle and bustle galore.... so much going on in one place...Muscle men, acrobats, skateboarding, rollerskating, art, shops, freaks and much more....I spent a good few hour just watching people, if you want to eat... expect to wait though, its very bust indeed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfage
40,Lovely beach!,Very much enjoyed strolling along the beach. It is kept clean and you can walk on the sand without getting cut or grossed out. There are some wonderful places to grab a bite to eat before/after your time on the beach. Great spot. It's cooler so we didn't go in the water but there is a surf side and a swim side. Enjoyed it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellel623
30,Little different from PCB,The beach area seemed a little run down. Lots of people running up to you trying to get you to give money to them stating its for the home less. Plus lots of merchandise vendors. Liked seeing muscle beach and the sand was real clean and water blue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811stacys
50,Bike the beach at Sunset!,"Venice beach has the coolest vibe--especially if you get the chance to bike at sunset on a Saturday night. The vendors, the skateboarders, the music, the entertainers are all worth it to watch as you glide down the coast and start to see Santa Monica pier light up. Definitely an experience I'll never forget!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/608priscillag

30,Any one not on drugs here????,"Venice beach is a great place to people watch, you'll encounter all sorts here. I've been coming here for years and always found it an entertaining place to be, the beach itself however isn't anything special. Maybe go for a walk, run or jump on a bike here and head north to Santa Monica and Pacific palisades. Worth a visit if you're a tourist but can see how it isn't for everybody.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tompG2193MI

50,Special Place,All visitors to LA must take the time to venture down to the Venice Boardwalk.The sites are priceless as you will see characters that will blow your mind.Disappointingly the area is becoming as a place of last resort for the homeless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goblin55
40,Interesting,"Definitely an eccentric population, good food in the area but not recommended for everyone - within one hour of being there saw cops break up a domestic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runawayblond
30,Interesting local haunt.,"If you want to be entertained on the cheap, then Venice Beach is your place. There are craft booths, street musician, tarot card readers, medical marijuana clinics, homeless/street people, surfers, beach goers, bicyclers, power walkers, tourists, locals, skate borders, various clothing shops and just about anything/anyone else you can think of. Clearly, a great place to people watch.You can walk on the boardwalk or on the beach. You can fish off the pier or simply play in the sand. Practice yoga or just stare at the ocean. Get there early if you want to claim your piece of the beach. It does get very crowded on weekends.Of course there are places to eat, some budget friendly, some not. Bicycles can be rented by the hour or the day. Parking on the nearby streets is tight. However, parking lots are available at various price points. Check online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbug880
40,"Beach is nice, hope you dont have to use restroom","Venice beach is an interesting place. The beach was good. There is parking on the beach, but get there early. They rent chairs, umbrellas and bikes on the beach which is great. The bathrooms are DISGUSTING! Lots of eccentric people on the boardwalk who are all basically high on medical marijuana. Apparently a visit to the ""Green doctors"", a ""medical exam"" & $40 gets you a medical marijuana card. Did not realize so many people had so many medical issuea that require medical marijuana. Its like going to the candy store on Venice beach. Interesting place to see and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirleyC184
20,Pretty grim,"We found Venice Beach itself to be really beautiful & we enjoyed the cycling as well as the skateboarders & surfers. The boardwalk however is full of cheap tack & guys in green peddling medical weed - the place stinks of it. Some of the artists and weirdos are entertaining, others not so much. Worth seeing once perhaps... just about... but not somewhere I'd rush back to. For LA beaches Santa Monica or Malibu are a much better call.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/originaldreamer

40,Unlike anywhere I have ever been,Venice Beach is home to Muscle Beach and is a fascinating p!ace.It has a lot of shops and stalls selling souvenirs at a good price.There was also a wide range of strange people about which gave it a great atmosphere.The famous Muscle Beach was an outside gym on the edge of the beach where lots of muscley men worked out and posed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natp44

50,Amazing Venice Beach,"You see everything on Venice Beach, from colourful local characters, live bands, an athletic tumbling troupe, a 'freak' show, fantastic painted murals, along with shops, stalls, places to buy snacks and the famous Muscle Beach where we spotted an ex-Lakers, now film actor (Rick Fox) being filmed and chatting to people who recognised him.It was a brilliant place for a stroll on a warm day, with so many things to grab your attention. I even got a bargain when I bought a dress for $9!!!Very enjoyable experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/501paulah
30,I came expecting the 1960's or 1970's - but I got the 21st Century,"As a fan of the Doors era, this was a region that I craved seeing. Muscle Beach. The Boardwalk. The Beach. They are all there but the flower power era was all gone. If you close your eyes and dream a bit - it might be there. The freaks still exist. The area still has a long boardwalk. It is an area of counter-culture. Don't spend a long time there. The shopping is poor - every shop basically has the same items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felikso

We ended up renting the bikes anyway to avoid too much walking but we didn't feel safe to leave a credit card and id with them. Their sign said that opening hours were till 7 pm but they said they'll close at 6.30. Felt like they just had decided that they want to go home earlier that day. Weather wasn't so good but the beach was alright. The boardwalk had nothing interesting to see, just some cheap t-shirts and sunglasses etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781petram

40,Worth seeing,"We stayed half way between Santa Monica and Venice Beach for 5 days and spent quite a bit of time walking along the boardwalk and experiencing the vibes of Venice Beach. We were fortunate that it was considered a quieter time to visit as I heard that in the busy times you can barely move on the boardwalk. There are lots of tourist shops selling t shirts etc and lots of places to eat. The people are what makes it interesting. You can sit at a bar and just watch the people passing, it's like a place that people come to where they can just be themselves and not care what anyone else thinks. It's good to see all the things at make it what it is, the gym, the half tennis courts, the basketball courts and all the people using the equipment and having a go, locals and tourists alike. There are the medical marijuana shops with people out the front drumming up business, the street performers and a lot of homeless people which is always a bit confronting. The beach is a great place to watch the sunset over the water especially for me as I live on the east coast of Australia so it was a real treat. Its a very flat area so it's easy walking, the hardest part is dodging others. Sit back, buy a beer and watch the show, all for free, it's worth experiencing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judychittawaybay
50,Seaside Butler Service,"If you're looking to relax on the beach in a resort style lounge chair under an umbrella, watching the ocean, being served lunch, this is the place to be! The Beach Belvedere attraction at Venice Beach, Ca. provides all the amenities needed to enjoy a day at the beach. You can rent an ice chest, music player, surf boards and wet suits, footballs, volleyballs and frisbees. They also provide towels and sunscreen for the guest, as well as a personal butler who will serve you food and beverages on command!A great perk to an already exciting tourist attraction such as Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachBelvedere
40,Where it's at!,Venice Beach is an amazing and thriving hub of excitement. It is the type of LA you see on TV. There is always something happening and the water is beautiful. Water is certainly cleaner than I expected. A great beach with an awesome vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanetreloarofficial
50,Fun and interesting,"Lots of shops to look in for clothes and souvenirs! The beach is really nice and watching the guys play basketball with the beach backdrop is fun. Of course Muscle Beach is also interesting, seeing men of all shapes, sizes and attire working out on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9leannes
50,Gorgeous beach,We picked up dinner and packed a blanket and arrived just before sunset. The view on the beach and the atmosphere that time of day/night was so fun!

50,"If I could give six stars, I would!","We stayed just off Abbot Kenny behind Feed Restaurant on the corner of Santa Clara and Electric Ave. It was a PERFECT location, walking distance to everything! Rented through VRBO, couldn't have been more satisfied. Venice Beach is a very interesting place but the people there are real, fun, and polite. It was like walking into an Instagram picture of hipsters. We traveled all over LA and by far, this was the best spot. We even bought skateboards and skated all over VB which made for a fun idea! Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dackp
50,Lots of fishing off the pier,"Fun watching the surfers. The beach looked clean. Lots of fisherman on the pier. Bike rentals to cruise the beach, there were lots of people doing that. Nice quite crowd, at least during the week",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chencha13
50,Fun and Freaks. Buy by the beach!,"I lived in LA for years and when I come back for a visit, this is the place I never tire of revisiting. It typifies everything LA - beautiful bodies, the narcissistic thirst for attention, the immigrant's chance to make a buck... ALL with the backdrop of a sunny beach and sandy boardwalk. You want to be a star??? Go see how much fun some people are having getting attention here. There's nothing too odd or bizarre to see here. It's all up for grabs. The best sampling of LA in all of its weird glory is to be experienced and bought HERE. The experience is free! Rent a bike, roller blade; show off your swimsuit or your Halloween costume... be free and have fun here. The best free freak show in the West.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reeshot
40,Great place,"Just like Baywatch but with real atmosphere, enjoy the cycling, walking, running, drinking, eating, surfing, etc...It's a great place, and it does take days to try and absorb even the smallest amount, it would surely take more than a lifetime to absorb most of its peculiarities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray_Finkle_9

40,Interesting!,"The last time I was here was more than ten years ago and it has significantly changed. The boardwalk is loaded with tee shirt shops and other touristy stores. There are unique people all around you tourists, locals and street performers. Its very eclectic. The boardwalk has the famed muscle beach gym which was fun to see as well as the basketball courts from the movie White Men Can't Jump. A new place of interest that I noticed was the medical marijuana store where if you have time the try to ""clear you"" or ""approve you"" for future purchases. As I mentioned very eclectic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarliTravels
30,"The good, the bad, the everything...sort of!","We go to Venice beach once a year, which is enough for me.if you want to people watch, it is fantastic. If you are looking for a relaxing day at the beach.....not. You will find the pot place along the boardwalk to get approved for medical pot. People wearing very little clothing and unusual outfits. Street performers and so much more. Cheep glasses for sale, t shirts and some great places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracyandjjtravels

50,"Lots of people around here, good to eat and hang out","This is the closest beach from where I live so I came here a lot, pay $12 for parking is not too bad since there are lots of places to eat and people are everywhere. I would prefer quieter beaches along the coast- sunset beach is one of my favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adac1121
40,Beautiful Location,"Rented bikes from Santa Monica and rode the bikes to Venice and took in some of the views and shops. Didn't spend much time here to get ride the bikes back to Santa Monica; however, was certainly beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofche001
30,Classic California Beach Experience,"When I was 12 I visited California for the first time. That whirlwind sightseeing trip included Venice Beach,and I loved it! I have the 126 film photos to prove it! Living on the outskirts of LA county for the past 30 years I can attest that Venice is only slightly different, to the casual tourist,today.Just as unique and memorable as always. Are you visiting L.A. from, anywhere, and wondering if you should use part of your precious time here? I would say, Yes if : you have kids, you watch t.v. or movies and enjoy seeing places familiarized on current and oldie films, you need souvenirs, you like people watching, you want to walk,run, skateboard, bike, segway,rollerskate, you like street pwrformers(and these are some of the best), you have an interest in California bungalow architecture, you want to take pictures, you want some boardwalk food ( NY/ NJ visitors should not eat pizza....just don't bother) , or you want to sunbathe, swim, surf...although to be honest I've never actually gone to the beach/surf at Venice but it is possible. I would suggest you choose a better option if you are looking for a beaches day, Venice is walking, watching entertainment for your spare singles, unique art and crafts, caloric splurges and usually sun. Wear sunscreen, that sand reflection will getcha, bring singles to share with the entertainers they work hard to continue the tradition and create your experience; every time I go, one more two acts are exceptional and I enjoy letting them know it. That being said, I can't help you with where to park or eat...I really only go when I have guests myself. I street park, which is possible with patience. There are lots too. I use TA and flavortownusa.com for restaurant tips. If it is summer I go midweek when possible. Everything thing is still open and busy but weekends will be crazy busy. Other times, mid week means fewer if any performers, fewer artists, maybe some closed shops, not sure you'd get the same overall experience. Now, time allotment. You could spend an hour, or a half day. Really doesn't warrant more than that. Unless, you want to go to the actual beach. Spend some time watching the skateboarders at their park and the dedicated weightlifters at muscle beach, a fenced open air workout club, along the ""boardwalk"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisaj_12
30,Rent bikes and ride,We rented bikes and rode along Venice to Santa Monica and Malibu Kinda of trashy but fun none the less,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillSure
40,People watching is very interesting/fun,"A very crowded walk, the usual souvenirs of California, pizza slices, burgers, hot dogs, ice cream, frozen yogurt, great beer spots, street entertainers, sometimes Ninja Warriors compete here, skate arena-fun to watch, lots of police representation-fairly safe during the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birdieb1
50,Great stop over if you are traveling out of LAX,"Flying on in North America from Australia, Venice Brach is a great place to stop over and adjust your body clock! Close to the airport USD 30 ride, it's an easy place to spend the night and relax!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roaming_AMo
40,People watching is Great!,Venice Beach is a must-see experience whenever you are in LA! Don't miss the skateboard park on the beach. ..amazing talent! There are many little shops and interesting food options. Well worth your time. ...it takes at least three hours to walk down and back the strip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynegs

40,Sight seeing experience,"Great for sightseeing , sidewalk entertainment, and vendors. Even though vendors had duplicate merchandise for sale. Restaurants also available. Don't forget to see muscle beach located on Venice Beach. Many sporting activities going on basket ball, skate boarding, biking, roller skating and more Wouldn't recommend for young children though would stay at Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayneecaruso

30,Nice to visit but?,"Actually had a good time there. Beach was awesome, shops were awesome and performers were great. The only thing i didn't like were the five black guys with amplifiers blaming the white race for keeping them down. At least that was their wording. Just tired of hearing these broken records.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welltraveled4578
40,"Beach perfect, homeless in Venice","The beach is nice however the homeless people are bit scary :-( as they sleep sometimes also at the public restrooms . and seiing ( only from outside) the ""Freak Show"" - real name of an attraction there - makes you believe that you are close to a halucination :-)However I really enjoyed it there! It is an experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanaO_12
40,Cool place to hang out but other beaches are nicer,"Was here during a business so we went out to all the beaches in the area each night. It wasn't hard to find a parking spot - it's always a challenge in the LA area. Anyway, the beach itself is pretty with the excellent sunset. We walked along the beach for a bit and I understand why people all want to live in SoCal. Didn't really visit any of the shops because it was later in the evening. It's not the cleanest looking beach area but it's nice for what it is. Didn't really have any problems with anything else and we left feeling pretty happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422hungt
40,Venice beach is an experience! So hip & electric,"My husband and I have been going to this beach for 16 years. My husband used to play basketball here on Sunday's and we used to skate on Saturdays. We now live in Florida but always go home to California for a week or 2 every year.We rented a place on Venice beach for 5 days, great street performers, lots of entertainment. Plenty to do in the Abbott Kinney area.The only down fall is the homeless people are everywhere in Venice. It's so sad. Not just in Venice but all over LA in general.The collapse of our economy has turned a big part of LA into tent city.It seems like the city can't seem to get any control over the homeless problem..When we went home all I thought was what happened to our beautiful city. Why are so many people dragging their possessions with them. The same people were literally dragging mattresses out every night to sleep on. Freeway under passes have many many people sleeping & camping out under them. I've never seen anything like it.I would have given this review 5 stars. But the water is too dirty to enjoy at the beach, we got cussed at by a minimum of 3 homeless people over 5 days that obviously had serious mental issues. One lady was drunk and started cussing because we wouldn't give her money.3rd parking has only gotten worse over the years, apparently they have given up solving these problems..But yes overall, I would say if you've never experienced Venice beach, you should definitely put it on your things to do list..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsRobinH
40,Culture Enriching!!!,"Saturday or Sunday is best to see the vast selection of characters that come to entertain you and tantalize you with their vision of art. If you have a need for medical smokes, its sold on the strip!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xelha92
10,Horrible,"We were dropped at the Venice end of the beach and instantly regretted it. Didn't feel at all safe and were quickly hustled by guys selling reggae CDs who surrounded us and we ended up giving them money for s**t CDs that we didn't really want. Lots of homeless people, people with mental illness and drug abuse issues,some openly smoking crack, and one or two ladies soliciting on street corners. Walked as fast as we could to get to the Santa Monica Pier where things felt a little more comfortable but still horrible compared to so many much nicer beach locations elsewhere on the beautiful Californian coast. Would urge anyone thinking of visiting this area to give it a wide berth and pick somewhere nicer if you possibly can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobSwindon69
10,"dirty,rundown","much nicer beaches to visit than here.place was dirty,rundown,lots of shops selling same products.unable to use any public toilets which were taken over by homeless people.not a nice place to bring children.go a little further up to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tadvice
30,People Watcher Paradise,"I stumbled upon this place in the 80's. I recently went back and the only thing different were all the pot dispensaries. Great place to shop though, especially if you're a tourist. You never know what kind of street performer you will see? Bring your camera! It stinks though in certain areas...(pee-wise). Lots of movies were filmed here. A must see if you're traveling in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomjonesCalifornia
50,Only one place like this in the world,If you want to see the Los Angles that you see in the movies then Venice Beach is the place to visit. There is no place like it in the world- You will be amazed and enchanted by all the characters that line the boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754cathyn

40,A classic boardwalk,"Stroll along at the boardwalk. Colourfull people, nice gifts and crafts. It has a relax atmosphere about it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dietwee
20,Wouldn't recommend,We weren't keen on this place at all. The beach looked nice but somehow we didn't feel safe here. We opted not to spend time at this beach and instead return to Santa Monica Beach which had a much safer and family friendly feel to it.The only interesting thing was watching people negotiate the outdoor work out equipment but this did not make the visit worthwhile at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pip-F1
40,If you are on California 1 then stop by.,"I think they call it the PCH, for Pacific Coast Highway. But if one is near by it is worth the stop. Go look at the body builders. It's a hoot. Even if one does not want to swim, go on down to the beach and take a stroll on the boardwalk. Have a snack at any number of restaurants and it will be a fine day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
30,Picturesque,"I wasn't expecting much from Venice Beach, as all the beaches we had seen in the LA area were just large and simple, but nothing particularly beautiful. And Venice is the same, large, wide and long, with the topping of weird people and extravagant shops. Not for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jac-and-Jek
50,Love the sand & the wide beach,"What shall i say when i was able to swim late October. Amazing weather and beach - long and wide. And thise waves...mamama mia..lovely. Around many restourants with delishes food. Shoping area, huge parking and rest rooms. Renting bike or swim board - you choose. Laying down on a towel or just renting a chair. I love it and i am really amazed by the wide beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justtinBulgaria
40,A fun afternoon,We had an afternoon to kill and went to Venice Beach. We have both been there before but it's been awhile. The place seems to constantly reinvent itself. It's a gorgeous long beach and the weather was perfect - sunny and high 70s. Lots of people (and dog) watching. We strolled the shops and had Smokin' dogs (hot dogs) at Jody Maroni's. Watched a pick up basketball game. Very relaxing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolbA4449WI
30,Check the box and move on,"Yes this is the iconic hyped and week known beach. Visit here for a few hours, but a day or longer is too long. There is a lot of drug abuse and mental illness and homelessness in Venice -- so much so that Uber drivers cancel pick ups in Venice (walk to Santa Monica to get your ride, a few blocks away).Take a walk down the boardwalk -- very interesting-- but after lunch, go elsewhere. Stay away at night..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krykie
40,Disney for weirdos,"This beach is defy one of a kind. Can be real shady and dodgy at times, but can also be the best and most entertaining place in world!From the street artist to the facinating graffitis to the chill laid back vibes! Its too much to describe but would hope to be back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/184candicer
20,"Beach fine, frontage a dive.","I was staying near here in September just gone. The beach is of really good quality, nice sand and plenty of space to sunbathe and the sea is excellent. The frontage however (buildings, ppl etc) is another story altogether. Some ppl see the ""nomads"" who frequent the walkway as a good trait/quality, I see them as a blight to what could be somewhere with potential. We have a place in England called Blackpool which is basically a old beach holiday resort that has been neglected, seen better days and hit on hard times, this is what I would compare venice beach frontage to. There is no decent restaurants and just shops selling ""crap"" and ppl haggling you along the front trying to scam you out of money. It`s safe to say I will not be returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/120ScottB

40,Very interesting beach,Venice beach was interesting. The body builders outside the skateboard park the bike park regular beach . Very interesting beach a very nice beach !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jahmai
40,Weird and Wonderful,"Feel really really normal walking the boardwalk. If you're from NZ or Oz, take some fruit and hand out to the homeless as there are plenty. Party,hippy feel, skateboarders, muscle men and everything your imagination would expect. Probably wouldn't linger with kids but worth a visit and opportunity to pick up souvenirs. If you see a grand piano wait for the homeless piano guy to come- a real treat and deserving of a few dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaH709
40,Great scenery,"This place contains a lot of homeless people, drug addicts, skaters and b-ballers. Most of the homeless people do not harm people because they are out there to sell their merchandise to tourists. Plus, there are a lot of LAPD watching. There are street actors for entertainment and a strip mall for shopping. The food are cheaper here compare to Santa Monica. Los Angeles will not be Los Angeles without this beach. The term ""ghetto fabulous"" fits this place. Its one of my favorite places to visit. It is always fun to ride bike, skateboard, or hike on the trails from Santa Monica to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tingyangs6
40,Good place to enjoy people watching,"Interesting place to visit, lots of street vendors and people doing crazy things.Enjoyed watching muscle beach with all the posers and also we used the equipment on the beaches which was for public use. Plenty of free toilets too. Lots of homeless people along this stretch and we were told by a friendly policeman to stay away from this area at night as the beaches were closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liz649
40,I can say that I've been,"Not the best beach to try and get your tan on. When I think beach, I think Miami and the Caribbean, definitely not this place.It reminds me of a boardwalk and more of a Jersey shore vibe. You can people watch and there a street vendors with some good looking items if you are a collector of things.The beach water doesn't look too appealing either but all in all a nice tourist spot. The day I came it was cloudy and the sun want out as much as it needed to be because it was cold for it to have been the middle of June.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoloTouristB
10,1st prize in Worst Beach On The Planet Competition.,"There are many negatives about this overrated hole.It appears to be inhabited only by aimlessly wandering tourists, alchoholics, drug-addicts and the homeless who trundle about the stark,white sand dragging their supermarket-cart homes behind them. Do not come here if you are a New Zealander or an Australian. We know what good beaches are supposed to be like and this place is an atrocity.The palm trees are so tall and straggly that they offer no shade and the entire beach is a desert edged with the most tawdry and awful tourist shops. The athletic prowess of the young men who zoom about on the amazing skateboard area however, will impress you. So will the muscle-bound narcissists who work out here but they will ask you for money if you take their photo.As for the homes and canals: they are for the most part small, crowded and slightly unkempt.The residents here need lessons in how to keep their yards tidy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishb764
40,"Showtime, anytime!","An exciting boardwalk with a slew of characters wanting to put on show for you, usually in exchange for a tip. You'll find artists, musicians, dancers, and lots of unique individuals and their wares. Check out Muscle Beach to see some weightlifting dudes sweating it out in the sunshine. There are shops, bars, and of course the beach. It's not the prettiest or cleanest but it's a photographer's dream, there is just to much to take in. You can't not visit Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briiidge

20,Very disappointing!,Venice beach has passed its use by date. We found it seedy and dirty. Really don't know what all the hype about Venice Beach is. We walked the ocean front for only a short time as we were yelled at by people sleeping around the area. Payed 2 hours for parking but stayed 1/2 hour and that was too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4444Anna4444
10,Terrible soo over rated,The entire beach smells like urine its awful. Its like a million bucks to even park. The boardwalk also smells like urine and its hot as crap. If you want water get ready to pay $10 for it or drink ocean water. And the ocean doesnt even smelll like the ocean it's incredibly weird,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliteSports

50,No beach in the world is like Venice Beach.,"Never have I seen a wilder, more vibrant assortment of creativity and craziness congregated as densely in one place as I have seen at Venice Beach. All of this frenetic activity happens on Ocean Front Walk, a three-quarter-mile concrete boardwalk with stores, fast food spots, flea markets and artists. (What exactly constitutes ""artistry"" - sword swallowing, playing electric guitar while rollerblading, spontaneous screaming - is something for you to decide for yourself.)Venice Beach promises an experience you will never forget ... or repeat elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739rebekahh
20,"Go for the beach, the rest of the area is a waste of time","Perhaps this was hip and funky once, now it is dirty and full of junk. A tourist trap except I didn't see many tourists.

50,Fantastic Beach!,"Travelling with teenage girls from the UK this beach was a MUST on our list of things to do in Los Angeles. We spent the whole day on the beach and in the sea, it was amazing. The boardwalk area was fun with many shops and places to eat and it felt quite artsy. There were outside showers for after the beach which were great. Remember to take a cool box with plenty of water as purchasing small bottles was really pricey! When I go to Los Angeles again I will definitely stay at Venice Beach, ours was a last minute trip and there were no affordable hotels available!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrean231

40,"Venice Beach, First Time","It was a nice, hot day when my family and I went to Venice Beach in May 2015. We paid $20 for parking at a lot near the boardwalk. Busy traffic of cars and pedestrians as we neared the beach. So many vendors along the boardwalk and a lot of different types of artists. Watched a group of guys entertaining a crowd of people with their dance styles and humor. They asked for monetary donations afterwards. We were glad to donate to them. Lots of skateboarders, bike riders, joggers and tourists, like us. Lots of bike rental spots & other items for rent too. I saw a couple riding in an attachment to a bike while a person pedaled them along the boardwalk. I didn't ask how much that ride cost. We did not go swimming that day, but the water was tempting. Saved the swimming for the next day at Santa Monica Beach. We walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Beach passing all the vendors, artists, snack bars & a few restaurants. It was a few hours on the walk with all the distractions. Stopping to check out the goods & entertainers. The bottled water and ice-cream at the snack bars were priced high, so if you don't want to spend ridiculous prices for them, bring your own goods and have a picnic on the beach. Picnic tables in areas spaced out along the beach. Some of our family walked back to the parking lot to pick up our cars and drive them to Santa Monica Beach where the rest of us were waiting because we were too tired to walk back. It was an interesting long stretch of beach for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olitaf
30,Just okay,Venice beach wasn't what we expected. Skateboarding park was fun to watch. Great people watching. Many homeless. Not your normal beach shops. Don't make a special trip to visit go to Santa Monica Peer. We visited as part of a tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeWandaTravel

50,A fun beach!,"I love Venice Beach, but it isn't because of the beach itself as most of our beaches in Southern CA are great. What makes Venice Beach stand out is all the street performers that one can watch for free and all the characters who frequent the boardwalk and, therefore, add interest to the place. Do hold your young children's hands, though, if you walk the length of the beach because you may encounter a seedy character or two, so it's best to be safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoforeignlands

If you have an opportunity to check it out I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjbgreenroyd
50,Top Beach,"This place is famous - lots to do and see besides the sand and surf. It may be part of LA but it feels like an old seaside resort town. Yes, it has canals, beaches, and a long pedestrian-only promenade with street artists and vendors. Lots of joggers, skaters, etc. Very nice scene for a fun afternoon. Watch out - I missed a no parking sign hidden behind vegetation and go a parking ticket. There seem to be too few spaces, since this is predominately a residential community, but I'll be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slc37918
30,It's a beach with stores,"As a tourist, I wasn't impressed. As someone who's been living in L.A. for several years, still unimpressed. The stores are nothing special, comprising of too much touristy merchandise. Then there are places to obtain a medical marijuana card, but don't get it here, instead, go to West Hollywood. The street artists can be entertaining at times, but gets old quick. The street vendors don't sell anything that's worth the prices. When I come here it is just to walk and people watch. Don't come here expecting anything fantastical. If you're a tourist visit another one of the dozens of beaches in Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregoryu874

It is something I am glad I experienced, but not sure I would recommend it to everyone. Not the best place for a family with kids. It was a little ""sketchy"" in areas.

Both were Excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sraso

40,This is LA...in a nutshell.,"If you are a tourist to the LA area, you HAVE to hit Venice. You'll easily recognize the locals from the non-locals. The locals are taking pics of the scene, while the non's are scattering around the scene as if it doesn't exist. I would suggest that you know some things ahead- Yes, street performers/people are going to try to get your money. They are. Either act like you don't understand or spot them a buck. -Yes, there is some craziness happening there. Expect it so you aren't shocked. -Yes, they like the...um...local plant. You will smell it, see it on shirts, painted on windows, etc. You will. Prepare yourself. -Yes, your driving is annoying us cause you are lost and we will honk, yell, and steal your parking spot. We don't mean to be cranky. Sorry in advance. Don't take it personally. There are some fun places to eat and shop in Venice...spend some time...buy some things...help the locals. It is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224DeborahM
50,Eclectic and Exciting,"This is a beach for everyone, even if you don't like the beach. I always take my friends and family from out of town to experience the eclectic atmosphere, from street performers, weird people who have been featured on film or tv., the muscle beach dudes, the street vendors, the roller skate babes, the list goes on and on. Never a boring day at this beach. Bathrooms are not always kept clean. Street vendors offer a multitude of products and food. Great spot for souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank

40,Better than expected....,"Found the boardwalk to be tacky, but no worse than many a seaside resort, but the beach and cycle paths are fine, off the boardwalk there are many good places to eat ranging from great little coffee joints to upscale,excellent and unfortunately expensive restaurants on Abbot Kinney. As to the oft mentioned marijuana fumes obviously these commentators have never been near a coffee shop in Amsterdam.....now those are marijuana fumes!

Possibly the most famous beach in the world, it is know for the ""Muscle Beach"" section, where body builders work out, bikini clad roller blade and skateboarders, and artists as far as the eye can see. Venice is a throwback to the 60's and 70's in many ways, with their shops and hippie culture. The most interesting people watching and people interaction beach for sure. It is iconic! It is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286edc

What a rip off.... Just be wary of the sales people around there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMB4SMB
40,Great day out with so much to see.,"We started the day having brunch at the Sidewalk cafe. Afterwards we hired bikes from a place inside the gingerbread court. It worked out around $18 for each of us for 3 hours. Well worth it.We went from one end of the path to the other. Almost at Malibu. On the way back we stopped off at Santa Monica Pier for a quick ride on the rollacoaster. You can buy a ticket for unlimited rides or one for around $8 for one go.We also stopped off at a beach front cafe where they had lovely deck chairs to sit in. It was very reasonable prices as it was order by the counter and collect when your number is called. Can't remember the name if the cafe though.Along the beach we saw the locals doing outdoor fitness etc. So chilled out.The day we were there, the waves were pretty big and my son enjoyed being in the water despite it being a bit cold.We saw all sorts of people and things during our day at Venice.

Plenty of people who can't play musical instruments, can't sing, or just sit around all day in dirty blankets will be glad to relieve you of that annoying spare change.

No one on the muscle beach when we were there but there were a lot of skaters which was interesting to watch along with a few people playing basketball. we took a taxi there which was expensive so took a bus back which meant 3 changes but saves us 40 dollars. while LA if u can get used to the buses they are much cheaper than the taxis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derby_davec
40,Don't Miss it,"Get there early, parking is limited and fills up quickly. Look for parking a few minutes walk away from the main board walk area, parking near the boardwalk can be $35 a day, but 3 minutes walk away it is only $12. Plenty of things to see and do, lots of souvenir shops and of course restaurants serving a wide variety of snacks and meals.One word of warning - be prepared for long queues at the restrooms; so don't leave it to the last minute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartynGB
30,Not what I expected,"I came to Venice beach to expect lots of muscle men working out but to be honest I think we only saw one! Wasn't what I was expecting but was pleasantly surprised. It is a nice beach, we rented a random so we could explore more of it, which is a good idea to save your legs.On one end there are street artists and lots of nice stalls selling handcrafted items",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478katyd
40,Always something to fascinate and amaze,"Just walk along the promenade and you you'll something to write home about. Great entertainers (and some not so great), muscle men, basketball game, odd people (who just seem normal here) and more. There is even a freak show! Grab an ice cream and watch the world go by.Parking is hard to find (especially in a weekend) so either come early or find a parking lot. We found one in Dell St which was $15 flat rate on the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larabe6
40,Good Beach,"We came to walk at Venice Beach; from the nearest parking lot on Main and Hill to the end near Marina Del Rey, it was about 3.5 miles one way. We did the round trip for 7 miles, and that took us 3 hours. Very good exercise! This beach is well kept and maintained (though you will see some homeless people). It is clean, and I didn't see much trash on the beach or the sidewalk. The sidewalk separates the bicycles and pedestrians - the pedestrians have their own sidewalk, so it is very safe. There are many vendors and artists on the side of sidewalk, selling food and art objects. Do note this beach is geared to adults. There are several green doctor clinics, and medical cupcakes are sold. Children should be kept on the beach AREAA only, not the vending area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachtheMage
30,Great sunset,Paid $9 to park and walk to a less expensive parking lot. We experienced Little shops that were overpriced for the tourists. The most interesting part of the boardwalk was seeing the houses along the beach. Beautiful place to see the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HomeSweetOmaha
50,Fun with waves,"It was waves but we loved it. Swimming guard was there and looked after the visiters. Clean beach and there was toilets and shower. But it smelt. Parking lot by the beach cost $9. You can also rent the bikes, cost around $10 each bike per hour. Be careful, not all the bikes have good breaks. We took a trip from Venice to Santa Monica. It was nice and you see a lot of shops, life and people along the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377alexandran

Common sense really",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ripitup2014

40,"Fun, romantic, alternative beach scene","This beach is super popular for good reason. The beach itself is good, though not as clean as it used to be. There are tons of shops that sell food, shirts, and even marijuana (?!). Lots of joggers, cyclists and a few roller bladers add to the overall atmosphere. I did notice several beggars as well though. Parking is expensive (10 bucks no matter if you stay for an hour or longer) so park a few blocks away and walk in if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinehresman
30,Not Your Typical Day at the Beach,"Venice Beach was full of the unexpected. It is loud, bustling with crowds of tourists, shops and the locals on wheels of all kinds- from bikes to Segway boards. Muscle Beach was amazing and provided our best video moment in L.A. as we watched our young daughter climb the ropes to the top amidst the hardcore body builders and blaring rap. As New Yorkers, we had to take the mandatory walk in the waters of the West Coast but then took a few selfies and left soon after. If you are looking for a relaxing day at the beach, this is not that- but it was fun to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933kathleend
10,Just nasty.,I can't believe how crowded this disgusting place was. Parking was a pain to find and expensive. The strip was full of bums doing dumb crap for money and stalking you to give them money. The stores all had the same junky tourist stuff. The beach was packed and the whole place smelled like urine. Don't waste your time or at least don't touch anything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachbums512

50,Venice Beach is a must,"Venice Beach is an interesting place to visit. It's part hippie, part tourist. There is a great German restaurant at the end of the strand. there are street performers and shops to buy souviners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XYZ123NY
40,A Must See in LA,"As an LA transplant, one of the places that I bring friends who are visiting in Venice Beach because it's the stereotypical LA experience. It has beautiful beach views, a skate park and event muscle beach. You will see people surfing and can even take a surf lesson though one of the local shops, which I recommend trying. There is also shopping on the boardwalk and places to eat a lot the way. It has a much more artistic and eclectic vibe than any other area in LA. There is a also a fairly large homeless community in Venice, which is just part of the culture there. Venice Beach is very active and noisy. You will see people on roller skates and skateboards and hula hooping while on roller blades, all part of the entertainment. It's a place where people really want to be seen. There is a great coffee shop called Manetti's on Windward Ave near the boardwalk. And a fabulous juice bar on Westminster. I liked Venice Beach so much that I moved there! Parking is tough though so plan to come early or pay to park, especially on the weekends in the summer time. It's a good place for families, solo travel, friends, dates, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenRiley44
30,"Beach 5 stars, Venice itself 1 star","The beach itself is just as beautiful as the beach at Santa Monica - miles of white sand and a very long beach. The surrounding area right along beside the beach was not my favorite place in LA. It is full of hipsters, which is OK - I LOVED Williamsburg in New York but this is something completely different. The hipsters around the beach cafes appear to be outnumbered by seemingly shady people and unstable people harassing you as you try to walk along the beach front. The area has a very big grunge feel to it. I knew about that and expected it but never felt comfortable here (Abbot Kinney Boulevard is another story though). Santa Monica just up the road is much more civilized and relaxed and the beach is just as good, if not better because I felt safer there. We walked along the beach boardwalk from Santa Monica to Venice and back one afternoon in September and it only reinforced to me how glad I was that I booked our accommodation in Santa Monica and not Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,Do something about you homeless problem,"This was our dream holiday and nothing was going to spoil it, however tramps were everywhere, not one or two but at least a hundred living under the trees between the walk and the beach and it really impacts on the local area. Come on LA do something about it. Beach was great, surf was fantastic and overall it was amazing, we will go again very soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855lanceb

50,Beautiful Sunset!,"The beach at Venice is amazing! I loved walking the pier and getting lots of gorgeous shots with my camera. I had dinner at a place right off the beach and came right back for sunset. It was a perfect night. Not too hot, and not too crowded on the beach. I'm a southern girl so I'm spoiled by the Gulf Coast and its white sand and warm water, but this definitely rivaled for all time best beach moment for me. You just can't beat the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gagirl75
50,LAZY DAYS/DAZE,"What a great area to spend a day or two just souvenir shopping, eating at the licensed cafes, watching the street acts and finishing with a walk from Venice Beach up to Santa Monica Pier to see the sunset and The Pier light up. From the area there is easy access to Culver City and Downtown LA through cheap bus and light rail transport. We have previously stayed in Koreatown and couldn't compare the two areas, especially with three 17 to 22 y.o. You feel more comfortable and relaxed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961MarkB961

40,It's a beach,"A pot ""clinic"" on every street corner, beggars all over. If you're into people watching it's the place to go. Strange folks. The beach is clean just watch out for the horse poo. The police should have their horses wearing poo bags. There were public bathrooms. Try not to get run over by a skateboarder. bike or roller bladers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doreenl835
30,Beautiful beach but not sure about the rest!,"Stopped off to look at the famous Venice Beach. The beach is just amazing. Very similar to the beaches on the Gold Coast in Australia, but deeper (more beach) and not as shadowed by high rises.However I was quite disappointed in the surrounding areas (roads / shops / stalls) etc. I don't know what I was expecting but I found it quite dirty and run down. Maybe that is what is in known for and I was expecting something else.I much preferred Santa Monica, just down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malomax
50,Quintessential LA experience,Venice is an amazing quintessential Los Angeles experience. The weekends can be crazy on the boardwalk but it adds to the experience. I would recommend renting a beach cruiser and biking up to Santa Monica Pier or Will Rogers if you are burnt out from the people watching. Renting a boogie board is another fun activity for an hour. The water is usually great in the summer. Lots of good food - try the Candle Cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulM447
50,Hope to be back!,We loved Venice Beach! We stayed at a place right on the beach and it was wonderful. We walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier. It was a perfect day :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKEAmyS
40,Fun to walk the Strand,"Venice Beach is fun and amusing. It is fun to see the characters who walk the strand, that is the concrete walkway. There are plenty of good restaurants and pleasant hotels. Remember to bring a sweater for when the sun goes down. It cools off quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwards751
40,Great beach for people watching ...,"I spent the day at Venice Beach. It was nice seeing all the surfers, even though the waves were not ready and willing that day. Walking along the boardwalk was incredible. A nice long boardwalk where everybody has to pass each other, make eye contact, say hello, it's nice to see so many different types of people on one beach. I didn't appreciate the smell of marijuana though, since I can't smoke with them. Some of the places you smell that coming out, like the apartments where the people stay right on the boardwalk. It was cool to go past Muscle Beach, and see where Arnold Schwarzenegger got this covered. Those guys were amazingly big!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelife2015
20,Run down,Very disappointed. The stalls were run down and poor. Did not find anything of interest to purchase. It resembled more of a homeless site with beggars. At times did not feel safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julielY908AH

40,A Perfect Sunday on the Pacific,"I took a drive to Venice Beach on a beautiful Sunday morning from my hotel near LAX. I was quite impressed by the long pier with many points to stop and to take photos. The surfers were out that day and the scenery was magnificent looking North towards Santa Monica. Everyone on the beach seemed to be having a great time. Free parking was available on the side streets. All in all, a perfectly relaxing day on the long expanse of beach. I bought a baseball cap with the Venice Beach logo to remember my journey there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J639VIjohnv

40,Grungier but more fun than Santa Monica,"A great place to have lunch in a little beach front cafe, enjoy a leisurely couple of hours people watching and getting in the groove with the musos, before taking a wander along browsing the eclectic stalls and chatting with the vendors. Edgy but in no way offensive.As short stopovers without a car we took a long time (1.5 hours) to travel by crowded bus from West Hollywood. It would be much easier by car and there was plenty of reasonably priced parking available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyTeviot
50,Mediterranean breeze in the Pacific ocean!,Venice beach is great place to be! I was there during January 2015 and in this time we are supposed to be freezing in Europe!

It was so such a dream to be there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bojanh2014
40,It's got character. That's for sure.,"Not our kind of destination, but we had cause to stop here as part of a tour.Cannabis smoke permeated the air and the stalls selling tourist fare were plentiful.You really should visit as part of a more 'well rounded' LA experience, at least that's what we told ourselves.Muscle Beach was a bit of a shadow of the legend that precedes it and the beach itself was quite vacant for the hot day that we visited on.Not a bad experience. But definitely not glamourous. We enjoyed ourselves none the less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItsMrAndMrsMills

Venice Beach is a unique part of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisz282

50,"Venice Beach baby, a bit bizzare, but fun for everyone!","Venice Beach is a mixed lot. It's great for everyone and anyone. The beach itself, is ok, I'm not going to lie, it's Los Angeles, what kind of beach are you going to get here. Stereotypical L.A. palm trees, murky water, and hazy smoggy skies. The totally loud and interesting boulevard that makes Venice. From the gorgeous eye catching men and women, of all variety, to the random things you are apt to see here. It's just fun. Food galore, from hamburger stands, to nice eateries right by the stand. Little shops, where you can buy crappy little trinkets, to save your memories of Venice, because let's face it you have to have something from here, but quite honestly, you'll never forget this place. You have to the drum circle of hippie's in the background that you can join if you so choose, pot in the air, there's always some type of street show showing going begging for a buck or two. Don't forget to keep your wallet and purse close to you! Pick pockets galore. I've never had an issue, but you never know. Bring wipes for the bathrooms, because it's like a concrete outhouse. Only more gross because there's sand everywhere. One more thing, one of the most iconic people at Venice is the guy with dread locks playing his electric guitar on roller blades. YOU HAVE TO SEE HIM!! Have fun and stay safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556shaunar

40,The Zoo is a show,"My husband had always wanted to visit Venice Beach, also known as ""The Zoo"", and we soon found out why. Walking up and down the sidewalks were people from all walks of life, in all shapes and sizes, in all manner of dress and interests. My husband wanted to see Muscle Beach, so that was our first destination (after watching a talented dancer performing for a while). I didn't realize you could train on the equipment at Venice Beach for a daily fee- kind of cool- and they have the names of famous people that trained there on plaques around the area. There are lots of outdoor activities to do on Venice Beach- volleyball, bike paths, basketball courts, paddle tennis and a skateboard park that was fun to watch. On the 2 1/2 mile pedestrian only path there are also fortune tellers, artists, vendors, beach/carny food, as well as Medical marijuana dispensaries and tattoo shops. There is also an actual freak show. Musicians, dancers, comedians perform for tourists and locals all over. We planned on staying less than an hour, probably stayed two. Bring sunscreen and water and your camera and enjoy the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glee47

40,An eclectic array of Locals...Venice Beach,"Venice Beach for all its popularity is a specific stretch of Beach, in Venice, located next to the Santa Monica Pier that has attracted all walks of life.

30,An Experience,"We have spent the last week driving and stopping down route 1 having stopped at Malibu we eventually found Venice (Muscle) Beach. It was an interesting experience and was not quite sure what to expect, lots of stalls selling tea shirts and the usual memorabilia lads playing basketball, skateboarding and of course the outdoor gym and weights. There was not that many people in the gym which was surprising given the history however we managed to find the kiosk close by that sold official Muscle Beach tea shirts for $20 rather than the copies sold close by. At least we have been there and got the tea shirt so to speak.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445tonyw
30,No exotic experiance sorry.....................,Found it a bit disappointing that the Golds gym fraternity were not present and maybe this is one of the reasons that I found it a bit average.All the retail outlets seemed to be a bit costly and the food was not inviting to the visitor.......................very croded just the same.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1722JSpeterm
40,Not like it used to be,"Venice beach is not how it used to be, if you want a classier, better atmosphere, nicer bars and restaurants, you would better go to Manhattan, Santa Monica, Malibu, or anywhere else, I don't want to sound bad but this is my personal opinion and my own experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bassemkhoury

30,"Interesting, But Not Great","As a first timer in LA, Venice Beach is somewhere we thought we had to go. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find somewhere to park. When we finally did, we got a ticket! Foreigners beware- a red curb, even if it doesn't look that red and there are no signs telling you not to park, will get you a ticket!Anyway, we went for a walk and it was kind of what you would expect; there were some oddballs and Muscle Beach. The best part though was watching the skate boarders in the skate park, who were incredible.Overall though, I wouldn't want to spend too long there. If you're looking for a nice beach, go to Santa Monica or Redondo rather than Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873AmyB873

People chilling, people freaking out, people singing, dancing, playing drums - I think everything goes - and that was in daylight!!! Definitely worth a peep, but not sure if I would like to stay there while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeirdreKerry
20,Disappointed,"Perhaps we had an unrealistic vision of what Venice Beach was like so were quite disappointed to find it very dirty and grubby., with lots of dark souvenir and surf shops that looked uninviting. But the most disconcerting was the homeless people , the druggies, (particularly around the Marijuana shop) and the modern day hippies that looked like they needed a good shower. The beach itself was vast and lovely. Parking is hard to find too. Glad we visited but not a place to take the children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/527mechellem
40,Best people watching!,"Best way to spend a Saturday morning is to jump on bikes and ride from Temescal Canyon to Venice Beach. The people watching along the bike path can't be beat. I say go for breakfast because well, by afternoon its crowded and not great for riding at a fast pace. If you like to cruise, then go any time of the day.When you get to Venice lock up your bikes. Be smart and choose a spot that is out in the open and holds a good amount of other bikes. My spot is next to the sidewalk cafe with the red awnings. There is a rack right on the path, and one next to their restaurant. I don't always eat there, but I've never had any problems with leaving my bike. Grab some food at one of the cafes and take in the action. After breakfast, walk over to the skate park. I was there the other day and caught Sean White just hanging out. Take a stroll down the boardwalk. The street vendors are great fun and have unique stuff that you won't find anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hjawa4
50,Excellent art and vendors,"The street music, street magic, and all the activities going on,from the skateboarding to the surfing or the Goliath men lifting weights, carries its own lively feeling. Fun place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathans140
50,Back to the 80's - Venice Beach!,"If you are brave enough to take the boardwalk from Santa Monica beach along to Venice beach, you will be pleasantly surprised. In a way you are stepping back to 70's and 80's, where wannabe actors and musicians peddled their wares, strung out on the latest hallucinogenic substance. There are a lot of shops selling medicinal ""Herbs"" and smoking appliances, and still a lot of musicians to serenade you as you eat at one of the fine eateries based on the boardwalk. I think many of the musicians playing there these days were actually playing back in the 80's!! The place is colourful, and it's great for people watching. I personally wouldn't hang around too long when the sun goes down - unless you're off to the Rooster Fish, if you must. Good for a sunny afternoon visit. Very Good in fact.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
50,Something for Everyone,"I have been to this beach twice and both times were unique and fun. The first time I played basketball (though there are no lights for night playing). The second time I went at night and chilled with some of the eclectic people for a few hours. This beach brings out hipsters, jocks, homeless people, regular people, and creative people. Definitely a place you have to try if you're visiting the city for the first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301calebk
50,Beach,This is a great beach and a great water line and don't forget to wear your bathing suit its a great way to spend a summer day or any day at that,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarrisonG119
50,Soooo much fun!,"I wish we had more time at Venice pier, one of our favorite places in LA. From the art on the walls as you enter Venice, to the street performances, shopping, watching the basket ball games, everything about this place was hugely entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasjv
40,Always interesting,"I love coming to Venice Beach from the SFV, running, bike riding or working out on the rings. Such an odd collection of people that everyone fits in. As the sun begins to set you realize just why you live in southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G419CJdavidb
40,A great place to people watch,This quirky area of LA is an excellent place to chill out and people watch or to simply hit the great beach for the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJM10
40,Nice ride!,"If you like running or biking by the beach, then this is the place to be. Obviously swimming is not so easy due to the huge waves, but there are a lot of activities to do in the beach all day long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/likornios
30,"Beautiful beach, but seedy scene along boardwalk","We had never been to this part of LA and wanted to see it, especially since I grew up watching ""Three's Company"". The beach is beautiful and it's neat to walk along the dock, watch the surfers, and see views looking back at the city. The area has a lot of character with unique shops and street vendors. It's great for people watching and there are wide, nice paths - one for wheels and one for peds. There are a few nice and well-maintained properties along the boardwalk.The boardwalk has an underworld, seedy feel. There are a lot of drugs, scuzzy motels and businesses, and unsavory people around. You feel as if you might not come out the other side unscathed, and there was even a murder here around 4am on one of the nights during our visit.We didn't want to use the boardwalk to get back to our car so we walked along a sidewalk a couple blocks in. The sidewalk was super narrow with cars speeding past! The restrooms at the beach are disgusting and smell horrible. (On a side note Helen Hunt made a movie here called ""The Ride"" and had the restrooms cordoned off with yellow tape in one scene. She probably didn't want to use them!)This is one of those places you have to see once and if you stay closer to the beach it might be a nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finalsan
50,Better than the Santa Monica Pier,"My FAVORITE BEACH! EVerybody is SO chill and laid back. Theres things you can buy, places to eat and the beach is awesome- of course!I loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roxy89103

40,Interesting Place,Very interesting place to visit you will see people from all walks of life. Great to place to people watch. Worth a visit while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dunnersfireman64
50,Terrific Must Do,"Venice Beach is amazing. We rented bikes and traveled up and down the entire beach. It is clean, lively quirky and beautiful. Dont miss this fun experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshinePatty
50,Best vibe ever!,"It's impossible to be on Venice Beach and don't feel the real California vibe. Skateboarding, basketball... Various cafes, bars and stores on the board walk. Good singers making their music to the crowd. It's perfect! Try to see the Venice sign on the Main St as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d_iar2014
50,"Pot smoke and incense and B.O. and everything funky under the sun, including Harry Perry","When I lived in Venice, on a walk street half a block from the beach, I pretty much lived a barefoot, semi-shaven existence, never putting on much more than a t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops. I wanted to punch the drunken lovable loser who sang Doors tunes on my back porch at 3 a.m. on ""school nights."" Parking sucked, locals did a lot of drugs (they still do, obviously), and the sunsets and bikinis were glorious.Since moving away from the Southland, every time I find myself in a cookie-cutter environment overrun with chain stores and Olive Gardens and sterile strip malls and soulless, trumped-up tourist traps, I long for the chaotic, loony, mostly harmless and often unwashed, always entertaining strip of westernmost Los Angeles called Venice.As a visitor, I'm drawn to the swirling, frenetic energy, the buskers and rollerbladers, the ""fragrant"" drum circle and the snake charmer in a banana hammock. I'm also drawn to the array of upscale eateries and tucked-away bars and rooftop cocktails.And all this is before even stepping onto the wide warm beach. So wide that if you amble down to the waterline and turn to look back, you'll see none of the fetid, teeming boardwalk. You'll be agog at the sea of serious sun-seekers, and lulled into a daze by the repetitive thump of the surf.What's not to love?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noneemac
40,"Great experience, watch out for the space cadets!","When visiting Santa Monica you just have to walk along the front to Venice Beach, it is an interesting experience, as you weave your way through the many boarders, cyclists and roller bladers you will eventually come to Venice, most noticeable by the number of souvenir shops, buskers and people talking to their imaginary friends, but do not let this put you off. There are many places for a refreshing drink and lots of good souvenirs and humerous t shirts on offer as well as lots of opportunities for that memorable photograph.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/studrummond
30,A bit seedy,"For a tourist area we thought Venice Beach would be a little cleaner and tidier. Homeless people are everywhere as well as drug users, some quite aggressive.The beach itself is lovely and there are some interesting shops but it's not a place I'd like to visit at night and I'd probably be dubious about taking young children. Didn't seem particularly safe to be followed by a drug user hurling abuse at us for walking past her!The skateboard arena is fun to stop and watch. Just be careful is our advice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dannel
20,Overated Tat,Went there on part of organised tour.The front was filled with shops selling tourist tat.Reminded me of Blackpool years ago.Not my scene.The beach area itself seemed nice enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArferUk
40,people watching,So it was our first time out in Venice Beach and im diggin the people watchin. I also had a chance to try out a poke bowl at one of the stands. pretty good. Overall the beach is nice and an added plus that you can work out there ( and shop around for flea market type items) We will be back and hopefully next time we'll be able to stay longer. Paid $9 for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pogicha
50,Perfect family getaway.,"The weather and water was awesome during the Labor day wknd. Long stretch of beach so lots of space for everyone.Lots of shops around. You can go without anything to the beach and buy everything you need for real cheap.There is a police station right on the beach boardwalk, so pretty peaceful.Lots of fun activities and unique performing people on the boardwalk.Separate area for only Skaters.Quite a few cool graffiti to check on the area too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruplogin

40,Nice to chill out,"Walked from Santa Monica pier along beach wlak way to venice beach. Grandson wanted to see muscle beach(fan of Arnie). Really nice walk well designed with a walk way for pedstrians and a seperate path for pedal cycles, skaters etc. Plenty of shops and things to do and see. Grandkids loved it, great way to chill out can stay as long as you want either just to walk or stay on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doc055
30,Very unique Beach,The famous Venice Beach. This has a TON of vendors along the way that you can check out goods. I found a great popcorn and beef jerky shop hidden in a nook. It is a great eclectic atmosphere with so many different things to see. Definitely recommend if you want a lazy day to just walk along the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneyland255
30,"Fun to see the skateboarders, but otherwise very crowdy","Went here late afternoon. Nothing special here, except for the skaters. Restaurants around the beach are many. As we were there, cops were raiding on ppl, I guess for consummation of illegal substances. Would not recommend for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/becseyz

Venice is a lot more Laid Back not too many Tourist as you would see in Santa Monica, but it still gets Very Crowded !! Known for Skaters, you can rent Beach Cruises, you'll see people Rollerblading, ect.There's a lot of Smoke Shops lol souvenirs stores selling everything even Incense (10 for $1) ;) they have Food spots, bars, & lots of Coffee shops, may I recommend Menotti's, you won't regret it if you want good Expresso & lattes...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Playita_Cindy
40,Colourful and interesting!,"my wife and I called at venice beach out of interest and found it to be a very interesting day trip. We called at muscle beach which is basically a large caged area with people ( I only saw men) body building and people jogging, rollerblading, cycling and sunbathing. The front is littered with colourful shops and places to eat and drink. An experience not to be missed 🏥",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g1000_8

50,Feels like you are on a movie set,"This is the kind of place that makes you re evaluate your life and wonder why you do not live near a beach. Beautiful people, beautiful weather, clean environment and people just enjoying life. Makes living seem worthwhile, fantastic place to chill out or work on your tan!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627haseebb
50,David Hockney at LA Louver Gallery,We visited Venice Beach to go to the LA Louver Gallery to see David Hockney's new exhibit that will be shown through 19-Sep 2015. It was worthwhile to see the master's newest creations and ideas pertaining to perspective. We highly recommend it if you're interested in contemporary art and technique.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJT645
40,Fun place to kill time,"We had some time to kill before a flight and this was close to the airport rental car drop. Its not polished, there are weed dispensaries, and there are interesting people (some of whom are drunk). If you don't want any of that I wouldn't recommend stopping here. I however found it great for people watching. There are a couple of fun shops and several good restaurants. We stopped at a place at one of the ends that had a great selection of beer and a patio out front. There is plenty of parking around. We parked in a pay lot for a couple of hours and it was fine. Street parking would definitely be difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kafroppi

Tethered is so much to do if you want to see things and action. Great places for drinks on the boardwalk and always something to see!!!I bring people first visiting Los Angeles there and they love it or it scares them from coming back but I guarantee they will not be bored 👍.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Real-Vacationer

50,My Sanctuary,This is one of my favorite places to go in the whole world. There's so much to do and so much to see and the ocean is just there waiting for me to behold its beauty. Never a dull moment great for people watching. Great place to take a nice long walk or bicycle. I go there for breakfast or lunch often. There so many options available. I especially like Poke Poke for their ahi Poke bowls. I love the energy at Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels
40,"Come for the freaks, stay for the food","Venetians would prefer to keep tourists out. Google is buying property at an alarming rate and forcing mom and pops and the people that keep Venice weird out. So visit before the city loses it's original charm.Tons of great restaurants, rent bikes, fun boutique hotels to stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/windsorknot
50,Sunday Funday Drum Circle! Must do!,"Love Venice Beach and all the people around here. If you have never been to the Sunday drum circle, this is a must. The rhythm of the drums, the energy of the people dancing, the sun, and the breeze from the ocean make it quite an experience. Other than the drum circle, there are lots of shops and restaurants on the boardwalk that can occupy your time. Watching people work out at muscle beach is also interesting. Or just take in the sunshine while people watching or watching the waves roll in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RinaTravelsWorld
40,People watching fun!,"Venice beach is full of all types of characters. Great for people watching. One of the busier of the beaches in Los Angeles. Not the cleanest. Lots of shopping & places to eat. You can lay out, walk or rent bikes. The homeless & thugs can be annoying. But if you just ignore them they usually leave you alone. The Townhouse has good cocktails & great place to go dancing at night. Larry's a few doors down has good food. Worth a visit if your going to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistyo123
20,Busy and dirty beach,"My children and grandchildren were visiting from Norway my children and grandchildren were busy from Norway tom that always heard about Venice beach in Norway and wanted to go and see it and take pictures.I was disappointed in many things about Venice Beach.They had great restaurants, but we were stopped every 10 feet for money. We had one young man ask my son visiting America if he wanted to score some drugs. It was very crowded. To me the old history and excitement of Muscle beach is gone. It is a shelter now for things and people I can not take my kids or grand children to.LAPD had a great presence there, but they were definitely out numbered.I do not recommend this for families with kids. I say that based on my personal experience while visiting Venice Beach with my family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401rickyj
50,"I visited, I moved here",I grew up on Long Island NY and love living near a beach. I also prefer eclectic environments because I find them stimulating. I also love historical overtones and interesting architecture. Venice beach has all that plus a community of people who for the most part transcend the typical LA arrogance vibe. So many great restaurants bars clubs and the boardwalk offers some of the best people watching anywhere. The local transients aka homeless are friendly and easy to get used to. Welcome to Venice Beach! Please don't litter! Thanks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DFrederick

10,Not a family friendly place,"Although we rented bikes and this was fun, it was very uncomfortable until we got further North away from Venice Beach. This place is full of weirdos and bizarre people. It did not seem 100% safe nor family friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehippoguy
40,Its worth a look!,"When you think of the wackiness of LA Venice comes to mind. Muscle beach, the skateboarders, the hippies, the vendors, the beach acts... it is all there. If you are a tourist you have to go to Venice Beach. Weather you like it or not, you won't see this kind of craziness anywhere else. It is very entertaining. One of our favorite things to do is to walk out to the ""Skate Bowl"" which is on the beach past the bike trail, and watch the skateboarders. They are amazing. The views are panoramic of the ocean and there is something quite peaceful about watching the Venice scene so close to the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swisscss

50,Hands down best experience,So many street freaks .. love it .. also they have a freak show. I was so intrigued I ended up starting to watch the show on Netflix. Every time I go to LA I try to bring my friends there. They have unique people everywhere playing music playing 21 drinking beer running in the sand pretending to be a babe on bay watch and much more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploringGipsy44
40,A must see location,"I went to Venice Beach early in the morning before the crowds arrived, but the skateboarders were already out and the surfers were already in the water. There are a lot of places that charge a lot to park, ($18) but I found a place and parked for free. I loved seeing the parents skateboarding with their kids. The shops were just opening by the time I left. I really enjoyed my early morning stroll on the beach. I felt very safe by myself and loved watching all the people around me. The only thing is, I would have liked to staying longer to really watch the beach come to life during the day! I'm sure it must be quite a transformation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgtg23
20,Felt like it was very Dirty,This place seemed to be very dirty and sketchy. The muscle beach was not that impressive and we left quickly and won't be returning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyp761
40,Not to be missed.,Definitely worth a visit. Walked the boardwalk. Found it very interesting seeing all the free spirits doing their own thing.

50,Venice Beach - Beauty - Bizarre - Fun - Visual Feast,"i lived in Venice from 1968-1984 and saw many transitions, since I lived there before the bikepath came into play. On most weekends Venice is alive and vibrant filled with tourists, street performers and vendors. One of the most interesting and different attractions is the Venice Freak Show for $5.00 (well worth the price of admission). Venice has bike rentals, a great skateboard half-pipe with great viewing of great skaters, wonderful shopping and outdoor restaurants. The main action starts at Windward avenue and goes North to a little beyond Rose Ave. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryFleishman

50,Great place,"We checked this place out when sun was already setting. Go get a bike and ride along the beach, it is awesome and not very expensive. The place is layed out for tourists, which in my opinion is no problem. There is also high security there. Police is around every corner, so you dont need to fear for criminal activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariusp152
40,Interesting and a little different.,"Our first stop here was on a bus tour early in the morning before the place get a busy. We went back a few days later around early afternoon and there were more people around. Don't be surprised if you are asked if you want to buy medical marijuana. They sell it it quite a few shops. If you don't get offered any, you are sure to smell it, especially around the skate park. There are lots of shops along the beach to browse in. Check out muscle beach gym and all the street art in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandp141
40,Bohemian stop on day tour,We had a very short time at Venice Beach early morning but we'd like to go back. The beach looked huge an really great - see others for comments on facilities etc. what struck us however was how Bohemian the beachfront was. Looks an exciting place to spend some time and there seemed to be plenty of 'alternative' type stores to browse and find something different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleRedBaron

50,Like nothing else,"Venice beach is a very interesting and unusual place to visit. It is definitely entertaining and full of fun. It is great for biking, water activities,skate boarding, best food and people watching!!!If you are planning on staying in Venice beach I would recommend to stay closer to Santa Monica( somewhere between Rose Ave and Dudley Court). This way you will be in a strategic position to to see both areas and in a walking distance to everything Venice, Santa Monica and even Marina del Rey has to offer. Also it is more quiet than deep in Venice by the Musle beach and not as boring as in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niksha2013

We arrived, looked round and then booked into a hotel in Santa Monica proper. My husband cycled along the beach and said it was OK, but I would not let my 16 year old daughters anywhere near it.

20,Avoid the night time.,The freaks definitely come out at night. Nothing really special just a bunch of street performers. They even close the shops down right at sunset. It's def for the younger crowd and the whole place just stinks of weed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandL4
40,Lots of activity for a stroll,"We went on a hot Thursday afternoon in August. On a weekend parking would be much more difficult. We found a place on the street just a few blocks away and walked over to the main path where most of the activity is. There were many numbered spaces for vendors to sell their goods or services; well over half were empty at this time. Regardless, there were many people walking, riding bikes, and otherwise crusing the wide walkway with stalls or businesses on both sides. Noticiable was the many places offering marijuana prescriptions with ""barkers"" at the door waiting for possible customers. There were no dispensaries, however, seen at Venice beach per se. We leisurely walked until we found a place for lunch. This is my 5th or so trip here - I would do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113rl
40,Nice,Nice beach and a beautiful view of the ocean. We didn't spend very long here ..... just long enough to say I stuck my toes in the ocean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417kks
50,Amazing Beach,"This is a great beach to go to by yourself, with friends or with family. Not as crowded as other LA beaches. Very clean and a nice area all the way around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcquml1
30,Great but my little niece and nephew were surprised by the weed doctors clinic!,"It was a fun experience for the family especially the happenings at the board walk. But I remember my little niece and nephew including me went on a laugh trip when we passed the weed clinics! haha BTW, worst toilets EVER!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWanderJade
40,Weird and Fun,"Street performers, aging flower children, skaters, bicyclists, tourists from all over the world converge to people watch, buy sunglasses, and enjoy the sun and beach air while being a part of the crazy parade themselves. Parking is tough, so go early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyOandOscarO
40,Venice beach,Was looking forward to checking out muscle beach and although the beaches are great and there's lots to see we were a little disappointed as it's not all that clean. Still glad we made the trip but been there done that..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieFyfe
50,Great experience,"We parked a couple of blocks down from the famous boardwalk of venice beach. If you plan to come to Venice Beach, make sure to dedicate a whole day. A couple of hours at the beach and couple hours to walk down, shop, watch the street acts, take a look at the graffiti wall, watch some of the basketball games, muscle beach, etc. When we went there was a venice beach basketball league. Near the public bathrooms, there were two guys who were selling their own art work (graffiti) and were donating the money for charity for the boys of the league. Unfortunately, the boardwalk was so long by the time we got back they were gone. I had them do a lot of art work and i'm still trying to local their website. If you get the pleasure to see them while you are there (mention my trip advisor review please :D ! ) The souvenir shops were priced average, not expensive at all unlike south beach prices. I bought about 8 tee shirts for $54 which was awesome. We also had the chance to see the famous freak show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marisolr241
20,Don't touch anything...,"Possibly one of the dirtiest places i've ever visited. Didn't touch anything, watched my wallet and got out of there pretty quick. If you want to see the beach scum of LA, check it out. Otherwise, go anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/679andrewR
50,What a great place,We had two kids & their grandparents in tow when we stayed here. We all had a fantastic time. The people were very friendly - the prices reasonable & the beach itself superb. Don't be put off by the ramshackle nature of the place it's great fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PGM181111
20,Sadly you need to see Venice Beach but that does not mean you have to like it,You need to see Venice Beach promenade but that does not mean you have to like it. The beach is beautiful but the promenade is filled with every whacko and rip-off merchant in LA. If you need to take some ultra tacky gifts home then this is definitely the place to find them!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipe266
40,My favourite place in LA!,"Its just great, the whole atmosphere is buzzing.I could stay and watch the skaters alone for hours.The shops are amazing and you can haggle to get a good deal if you're buying more than one item. They do some funky things. Think Camden on sea if you're from England!Try and stick around for the sunset too. It's truly beautiful. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because you b can feel quite hassled there with the guys trying to get you to listen/buy their cds and the homeless asking for whatever they can get.I'm so sick and tired of getting hassled in LA (bus tour anyone???!)You can't go to LA without going to Venice beach. Make sure you get a good few hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiannonM_13
50,A nice place to visit,A nice place to visit specially in the afternoon. . The sunset view is awsomeThe muscle beech is close to the Venice beach .. while walking there you would never get bored. .Plentyof beach bars and and lots of Canabis clinics !You might spot a famous bodybuilder there every once and a while,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mujahid_Dhaif
10,This place has become a dump,"Visiting Venice beach was one of the main reason I wanted to visit LA, the hype around the basketball games at Venice beach and the world famous outdoor gym. I was super excited and it was a massive disappointment unless your looking for herbal medicine. The markets are pretty repetitive and unappealing and the atmosphere is the likes of a hangover. Damn shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shakaka
40,So glad to go,This is a place you see and hear about in movies and it was nice to go and walk along this beach. We even saw a few people working out! It was a nice evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brinastew
10,Terrible in all aspects,This is truly a ghastly place. Homeless and druggies everywhere in plain site. We ate in a beachside restaurant and it was inedible for all three of us. Do not take children there. It's almost scary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gericorb
50,Super cool!,"Venice Beach is a must. Possibly one of the nicest touristic places to be at least once in your life. Everyone is unique and a stroll next to the seaside will definitely raise your energy. You can find all sorts of people, and have a lovely time. We went last week and had some drinks in front of a music band of hippies. It was a fantastic experience. As a foreigner, I really appreciate the place, but I personally couldn’t live nearby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarabP1148TG
40,Great Family Outing.. Venice is Great !!,Took the family to get the Venice vibe.. Great sideshows (of which my 10 year old son was chosen to participate and got paid $20 for his efforts).. Basketball league tourney was awesome.. People where weird but artistic in their own ways.. Have to see place..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960ronc
40,A Beach for the Tourist looking to be a Non-Tourist,"If you are traveling to the LA area or staying in the LA area for any length of time and want to get-away to the beach to enjoy nature and some ""me"" time, this is the place to go. Unlike, the Pier at Santa Monica, this is more for the locals, or the local want-to-be.Venice Beach Pier is handicap accessible and void of eateries and tourist stuff on the pier itself. People come here to walk the pier, fish from the pier, sun on the beach, surf or walk/wade in the water or walk the ocean front for exercise and/or enjoyment.Parking can be a bit of a challenge. There is paid parking on the beach front. It was $9.00 the day I was there. There is also metered parking on the main streets $2.00 per hour, coins or credit cards only (no dollar bills). Side streets offer free parking but the spaces are hard to come by.There are a variety of restaurants and eateries to choose from depending on your pocket/pocketbook. There are also your typical local stores selling everything from souvenirs to items for local consumption and personal needs.The atmosphere and attitude are California laid back. This is the perfect place to come to see a different side of LA and not spend a bundle of money in the process.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858marca
50,"Quirky, weird, fun.","Venice Beach is people watching nirvana. Rent a bike and ride up an down the coast from Marina Del Rey up to Santa Monica....but be sure to stop into the shops along Venice Beach. It is a circus on weekends, performers, preachers, vendors, artists, homeless, etc. don't miss the drum circle on Sunday evenings. If you walk to the beat of a different drum or you want to observe those who do, don't miss Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharone790
50,Venice Beach is one of the most California things to do while visiting LA.,"We visit Venice Beach every time we vacation in Los Angeles.It is beautiful.The food and shopping & sights are wonderful.Walk the boardwalk,rent a bicycle or roller blades.So many things to do.Stroll by Muscle Beach the birthplace of the fitness boom and maybe see some bodybuilders pumping iron.We have found our favorite thing to do.There is a little food stand that sells the best tempera chicken strips and shrimp.They also make great fresh fruit smoothies!We picnic on the beautiful green grass and people watch.Venice has so many artist selling their work.Entertainers of all kinds.You never know what you might see at the Venice Beach Boardwalk,A taping of a television show or Movie.Live Venice beach league basketball games.Venice is just a short $1 public bus ride from the Santa Monica Pier,where there is plenty of parking and you can see the pier and Boardwalk in a day.This reviewers ""California must see""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamK338
30,Interesting,Buzzy and lively...Camden/Covent Garden on the Beach. Unfortunately I don't like to see the Marijuana 'medical' pop up shops along the promenade nor smell the vapour from smokers; otherwise enjoyed the stroll.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adeweston
40,Interesting - not what we had expected!,Arriving at Venice Beach we were amazed by how wide the sandy beach area was! Gorgeous views back to Santa Monica. The actual boardwalk was nothing like we had imagined- filled with stalls and shops. The skate park was the best part for our teenagers - watching the tricks and slides the board riders were performing! Muscle beach was a must see for my husband - although we were told weekdays are very quiet - best to visit on a weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel_Cat75
30,Just a beach?,We walked to the end of the pier at Venice Beach and then walked back again - its great if you want a beach as it didnt appear as busy as Santa Monica but I wouldn't rush back just to go the beach again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckstrike13
30,Nothing Special,"It was gross frankly. Traveling from NYC it actually reminded me of a dirtier Orchard Beach. The cool things were seeing all the eventful activities the locals partake in such as Muscle Beach, Racquet Ball, fishing, surfing, and I suppose boardwalk navigating. I wouldn't recommend this beach if you aimed on actually sitting on the beach for some rays and ocean. I was simply taking a picture when an escaped Rehab Clinic patient named Daryl Hamilton asked me to take a pic of him before proceeding to ask me if I played for St. John's because of my jersey & then asked me if I had pills for him even Tylenol. I slowly walked away and wished him better health. It was gross. Homeless people all over too (I gave some a few bucks I feel bad at times).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpcesco17
50,One of the most beautiful and high energy beaches along Pacific coast,"The beach is really beautiful and clean along with a lot of activities for all age groups like racket ball, gym and play area for kids. The boardwalk and beach market was really awesome with a hell lot of shopping and eating options. Street side shows and street side artists were very good. It is a must go on LA visit. But make sure you keep cash when going there as many places do not accept cards and the ATM are from credit unions which levy a small charge on every withdrawal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104abhisheka
50,"Marvelous beach...""interesting"" town.",The beach itself is clean and long and not very crowded. The ocean was beautiful and warm. There are some very good restaurants in the town and some fabulous people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2769GKjohnb
30,One visit is more than enough!,"A long strip of beach where one side has food and other vendors ( very touristy and basic). They did have some events happening basket ball matches, and had performers. I had been there before and felt that it had become run down since then. If one wanted a cheaper place to hang out, this would be the spot. Younger crowd mainly. Colorful. Went back to show my children, but for me, the first visit was enough! The beach itself is lovely! Worth one visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Azizak
40,"Wonderful Beach for playing Sports, Biking etc.",Our family had great time biking around. Bike rentals are not very expensive but don't forget to bargain though as they do. Some good restaurants and patios to have a drink or too. Great place to rent a breach front vacation home with your family or friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647sanjay
40,Worth a visit,Go at least once. Be careful not to get caught out by the car parks that try to charge you $20. Go a bit further along and there is a massive car park which is $8 all day. Walk along and see the 'sights'.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynChester
40,Great Time,I came here on my very first day in LA since this was the closest attraction from LAX airport.Lots of interesting restaurants and street food.I came on a Saturday and it was not overly packed and there was even a live concert.The water is quite nice and beach not packed at all.There seems to be something for everyone from a very awesome skate park next to the beach to colorful and interesting shops along the boardwalk to the famous Muscle Beach.The only thing I must warn you is the parking nearby as there are scammers that claim their area is public parking so you think it's free but will charge you a crazy amount.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxD87
20,Keep your head on a swivel...,"The main boardwalk along the beach is basically a linear ghetto with seedy shops on one-side and often aggressive homeless, hustlers and addicts between you and the beach on the other. It's like running a gauntlet through a free-form freak show. Beach itself is really nice- but not worth the hassle since there are plenty of others to the north without the drama. Lots of gang activity too. Police are nearby but not really visible; seemingly locked in a beachfront bunker until something really bad forces them out. I witnessed two separate gang beatings on two different days-which didn't produce a single police officer.If you want to see or be a part of this spectacle; just keep your eyes open, enjoy the scene for what it's worth and be gone before dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonymA7725NW
40,Interesting area to walk around,"A lot of strength people around. The beach looks very nice in the evening. A few Marijuana Dr. shops around in this area.. This is my first time to see this kind of stuff. A lot of souvenir shops, sun glasses, t shirt and restaurants around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0_Gyrfalcon_0
50,Iconic Beach,"Funky shops, interesting restaurants, strange and ordinary people, interesting architecture, and so on. Where else can you find all this in such a relatively compact space? There is ample paid parking on the beach and on some streets. Definitely a must see when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goditolindo
50,Favourite,Without a doubt my favourite place in LA.Great atmosphere with lots of lovely tricker stalls and shops to spend your money at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aymeh
40,"Beautiful beach, colorful street life, interesting shops","People come from all over the world to see, not just a perfect California beach, but an array of entertaining people. Everything from skateboarders, wrestlers, musicians, poets, fanny pack tourists, and artisans inhabit this small stretch of boardwalk. Gets a bit crowded sometimes and one should keep their wallet safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
50,Great place to relax,"Wow, what a great visit. Get to the beach before 8 am on a Sunday and it is easy to part and get in the restaurants... The pier is so very large and cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomwF4249DP
30,All Walks of Life,"Lots of street performers, shops & food. Anything was for sale, including things that should NOT be for sale. Muscle beach gym was there and that was neat to see. Not sure if I would want to be there after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikea168
40,"interesting place, worth a visit.","Nice beach with a nice pier and bike path. Its busy but not as much as Santa Monica which is just up the road. Lots of interesting people, shops and sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NematodeT
50,Great place to people watch and see some cool artsy stuff...,"I'm a lover of street art, so was drawn to Venice to come see all of the murals along the strip and I wasn't disappointed! I particularly liked the Jim Morrison and muscle beach murals you'll have to switch streets to see all of them.There are a lot of hippy types and wacky people selling their wares - some good some just weird. I particularly liked @flewnt metal/ woodwork (find him on instagram to see more). There was a guy creating celebrity portraits on pieces of wood; burning them in with a magnifying glass - now that takes talent!There is a lot of tacky stuff down there, but who doesn't need a 'l love Venice Beach' t-shirt!It's a great place to just sit with an ice-cream and watch the world go by, you'll see a lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viciousb
50,Venice Beach Zazzle,"Strolled the entire length of Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier.Great way to spend a day with street entertainers and all sorts of shops and street vendors. Cannot go to Venice Beach and not mention the ""beautiful people"" on their roller blades and bikes. Great atmosphere. Finished off the day with a great ice cream at Marina del Ray",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Convicttraveller
10,Derelict area,"Probably, this was once the place to be. But it is a very philty area now with vague businesses and weird people. There hardly is a decent place to get a bite and in case you find one, they will charge too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elisabethcm2013
50,People watching at its best,"What a fab and vibrant place,loads going on at the weekend,less busy weekdaysBeach is beautiful and cleanPlenty of bars and restaurants",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30MA69
40,You gotta see it...,"""Venice Beach"" really refers to the crazy scene along the promenade lined with a variety of street performers,muscle beach and the basketball courts that offer high quality pick up games. Numerous street vendors,artists and gift shops offering every conceivable tee shirt (4 for $10). You go there to observe the endless variety of humankind..that's why it's the biggest tourist attraction in LA after Disneyland. And the actual beach is really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philsman
30,Colorfully bizarre,This place is like the French Quarter and Amsterdam's Red Light District mixed together and placed on a beautiful beach. Glad I walked through on a Sunday morning. The show gets more interesting as the day passes. Not a family area even on a Sunday morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987drews
50,Lovely area,"Really lovely area of Los Angeles - worth spending at least an afternoon here. There is a beautiful beach, lots of interesting beach front stores and quite a few street artists etc along the esplanade. One thing that seems to be lacking is beach front bars/cafés, but there are lots of take away places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82millief
30,A bit tacky but fun,The beach here is really nice - lots of people but big enough to ensure you can find your bit of sandThere is a real diverse set of people who come here. The shops are a bit tacky and no real restaurants or bars overlooking the beachAn interesting visit but not one I'll be doing again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baxie
10,Totally Overrated!,"Although I've lived in the LA area all my life, this summer's visit to Venice Beach with my college age niece was my first. Wow...what a disappointment. Crowded area with LOTS of tourists and locals, cheap touristy gift shops, and marijuana dispensaries. Long lines for the outdoor restrooms. Everything feels dirty, looks dirty. I would never return or bring visitors to this beach. Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Santa Monica, Malibu...all fabulous beaches. Venice Beach is a train wreck. Never again...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBarb1
40,A place you just have to visit,"Reminds us of walking through a music festival crossed with a market with lots of vendors, musicians and a backdrop of the smell of cannabis. Lots of homeless people, lots of hippies and a few eccentrics make this a very entertaining visit. The beach itself is vast, very clean and has plenty of room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stellablack2014
50,Subject matter intended for a mature audience!,"What a fun place to visit if you're not easily offended!Took our teenagers there and we all had a great time people-watching! We saw it all... A beautifully sculpted body builder, a senior citizen wearing nothing but a leather thong and devil horns (horrors), and a full-on fist fight! Be prepared to hear a lot of swearing and to smell a lot of pot..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theshoppingfoodie
40,Great markets,"Other reviewers have said that Venice Beach is run down and dangerous ... so we went with some trepidation. We were heading for Santa Monica, but the traffic was horrendous so we stopped at Venice Beach. Finding a park was a challenge, but the town and the Boardwalk were a surprise. Clean and tidy, full of 'colourful' characters and the markets were interesting. We didn't feel in the slightest bit unsafe (it was the middle of the day and crowded). Will be back and wouldn't hesitate to take kids with me if I had them in tow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889natalier
40,Highly entertaining,"As with Santa Monica, the boardwalk area is clean and well maintained. The shops, stalls and street entertainment is great. Lots of homeless though which I found a little upsetting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erindoors54
50,Day Trip,Nice place to visit but really wouldn't stay overnite in this area. Seems to be lots of homeless people hanging around. Did not feel safe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresamd0906
50,Wow,This place has a life of it's own which is very easy to slip into. I never wanted to leave. Some amazing characters to observe as you dine al fresco and gaze out at the sea. I will be back. I need to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516natashan
50,Magical Ocean Front Walk,"Venice beach is about the 2,5 mile long ocean front walk- a great place to stroll and take in the circus-like atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicolas_Kar
50,Love this beach!,Venice Beach is a super nice beach! We were more towards the pier where its probably not as busy as Santa Monica beach. People watching is great. The sand is clean. There are garbage bins everywhere so the beach is pretty clean. Deffinitly one of the best beaches I have been to. People are friendly and there are great shops along Venices Boardwalk to stop in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandah62

30,Very mixed area,"Some beautiful parts eg canals, Abbot Kinney BLVD, but also some trashy smelly parts to this area of LA. A real mix. Worth a visit though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdW741
40,Great LA fun!,Venice beach is probably the most iconic beaches when one thinks of LA .. And rightfully so. It's a really gorgeous beach. People watching is probably the funniest thing we've done in a while.We also found tons of really unique cheap souvenir shops all song the boardwalk. This beach is a must stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodibrogan
40,Venice Beach Rocks!,"I love southern California and am jealous of the people who get to live there.Venice Beach is a must-see for anyone visiting the area, and is an experience thatwill always stay with you.The street performers are awesome, but can be a little annoying when they ask formoney.There is a wide variety of vendors and restaurants and the weather is perfect.Parking can be a challenge, but that is a standard obstacle when it comes to anybeach.I preferred the Santa Monica Pier to Venice, but both are awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672manuelq
50,At night walk south along the boardwalk. During the day go to the beach north of the peir. The sand was like flour!,"We visited twice. Once at night after eating at James Beach, the restaurant's name in Venice, we walked along the boardwalk. We started north and then quickly realized the environment to the north was rather sketchy, so we turned and went south towards Marina Del Ray. There was a long stretch of beach front access to the south that seemed safe. A few days later we walked from Santa Monica Pier all the way to the Venice Beach Pier. It was incredible how soft and almost fluffy the sand was when we got to the Venice Beach area behind the offshore break water. REally nice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougTMesa
40,Great Place to People Watch!,"Lots of little shops and touristy things to buy. Street vendors everywhere performing magic tricks, singing, chainsaw throwing, etc. Great muscle bodies working out in the weight section. You can walk the boardwalk, rent bicycles, or rent segways. Enjoy the waves and the white sand, or grab a bite to eat. Great place to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyg554
10,GROSS!,"The entire walkway smelled like urine, the bathrooms near the beach were pretty much porta-potties with no sinks, and smelled disgusting. This is definitely not a family friendly environment, no bathrooms anywhere which may contribute to the urine smell. If you want somewhere nice, pretty and clean, do not come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dalezava
30,Found our time at Venice Beach quite interesting,We loved the beach area but the boardwalk definitely had some interesting people out walking about. We went to the Santa Monica Beach the next day and it was far superior!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Travelgirl08
50,So much fun !,"Definitely a must see in LA.Go and see the beach.Go swimming if weather permits.Lose yourself in the little streets around Venice Beach: see how people live !Plenty of cool bars and restaurants all around.Rent bicycles and wonder around.Young, swinging, funky, diverse...Wow !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucaMT
50,Free WiFi,Walking the canals and the boardwalk was fun. We found free wifi at the Rangers station which was fast wifi. Appreciated the wifi to look up information about the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pjjbro
40,Beautiful beach - unusual surroundings,"The beach itself cannot be faulted. Huge expanse of hot, golden sand, fabulous waves to bodyboard, lifeguards to keep,you safe, much less crowded than surfing beaches in France.There is a bike path than runs along the beach, which is fun to ride. It says cyclists only, but people seem to stray into it as well.The street next to the beach is full of cheap shops and stalls and 'unusual ' people, many of whom are under the influence of something. If this offends you, don't go - go to the other end of the beach nearer to Santa Monica. Certainly, during the day, the atmosphere was not threatening in the slightest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justamumWakefield
20,Famous TV/Cinema spot but it is crowded and dirty,"If you want to see a beautiful beach close to Los Angeles, probably Sant Monica Pier and Malibu areas are much better. Venice is crowded, smelly, dirty and hard to park, but it is a must see spot (at least for one time in life) to see muscle beach, the skate park and some other iconic spots that we all saw in the movies before",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucianor799
40,Fun times at the beach,"Some reviews really make this place sound bad. That was not our experience at all. The beach itsself was nice with lots of hot soft sand. People watching was fun as you have all walks of life hanging out here. Is it touristy? Yes. There are stores and people selling stuff at every turn. But in general its a fun place to spend the day at the beach, looking at stuff to buy, people watching and eating. People are playing basketball, lifting weightsThe peirs are nothing special, they just offer a different view. They are pretty dirty and could be kept up better than they are. Overall we had a great day and enjoyed the beach. $24 uber ride for two from downtown LA one way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harley9787
50,Can you say...people watch paradise,"This place has something for everyone of all ages.

40,Great beach that comes with its own entertainment!,"We have always heard about the famous Venice beach and all of the facets it has and just had to see it for ourselves. It lived up to every story we had heard. The ocean and beach were beautiful and definitively a great way to spend the day. We walked on the boardwalk from the pier to Venice beach and it was lovely. The people were friendly, their creations for sale were unique and the shops were varied from typical shirts and souvenirs to unique spaces with interesting novelties. There were plenty of places to have a snack and a drink and people watch. The street performers were talented and fun the watch from singers to painters to dancers as well as the reality show side show located right on the walk. Only two negatives were the saddening amount of homeless people sleeping on the sides of the boardwalk with their belongings, and the bikers on the paths with little patience for first time visitors. Stay away from the bike paths because they show no mercy and will yell if you invade their spaces so cross quickly if you dare! We would definitely go back and spend more time just to people watch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17kariw
40,Venice Beach is a Must,"Venice Beach should be on your agenda when you visit southern California. The weather is usually picture perfect and you can do a lot of different things. Walk along the beach and enjoy the water and the sand. They have paddle tennis, skateboarding, biking, rollerblading and shops. If you go on Saturday or Sunday you will certainly see some strange and interesting people. Whenever we have visiting guests my husband always takes them to Venice Beach to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457EstherK

50,Great for boogie boarding!,"Fun beach for boogie boarding. Decent waves, warm enough, lifeguards on duty. The shops along the boardwalk are fun...great people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauren1266
50,"Hot dogs, skaters, bikini babes, street performers and great shopping!","If you go to Los Angeles, don't miss out on the Venice Boardwalk. go early to find a parking space and have lunch at the Sidewalk Cafe for a ringside seat for the street performers and general all-around freak show. On the circle (formerly the swimming lagoon just east of Pacific you can enjoy a sushi happy hour at Hama Sushi, a local institution. it's about bars and the beach. Pick up plenty of cheap sarongs, incense and teeny little gifts to take back home. See the weight-lifters, dancers grab a duck sausage at Jody Maroni's -- awesome!! Also Daddy's dollar dogs or a clam pizza slice. I love Venice -- don't forget to stroll the restored canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizrae
50,When Amsterdam copies Los Angeles,Nice place to hang out and spend the day. Entertaining....Not so many great restaurants though. A lot of fast food on the beach side. For better food go to Washington Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoheilD
40,"Not good views, but so much to do!","This isn't a beach like Laguna beach. Laguna beach has rocks and nice scenery; however, Venice beach is not like that. It has a pier that you can walk on, but it doesn't have like an shops on the pier or anything. It's a plain pier. What made my experience amazing was how we rented bikes and rode bikes alllll across the beach. Literally so many people rollerblading, biking, skateboarding. It was so much fun. You can ride all the way down to the Santa Monica pier. Along the way is a muscle beach. That was my favorite part about the beach! A lot of people do the balance string and the hoop exercises and the bars. It's fascinating to watch. But really, if you go to this beach, rent a bike. You won't regret it! There's a boardwalk with a lot of shops for food, souvenirs, clothes. It was hard to find a good Venice shirt for me and my brother. The material in every shop wasn't what I liked. The graffiti part of the beach is my second favorite part. People were doing graffiti and it's just pure art. The view of the sand set with the palm trees is amazing. The beach itself is VERY clean and spotless. One of the cleanest beaches I've ever been to. They have a bathroom every half mile, so that was a plus. There's no homeless people sleeping around that I saw.. So that was even better. Overall, it's a great beach to do stuff, ride bikes and go to little shops with a good sunset and swim. But don't go if you're trying to get a good beach view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicale1
10,A place to be missed,"Venice Beach was one of the dirtiest, tackiest, places we have ever been to. The only positives waere the skateboarders.....if you could get across in front of cyclists who were exceedingly rude and impatient. The murals were ok, the rest if it,naive it a miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373bellar
50,The Freak Show At The Beach,Weeellll if watching people do strange things and see the latest is Hollywood weirdness is your thing. Then yes you must visit Venice Beach. And for all of you tourists yes this includes you - at least once I think.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarketingDiva
50,L.A. Beach Chic,"Nothing combines the laid back fun mix of Surfing, Skate Boarding, Rollerblading, Bicycling, Weightlifting, Bikini Watching and plain old relaxing on the beach and munching on a fabulous burger! This 10 block area is too cool for anyplace anywhere in the world except L.A. of course!Just walking around is an experience you will NEVER forget. On top of everything you have great tee shirt and souvenir shops as well as sidewalk performers that are SENSATIONAL!If you miss Venice Beach while in SoCal, you can't really say you've experienced L.A.Really!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SURFERDON
10,I suppose if you must,"I suppose if you must check it off your list of things to do/see in LA, it's barely worth a visit; ONCE!My personal impressions: Dirty, uninspiring, pitiful and otherwise grossly overrated. Frankly, I felt sorry for the human race upon visiting this otherwise 'land of the lunatic on the loose'!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HavePlanetWillTravel
50,Back in time,"Think 80's movies and rollerskating, I watched everyone and thing from the homeless to the regardless just doing their thing and it was a great mix of the have and have nots. Muscle beach was wicked and met a parkour champion, watched the skateboards rule and had a taco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LXO
50,"A true and unique experience in the world of shock, maybe not!","It does not matter how exceptionally different this place is from all other places, you still are a stone throw away from the pacific waters of the ocean, with the beautiful golden/ silver sands of its shores. That is if you get tired from the continues entertaining acts, people, naked bodies( not all the way, but almost) some of them are just beautiful and In shape too. The place is full of weirdos and artists, I don't know which one it has more of, but you be the judge. You will not be bored, and if you get tired from walking, stoping and walking, then you can grab a bite in what could be decent restaurants, with outside seating, right there toward the end of the walk heading north/West. There are stores, some have good stuff, some have stuff that is good for nothing,You decide. Great combo of the international flair of people from all over the world. Mostly people there are friendly and are there to have a good times. If you have your bathing suit and a towel, you should take a dip and soak in the California sun for a while. Just make sure you have a good sun screen, so you don't get burned, specially the kids. There are comedians there, Henna Artists, musicians, there is a muscle beach there with some very strong bodies working out. If you can have some one drop you off there, as parking is expensive, that is if you are early and find a spot. You can rent bikes if you want to take a nice ride along the coastal cities, or just stay in Venice and Santa Monica area. Don't be surprised if you smiled weed or some other smoke while you are walking. Its safe, police are on foot and on bikes, and hardly there an incident there during the day. You buy some California, Venice and Los Angeles shirts there for yourself or gifts.Have fun and stay safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684
50,Better than Disneyland,"You want to have a good time at the beach? Go to Venice. Muscle beach, basketball courts, sights and sounds you'll never forget.

20,VENICE BEACH IS....BORING!!!,"All the teenagers who visit us from Europe over here in LA say, ""We want to go to Venice Beach"". OK...I take 'em there. But, Venice Beach is only a blacktop ""bikeway"" that people skate on....and bicycle on....and walk on. There are some shops and restaurants...maybe a soft ice cream or hot dog place....some people play volley ball on the beach.....not very exciting....after your first visit it becomes BORING! Should YOU go there? Yesssssss.....go...just to satisfy your curiosity. Then try to find some ""real canals"" that still exist away from the beach over there! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824johnb
50,Best entertaining beach in Los Angeles,"I simply love Venice beach. Each time when I visit LA it's our favorite beach. You will not get bored since even for the off season the boardwalk is filled with entertainers making Venice beach a touted place.Just be careful from some of vendors who approached you with their CDs and want them to buy. If you are not interested simply move on like you don't speak English . Enjoy the beach and the entertainment it's a fun place to be and if you want to see the world pass by, just sit at a restaurant by the boardwalk and have a drink or a meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcj220
40,Like it or not a must see,Best time to visit is during the summer. The performers are something to seen - see freaky some with real talent you are the judge stop and enjoy a performance or walk on. The regulars are also charactrs no seen in many places-sometimes weird but always a talked about experience. All this uniquenes and it is free-unless you choose to contribute when the performers pass the hat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801alw

50,The delights of Venice Beach,"Summer or winter, thid is a great place to visit. If the weather is warm, wear your bathing suit and relax or play on the sand or enjoy the water. Terrific new playground for little kids, lots of shops and restaurants, big parking lots,, OK bathrooms.Summer Annd winter, walk on the boardwalk ( with your dog in the winter), view the many colorful artisans selling their wares, interesting shops, cheap sunglasses, watch musicians, roller skaters, tattoo artists. Much activity. Especially good breakfasts and lunch at Figtree Cafe Good yogurt parlor. Etc, etcMy favorite place to take tourists for a. So. CA experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanAda2015
50,Great Experience,"A great place to spend an afternoon, with a great variety of people. Walk by the boardwalk on the beach and see the most excéntrico personalities or go to Abbot Kinney for hipster gourmet local food . Great ambiance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrielaMedelllin
50,a nice warm water beach,"having lived in this area of LA a number of years ago I can remember the warm clear water,the nice sand and the boardwalk area. It had nice shops and places to eat and the burger places with grilled onions bring back a lot to me when I see this. I liked that you could drive up to the beach and the people would be skating and lifting weights and just having a good time. The waves were good and made for some great times.It was a bit away from Hollywood but with the new highways it is a lot faster now if you do not get int0 a traffic tie up. a great beach to go people watching as well as for swimming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn680
40,Fascinating but no shade,"This is one of those places that only comes alive in the afternoon.We arrived at 11 am and most of the sea front was quiet, although there was already a queue for the beach front car park.As the afternoon wears on, the various stall holders set up and more people, including the cyclists, skateboarders and roller skaters, start to take to the walkway.There's an eclectic mix of stalls, shops and food retailers and a wide range of people to watch.On the day we were there, filming for an advert was under way at the skate park, so we spent 10 minutes watching what was going on there.We walked the couple of miles to Santa Monica pier, but ended up getting sun burnt as the odd palm tree provides very little shade on a west facing promenade.About half way along the sea front of the town is Muscle Beach, although this is not the original location, you still get a flavour of the origin of the 80's fitness boom.The beach itself is like many of the beaches along this coast - long, wide, clean with lifeguards and restrooms at regular intervals.All in all, a must visit if you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmileyBean
50,Walk down The Promenade...Bring a Camera,There are a myriad of sights and sounds and characters at Venice Beach--especially along the promenade. Beautiful light sand beach as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakeTheHighRoad
40,Great for people-watching,"Venice is by no means my favorite area of LA, but it is an interesting place to kill a few hours in the afternoon. Going for lunch and an afternoon beer is a treat, as is timing your visit to end around sunset. You can walk down to the beach, relax, and watch the sun fade away.Be prepared for hoards of people, strange smells, grungy sidewalks and people asking for money or pressuring you to buy their street art. Everyone's friendly, by and large, though, so it's never really a bad time.This is certainly not a place to go if you're not in to eclectic people, places and things.If you're headed here for lunch, grab some food anywhere and then stop by the beer garden to enjoy a cold one and watch the people skate/bike/walk by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious1991

30,When in LA...,"You have to swing by the once most creative place in Los Angeles. Once the mecca of creativity, free spirits, ... It now seems to be overloaded with some quite extravagant homeless people. I think in general it's just something you have to see. Good to people watch and all in all it is a nice walk if you start from the Santa Monica pier. Just ignore crazies that come talk to you about the invasions and such :-).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375hansv
40,Great people watching,"I'd read the reviews so felt I was ready for any disappointment but ended up being pleasantly surprised. We hired bikes and rode from Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach and back. The people are weird and wonderful - arty types, skaters, stoners, street performers, fitness freaks, roller bladers, bikers - very diverse with a strong undertone of 'look at me'. We felt safe and highly entertained!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/582melissac
30,Worth seeing only once,"I put this with the red district in Amsterdam, canal street in New York ...... You get it...worth a one hour walk only in the day light. Do not use a bathroom or eat there. Catch breakfast at the Shutters in Santa Monica on the beach then walk toward Venice beach. Make sure to follow the map and walk thru the canals then back along main or Abbott Kinney. You can also rent a bike and do the same path but shopping would be a challenge without a bike lock. There are fun shops in Venice to wonder thru.So go to Venice but be smart about how you see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyF443
40,Very cool place on the Pacific coast,You can read in guides that this place is similar to Italian Venice. It is not true. But nevertheless it is a great sample of different California. Make sense to spend 2-3 hours and enjoy very special atmosphere!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lubomird839
20,A bit of a let down,"Of course, like everyone else, I thought this area was iconic for suntanned girls on roller skates, body building on the beach and the fashionable and colourful young residents of LA. What I got was drug addicts, homeless, graffiti, crap shops selling tourist tat and a scruffy town that seemed to be dying on its feet. Sorry folks, that's really how it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedroingandia
40,Bike riding fun,"Rented bikes in Santa Monica and rode to Venice beach and back. Easy ride, all concrete and flat. Good for families. Great views of the beach and lots of crazy people. What you would expect in LA. Rented bikes on 4th St in Santa Monica for $15 each for the day. Only issues renting off the beach is riding on the city streets for a few blocks but beach rental spots get $8/hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmyB726
30,What?,"Ok so let me start by saying I have been to Many places...and I have NEVER seen anything like this beach!! Venus is absolutely a crazy experience. its a great place to people watch...from interesting, to scary to funny to entertaining. The spectrum is amazing. However I don;'t think I would bring my kids...some of the things we saw we can't un-see!! The overwhelming smell of POT is at times too much to handle. I felt high just walking on the boardwalk. interestingly enough they sold POT right on the boardwalk in many green stores with the leaf on the sign hey called in ""Medical marijuana"" however EVERYONE on the pier was openly smoking it...ato any of the craziness of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitaa69
20,I don't get it.,Overrated. I don't understand what the attraction is. It's not even a nice beach? The shops are overpriced and you are constantly harassed by random people. Not the type of thing you'd expect in a first world country anyway...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InfinityandBeyond86

30,Venice In n Out,"The most famous/infamous Venice Beach is a landmark spot when it comes to beaches, but not when it comes to how clean and enjoyable the beach is. Lots of people, drum circles and musicians everywhere, and sure couple of places to see and grab food/drink from but if you're after nice swim/surf/beach look in Santa Monica/Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomasawyer

20,"Dirty, homeless, waste of time.","We have been wanting to visit for a while now and we had time to go one morning at about 11.00 am. Many of the stalls where just setting up and the homeless were just starting to wake up. This area is filthy dirty, with filthy dirty people everywhere, there is nothing nice about this area. All the shops are the same Tshirts and some souvenirs and that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misspiggy21
10,Venice down the tubes,"I have watched Venice go down the tubes year by year.more and more gang members hang out at the beach, drug addicts andbums, who harass people. crowded beaches and bike paths, and peoplesleeping on the streets all over Venice and nothing can be done about it.A lovely place has gone down hill and the home owners and store ownershave to pay the price with crime. I wouldn't tell my friends to come here. sorryfor the review but it's the truth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glassartist4

50,I love Venice Beach,"Venice Beach is so interesting. There are so many sights to see, things to buy and food to eat. There is a very interesting mix of people at Venice Beach. Most of the action is on the boardwalk. There are souvenir shops that sell t-shirts , hats sunglasses, key chains and many other reminders of your trip to Venice Beach. You may catch a basketball game or raw talent singing or rapping on the beach. There is a section called muscle beach where the bodybuilders show off their muscles. Or you can just lie on the beach and tan if that is what you like. There is always music somewhere and people walking their dogs. There was a carnival there the day I was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/671vagirl
50,Wonderful,Wonderful beach. We rented bikes and took a nice tour. The toilets are nice and clean and there was always paper available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annelT3063JE
30,Not bad,"Not the prettiest beach, it's pretty dirty, and there are alot of tents or sleeping bags of the homeless people who live there..but the homeless people seems to be nice and friendly:) stores are not selling anything interesting, beachy cheap merchandises mostly..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iren2012
50,America's Quirkiest Beaches,This is the Greenwich Village of Beaches.

40,Great Views and Very Interesting,"Went to the beach and enjoyed this. This is where Muscle Beach is and it was fascinating. Saw some good body builders. The beach walk is the same as all tourist beaches with the usual shops selling the expensive t-shirts etc. I have never seen so many ""Green Doctors"" shops. The pier is good for fishing and walking. They have a bike path all along the beach which is nice. A skateboard park is great. Great sand and surfing. Lots of eats and views. Did not go back into the town as had no extra time but it looked as though it might have offerings. Next time for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimK751

40,All good on Venice Beach,"A great spot for swimming, surfing, people watching. Basically anything goes here. There is more footfall on Venice beach than at Disney apparently. Check out Muscle Beach there's lots to see there andIt's of local entertainment along the promenade. Great cycle track too. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paula_Dublin_Ireland

30,Nice beach to swim.,"Came as a tourist and definitely got that Cali feel with surfers, rollerbladers, the tall palm trees and the lifeguards stations that reminded me of a bay watch episode. The beach was clean and the ocean was cool and nice to swim in. My kids enjoyed wave jumping. I enjoyed laying in the cool sand, with a nice breeze and just hearing the waves crash. The boardwalk is definitely good for people watching, all types of things to see. Nothing really extravagant. The food wasn't too pricey either. Bathrooms were disgusting, but it's a public beach what do you expect. Spent $20 on parking, but it was extremely close to the Boardwalk so I didn't mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_Montanez

It exemplifies freestyle California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phins_Up_Quincy

50,Business and fun,"From Ohio to LA, I was lucky to by sent to a work conference. I brought my daughter and her friend and mom. I felt guilty for having so much fun for a work trip. We had a free day and went from downtown where we were staying to Venice beach. It was a fun place to just people watch. It is everything you see on TV with bikers skateboarders sun bathers basket ball players and all that. The beach is clean and beautiful especially by the pier. I thought the boardwalk would be wider but still cool. It was hilarious to see a row of souvenir shops and then all the sudden you see a marijuana paraphernalia shop and a doctors office next to it card ""the weed doctor."" That is not something you see in Ohio so it was pretty funny. It was just a different kind of experience. I recommend not going at night because it's a little shady in the evening. Don't use a taxi. It cost $23 for a 2 mile taxi ride. From that point on we used UBER. We went 15 miles for $15. Awesome service. Taxi service is a rip off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimnjdy

50,Great place to visit,"The boardwalk is fun, lots of places to shop and eat. The beach is beautiful! I really enjoyed the scenery and the characters here. The weather was gorgeous. There is lots of space to ride a bike, roller blade, skate board, etc. or you can just enjoy laying on the beach, or just people watch from the boardwalk. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2bostons2ppl
40,Colorful and entertaining beach,The beach is expansive and in the Summer months you can actually go in without a wetsuit. I did - and I'm used to Florida beaches. There is the famous muscle beach and the boardwalk with all its characters. But the home nearby - and Abbot Kinney rd is not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartl780
40,Great Beach,"Nice place to hang out, lots of space on the sandy beach...big waves for surfing. The kids had fun. We were there at the end of June and the temperature was just great for beach time. We found a place to eat but there is not many places to sit. Overall we can say it was a nice and warm afternoon at Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nath67
30,Nothing special during the day and sketchy by night,My bf and I went to LA for the first time so of course we wanted to hit up the beach. Everyone we talked to recommended Venice beach. Well to be honest we were disappointed. During the day it was nothing special and at night it's sketchy so lock your doors and walk fast to where you are headed. The lack of facilities was discouraging. The ones they had smelled awful and were disgusting. The ocean was nice but found it to be very weedy near shore. We kept getting tangled in them for standing in the ocean where the waves were. But it's a beach.. I've been to a lot better. Parking is pricey in my opinion for $17 a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SolangeC
50,Not only beach but also walking way of the beach is full of fun,"Beach is nice, cool waters of pacific ocean and sandy, life guards are imprevise butReal fun is on the walking way, shows, dance, souvenir and art pieces, musicians all likeLife circus, if you like to watch people it is a real fun to be there.You may see police in every corner all around the beach, polices with horses are kind of show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aydinkerim

40,Unique,"Been here a few times when visiting. I love to walk up and down the boardwalk and just people watch. There is a lot of things to see, and eat. Big fan of the movie, white men can't jump, so I got to play some hoops on the courts. It's a unique place and never really know what you'll see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wvu1bub
40,"Collection of Colorful Characters, Endless Beach and Action","If you are into people watching this place is a must see!

20,No longer quirky,"My teenage daughter wanted to see Venice Beach as she had heard of it and we had told her that it was interesting and a bit quirky. Well, no longer. The boardwalk is now just t-shirt shops and ""medical"" marijuana clinics. Many, many homeless people and less than savory characters. It has become just plain seedy and has lost its charm. Still a couple of artists and street performers, but not very many. Very disappointed that we wasted our valuable time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveldiveski

10,Don't waste your time,"I walked the pedestrian path between the Venice pier and the beginning Santa Monica beach and was totally disgusted. It is filthy dirty and a bit scary. Lots of pot and tattoo shops! Maybe if you were down close to the water is would be nice, but definitely NOT going back! This is NOT a place to take your kids for ice cream!! Also bathrooms were dirty and smelly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaGB
20,Not a very nice place,"The beach is nice but the rest of the area is not nice at all. Lots of elements walking around, litter on the ground. People sleep here and the area is run down.

50,Clean and well maintained,"I visited in January when it was probably too cold for the locals, but being from Canada I was happy to be able to walk barefoot in the sand.. and even dip my toes in the ocean... :) The beach itself was pretty empty, not too many people around, but it was clean and well maintained. I especially liked the colourful rocks littering the beach.. I brought some home for my child who was unable to travel with me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynds_x

40,What a place to people watch!,"I have visited this place many times and each time is a true joy. Grab a seat and have a cold one and what all the different types of people. They are roller blading, working out, providing entertainment for coins, etc. There are numerous shops and restaurants along the strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veturpin
30,Interesting...,"Venice/ Muscle beach is one of those places you just have to go to once in your life! However, once I think is all I can handle. Between the medical marijuana shops and the general crowd you can get a little intimidated. I wouldn't suggest it for families however maybe as a young couple it could be fun. It's just very dirty and dingy and watch out for the people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camillec30
50,Time Warp!,"Heard so much about it, you have to see it yourself! Lots of health conscious people cycling, running, boarding, skating, even Segway riders (although we thought they were banned on here!). Full of graffitti, hippies, market stalls selling all manner of hippie/holistic wares. Lots of homeless and spaced out people, so attention needs to be taken. Plenty of cafes, bars, restaurants along the promenade to take in the spectacles and public toilets, we were daren't try!! We walked from Santa Monica to the Pier. It was certainly a memorable promenade!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patbean
50,Sand and surf,"The beach was perfect. Plenty of room for fun to be had by all. Rented a boogie board for my son, very reasonably priced. I also thought $9 was a reasonable price for parking. We didn't get to walk down to the boardwalk due to time constraints. I recommend planning several hours/all day for this activity. The restrooms here were not as nice as at Santa Monica, but sufficient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4981IFmichellel
50,Iconic,"Not quite one of the wonders of the modern world but absolutely worth the visit. If your anywhere near LA Venice Beach is a must visit.One of the best people watching spots in the world. You can be as active or as relaxed and lazy as you want. Surfing,Cycling,Tennis,Skateboarding,Jogging, Beach Volleyball to name but a few. Me? A cool beer at one of the many cafe/restaurants that fringe the beach and watch the action pass me by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herefo

50,Lovely Venice Beach,"Recently returned from the states and drove to LA from Anahiem. We managed to park right on the beach front in between Santa Monica Pier and Venice beach. $10 all day parking. We walked from Santa Monica Pier and back. So much to look at. The walk took about 30minutes. We sat and watched all the kids at the Skate Park, watched the boys pumping iron, watched some form of miniature tennis grabbed a coffee and just sat and watched the boys on the basketball court, which our son loved. And don't forget all of the stalls you can brouse through. Casually wandering back up to Santa Monica Pier but didn't think much of the amusement area. Walked down to the end of the pier where everyone was fishing and saw a seal waiting for someone to throw him a fish poor seal. A very enjoyable morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoH852
40,"Sun, Fun , Beach , nice people",I would always come back to venice Beach . It had an great impact to me. The Artists in the street and acrobatic acts made it very lively. I really liked the beach. You can either watch the surfers or jump in the big waves. Just strolling tbrough the Street is very entertaining and joyable. There is no much more to tell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522gabrieled
30,"My sons loved it, I thought it was kinda funky and dirty","I would have probably loved it in my twenties, but the day we were there (in July 2014) it was just dirty and crowded and full of people that were just too questionable. Don't go there alone or use the public restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califdrm
30,"Quirky, not what I expected",Definitely a lively place with lots of people but at the same time full of tacky little shops selling tourist tat and the famous outdoor gyms really weren't much to see (not being a big gyms fan or anything). Glad to have seen the place but I don't think I'd go back; I much prefer the areas a bit inland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timg395
10,"Huge, Huge Disappointment!","We were visiting the Disney parks and decided to take a restful beach day, so we drove to Venice Beach. The beach itself was fine. There were lifeguards, the sand was great for building sandcastles, and it was relatively clean. The kids jumped the waves and braved the 68 degree water. Then we went to the boardwalk and were shocked at how dirty, unmaintained, and seedy it is! The small stores sell cheap knockoffs, T-shirts with inappropriate messages, and lots of drug paraphernalia. The bathrooms are filthy. The grounds are dirty and unmaintained. Officers on horseback try to police the homeless. The pier was dirty with fish guts and bird droppings. There is a kids play area, basketball courts, and the famous Muscle Beach with a few guys pumping iron. We were expecting ice cream and snow cone shops, people roller skating, families walking along the boardwalk. Instead, it was mostly creepy adults just hanging around. There was no parking except for the pay lots. We paid $9 to park to swim, then drove towards the boardwalk area and had to pay another $9. Stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AreWeHavingFunYet
40,"Funky, weird, and slightly sketchy Venice Beach","We stayed one night in Venice Beach (Venice Beach Suites and Hotel). Loved the hotel. Venice Beach is a must see when visiting LA. There is a lot of humanity. Street performers, people selling handmade items, very cool street art, and a lot of homeless people. We were never approached for money; life there is copacetic...it's sun, sand, and beautiful weather. We ate dinner at Larry's and breakfast at Fig Tree Cafe. Recommend both places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizdowning
50,Happening beach with a overload of holiday vibe,There's something about this beach that relaxes you and calms your mind. Planning to get back again for a longer stay. Definitely worth the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scraja
40,"Great tourist trap, worth a visit.","Venice Beach is as advertised, a prime tourist trap. There are all the usual t-shirt shops, scam artists, nut jobs. Plenty to look at, plenty to see. Bargain bargain bargain on the t-shirts, you'll get abused sometimes, but you'll get a cheaper cheap t-shirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiBobCambodia
10,Bad introduction to first holiday in LA,"Venice beach was nice,street performers were awesome,people overall in the states were so hospitable,just the custom shirt store ripped us off $140USD for 3 sovernier shirts,couldn't beleive it,and as it was our 1st trip to Venice Beach I would definitely recommend to shop at marked price stores,Disney and Universal Studios didn't even cost that expensive,when people like this take advantage of tourist it makes u not want to revisit the area again,this experience really ruined our holiday,as well I will inform my family and friend to avoid these kinds of stores",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonnyr867
40,Stunning,Besides the lovely beach and the shops and restaurants take a drive into the suburb and see the canals that are built to look just like the ones in Venice Italy. We only spent a morning here but enjoyed it very much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SA_Girl2014
40,What a fun beach,A fun place to people watch. A lot of tourist shops with tons of fun stuff to buy. Too bad I didn't have more room in my luggage to buy more stuff. A lot of public restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulY739
40,"Eclectic, lively, seedy",Venice Beach is a must see while your in California. The people are very interesting and the boardwalk is fun to walk or bike for miles. The amount of people sleeping on the beach takes a bit to get used to but we didn't have any trouble while we were there. I would stay in Santa Monica near the pier and then bike down to Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LonePalm07
30,Nice beach,"This was a very nice beach. There was minimal parking, but we were lucky to find a space. The bathrooms, however, were horrible. Don't use them unless absolutely necessary. Also, along the boardwalk area were many sites to see. All kinds of people selling many different things. Not a very clean area there but different none the less. The beach was beautiful. You could see the mountains and hills of California and the waves were great! Great for a 2-3 hour visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dm670
20,Venice Beach,"Like many other places where lots of tourist go, Full of t-shirts, hats, souvenirs that you don't really need. There are some bits of street art from time to time which have crowds watching but it's really just a tourist boardwalk with nothing much to see. May be if it had been a sunny day we'd have felt different about it, but not a place to hang out in later in the evening. Lots of police on horseback around, even during the day. Nicer places to go along the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLSE2
20,I Was Shocked,"I was anxious to see the Pacific Ocean but made a poor choice in going to Venice Beach. I did not know that pot was legal in California and was surprised that there were these ""Green Doctors"" that would call out to you and ask if you had any problems right down to a headache. They said they could write a prescription to get pot. It was evident that the people there were all smoking pot and doing other drugs. There were hustlers trying to get you to give them money for listening to their CD's. As for the ""Muscle Beach"", there were about 2 people there. My daughter-in-law was walking on the beach and came across an opened knife resembling a switchblade. This was my first and last trip to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattiM898
50,Great Vibe,"A great place to spend time at the beach or cycle the bike path,even though it can be a bit crowded high season.You name it everything can be rented or bought close at hand,food ,beachwear,bikes etc .If you come by car there is heaps of cheap ($5 per day) public car parking close and handy .I found the area to be well maintained and clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354phillipr
20,Pros and Cons,"Venice Beach - A mythical place that only existed in my TV until this trip. We were taken here as a part of a 'We Love LA Tour"" … To our surprise we were inundated with smells of marijuana, buskers pleading for a tip, homeless boozing it up and passing out on the side of the boardwalk and the worlds most self indulged people putting on a gun show at muscle beach. Great to take it all in and laugh at how these people actually get about their days, entertaining and ever so needed to see however I would not recommend staying in this area of LA … just a few miles up Santa Monica provides similar yet less obscene people, and a much more relaxed and not so in your face type of boardwalk to enjoy.The thing I did enjoy was see in how the youths of the neighbourhood were all together and doing street performances that were actually good and getting the crowds involved without forcing them to tip or donate any money, aswell as seeing a local basketball comp and the local kids down at the skate park.For sure hire a bike and do part of the 26 mile ride through Venice Beach… Take it all in but don't get sucked into the scummy side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386nikb
50,Crazy! 😊😊,"It's another world,full of people that enjoy time on the ocean, u can see here the muscle beach,take a swim on the ocean , Walk down the palms and take shopping in a lot ok kind of shops,and meet wonderful and excentric people.i like a lot this place,in some part u have a sensation to back at the 70'...nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barzakan

40,Beautiful place to watch the sunset,"I hit Venice Beach after Santa Monica and prefered Venice. It was less crowded, and the view was beautiful. I'm sure there were lots of tourists there, but it felt less touristy than Santa Monica. Lots of restaurants and some shops to wander in after the beach. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2FarAwayLands0
50,Very fun and exciting,"We spent hours here and didn't even get in the water. There was so many talented people dancing , playing piano , etc for entertainment as well as shops. It was beautiful to see so many people that were out to have a good time in the nice weather. There were quite a few restaurants to choose from as well as concessions along the path way. We walked from Venice all the way to Santa Monica beach. You don't realize how much you have walked with all the scenery. There are plenty different bikes and motor pads to rent to get around. If your healthy and love views I suggest walking it to not miss anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fefe019
40,Nice Beach,"The beach is rather nice, obviously famous, something I wanted to see because it's famous but you wouldn't want to be there at night as there are alot of homeless people and beggars hanging out, as well as alot of illegal activities, but was nice to visit in the daylight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Habs24_68
30,Dirty,"I was really disappointed with Venice beach. If you're not doing drugs, covered in tattoos, and on a skate board, be prepared to feel out of place. cheesy boardwalk stores. everything just seemed grimy and dirty to me.

50,Great day at the beach on foot or by bike,"We really enjoyed our day at Venice Beach, lots interesting sites and people of all shapes, sizes and, well, smells... The beach itself is very wide so there was lots of room to relax. Waves were a tad too strong the day of our visit but we did some body surfing just the same.

20,Wow so sad,"Venice Beach city is dirty, seedy and over priced.We were there for a birthday weekend celebration and I guess it's geared for a younger hipper crowd (if it's hip to support a druggy environment). I know it's California but still. I wouldn't bring a young family here for vacation. Go south to Orange County cities, a much cleaner environment.The only reason it gets 2 stars is that beach is well maintained and clean.We stayed at a very nice hotel with a beautiful ocean view that is ruined by the garbage around the boardwalk stores surrounding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmnpoore

20,not great at all,"My husband and I went there right after landing. The beaches were clean, but water was stinky and dark and cold.

50,Loved the ambiance,"I had a great time walking around Venice beach. My advice is to drive to Santa Monica Pier and park there in the morning. Traipse around Santa Monica Pier and either hire a bike or walk to Venice Beach. Enjoy the view and the sights; but don't forget to wear sunscreen and a hat - the sun was piercing when we went.There are a lot of tacky souvenir shops along Venice Beach, but you can easily avoid this strip if you stick to walking on the beach.One thing I felt overwhelmed with was the smell of mull in the air.

20,Quintessential SoCal Beach Vibe,"Had some time to kill before our flight and I wanted to show my daughter's college roommate from NY what a SoCal beach is like. Maybe it was the fact I could not find a place to park got me off to a bad start. All the beach parking was full on a midweek day, mid-afternoon in the summer. I drove aimlessly for quite some time before deciding to park quite a ways away on Washington.The beach is nice, what's around the beach is not so nice. A lot of cheesy, cheap shops selling t-shirts and other worthless merchandise. Many marijuana shops selling 420 cards. Lot of people hustling for a sale. There is a lot to see, but the shops are all pretty much the same...t-shirts, marijuana cards, marijuana paraphernalia, tattoo/piercings and snack foods. There are also a number of homeless people ""working"" for spare change. Muscle Beach is cool. Watching some pickup basketball and paddleball is somewhat interesting. Maybe a long time ago, this was my scene, but not today. My favorite park of the visit was watching the street vendor cut up fruit to sell for guests. No one may ever notice, but he was great with a knife. The family was in some t-shirt shop and I waited outside. I watched this guy for 15 minutes cut up fruit to sell. Bravo fruit cutting / selling guy. Best part of my trip to Venice Beach...maybe the contact high was a close second.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eric95403
40,Iconic LA beach,"Venice Beach has become an iconic location for LA sight seeing and probably worth it. It is true that you see 'everything' on this beach and mostly the strand. Be advised that 'everything' is true. If you are alittle sensitive to the out of the ordinary then I'd steer clear but I always enjoy a trip to this beach. It's also perfect for inexpensive beachware shopping. Parking is a challeng though,be warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyQM

50,"Great beach, laid back people, cool place to chill!","What's not to love about Venice Beach!! It is not only iconic from movies, but everyone is so friendly and laid back. The sunset here is just phenomenal. Breathtaking!!It was an awesome sight to see everyone being in their moment, soaking in all that energizing sunshine, while maintaining a healthy lifestyle (biking, running and walking). I finally got to see Muscle Beach, but there were hardly anyone working out because the sun was going down. There were also lots of new constructions going up, and looking at the signs, a handful of the condos were up for grabs as a vacation rental, right on the beach. There are plenty of food vendors on the beach (mostly small business owners), and a few souvenir shops. Surfing lessons are provided here, bikes as well as rental of skates.I believe the attraction to Venice Beach is the laid back lifestyle, friendly locals, free access to an outdoor gym, basketball courts, skates, and best of all, the view and the all year round pleasant weather!Until then, Cheers! ~ :p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwin_sfbay

You will see all kinds of people so it is a great place to people watch. Overall, it has, what I would consider, a hippie vibe. There are also many artists selling their creations.

Closer to the beach is an area where graffiti artist are allowed to paint on walls. Very intresting to watch them in action",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KRAtlanta

30,It's a beach like plenty others.,"If you've seen any movies with the famous boardwalk, it's pretty much it. Cheap shops with cheap products and lots of people pushing you their mixtapes.

30,Not the best beach in California,"Visited Venice beach in October. It was not overwhelming. There were people everywhere, and compared to the beaches in San Diego, it was quit hectic. The shore itself was lovely with California waves and sand, but I don't think I would've liked to visit this beach all by myself. There were different kinds of people at Venice beach. One man asked me if I wanted a bundle, and another man I believe tried to steal my purse, Therefore I strongly recommend that you watch your back at this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieh828

You pass by incredibly beautiful homes that have such character they make the ride that much more of an adventure. The homeless people who make their home for the day along this strand add color and life while playing music, doing acrobatics for $, selling trinkets, to creative signs for begging. Seriously ALL walks of life take over this small area. As well the street, Abbot Kinney has some of the most delish restaurants to try.

40,Mixed review of the area.,"So we all seen Venice Beach on TV and in movies. In person it's just like you've seen except the dirty side. The beach is long, wide, flat and beautiful. There is a cement path for bikes and skaters to travel and a wide sidewalk that is located next to the shops and restaurants. You'll find many shops for t-shirts, sunglasses and souvenirs. There are smoke shops and medical marijuana doctor offices. A few art shops and convenient stores. Most food is quick grab fast food. There are some sit down restaurants too. On the beach side of the walk path are local vendors selling everything from jewelry to art. Venice is famous for it's athletic lifestyle. The bodybuilders workout in a open air gym. There are basketball courts, volleyball courts and small tennis courts. It was enjoyable to see people using these facilities. The people in the area was locals, many tourist and a large amount of homeless. During the day, the area seemed very safe. Police on horseback monitored the premises. Suggestions are made to not leave anything visible in your car. There are signs that say ""hide it, lock it, keep it"". If you're not using the beach/ocean you can see Venice Beach in 30-45 minutes. Younger adults would probably find Venice very exciting. You can park in a pay lot at the beach or drive the streets looking for a meter. I'm glad I went, the beach is beautiful...everything else not so pretty but fun. I probably wouldn't return to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sightseesylviaP
20,"Iconic, but leave before it gets dark.","While many stories have been written about the famous beach, unless you want to see the underworld of beaches, best to go somewhere.

50,Cool experience!,We visited with our two teenagers and rented bikes to ride along the boardwalk. We only had a short time there and wished we had planned a longer stay. There were shops and restaurants along the shore and many interesting characters. It looked like a fun place to hang out. The skate park on the beach was very cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjre
30,"Nice, but Not the Best","Venice is your typical So. Cal. beach. Parking is an issue, you have to park in the adjacent lot because there are very few street parking spots available. No bathrooms nearby, you have to walk a ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoofamily

It gets quite crowded on the weekends but that is part of the fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
30,I want to bathe after I leave Venice Beach....,"Once is enough for a visit here. If you like cheesy merchandise, people watching (free to be you and me), human obstacle course walking down boardwalk, and skin which should not be broadcasted, then you will have fun. I have been there numerous times and feel as though once was enough. However, I do recommend the uniqueness of the muscle beach area, skateboarding park and some events which present themselves at various times. My bottom line suggestion is to go once for the experience and then find other places to enjoy the California Vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robin136
20,A once and done spot!,Since I have never been to Venice Beach... needed to knock it off the bucket list. The most enjoyable part of Venice Beach was watching the pickup games. Basketball and handball courts. Stopped and took some photos of muscle beach workout area. Of course it was locked and stored away. I suggest never using the public restrooms. They do not do a great job of controlling their homeless. And every stale was occupied by homeless. I went to a bar and bought beers just to use a clean restroom. There are some great artist out there. Overall not a place for young children. And if you are into see a melting pot of people. This is your place... would like the city to put forth more on cleaning it up. A once and done for most!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erick334
50,Venice it is!!,"If you pick one beach in LA, then Venice it is!!Spectacular view of the ocean. It is not crowded by small shops or amusement park rides like Santa Monica beach. It tries to keep the beach flavor as is! The beach boardwalk is very long and a very spectacular one. If you are looking for a soothing beach experience, then Venice it is!Also, the restaurants and shops near the beach is much more cozy. Parking is available on the street as well as near the board -walk. It is on-premise restroom, which was surprisingly clean.We went there after 5pm and people were surfing and swimming. A very good family beach to take the kids as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LazzyyTraveler

40,Did I step on a branch or is that a dreadlock?,"The boardwalk is a good place to see a different type of society. If you're used to more cosmopolitan areas or conservative areas this may come as a shock as it did to my mother. The area is VERY crunchy, every place smells faintly of patchouli, and of the 45000 or so homeless that call Los Angeles their home, I'd estimate 20000 live in Venice alone (with the rest in downtown.) While I wouldn't want to call it my home (because parking is, like, the WORST!) I LOVE walking around here.

40,Very interesting place - don't go with family at night though,"This was quite the interesting walk. In the morning, we walked from the Santa Monica area - about a 20 minute walk from the pier to the start of Venice Beach. Almost everything was still closed at that point - around 8:30 a.m. There were a ton of apparently homeless people around gathering in small groups. Could be a little intimidating, though no one bothered us at all. There was a huge group of maintenance people working their way through the street, washing the streets, picking up trash, emptying the trash cans, etc. - don't know if they do this every day, but they clearly were making a huge effort to make the place clean.Came back in the middle of the afternoon with our teenagers and it was full of life. Tons of small stands with people selling artwork, henna tatoos, jewelry, etc. with a bunch of small, more permanent, shops on the other side. A lot of the stuff for sale was kind of crappy, but still interesting to see.There were several musical groups playing on the street, a few acrobatic-type performers, a clown making balloon animals, etc. We didn't try any of the restaurants but there was quite a variety of spots - some more traditional sit-down spots and a ton of food trucks and stands.There's a parking lot right at the end of Rose Street that's at the northern end of the main strip. We did not park here and not sure what it costs. We parked about 1/2 mile north of there closer to Santa Monica for $8. There are a bunch of public restrooms all along the beach walk, which is very nice.I wouldn't come here at night as it definitely had a seedy feel to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilaoc
40,Fun stroll by the sea,"Always a request from out of town guests. A fun place to stroll by the beautiful Pacific Ocean with other people fun to watch.

Parking can be a challenge.l",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabbyCalifornia
20,Not very clean.,When visiting Venice Beach we were anticipating a great beach with many things to do. We were very disappointed. The shops were manned by very shady tipes and we did not at all feel very safe. Police cars were driving up and down and looking out for trouble makers. The best thing to do art Venice beach is people watching. Just because you see the weirdest individuals on earth. Unbelievably tattoos an piercings never to be seen again. The bad side was the litter blowing around in the light breeze. It is actually filthy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanC710
30,Worth a quick walk but don't make eye contact.,"It had been a really long time since we strolled along the ocean front. We seemed to remember all the odd people and performers.

It's worth a quick stroll, but leave the kids at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samndjsdad

30,The Venice Beach freak show,"Venice is, well,...unique. It is a mix of tourists, people out clubbing, meth heads, burn outs, and more types of people than you can imagine. I think it is somewhere you need to go see if you are nearby, and keep in mind that the make up of the crowd changes over the course of the day, but Santa Monica is much nicerI will say this, you need to go up and check out muscle beach.

There was also a basketball game going on at the court (Hello- White Men Can't Jump). There was also a playground kids could play at. If you are into skateboarding, there was a skate park. There were lots of shops on the Boardwalk selling t-shirts and other souvenirs. There were also Medical Marijuana Clinics.

30,A different beach right near Santa Monica Pier,"Came out here when I visited my cousin for his wedding. Had heard a lot about Venice Beach from my cousins and the Travel Channel. The beach was a good distance to the water. The board walk was long and had many unique shops featuring people of various cultures as well. Shops were more pricy as were the t shirt shops that you find on East Coast beaches. I realize cost of living is higher here thus the higher prices. There was a place that rented chairs, umbrellas , etc. that was resonable for beach rental items.The beach was clean and sand was nice,. There was an ""artsy"" atmosphere there if you like that type of atmosphere. It is very close to the Santa Monica Beach and Pier which seemed more family friendly. So it depends on what you want when it comes to a beach. Muscle beach where Arnold Schwartnegger got his start is right adjacent.If you are out this way come see for yourself.

30,Average beach/boardwalk,"This was a fun, upbeat, trendy location. Lot's of places to eat and things to do. You can shop, eat, drink, play volleyball, rent a bike or skateboard, watch the street performers, and various other things. We had plenty to keep us busy.The weather was nice and cool and we were visiting from North Carolina where it was 90's, so this was a nice break. The water was definitely too cold to swim in, but it was good enough to put our feet in.There were a lot of homeless people and people on drugs. Everywhere we went were people with signs asking in various ways for money. The homeless were using the showers and bathrooms, which is fine, but it made for some really smelly areas that I wish we hadn't had to use. There were a lot of dogs loose too. It seemed most of the homeless had dogs and none of them were on leashes.The shopping and restaurants and such were pretty typical of this type of area, but I've never seen homeless people basically taking over a tourist area like this. It could make it a somewhat sad place to visit if you dwell on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyjg
40,Popular tourist spot,This place is good for people watching and for enjoying the beach front scenery. The shops are tacky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlanetOz
40,Eclectic vibes,"This is not your average beach. We live in NJ and are used to board walks, rides and games. The street performers bring this place to life. They are funny and really get a crowd engaged. The downside, is there are a lot of homeless in the area. They don't bother folks, but it's a shame to see the great number of homeless/runaways in the area. We enjoyed going to muscle beach, even doing a few exercises, rope climbs while we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamieshearr
40,You need to experience this at least once!,"Venice Beach is such a contrast to the Santa Monica area. It is sleazy but in an interesting way. Muscle Beach is fascinating to observe. The kids playground is pretty nice. The bike path is great. But, the best part is watching the people...eclectic is an under statement! Beware, though-bathrooms are really gross.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seaski42
20,"Not clean, suspect individuals and stinky",I had heard great things about the famous Venice beach but was unimpressed with my visit there. The beach was dirty and stinky. Parking is horrendous and there are some people lurking around that I would not have felt safe by myself. It was fun watching the surfers as there's a pretty good surf there. The medicinal marijuana peddlers are continually accosting you on the boardwalk. There are much nicer beaches in the area. Don't waste your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krism984
30,Fun Way to Spend a Few Hours,"The variety of shops and kicks makes this a cool while in LA. The people watching is second to none!! Be sure to get some street food, and watch a hoop game and check out Muscle Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Largenoggin69
30,Would not advise going.,"Venice beach has always been sketchy. I don't go anymore. Tourists love it, but the water is dirty, the beach is gross, & some of the people who inhabit it are less than desirable. I'm from L.A. & just don't recommend wasting your time there. Go to Santa Barbara or Manhattan Beach instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh
20,Did not feel safe,"There are lots of recreational activities here and lots of shops. Not a bad beach, however be careful of the criminals lurking around. You have to be very careful. I almost got robbed when I was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simone1019
40,The eclectic California way ...,"Here we have it all: sun, ocean, enormous beach, outdoor gym, surf, bicycles rent, hiking path, skateboard park, all kind of foods, buff guys walking around, ultra-tattooed people, boardwalk, music, medical marijuana prescriptions, homeless people, cheap souvenirs, unique stores, police station, art displays and fascinating entertainers ... everything that you want or not!It's basically a carnival street/beach with a proper atmosphere and unique people. No need to be sacred because everyone is well accepted here; is well secure and clean even though there are many homeless people.Never the less this is a strange and beautiful place with the more eclectic group of people that I've ever saw in my life.Hike or rent a bicycle and ride about 3 miles from Santa Monica to Venice Beach is a great options and a way to spend a sunny breezy afternoon.In Venice there is always something interesting happening to talk about with friends and family.What a blast! ... Worth a visit. Recommended spot during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coutito
40,Sun and surf,"Nice clean beach with many surfers around. Also attached is a small market area for local shopping and a small play area for kids, with swings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deejay90210
50,A real atmosphere to enjoy and be part of,"Now this was great a few hours walking along the beach and enjoying the sights. So much to enjoy, the people, the shops, the music and the entertainment. It was nice to sit eat,drink and just look at the world at Venice Beach go by. Glad we decided to spend some time there. Bus down to Santa Monica and a walk along to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299bethm
40,Walked the pier,"We got there in the evening, around dusk. Didn't see all the ""weirdness"" we were thinking we'd find, but watched people fish off the pier, saw someone catch a big lobster, saw a seal, and had a good time talking to people. We'd like to come back sometime when we can see the street acts, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoingForCoffee
40,At the Beach!,Part of a great beach-front walk and an interesting stopping point to revive. Beach entertainment to watch and generally a great people-watching spot. Bus out or just keep walking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuDooNZ
30,Fun and gritty.,Just the right amount of grit remains to make this one of the last true beach communities in SoCal. Eccentric shops and eateries give way to dudes who have not bathed outside the ocean in weeks. A cool spot to imagine where the shot several films in the 50's including Welle's Touch of Evil.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBuksh
40,Wonderful:),"Want to see all LA has to offer while staying on the beach? Venice is a great choice!! We toured all over (Hollywood, San Fernando Valley; Ranchos Palos Verdes; Downtown) and everything was within an hours drive. The beach was surprisingly quiet and beautiful with mountain views. Strip is fun, famous canal neighborhood a must see! We stayed on a pedestrian street which afforded a quiet location only a 5-0 minute walk to the heart of the Venice boardwalk. Bike friendly and Santa Monica only a couple miles away. Walking on the beach at night felt a bit iffy but everywhere else in and around Venice was great and felt safe! I will definitely choose Venice Beach to stay upon return to the area:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/driftnanddreamn
50,nice impression,"After visiting LA, I had no high expectations from its beach. However, it was a nice surprise to see that the beach was very clean, people were nice. There are many shops from where you could get original californian souvenirs:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shinysimo
40,Art and Craft Stalls .,"Not a place to be at night seems a little dodgy, a place that you may find trouble. During the day however very safe and very interesting. Lot's of art,craft here. Definitely unusual and different. The bike ride would be amazing. The bike taxi was an experience and well worth the money. Take in Santa Monica while you're there. I would go again but as I said don't hang out here at night or use public transport here at night .....otherwise great.... Henna tattoos were amazing as were the shell art and the musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertaandharryz
50,A must see- Venice Beach,"My kids loooooved Venice Beach. It is such a fun walk. Fun people, laid back vibe. Fun shopping, amazing skateboarders, street acts. My son wants to move here after spending time here (not sure if thats good or bad?:)Its a lot of fun and a classic iconic strip to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindas286

50,"Aptly Named ""It is as Beautiful as Venice is""","Everybody i asked when i was visiting LA told me you have to go at the Venice beach and i am glad i did.. Its a beautiful Place absolutely serene and calm... near to the airport so it does not take long to reach if you are staying in that area... We just spend about couple of hours there because of the time constraint but you can actually spend hours there.. you can rent bicycles as cheap as 8 dollars for an hour can ride along the beach and explore the entire area... as the roads are pretty much leveled you will not get tired riding... Lot of People hire bicycles from Santa Monica Pier and just ride along the whole stretch covering Hermosa beach, venice and other couple of them... One of the oldest places to eat is on Hermosa beach called Mermaids.. its not a fancy one but has been there for ages and is really good especially for Sea food lovers... Again a must visit spot in LA and it really wont be disappointing....Important Tip: It can get really crowded over the weekends or important US holidays so parking sometime can be a challenge but there is plenty of space for parking right by the beach which sometimes you avoid due to the traffic leading upto it... and if at all you don't get a place you can always go upto the Yard about a Mile and half from the beach and park it there.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820abhinavj
40,Not the cleanest beach...But entertaining!,"Wanna see a bunch of weirdo's?? Come to Venice Beach! This should be your top destination for people watching. My gosh, it's so interesting. When can you visit a place called Muscle Beach, with old Fabio wanna-be's...The infamous guitar playing guy wearing a turban and toga on roller blades, whose plain plain rude if you'll pay him a few bucks for a photo, but disregards that and insists you pay $15 to buy his t-shirts...or, how about the bums making a plea to legalize marijuana, beggars who hold up signs on the truth why they need your money...to average souvenir shops aligning the boardwalk, great NY thin crust pizzas...and maybe, just maybe, you will get to meet the 3-headed turtle. Cheap, cheap fun. The beach is not that great, I would not relax there. A few miles down by car, or even by bike will take you to Santa Monica - which their charming little pier is worth the visit. Like I said before - Go for the experience! We take the teens here purely for entertainment. WE are the land of fruits and nuts - So enjoy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheleo612
40,Great beach to hang out.,"Growing up in Southern California, Venice beach was my hang out place on the weekends. You have a lot of stuff to see and experience in Venice Beach. You can enjoy local vendors and restaurants along the beach. If you like biking you can rent a bike and go all the way to Santa Monica pier. The weather is always excellent for walking and sports. I highly recommend a visit to Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaudiaCurtis
50,A must see stop along the coast,"My husband and I stopped in Venice Beach on our recent road trip up the coast. We both loved walking up and down the beach, watching the skateboarders at the park, shopping from all the local vendors and just the overall feel of the place. There's also a lot of interesting people walking around so if you enjoy people watching, this is the place! Definitely a must see if in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisahS839LY

40,Great to visit,Really liked our visit to Venice beach. The people are quite something to see. OK there are lots of homeless but they are not threatening and we felt safe. There are lots of stall and street acts so plenty to see and the atmosphere is so vibrant. My grandson even joined in a basket ball game which was one of the highlights of our holiday. The place is definitely on the up and worth visiting for the experince which is quite unique!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardenofengland
20,Underwhelmed,"In spite of this being a have to see place if you're near, please be prepared to be underwhelmed. From hope selling legal ""medicinal"" cannabis everywhere to bums and beggars by the foot, its a bit of a dump. Sure its got muscle beach, great sea and some cool board shops, the only thing actually worth seeing id the skateboarders. Surprisingly, the best behaved bunch, no foul language no litter and a very much community feel amongst boarders. Allow yourself an hour before you're bored and pay your mandatory $20 parking and head for Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17stevej
40,VENICE is back- Clean and Fun,"I have been going to Venice for years. It gotten to a point where it was mostly drugs, vendors, pan handlers, and gang activity.Well things have certainly cleaned up. I took extended family from out of town to Venice this weekend. The vendor had been cut to a minimum. This was a great thing because it keep from crowding on the boardwalk. The street performers were few and it allowed you to choose which ones you wanted to give your attention too. The beach itself was clean and frequently patrolled by police and live guard helicopters.The shops still have a lot of vendors that sale marijuana paraphernalia. The shirt stores are also very adult. I would say that it is a place better servers for small children and adults. Unless you dont mind what your kids see and hear.I am impressed by the clean up of the boardwalk. It still is very much an adult experience however, that is part of the allure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/measton23

40,Ecclectic mix,"I knew the reputation of Venice, but I didn't really have a concept in my mind of what it would be like.We park up. Walk a block to the sea front and are faced with golden sands and the blue of the Pacific; but much of the stuff that makes Venice Venice is either on or close to the boardwalk. Whether that be pretty young things playing volleyball, odd young things on unicycles, or entrepreneurial young things selling touristy object d'art in stalls along the front.Eclectic music fills the area. Lots going on but very laid back all at once. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrPaulT
40,Relaxed & chilled,"Venice beach is cool and calm, there isn't much to do but there are a lot of restaurants by the entrance. The people are really chilled.

20,Disappointing and turned off,Came here years ago we loved it i dont remember it being so gross and so bad but now that my daughter is older she sees it for what it really is...lots of over priced vendors and tourism shops selling stuff what started getting my 20 yr old daughter turned off that just in every tshirt shop they sold tight short shorts that all had very down putting remarks towards woman REALLY....why would any women want to wear this then the other thing you can not walk no where on this beach with out getting the smell or smoke of weed or marijuana gross.. then you got all the homless and some have dogs and it makes you feel horrible for the person and that much more for the dog the bathrooms are constantly over run by homless who stay in there for long periods so if you got to use it bad your out of luck and the stench of urine is everywhere yuk dogs tied up in the hot blazing sun no shade no water when we told a guy whos dog was tied to bleachers his dog was hot and thirsty and trying to crawl under the bleachers to get out of the sun but couldnt fit he said ya he probably is hot and thirsty and just turned around and continues to play basketball wow we got the dog some water he didn't even care then theres 7 young punks street dancers making rude comments to 2 guys walking by calling them g*y they must be g*y look at them.... that was the last straw we left.. oh and parking is 20 bucks all around here in the lots overpriced and if you park on the street watch signs cause they love giving lots of tickets its dirty filthy and i left feeling dirty and grimy personally and physically uggg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
50,"It is Venice Beach, just go with it!","I love Venice Beach because of the abundance of people who are doing their own things without troubling others. I like the Venice Beach atmosphere for a couple of reasons: First, my family and friends whenever they visit the Los Angeles area want to inevitably walk along the Venice boardwalk and let me tell you this is a treat no matter how many times I have previously walked the boardwalk. Second reason: Venice Beach is always a blast and always interesting as it avails a multitude of discussion topics to tap into whether on the drive home or conversing at a nearby eatery.Lastly, the beach air is soothing, comforting, and rejuvenating, thus in my estimation, Venice Beach is an experiential space that you should not pass up. Enjoy and smile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953indianaj
40,It takes all kinds...,"Why go to Venice Beach? Because people there have few inhibitions so it is a fun ""people watching"" place.

40,Cool place,"It's a nice walk on the board walk with all the attractions, Went there on Sunday, the place was packed. People come for a stroll or to use the sport (body building,skateboard) facilities/beach or just to hang out and watch people walk by or street artists offer their art.

10,Massive letdown,"I live in Southern California and have always wanted to visit the infamous Venice Beach. I had to go to LA for a quick meeting so I thought I'd make a day trip out of it and bring my 8 year old along. In my mind, I was expecting Venice Beach to be this bohemian, artsy paradise with cute cafes and quirky shops and galleries lining the street. The reality was the absolute opposite: Venice Beach is filthy, smelly and seedy. Drug addicts, homeless, cops and gangs everywhere. The worst was these ""pot"" dispensaries: total tatted up sleeze bags in doctors coats trying to sign anyone with a pulse up for medical marijuana. I am a nurse and was completely mortified by this. The safer part of the boardwalk is by the pier; the further north you go the more sketchy it gets. I was nervous about my daughter stepping on needles or us getting robbed so we got out of dodge and headed home. I will never go back there again. There was 2 good points about our experience: 1) Lunch at Venice Whalers (by the pier) and 2) Insane high level skateboarding at the skate park. Santa Monica Pier is way cleaner, nicer, and safer- if you have a family, skip Venice Beach and go straight there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monkeylvr
40,"Great, but I expected more..","I don't know what I was expecting exactly.. Some kind of what you can see in the movies, superstars and surfers.. It's nice, truly! But it's just a beach.. At least I can say I went to Venice Beach and bathed there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6681SLmelanieb
50,Amazing Sunset,"I took a walk to Venice Beach from Santa Monica Beach. To some, it might be on their level of a pleasant beach, but I would argue that it has its uniqueness. Watching people playing basketball while the sun sets into the horizon was a beautiful experience for me.On a side note, remember to check out the food trucks at Abbot Kinney on the first Friday of every month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanwanliu
20,Please clean up the homeless!,"As my title suggests, there are many homeless people along this stretch. I actually felt really intimidated whilst I was here, as we were harassed for money quite a few times as we walked along the pathway. Some of the homeless were quite obviously affected by drugs, and their behaviour was rather erratic.We also witnessed a man being arrested by police on the pathway in front of muscle beach. It was all quite dramatic, with 4 police vehicles driving at full speed over the beach and then up onto the footpath.The whole place had a grubby feel about it, not somewhere I would wish to spend my vacation time.My advice is to stay away from Venice Beach. Stick to the Santa Monica end its much nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joshane615
40,An experience,"We actually had a great visit to Venice Beach. Our boys bought skateboards and boarded down the boardwalk. An experience they may never get again. It was fun to watch the people doing tricks at the skate park. Plenty of touristy shops and vendors. Bathrooms were reasonably clean, especially since they were unisex. Saw a couple of model bathing suit shoots on the beach. Overall, a fun and interesting experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ksmitt
40,Been there to say you been there,"Place is cool. If you go to LA you have to go there. I will probably not go back, but I can mark it off the list. Its different if your from the South or Midwest. I was ready to go by 3pm, but I'm glad I went. Super crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344russellk
20,Not a great place for families,"We were disappointed in our visit to Venice Beach. It's dirty, full of cheap beach shops and provides plenty of urine/feces stench. The public restrooms are pathetic. We rented bikes for about 2 hours and had some trouble in some areas with walkers walking in the biking path even though they're clearly marked. We would not recommend this for travelers with young children unless you want to use this as an opportunity to answer lots of questions like ""what smells so bad?"" and ""why is that lady singing in the dumpster?""

10,Total dump,In every city you know there will be one street that's a must see even though it's a tourist trap and is not a good representation of the atmosphere a city has to offer. we've seen many of these throughout the world and they're never anything special - but Venice beach is for all the wrong reasons. Not only is it ugly (Santa Monica beach is a lot nicer) it's full of Juniors and people who Are contantly trying to sell you something. Definitely a dump that's worth seeing just to tick the box.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anic01
40,Uniquely Fun and Funky...great action and activity,"You're either going to love it or hate it here...there's not a lot of middle ground. It's got the potential to be a freak show (they have a dedicated one, but the ""freaks"" are everywhere), and mid-western families will buy knock-off sunglasses from a stand next to a head shop next to the grumpy guy who will give you bad advice for $1.00 next to the guy who jumps off a step-ladder into a pile of glass.Skate punks wait their turn while 50 year-old dads show them how they used to do it in Dogtown. (You know they're dads because they're wearing pads and helmets now.) Pick-up basketball is serious business, as is, of course, muscle beach. The bike path gets crowded on weekends, but it's great riding from Santa Monica to Redondo Beach (and back) if you have the day to spend. Speaking of Santa Monica, it's an easy walk and back...great opportunity to check out the beach-front residences or cut over to the canals to change things up a bit.You don't have to get too close (please don't feed the animals or tap on the glass), and, for the most part, everyone is cool and understands the peculiar dynamic of the boardwalk. If you're a dedicated people-watcher, there are more people of all shapes and sizes wanting to be seen per square foot here than anywhere I can recall. And there are some really great spots to stop, eat, and drink to take it all in. Use common sense, hang with friends, keep your wallet in your front pocket, and don't buy cheap flip flops...you know they'll just break anyway.For beach time, enjoy the surf and sand on either side of the pier (off Washington Blvd), though it IS definitely quieter on the Marina del Rey (south) side of the pier...there's no boardwalk or public facilities on that side, but you're still minutes away from the Venice action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcx-PA

The locals recommended we visit Venice Beach as the place to go to ""people watch"". Apparently the locals have not visited this beach for quite some time. We found the beach area and the grounds dirty. Several of the retailers had dirty storefronts. Parking was a huge ripoff;signs stated $ 10 parking but attendant demands to park were $20. The public restrooms were toxic and foreboding. The public has lost its pride of this beach and it shows. Particularly not recommended for family visitation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDM137

We stayed in Venice at a Airbnb studio rental that was horrible compared to the 'raving' reviews it got....and the town of Venice...well just dirty.

It too was cold, dirty and just plain gross inside. The hubby and I thought we'd drive the 15 min down to the Venice boardwalk but after driving around and around in circles down the crowded 'alley' looking dirty streets, with people honking constantly and flipping you off we basically were like 'f--k this'. The area was so run down, dirty, unattractive looking it was not worth any more of our time. I was told the boardwalk was freaky but was willing to give it a go....but dealing with the people, traffic and 'cracktown' appearance just a block away from the beach/boardwalk....no thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitteakat
50,Love the surfing!,Borrowed a surfboard and went surfing - was a brilliant day! Make sure you are off the beach before the tramps come out and be prepared to wait a long time for a car parkign space if you don't set off early. We parked in the backstreets and even that took a while to find a place. Lovely restaurants on the entry to venice beach - cabo cantina amogst others. Nice clean big beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skydiver012
40,relaxing place,Enjoy the view and breeze along the beach. Many activities that you can do around the area. A relaxing place within LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesfly
20,A Nice Stretch Of Beach Full Of Homeless/panhandlers/garbage stores,"Comparing many of the adjoining beaches along the shore from Marina Del Rey and beyond, Venice Beach was nothing that we had expected or had hoped to pass through. The beach and water were beautiful; the opposite side with the walkway and bike path was an unkempt collection of con-artists panhandling, really bad souvenir shops with awful merchandise, and lingering street people who should have looked for employment and not bother the tourists. If you can skip Venice Beach, do so, unless this sort of atmosphere turns your crank......not us !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonandMarusia
50,"Great beach, food and vibes","Visiting this famous beach was a thrill as I got to see the Muscle Beach Museum and plenty of muscles on the beach :-) Blank canvases of concrete for artists to adorn beautifully and artistically. Live music, people conversating, food cooking and the beach was poppin! Bathroom lines were 40 minutes long, so make sure you go before you go! Great souveniers available to remember it by. Save a buck and bring your own bottled waters, snacks but grab some of that great funnel cake and chili cheese fries!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreathingAloha
40,Talk about weirdo's hahahaha,"Well what an eclectic and weird mix of people from all walks of life. I think that Santa Monica Beach is a much nicer beach to visit, but if you don't experience Venice, you won't know what you missed...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaryllR_12
50,Everyone needs to visit funky LA,"Go to see the skateboarders, eat at stands, walk around and be hounded by merchants and go down to the shore and walk on the sand for miles, to Marina Del Ray or Santa Monica.Can walk up to Main St in santa Monica, or walk to the Venice Canals.Wonderful California experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibumaven
50,The Beach is Perfect,"Venice Beach is a great place to go, there is a bike path and a lot of exercising areas. I liked that place a lot, you should go. There are beach volleyball courts too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juans803
50,BRING YOUR CAMERA!,"Crazy. All types of folks to see. Lots of shops for souveniors. Look at the folks selling on the sidewalk.. look for hand made or made in california. Support the local artists. Only complaint.. the signs at the store fronts that wanted $1 to take a picture of their display! Just stand back a few more feet and zoom in.. that is ridiculous to ask for money to do take a pic of a display. Oh.. and need to ""medicate"" .. every third shop is a medical marijuana facility and the doctor is always in.. LOL.. can't afford the diagnosis.. no worry .. stand around you can get a contact buzz! LOL. Glad I got to see what this place was all about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TishW_13
10,What a disappointment!!,Haven't been here for many years and won't be going back!! Absolutely filthy to say the least. It is evident that this a haven for crime. No decent restaurant anywhere in sight! I can accept weirdos but this area is dangerous and unless you are someone who is like that suggest you stay away!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyg789
10,SKIP THIS BEACH,"Very creepy and dirty. When you pull up, the first thing you see is a legal marijuana store. Too many freeks. We were afraid to get out of the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NanaFradette
50,Fun for everyone,The beauty of the beach & the character/personality of Venice beach shouldn't be missed. Fun for all ages. An unique L.A. Beach experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LRIMom
20,I think it is past its peak.,"Historically this is a really interesting area. Lots of history going back to when Venice was its own town separated from the city by farmland. Then the canals were dug, then mostly filled in again. If you have time and a sharp eye there are still very nice examples of historical buildings to be seen along Main Street. Glimpses of Art Deco are still there if you look hard enough, and on a quiet morning you can almost place yourself back there in time. The canal architecture is very interesting, and it is worth doing a little research on that alone before you visit so you know what you are seeing.Move one street West to Pacific, and you are in another world. This is the 'Beach' part. Dirty, busy, graffiti, homeless, and bad apartments behind big walls. Ugly.Next is the Speedway, which is essentially an alleyway full of cars and dumpsters that the people with the big $ beachside houses use.What turned me off was the lack of police and the many players visible in the area. We saw one attempted assault in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, but the victim managed to escape. This was just random thuggery in front of about a hundred people. The thug was an imbecile who thought he was being funny and was performing for the crowd. We left. That sealed it for me. Too many idiots. I had read reports of some pretty nasty incidents of serious crime in the area the week before we visited, so I was pretty vigilant. Perhaps if I wasn't there with kids and had my tourist blinkers on I wouldn't have noticed things and enjoyed it more. Most likely I would have just been mugged in an alleyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle
10,Beach Bust,"This beach is over-developed, congested with traffic, and very crowded. The parking rates are some of the highest in the area. While it may be touted in some tourist guides, it is one of the worst beaches in Los Angeles County. The beaches in Ventura County and Orange County are much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11JerryB
10,shameful,"Venice has lost its soul. What made Venice was the wide array of diferent styles of art. You could find singers, painters, musicians, everything. now the only thing you find is these medical marijuana places and undesirable people. Do not go and specially don't take your kids,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Therealtrue
50,Better than expected.,"We only had 30 minutes, as we were on a tour bus, but we made the best of it. Venice Beach was everything and more. It was one of the places I really wanted to see after following the stories of skate and surf boards of the 60 and 70's. The vibe it had even first thing in the morning was awesome. I could of stayed there much longer and if I make it back to LA, it will be one of my first stops for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimFabe
40,Touristy but worth it,"I have a soft spot for Venice. I love the mix of people. Tourists, performers, locals, bikers, surfers. There is a little bit of everything.There's Muscle Beach, some hot dog stands, cafes where you can sit and watch the view, performers trying to get your attention, money or to be discovered...There's something about it that puts a smile on my face.Cons: parking is crappy, expensive and there's usually a wait. We've given up and gone home several times. Do yourself a favor and take an Uber. Get dropped off on on of the smaller streets or on speedway dr to avoid paying to wait in the car for 1/2 hour plus near Washington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinary-widow
50,If you are a tourist in LA you have to go,"Grungy, fun, sexy plus a beautiful beach. Check out the surfers or go to to the skatepark. Walk down the Board Walk (the #2 visited tourist attraction in Southern California!) Have a glass of Sangria or an ice cold beer at Venice Ale House and soak in the atmosphere. Nothing like this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanukphoto
50,Favorite L.A. Walking Tour,"I'm a local. But I've always liked to join organized neighborhood walking tours of ethnic or historic L.A. Areas that have been recommended by friends or the news media. There actually IS history in SoCal! The local Vassar College Alumni/ae Group arranged a fundraising event last weekend. Twelve of us walked the streets and character-inhabited beaches of VENICE (CA). We learned about the early land and aquatic development when Venice was its own city. We explored the streets that used to be canals, and we saw numerous videos and photos of the changes that occurred over the years as the takeover by the City of Los Angeles forced generally unwanted urbanization. Numerous famous people lived and made films in Venice back to the days of Charlie Chaplin. If you would like to enjoy a fantastic three-hour easy walk through one of the most interesting neighborhoods in America, check out the Reel To Real Tours website. The owner and tour guide's name is Jonathan. You will be amazed by his knowledge and amused by his anecdotes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarelf
40,Great Beach,"From the moment you park and step on the beach, the paths are endless you can head down either north or south walk the strip touch the water surf the waves or even walk the pier or ride bikes. There's always something to do here at this beach so anyone can hit in",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caloksp
10,Homeless Ally,I had a romantic view of Venice Beach. With sexy girls rollerblading down the Venice Boulevard of Bay Watch and of NCIS LA scenes of a great place to visit. This Icon is ruined and I found it threatening. The Homeless were everywhere in their cardboard homes & shopping trolleys begging for a $. We walked the 6 miles from Santa Monica Pier and the end of Route 66 to the Venice Beach Pier. All the time looking behind for a mugger. It is not a nice place to visit but it gives a startling exposure of the haves and have nots in America.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeTill
50,Nice relaxing week at venice,"I love this place such a different variety of people, real cool place to just hang out and watch the world go by, i would recommend hiring a beach cruiser and taking a ride to the other side of Santa Monica about 6 miles each way easy enough on these though. There was a competition on at muscle beach, there were some great skateboarders at the park, there is however a lot of homeless people that do not stress you out as they are all seeing the dr green",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tenk012345
20,Better to experience through photos...,"The days of old muscle beach are over. Long gone are the days were healthy bodybuilders exhibit their physique and strength. Now, you witness marijuana influenced individuals with anarchist attitudes and a sence of entitlement. Steer clear of this beach filled with transients, drug dealers, gangsters and purse snatchers. You're better off viewing photos of old or going north toward a cleaner coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armandom562
50,I call it home,"So, of course, I think Venice is the best place in the world. I travel a lot and I'm always happy olive right here. It's very much a neighborhood or group of neighborhoods. There are restaurants, beaches, bike paths, canals, shopping streets and oodles of street performers. The latter mostly in the summer. The air is clean and it's never too hot or too cold. In the winter it's quiet and peaceful and in the summer it's vacation-landia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5766XBbarbaram
30,Nice afternoon stroll,"It's a good place for people watching and a stroll. Always expect crowds, people selling music, souvenirs and homeless kids. The ocean is always beautiful and the regulars are pretty amazing. Plus, except for parking, it's free!Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622michelled
40,Venice Beach Eclectic & Exciting!,There is always interesting entertainment at Venice beach...from street Musicians to interesting shops-there is a little bit of everything here! Great place to stroll shop and eat and definitely people watch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryF549
50,My favorite place in the L.A. Area to spend a morning,"Love coming to Venice early, taking a long walk and having breakfast. Perfect spot to people watch, shop, see street performers, bicycle or walk. Been coming here since 1970, lots of great memories. Get there early for inexpensive parking, the rates go up as the lots fill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862JamesD
50,"Great people watching, beautiful beach","Venice beach is beautiful. There is a sidewalk that runs a pretty good distance with all kinds of touristy shops along the way. The people watching is spectacular. Not much good eats, although there are a few small restaurants there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineG62
30,If you are looking for homeless people and Marijuana Card This is for you.,"I would suggest that if you have small children you should probably avoid Venice Beach, unless you are looking for to some very pointed questions. There are parts that are okay and others that you would not want to be there at night. Between the homeless and the medical marijuana doctors on the beach you will either be sadden by it or enjoy it for the people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GodBlessAmerica1
30,If QUIRKY is what you are looking for ...,"You can spend as little or as long as you want walking along Venice Beach. Parking can range from metered parking (if you are lucky) to $10-$20. Venice Beach will bring you back to the 1960's and the tie dye era. If you like quirky, you'll like Venice Beach. If you don't like quirky, it is probably still worth an hour of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaci405
40,Worth seeing,Driving from long beach we headed to Venice to spend the day. I could not believe the depth of the beach / just beautiful.We walked the boardwalk for a couple of miles - a number of carney type stores and people in the otherwise of the walk selling everything from pictures to giving away free hugsInteresting a lot of green doctors selling medicinal weed tell them you have a pain - your good to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CIAOMARYEH
40,Varied,"Exactly what I expected having visited here 35 years ago. Nothing's changed except the hobo's have moved in but you find them wherever you go in the world. It's not there fault as they just need help, but in any case they don't every interact with you. The beach is lovely but watch where you walk as there are small tar deposits that stick to you like sh@t on a shovel. But that's a minor point. Come and enjoy the eclectic scene.........dude",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apashouros
40,Venice Beach is a Great Place to Stay in LA,"For Australians Venice is like Newtown by the beach, same assortment of very individual locals, quite a lot of homeless, lots of small shops and spruikers, but with a great wide beach boulevarde with a seperate cycling track, huge expanse of sand to the beach which stretches down to Santa Monica Pier and up to Marina Del Ray. It all comes alive by 11 am and goes till late with a constant stream of locals and tourists.There's some great food places, soo many tattoo parlours, even a full size piano that is played every day.You can really watch the world go by at Venice. We are staying right on the beach and it's so central to go places each day and yet have the beach to start and finish the day, really makes for a great holiday. Inner city living Aussies will feel right at home in Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acutlc
40,Saturday morning walking on Venice Beach.,"My wife and I walked down Venice Beach early (8am-ish) Saturday morning and I tell you this...the place is a must see if you are in the area. I don't care what your background is or what walk of life you are from Venice Beach is simply a cool place to see. Things you will see good or bad take it how you want. Street performers, intense pick-up basketball games, homeless beggars, skateboarding, Muscle Beach (huge people weight lifting), the beach and all walks of life on the sidewalks and beach. I suppose you could see and hear some stuff as a parent you may not want you child to although we didn't while we were there. Not the cleanest but not the nastiest either. Lots of little shops selling junk pretty much but still neat to go in and look around. I wouldn't spend the entire day there but about 2 hours and you will get your feel but it is a must see regardless or at least we thought so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ryeback76
40,Freaksville,"Venice Beach is freaksville personified. A couple of hundred beachside stalls and the shops behind them sell everything you can imagine, and a lot of things you never imagined could be sold. Real and henna tattoo parlours, instant sketches, piercing parlours, jewellery, bongs, cheap T-shirts, glass sculptures, bicycle parts, artificial flowers, hemp clothing, psychedelic art works, general junk, self published books - you name it, its there. Cafes served ethnic food with origins from Peru to Tibet, and the locals varied from hobbling pensioners to spaced out twenty somethings, and sleeping hoboes to girls in minimalist bikinis and their muscle bound partners. A fascinating eyeful of an alternate culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774warwickc
50,A day in Venice CA,"We saw the beach with the ""honky-tonk"" shops and the skateboarders and even muscle beach. We enjoyed the homes on the canals and had a great meal at Salt Air on Abbot Kinney. Time Travel Mart was also a fun stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mostofi
40,Fun in a weird sort of way....,"Venice Beach is odd.. Fun place to people watch, lots of strange characters lining the walk. Weird and seedy shops, a few of them were weed ""doctors"" with the dr being ""in"".it was kind of a blustery day so we didn't stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramonar531
40,Spring time at Venice beach,"Walked along Venice Beach to Santa Monica pier. Disturbing to see so many people squatting (sleeping rough) along the foreshore. However the ingenuity of the people with their goods and talents on show was amazing. some of it excellent. Quirky little cafes and bars back from the beach and further into town, some very classy shops. An eclectic mix in a very small area. Great to be on foot and explore if you don't have a specific place to be. The pier was interesting where wheel chair fishermen could park. Should come back when the sun is shinning and a bit warmer. I think the highlight was exploring the canals around Venice beach that are hidden away. Some of the outdoor settings are beautiful in such small spaces. A very clever use of furniture and flora.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieT215
20,We went in Winter,"We went in Winter so there was not much around, it had a bit run down feel about the place, the beach was large so probably would have a better feel in Summer? There are a few shops to check out, very popular grubby toilet block and at that time of year not many street performers, so that was about it, I would give it a miss in Winter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belinda1203
40,Multi faces and good time,Really a great place to walk and see many people doing all kind of activities.. so fun. the places to have a beer and see the people walking doing sports is so much fun..I was 10 minutes walk from the beach so I was in a quite and cool place.. Venice beach is very busy..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alejandrow566
40,"Strange, but fun","This is one of the weird beaches, seedy crowd but lots of culture. There are many cool things to see - check out the graffiti on the concrete structures. Lots of food options as well. Parking was very expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yuckyfaghag1
40,Fascinating,"I live here and still find Venice Beach a fascinating and interesting place to people watch. There's an eclectic mix of people, races, religions and more on display. Good eats, typical tourist type shopping and endless photo opportunities. Rent a bike and ride along the stand as far north at Will Rogers state beach or go south all the way to Redondo Beach for an all day outing. Have fun and enjoy! If you have questions let me know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddhZ9740GM

40,A nice stretch of people watching and then some!,Spent this Saturday afternoon strolling the Venice Beach beach scene enjoying the sight and sounds with my kids. Very entertaining both from street performer and people watching perspectives. Interesting atmosphere beyond the T-shirt shops and sketchy critters with local and out of town visitors. The pier was also an interesting vantage point and nice way to enjoy the sights and sounds of the water. A must see if in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joel283
30,Go on a Busy Day,"My review is based on what we saw - not a lot. We told a shop assistant somewhere else in L.A. that we were on holiday and he asked where we had been. When we got chatting, he said Venice Beach has to be done on a weekend. So I'm not saying Venice Beach is bad, just that you have to pick a good day to actually get the vibe and the experience. Would like to go back and see it properly. The guy said he went on a Sunday so my assumption is the weekend is the best time.Only saw one guy perform with sharp glass and generally the walk we did from Santa Monica was lovely. Be careful of the sun. Sun cream is a must, my boyfriends legs got burnt at the back when we walked all the way down to Venice Beach. It wasn't even that hot. About 20 degrees C. Think he was wearing a thin cotton sweater and his hands got burnt too so if you go here make sure you put on plenty of sun cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeshlee
30,Shady,"As a tourist this place was very odd. However, it's a place of great culture. Nothing wrong other than the restrooms. I do recommend spending most of your time at the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talkinwithj
40,Dude...,"I loved the atmosphere here. There are loads of shops on the boardwalk, but only if you want to buy T-shirts, dope smoking paraphernalia, surfing kit or tattoos. Even so, the place is full of people just enjoying the vibes and having a good time. I went for a paddle in the Pacific at exactly the spot where a corpse got pulled out of the sea in one of the cop shows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265NeilW
40,Lots of culture everywhere!!!,Venice beach was on my list of places to visit while here in California. My uncle Jim gave us a professional tour and we got to see some of the old buildings and houses where celebrities use to work. Be prepared for a lot of walking and people everywhere. There are many many shops selling various clothing and items. I love the whole atmosphere it's young and vibrant. The actual beach is very clean and not dirty like most people make it out to be. Plastic bags are band so that cuts down on a lot of trash that lands in the sea. A must visit place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Florid1990
50,Great place for a bike ride,We hired bikes and rode from Santa Monica pier down to Venice beach. It was a great day. It's a very entertaining ride with heaps to see along the way. Don't forget your sunscreen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9621GZdaniels

50,MY FAVORITE WALK,"Whenever I need to just walk and people watch Venice Beach is the place i go. The weather doesn't even have to be perfect. There is always just a wonderful vibe there. So much to look at, yummy food and the smell of the ocean. You can make it a long walk or a short one, it's all good. Great place to take out of town guests!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenS850

40,Magic and Massive,If I think that I walked on the same beach..touching the same sand over all the Baywatch actor did...it's sound so magic!!!Well ...the beach is very massive...and you can enjoy with a walk until the Santa Monica pier ..with the light and games there ...even if you are a sport person you can run on the path and use the machine available ...Amazing place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shery88
50,I must see if you're in L.A.,"This is the quintessential L.A. tourist attraction. Right on the ocean you can sight see, people watch, shop, and of course eat. Plan to spend at least an hour or two. The downside is you can spend $8 - $18 for parking depending on when you go. That said everybody should go at least once in their lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4624VIjohns
10,Don't get it,Biggest complaint is how dirty/dingy this place is in comparison to other locations around LA. I'm not sure if it because of how many tourists visit or what but to me it is a place to give a miss to. If you want to visit the beach look elsewhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191joshg

50,Always a good time!,Pros: so many different shops and food spots you can spend an afternoon just walking.. muscle beach where really buff people work out :) eye candy! And last but not least.. cheap bike riding along the beach! Rent a bike and go from Venice to Santa Monica beach..the views are awesome..and its soo much fun!!Cons: parking is ridiculous and waay over priced.. there are a lot of bums..and strange people there..but thats what makes it more interesting.. BATHROOMS.. if you can hold it.. bike up towards santa monica.. with in 5 mins of biking there are waaay cleaner and less packed bathrooms believe me the ones right off of the basketball courts are the worse!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scillas2015

50,quite the place,was only there for awhile.Quite the experience.Muscle Beach was an eye openner..too funny...the characters on the boardwalk were worth the walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230ginnyr
50,Most Famous LA Area Beach,Venice Beach is incredible. Incredible sights sand and water. Walk all along the boardwalk (actually asphalt) just taking in all the shops and restaurants. The street performers hustlers and characters. The people watching might be the greatest sport down here. All the players are present for an unique and unforgettable show. Soak up that California Sunshine! A treasure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stOOOge
40,Visit at least once,"My boyfriend and I rented bicycles and cycled on the beach. It was fun and a great experience. However , Manhattan Beach is better. Venice Beach is not as clean, more graffiti, and skateboarding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melliesue
10,Custom t-shirt shop.,Went into the T-shirt shop near the pier. The music was very loud. The guy came up and started conversation asking where we where from. Really feindly. He says you can get any design on any shirt for 19.99. Cool I thougt. So I buy 2 shirts. Tank tops to be exact. One for me and one for my girlfriend. They make them and we are excited because they look really good. The guy takes my card and swipes it and then says this is what I'm chargin you for. 2 tanks 19.99 a piece then 2 graphics 19.99 a piece and not to mention during the making of my girls shirt he says do you want me to put venice beach underneath? I was like cool yeah do it. Didn't say it would cost anything. After all said and done I paid 92.56 for two cheap tank tops. Stay away from the shops. Tourist traps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steelmann28
30,Not as wacky as we expected,"Must have been an off-day when we were there, because we didn't experience the craziness you hear about. Sure, there were a few ""interesting"" people to watch. And the shops have that off-beat air about them. The beach was nice enough, but not as nice as others in the area. As with other beaches, access is free, but you pay to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwg51357
10,UUGGHH!,"Very disappointed. We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach along the bike path. There were homeless people in Santa Monica, and along the way, but when we got to Venice Beach the number of them skyrocket. Little shantys built along the little sea wall, people sleeping all over the place. We turned around before getting even half way down the walkway.

50,Meets Epectations,"I've always been a fan of the wonderfully weird Venice Beach. from the 'doctors' who certify that you medically need Marijuana to the traveling 'grungy' minstrels.. it's is overall the best place to people watch and just go with the flo.Love the restaurants and quaint shops the painters and most the water and beach.great art work and cool murals line the path. Parking is scary so we caught a cab from the airport just in case and I was glad I did. $20-25 a day for parking is not a good thing so I'm glad we didn't rent a car.Uber seems to have created a nice niche here and can take you anywhere. Loved walking over to Abbot-Kinney and shopped till we dropped, also had a great massage and hair at Lamai and Trim. Niki was great!Overall Venice Beach hasn't changed in years, the homeless are still homeless the musicians still need new amps and the stores still have awful saying on some shirts but it's eclectically beautiful.. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonik713
30,Chilly but Fun Atmosphere,There were fun places to shop and a good overall beachy atmosphere. It was a little cold out but I went swimming anyway! There are great waves there for jumping around in. The bathrooms are very dirty on the beach so I suggest buying food at a restaurant and using the bathroom there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_royal_review
20,"Like most things L.A., I ask myself ""Why?""","My daughter has chosen to live in Venice Beach, so I am obligated to visit there if I want to see her. She pays an enormous amount of money to live in a large closet on a street I have dubbed ""Urine Avenue"" (actually Rose Ave.) for the delightful aroma you enjoy while walking on it. While navigating the 8 straight blocks to the beach to see the weirdos and eccentrics who frolic there, you have to climb over the drunks and nut jobs lining the streets, and pass countless permanently parked vehicles which are obviously inhabited on a daily basis. Apparently, Venice Beach has neither laws nor a police force to protect the taxpayers, who I'm sure pay a pretty penny to legally live there. The beach is a beach, far down the list of pretty beaches I have visited in my lifetime. Unless you have a family member living there, I see no reason at all why anyone would want to visit this place. But on a positive note, it makes me very grateful that I live where I do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinwcollier

50,Lived There for 10 Years,"If you are in the area, Venice Beach is a ""must visit"". While it has gone through many changes through the years, it always remains an icon. Venice Beach is to Los Angeles, what Las Ramblas is to Barcelona. And they have their similarities - although I would say Las Ramblas stepped it up a notch and Venice Beach began to notice.There are a few ways you can spend your day in Venice Beach First, expect parking to be very difficult. While finding free parking is possible, you may just want to bite the bullet and pay for parking at a beach parking lot. Save the limited parking for the residents who pay a premium just to live there-many in tiny box-sized apartments. There are a few parking lots. You can park at the one on Washington Blvd just after (west of) Pacifiic Blvd, or you can travel north on Pacific Blvd to find another lot. Parking will cost you anywhere from $5 to $20 depending on the day and the season...although that is more of a guess as I have not lived there in some years, even though I still visit.There are many ways to spend your day at Venice Beach. There are decent surf breaks at Venice Beach if you want to surf. Try the Pier at Washington Blvd (which is right there by the aforementioned parking lot), or walk north to the Breakwater (around 21st street at Pacific from memory-but don't quote me on that). The Breakwater is my preferred surf spot (I'm not that good), although you may find a steeper wave at the Pier. It really just depends on the tide, swell and wind.There is a lot of localism at the surf breaks from what I hear...probably more towards the boys than the girls. Being a girl and a local, I never personally had to deal with it to say for certain how bad it is. Just follow wave etiquette and don't jump in on anybody's wave.Of course, you can just park your booty on the sand just about anywhere and absorb the sun rays and play in the water. Watch the waves. the surf, the surfers-maybe boogie board, and enjoy the sun, along with the eclectic street scene behind you. There are even some volleyball courts on the sand where you can start or join in on a game. Do take some time to either walk on the Boardwalk or bike down the beach path (heading north) to see the street scene. Maybe even do this on day one, so you can peruse and further explore Venice Beach on subsequent days after you've gotten your bearings. You can forgo the beach itself and just walk along the street scene and shop from street vendors and tourist shops. I do also think Jody Maroni's is a worthwhile stop for a beach sausage (or bratwurst). Of course, I would be remiss to not mention fine restaurants like Mercede's Grill (yum Brazilian) or C & O Trattoria (an Italian restaurant where the waiters sing and clink glasses with patrons to the song ""When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, that's Amore!"" Don't expect singing at lunch time though, as it may only be available at dinner and/or weekends. These restaurants are on Washington Blvd (the south end of Venice) where the Venice beach area turns into Marina Del Rey. There are also other fun bars and eating spots (Hinano's/ The Whaler) - including some further north on the boardwalk and along the bike path which will take you all the way up to Santa Monica Pier. Santa Monica Pier offers carnival rides, as well as an outdoor free gymnasium park in the sand built for adult workouts. You can bike the whole path from Washington Blvd to Santa Monica Pier and back for a day of fun and absorbing the sights...but I wouldn't try to walk the whole way. Bike rentals are available all along the beach, as are Segways (those two-wheeled, electronic ""people movers"").If you want to get into the scene of Venice Beach a little bit more (away from the boardwalk, actual water and waves), travel down Abbott Kinney Blvd. where you will find eclectic shops and restaurants from kitschy to ritzy. Stop at locals favorite ""Abbots Habit"" for a coffee, sandwich or salad (and some art). Have a beer at the Brig (bar). Or travel off the beaten path (on Abbot Kinney, just on the south side of Venice Blvd.) and have a nice European breakfast at the French Market Cafe. Lovely. Be prepared to park and walk whereever you go. (Although you may get lucky!)I would be gypping you if I didn't tell you to take a stroll along the Venice canals and bring a camera. Here is where you will get all those beauty shots of you on a canal bridge to take home and show your family. The homes on the canals are truly delightful. You can enter the canals from either Washington Blvd. or Venice Blvd. between Pacific and Dell. Park and take a walk and absorb the beauty of the homes on the water. Incidentally, there is a nice kiddie park for toddlers just off (south of) Venice Blvd on Dell for mommies and daddies to take their little ones. (Find similar parks along the Venice bike path from Venice to Santa Monica where families play but also picnic.) There is an entrance to the Venice Canals right behind Baja Cantina Mexican Restaurant (which is a fun place but also quite a meat market-great if you are single and looking to flirt!) If you just want to make a night of it, have some tacos and margaritas at Baja Cantina and then take a before or after dinner stroll through the canals.Being among the over 1 million visitors a day to Venice Beach, please be good guests and respect the ocean. There is so much litter in the area from tourists and those coming from inland and it is difficult to keep on top of. Please pack out what you take in and respect our beaches. It's a beautiful and unique spot that we would like to maintain for residents, visitors and oceanlife, alike.Lastly, be safe. Venice has a reputation for gangs and criminal activity. Stay in the areas mentioned and don't wander into unknown neighborhoods. Keep an eye on your things and don't antagonize others. Keep to your own business and stay away from confrontation. Don't be scared, just be aware.Thank you and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creativitoy
40,Interesting spot,This was my first visit to Venice Beach. I was in town for work and wanted to try something new. It is an eclectic spot. If you want quiet this is not the spot for you. If you want interesting people and environments then this is a great spot. It is most definitely a tourist trap. Lots of henna tattoos and cheap tshirts available.We went during prime time on a Sunday afternoon and finding parking was ridiculous. We paid $15 for prime parking because I was too impatient to drive around more than we did. We took in all the sights and sounds. There are a LOT of vendors. We checked out the skate park which was cool and then walked to Muscle Beach which was interesting as well.If you go with the right expectations then this can be a fun spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldgiraffe

50,Never a dull moment,I've been to Venice Beach many times as a southern California resident. I always take my visitors to Venice Beach when they arrive and surely before they leave. It amazes them and immerses them into southern California. Colorful people .. throngs of just about every kind of person you cannot imagine are on the move taking in the street shows..muscle beach...restaurants . ..street food..ocean . .parks...art scene..and so much more. I can never get enough of Venice Beach because it's all about the people baby. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/427harryc
50,Lots of fun,"We love Venice beach. Every time when we in LA, we have to visit it. There is a lot of stuff to do and see. Boardwalk and long strip is always fun.

40,A Taste of LA Beach Life,"All you out-of-towners, it's worth a trip to Venice Beach - especially on the weekends. Along the sandy hillocks and sparkling ocean lies the Venice boardwalk, which can be a joy to discover. Filled with hordes strolling, bicycling, skateboarding, skating - and blocks of outdoor (and some indoor) vendors selling all manner of artwork, clothing, beach necessities, and a variety of touristy souvenirs. The booths are Interspersed with restaurants, fast food booths, and lots of places to use up your daily allotment of calories. And let's not forget the various ""entertainers"" plying their special skills, whether they be playing music, dancing, or any number of specialty acts enthusiastically performed. Not to be missed for a sample of beach flavors a la LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docelaine
30,Beautiful beach surrounded by a hippy-dippy atmosphere,"First off, the beach itself is gorgeous.If you walk the boardwalk, you will see folks from every walk of life, unfortunately many homeless people. The shops are typical tourist junk as well as quite a shops offering to evaluate if you qualify for a medical marijuana card. These shops seem to pop up to meet demand, so it wasn't surprising there was a lot of pot smoke around. If you enjoy people watching, this is an excellent place to go!The boardwalk was a bit run down and trashy, but signs were posted that the town was starting to clean and disinfect, likely as part of the preparation for summer.Public bathrooms were available, they were pretty nasty but usable in a pinch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skrobob
30,The Beach is Fantastic...The Locals Are Sketchy,"I love beaches, I love Venice and all things Californian. Sure, I'm biased, I was born here. There is nothing lovelier than spending a day ambling from the Santa Monica Pier to the Pier in Venice and then back. The beach itself is a marvel. I would be remiss in my duties to not warn out of towners to be careful in Venice Beach. One has to be careful of the locals even when walking on the beach itself. There are drunken gang members walking down the beach in the afternoons just looking for trouble. Their attitudes aren't as bad as the mounted police....stealth black ATVs....who dress like Darth Vader. These cops have a real problem and are the real gang issue in the area. They ride through the people sitting on the towels, craning their necks to look into purses, beach bags and stuff.We've covered the safe aspects of the beach so now let's move up to the Boardwalk, a delightful but typically cynical mass of ramshackle stores selling crappy tourists t-shirts. It's up here where it gets dicey. The shops are okay, there are loads of great eateries and these attract all kinds. Most of the people you meet here will be just fine. If you are a foreign visitor be aware that America let's it's homeless and crazy people run around pretty much uncontrolled and unmolested. And they don't stop them from molesting you. Most of the people on bicycles, who are not down on the bike lanes, are gang members looking for trouble. They will steal from you, they will beat you up, they will rip you off, and most of the time they will never be caught. There have been ritual murders down there at night. We Angelenos, for the most part, don't care, and are either unaffected by it or can deal with it. Most of the times it's safe. Just be wary like any large urban center in America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bSirius

50,The largest free show in California,"Venice beach has changed a lot since I grew up there, but it's a must see for people looking for a beach experience when they visit southern California. It stretches from Navy Street to the north, down to Washington Street to the south, covering about a two mile stretch of boardwalk. There are shops, restaurants, cafes, and performers. Parking is cheapest at the lot at the end of Rose Avenue and the other lots are at Venice Blvd., and Washington Street. They fill up fast, so get there in the morning and plan to spend the day looking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1CAL
40,Delight in it's Character(s) - Why I love Venice Beach,"At Venice Beach, I can stroll on the Boardwalk, and look at all the shops and hand made items lined up sale. I can power walk the Strand or ride my bike. I can bring a beach chair and sit by the ocean, lie in the sand, and take a dip in the water. I can play paddle tennis on a court, or volleyball at a sand court, and the best part, all of this is free to everyone. Here is where you will see all sorts of folks, living and accepting each others differences. Enjoy yourself as a family by the sand and surf, as a couple or even solo, grab a table at an outside cafe, and just watch everyone go by. The venders who sell across from the shops have lots of one of a kind items. They are worth a look if you want to find that unique gift for someone back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/askmetotravel

Join in or watch activities of all types, from beach activities to impromptu music acts. Plenty of food/drink options and great for people watching. Don't miss the canal system, with its idyllic location and wonderfully varied architecture, only minutes from the buzz of the beach. See also the graffiti wall, where kids can (legitimately) spray graffiti onto a series of concrete walls. Lunch at Poke-Poke, rent a bike or just laze on the beach.

50,Muscle Beach,"One great way to spend the day doing activities meditating and just taking in the Pacific Sun set at Venice Beach. You will not find a Hotel Air Venice on Trip Advisor but I strongly recommend the hotel if you want to stay at Venice Beach, it's right on the beach. And by the way if anybody talks about the homeless population there as negative, let that not be a deterrent, they're quite harmless and bring a certain vibe to the atmosphere along with surfer dudes and cool little restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masterdee71
50,One of the best experiences EVER,"I loved everything about Venice Beach. The smell, the sounds, the gorgeousness.. you could just lie on the beach and melt your worries away.

50,Very nice,"My friend and I were staying in Marina Del Ray and walked the couple of blocks to the Venice Pier. We found a spot on the sand a little ways down the beach and had a very nice afternoon. The beach wasn't too crowded early in the day on a Saturday in May. We walked along the boardwalk a little ways and did some people watching. The beach itself was in very good condition. You can tell that the sand and beach is well taken care of. The water, however, was filled with a lot of seaweed and drift wood. Wouldn't recommend swimming (also because the water was freezing!)We missed out on the normal ""freak show"" reputation that Venice has, maybe we were not in the right spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeyt90

It's got everything, people from across the world, long clean sand beach, ample parking, hotels, restaurants, night clubs, and a lot of entertainment at the famous broadwalk. It's always busy on weekends and specially on sunny days.You can hire a bicycle and roam around across the beach on cycle track, and go upto Santa Monica beach. People do skating and skateboarding, specially childrens.The broadwalk along ocean front is the long chain of small shops, artists, dance shows, singers, and all sort of peoples, it's a happening place as evening approaches.There's an open gymnasium, basketball court, and skateboarding arena.Sunset looks is awesome from the beach as sun sets behind the mountains.Overall it's wonderful and pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanjeevb16
20,Funky and Freaky,This is not the best beach to visit for families. But it is a curiosity. The graffiti art area is constantly morphing. Stop by the nearby skatepark for cringing entertainment.

There are some good eats around, and sometimes the street artists and performers have some really cool stuff.It's very touristy...

40,A new experience,"In mid-April, along with a friend, we went to Venice Beach. Had a great lunch on the main street [many great lunch options], before walking the Boardwalk to the kiosks. The beach is on one side of the boardwalk, and houses/condos on the other. There is a dedicated, paved biking path. The art and architecture of the condos, etc., is quite interesting,as well as the beautiful flowering trees, plants, etc. The beach is beautiful and huge; white sand, and sky-blue water, what more could one ask for! The many kiosk stores are fun to view, and shop in. It takes about 20 minutes to walk from the main street, along the boardwalk to the kiosks, so allow yourself enough time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revdj

Lots of shops everywhere as well as sidewalk tables selling just about anything. Walking towards Muscle beach you are away from the insanity and just sit on the beach if you would like. I do not recommend this place at night due to a pot and drug culture on site.

40,Depends on what you are looking for,"There are several beaches in LA and each of them has different characteristics. (I can't understand why, the same ocean the same sand, may be that is one of the logics of Hollywood :)) Venice might be a disappointment for the ones who expect a clean and neat beach with posh restaurants. But for the ones who want to see something different, it is the best spot to spend time. Several street sellers who sell their hand made stuff, homeless people who are living in tents by the seaside, street musicians who would definitely want you to tip if you stop and listen :), smokers, skaters. One the most fascinating part for me was the skating platform! You can watch highly skilled skaters with excitement. Do not go there hungry if you are picky person about food. There are limited, clean places. Do not miss the sunset! It is amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iremse

It was nice, but I don't know how ""family friendly"" it truly is. I would suggest families head just a couple of miles north to the Santa Monica Pier, where there is more to see and do for kids.I had no idea that any sort of reputable ""doctor"" would set-up shop right on the beach in a small store-front to prescribe medical marijuana. There were probably six or so ""doctors"" offering their services. Lots of street people, kids on skateboards, muscle beach, etc. The beach itself and the pier are much more family-friendly. Don't miss those!Probably my favorite part of the Venice Beach boardwalk was seeing ""Freak Show"". It was just like the TV show, but only a couple of the performers featured on TV. For $5, you can't go wrong. Pictures with the performers are for a donation of a couple of bucks, but it is worth it.One word of warning: the bathrooms located on the beach are absolutely disgusting. Especially if you have little ones, use the restrooms in a restaurant when you get a bite to eat. You won't regret it! Plenty of food options, so grab a bite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabi_kansas
20,Unimpressive and dirty,"I was on a business trip in LA and wanted to visit some of the local attractions. I heard that Venice beach and boardwalk were awesome, so I went. Parking was a challenge and expensive. I walked down the boardwalk and was approached by street vendors who didn't want to take no for an answer. There were drugs, drunks, homeless people and con artists. The streets and shops were dirty. I wasn't impressed at all. I ventured to the beach area and that was filled with graffiti and also dirty. It felt run down and dumpy. I also noticed that the police were strategically placed on side streets, so I assume crime is also a problem. I didn't see the artsy sights like I was expecting. I walked for about a mile to give it a decent chance, but didn't see anything I liked. I won't visit again on my own free will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamoyer

40,Good boardwalk,"Lots to see and do at Venice Beach. Street shows, hawkers, T-shirt stores. Wide boardwalk. Lots and lots of beach. Feels safe enough in daytime. Police presence noticeable but not oppressive. Everything shuts down at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1996OAjamesh
40,Great place for people watching,"No visit to LA is complete without a trip to Venice beach.It's definitely for everyone: it's not glamorous, it's dirty and marihuana smell is so thick at times, you could cut it with a knife.That said, there is a certain sense of joyous anarchy to this place: everything goes and everyone is free to be whomever they want to be. This makes for some awesome people watching. From guys lifting weights at Muscle beach to vendors pedaling all kinds of crafts (and junk), to ""green doctor"" places, it all creates for a unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/102antonp
40,No visit to LA is complete without a visit to Venice Beach...,"As the title says, no visit to LA would be complete without a visit to Venice Beach. Make sure you leave early - the journey from Downtown LA to Venice takes at least an hour in the rush hour traffic and although there is plenty of municipal parking at the beach (great value at only $4 for the day) but it fills up quickly on sunny days.Once you're there, all you need to do is walk the boardwalk between the two piers, soak up the sunshine and marvel at the human circus around you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMcGonigals
40,Quirky! Loved it.,"We walked to Venice beach from Santa Monica pier and we asked security how far it was. We were told about 1 mile and ""you will know when you are there"". He wasn't wrong either! The place is something else... Lots of street vendors, acts in the street and great graffiti art work on buildings.We stopped by muscle beach to watch the bodybuilders, paid $5 to go the freak show and had an ice cream on the beach.I loved the feel to the place and had a pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huffy010512

50,Lots of cheap junk....,"unless you know where to shop. My favorite store is Indigenous, native american fare. Click Souvenirs at 1305 Ocean Front Walk #101 has some good quality jewelry and Khalil loves to bargain. The Wee Chippy has authentic fish n chips, up a side street. Great pizza at the Sidewalk Cafe. Also, good to leave by 4:30 or stay until 7. Traffic eastbound BAD news....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A7159TVcarolines
30,I'd always wanted to visit this famous beach but what a disappointment,"I had a couple of hours spare whilst in LA on business and so I opted to go see the famous 'Venice Beach'. I had no issue parking (it was 1:30pm mid-week) right at the front by the tennis courts (parking ticket cost was US$6.00 for parking 9am-4pm) and was on the main Venice Beach strip in an instant. The strip is a mass of cheesy tourist trap shops and the crowd seemed in the main to be cheesy tourists as well. I took a walk up and down the shops and nothing impressed me, I had a look at the famous 'muscle beach' and then I wandered over to a skateboard park and watched some skaters for a bit while I ate a very nice ice-cream... I then wandered back past the shops, through the tennis courts and back to the car park where I used the public toilets which were in a disgusting state, the door on mine did not lock and the floor was awash with urine, toilet paper and trash and the smell was vile. So all in all Venice Beach was a bit of a disappointment but I suppose you have to do it even if just the once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
40,Venice Beach Boarwalk,"Venice Beach, California, wow!I'm here at last.After seeing it in movies, hearing it in songs and wondering what it would be like to be there.It is Sunday afternoon on a lovely spring day. Sunshine, throngs of people and cyclists.All moving along at a steady pace along the boardwalk and beyond.I had to walk out on to the pier, all the way to the end.People walking, people watching, people fishing, bringing them in one after the other.I enjoyed watching the waves rolling in, and the board riders, the colour of the sea, the transparency, seeing the bottom clearly.Looking back toward shore, a sadder spectacle - many white crosses symbolizing fallen soldiers - lest we forget.Then back to the shore to continue my walk past various stalls and shops: swimwear, sunglasses, dresses, dive shops and pizza.One place that came as a surprise was ""Dr Kush"" where you could buy and smoke marijuana for ""medical"" reasons.I'm sure the ""medical reasons"" listed there covered just about everything.Anyway, i stopped at the pizza place and bought a pizza, which I ate as I continued walking.I walked all the way to Santa Monica Pier, and along the pier to see the rides and amusements.Then it was time to return. I found the bus station at Santa Monica to make my way back to the hotel where I was staying.A long and enjoyable afternoon altogether.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlfredSydney
50,Still leaving on the 6th - very interesting,"Visiting Venice beach is a must if you are around. People are absolutely unique. Okay you will not get anything else than fast food an d souvenirs, but watching a real basket match or people skating in tanga is something you will just do here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauragA5991KB
30,Strange Brew,"Uncomfortably too many ""alternative"" life style types camped-out, and disappointing restaurants. Can't beat the expansive beaches though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/376darwins
20,Bali with marijuana,It's an interesting place but a lot like a first world slum - lots of green doctors who will perscribe anyone with a broken fingernail Mary's Iguana for pain relief which unfortunately attracts all the usual crowd. - my advice? Keep driving till you get to Santa Monica Pier for tourist stuff or south to Redondo Pier for the LA local experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/126pebbles1973
40,Beach with a difference,"This beach was intriguing, quite different to other beaches I have been to but in a good way! Lots happening, very lively atmosphere with lots of different beach shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorSb
30,Not nice...,Hard to find a parking spot. Extremely crowded beach. Few food options. If you are looking for a nice beach to enjoy with your child this is not the place to go. You will even find marijuana shops (for medical purposes though). Public restroom line took me more than half an hour!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alerf
40,Weird and wonderful,"Really cool beach, very different to the other beaches in LA. I personally thought it was fun, very unique and chilled out. Major downside however is that it is a bit rough, a few people made me feel uncomfortable and I definitely wouldn't like being down here alone or after dark. Having said that if you don't engage these people they will leave you well enough alone so don't let it put you off a trip to Venice broad walk. Really enjoyed this area as it's something different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoellePig
50,Planet Venice,"Venice Beach is in a league of its own, to some it could come across dirty and daunting, but the different people we met along the walk to Santa Monica Pier were very friendly humble people, yes there are ALOT of homeless people which is sad, but the locals selling their wares were happy to have a chat and tell you about themselves or the area!! Honestly forget about how they appear and talk to them, they were so friendly and easy going and some of their artwork is amazing and we did buy some!! The work out/gym area with the muscle men is worth watching also! The beach is beautiful with white sand and the view of the pier at night is spectacular!! Highly recommend it for the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsAnthony
40,Trendy.. Great art and boutiques,"A walk in the beach area was interesting... but the best part of Venice I found to be the Abbot Kinney Blvd, a strip of Art Galleries, Boutiques, nice restaurants and cafes. Very nice.. spend their a whole afternoon, window shopping and enjoying the hip scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmenR961
40,For tour only. There are a lot of better beaches in LA,"My cousin took me to a trip at Venice Beach and told me not to expect your typical beach settint. He wasn't kidding. I thought it'd be just all sand, hot babes and waves but what welcomed me was a nothing I expected. It was a haven for crazies. A lot of people doing random stuff like pulling pranks, people doing documentaries, aspiring hip-hop artists forcing you to buy their demos, heck I thought I was at the Hollywood walk of fame all over again. Muscle beach was a sight to see though, with all those steroid bodies pumping up at the beach but other than that I thought Venice Beach as more of a tourist trap. Might as well go to Santa Monica or Newport Beach if you want a proper beach life. But if you want something out-of-the ordinary then Venice Beach is for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMarquez
10,Seedy and unsafe,"Do not visit Venice beach! It is dangerous, dirty, rampant with drugs and smells like urine.Marina del Rey and Santa Monica are close-by, safe and family oriented. Marina del Rey has Mother's Beach, which is great for children, paddle boarding and kayaking. The Cheesecake Factory overlooks the beach and is a good for couples and families. California has many beautiful beach options but Venice is not one of them. If you want to visit a beautiful beach, good shopping, great restaurant options with art shops then visit Laguna Beach, Marina del Rey, Santa Barbara, or anywhere along the central coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FJFunseeker

50,We had a great time there,"Venice Beach is kinda tacky, but lots of fun. The street performers we saw were great. And it is a wonderful place to people watch. Saw a new game called paddle tennis--lots of courts. Nice beach--but we did get tar on our feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannetravel
50,"Awesome beach! Interesting, chill crowd!","The Venice Beach boardwalk is beautiful! Awesome shops and cheap, cool places to eat. The crowd is a combo of edgy, crazy, artsy, but super laid back. I never felt unsafe though. I'd definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FCruzCHI
30,Wouldn't hurry back,"We arrived rather early in the morning as it was the first stop on a private tour. Although it is a beautiful beach, at that time of day, it felt like a hangover. There were a few people around and the type of people varied greatly. Seeing muscle beach etc was cool but I was glad to get out of there. Santa Monica had a much friendlier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LLKKcufuvobp
40,Need a few nights here,At first it was intimidating with so much going on. But by the second day I embraced everything around me and started playing basketball with the locals. I throughly enjoyed my time here and made a lot of friends. I recommend for the younger generation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270jamesz
40,So much space!,"Similar to Santa Monica beach, this is a beach with a lot of space for people to stretch out. There is ample parking and plenty to do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeStrachan
40,Interesting experience,"The Venice Beach boardwalk is a very casual area crowded with skaters, bicycles, and walkers. There are all sorts of street performers and vendors. A stop at Muscle Beach and the Skateboard Park should not be missed. Along the boardwalk are many different stores and eateries. We are not really beach people but the beach looked pretty nice. Parking can be expensive. On the day we went, a private parking lot on North Venice Blvd about 3 blocks from the beach showed a sign for $10 dollars but right at 300pm it went to $15. At the same time, parking on the beach at the end of North Venice Blvd was $6. The beach and boardwalk are great places for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCEBY
30,Confused,"I can totally relate to the confusion in the reviews. We visited this beach twice: on weekday afternoon and on Sunday evening. The first visit was great! People around were walking dogs, strolling , riding bikes and enjoying the weather. The whole experience was very nice and we wanted to go back. Well choosing Sunday night was a bad idea. The whole ocean front walk was covered in garbage. Homeless people were everywhere as well as drugs. I didn't feel safe walking there especially with my toddler. I counted 6 police cars during my walk and I bet they were there for a reason. So if you're not up for extreme and just want to enjoy a nice walk and ocean shore I suggest you go there in the afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W4609JE_
50,Gorgeous!,"Venice beach and Boardwalk is absolutely stunning - lots of street performers as well as a gorgeous beach and of course, the Pacific Ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linzi03
50,A Must See In Los Angeles,"I'm not much of a beach person but having said that this was a favourite of mine when visiting Los Angeles. Parking was a mere $7 for all day parking - a great price in comparison to other places we had visited and it was on the sea front so no walking to the destination needed.A walk along the pier gives magnificent views of Venice Beach and is something to admire, especially if you don't get to be by such a place frequently. In order to explore the stretch of the beach faster than walking my partner and I decided to rent bikes from the beach rental - $12 each for 2 hours hire - not too bad a price and as we were on holiday didn't mind paying the price.The bikes are standard enough mountain bikes typically but fit for purpose. When renting be rest assured your credit card and ID are safe - its just to ensure you don't run off with the bikes. They do not enforce safety equipment such as helmets but if you do object you have to sign a waiver stating you are liable if any accident should occur. As we knew the bike trail was a long flat pathway away from traffic we signed the waiver.Off we set and rode off down the bike trail which was packed with cyclists, rollerbladers and walkers - as everyone is aware of each other no accidents occurred. We biked all the way down Venice Beach and Santa Monica Beach before heading back. Tip - if you like locations that have been in TV shows etc. I'd recommend cycling under the underpass on Venice Beach which funnily enough featured in Season 6 of Modern Family only recently.2 hours was just about enough time but in future I would perhaps rent for a longer time period. There are also an abundance of cafes to stop for a drink or snack along the way at a reasonable price. We did not take a dip in the ocean but it is there filled for swimming, surfing and many other water activities.This was such an enjoyable day and I would go back again tomorrow if I could - I am very envious of people who have this on their doorstep. If you go to Los Angeles - go to Venice Beach !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVRW1011
40,a famous crowded and commercial area,"It is a very casual area. Very crowded, and with nothing beautiful.

30,Nothing like on TV,"I guess I was a bit naive thinking Venice Beach would be like it is in the music video ""I'm Sexy and I Know it"", I was warned by my friends who had been that it's not the place for me. It's not that I don't have an open mind about things but I don't think seeing an obese dog that looks sedated, dressed in a bikini with bills in it's g-string to have photos taken, is anyone's idea of entertainment. Or the amount of homeless people which is very upsetting to see.HOWEVER! My partner and I biked from Santa Monica Pier and back through Venice Beach and I did enjoy myself. There are cool little stalls and people dancing/performing. We went during the week so it was quieter/less to see but ticked off the bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EugeniaNZ
40,Great time for People Watchers.,We went two different days.The first day was in the morning during the week. There was hardly anyone there. I did enjoy walking around and seeing it for the first time.The stores are pretty much the same as any beach front. They repeat after a few blocks.The second day we went it was on a Sunday afternoon. Big mistake. Ha there were so many people it was hard to walk and the wait in line for the bathroom was very very long. Still worth a peak thou.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMiche

40,Touristy and kinda fun!,"Its Venice Beach. There are some funky, fun characters around and a lot of tourists to look at. Along the boardwalk are cheap souvenirs, some not so great art and a few good pieces. Get your sunglasses, tacky tourist t-shirt or henna tattoos here. You can get a real tattoo, too to match all the tatted up people you will see.There is a cool breeze from Alaska and cold water you'll need a wet suit to get into, so even when the map says Southern California, it wasn't what I expected as far as heat goes. But you can get yourself a nice tan, or sunburn (whoops!) - be careful if you're a northerner coming south for the sun like me! It is still more intense than the northern latitudes!From here, you can walk up to the Santa Monica pier along the waves and check out the sun worshipers or become one yourself. Or rent a bike, rollerblades or a Segway and use the path to go miles along the beach.There are also yoga classes here and there on the beach if you are so inclined.It is worth the visit if for nothing else to say you've been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oaktree56

Sure there are homeless sure there is likely drugs (OK the Green Doctors place that would certify you for Medical Marijuana is new) but folks that is life everywhere now.. Still if you stop a while there is great people watching and great people to talk with. Dogs to pet bikes to ride beach to enjoy sun. If you want sterile sanitized artificial go somehwere else.

30,A must when in LA,"Venice Beach was one of my top 10 spots during my visit to LA. It was quirkier then I expected but worth it.

20,Check that off the list,"I can now say that I have been to Venice Beach and I have no need to go back. I'm not sure if my expectations were high because of things I've seen on TV but wow. Everything about it felt dirty & I felt like I needed to hold my belongings close. There was a significant amount of police presence which made me feel better but it also made me wonder if they were so purposely visible because it wouldn't be safe otherwise. The skateboarding was cool to watch & the graffiti was kind of artful other than that it left me flat. Tip: Don't use the public restrooms. Go into a restaurant, buy something, & go there. Or hold it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieNSC

The following Monday we had an opportunity to revisit and I`m glad we did. Hardly a soul around the beach and boardwalk. It was quite interesting to see people from all walks of life. I felt perfectly safe here in the daytime and enjoyed the tourist highlights like Muscle Beach and Gold`s Gym landmark. Take a side trip to the canals which are quite picturesque. I may not go back but I am sure glad I went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonLethbridge

40,"Slumming it? Like ""eclectic"" and ""dirty""? This is your place.","Oh Venice Beach. I was so excited to come here but alas, our love was short lived. Now, I had visions of what the TV shows us and part of it was true. It wasn't very crowded on a Thursday afternoon and I wanted to see body builders and roller bladers and lots of ladies in ridiculous get-ups. I saw a teeny bit of that but mostly i noticed that there was glass in the sand, a lot of trash, a bunch of homeless people, and it smelled like pee. Human pee. Now, if you like people watching, then these things are plusses! Right? I love people watching and we went and watched the skaters for a bit and the surfers. If you want people to panhandle you or try to sell their crappy CD or Jamaican oils to you, then you will love it. I'm sure you can buy virtually anything here but I didn't try. For food, there are many options both on the strip and just off. There are some awesome vintage/thrifty stores and lots of psuedo hippy stuff. also, there are 1000 billion pairs of sunglasses for sale.

Its great for an hour visit but then head elsewhere if you are in LA for a short time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garycU290FM
50,Full Day of People Watching,"We were in LA for a few days. Venus Beach is a full day of people watching, swimming and fun. I suggest that you find full day parking lot. If you do a half day or hourly meter, you'll find yourself going back and adding more time because there is so many things to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198tomf198
10,Do not understand why people go there,"We drove during daytime to Venice beach, as it seemed to be a must-visit-place. First you get robbed by the providers of car-parking. They charge 30 USD independent if you stay a few minutes or for the day. For us this made more than 1 USD per minute of use... The ""beach"" is just a loud and dirty overcrowded lining of sales-booth. The few public toilets add to this nightmare. There are so many beautiful beaches in California, so it is o.k. that this one got ruined but there is no reason to go there..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261bernhardf
20,Where All the Old Hippies Go,"This was my third and last time to visit Venice Beach. I have only gone back because my husband finds it fascinating. Too many panhandlers, homeless, and just scary people for me. I'm a hopper and I wasn't even tempted to go into any stores. Just not my cup of tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susanretired2013
40,Great People Watching But Crowded on Weekends....,"Great Beach, but better people watching. More drug paraphernalia than I remember. Decently cheap food options and tons of goofy t-shirt shops. always worth a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfizzle
50,Iconic place,"Visited and stayed in Venice beach for 3 nights last month and after having high expectations after years of wanting to come here I was not disappointed!Yes it's a little rough around the edges, but I loved the whole atmosphere around Venice, so many interesting things and people to see, as many reviews have commented it's a great place to just people watch while chilling out in 1 of the many cafes along the beach front.I personally think renting a bike is the best way to get around, there's a good bike rental business next to Samesun hostel, that way you can cycle right upto Santa Monica pier-taking everything in on route.All in all a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamjar1234

50,A colourful experiece as always,"Our second visit to Venice beach this time with our daughters. Crazy parking but we were lucky to get a spot for 2 hours free, keep driving down the back streets of the beach there are always people pulling out. Great boardwalk, managed to see a couple of movies being filmed not much to see at muscle beach but still good to see. An eclectic mix of individuals selling their wares. We went during the day so felt safe, I wouldn't recommend at night. A must for newbies to LA and for teens who play GTA...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadaScot
40,Fantastic atmosphere,"Great beach to walk around and enjoy the buzz, I had a 10 hour stop over i I caught the buzz from airport to Venice beach and back for the day.Had a quick swim laid on the beach for awhile and then went for a walk around the area, it has an amazing buzz to it with people riding bikes, skateboards entertainers etc.Also ok for shopping but thing to special about the market stall along beach, although did get some nice sunglasses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O491CUjasons
30,I love beaches,"I love beaches, and Venice is definitely a place to take in some unique sights!

Rent a bike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherl909

50,Relax and hippie,"Is all what you imagine, street art, roller skating, the muscle beach, cool restaurants with beach front, mariguana shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaBoy
40,Biking is the only way to do this,"Nothing beats riding a bike along Santa monica beach using their dedicated bike lanes. One way to do it is get a bus (big blue bus is $1 as an example) to Santa monica pier, walk to the edge, walk back, hire a bike for two hours for 19 USD and ride along the boardwalk until the end. Ride back and then walk your bike through the crowd for a spot of bargain shopping. It's nothing but entertaining with plenty of colorful people and lots of things for you to stop and gawk at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alicefkn
50,Buzz on the beach,"Venice Beaches negative reviews on here are actually very positive reasons to come here! Cool, creative, relaxed vibes exude during the day time. Artists of dance, skill, paint and street art all line up the beach along with the occasional chancing pot heads. We found their pot begging signs hilariously honest. Don't ask, don't get! Sadly we missed the Freak Show as we were too busy mesmerised by the sunset on Santa Monica pier but I have no doubt it would have added to the fun! After dark, there was a few scuffles between the homeless community but it didn't shock us at all. Must do when in Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alysonc253

Heaps of homeless people and plenty of chances to get conned out of your vacation money if you dont keep your wits about you.Muscle beach is a outdoor gym, the beach is nice and plenty to see.

40,"Beach town belies LA reputation for traffic, smog","Venice can be a delight depending on when and where you stay. Comfortable bungalow streets just off the beach can turn from quiet mornings into rowdy Spring break-like afternoons. The south end where the boardwalk ends is relatively upscale while the north end from Venice Boulevard to Rose is a dystopia of homeless vagrants and graffitoed walls. Walk down Abbott Kinney or through the canal ""courts"" and you will be in gentrified, upscale Europe. Walk down Washington Boulevard and you will feel like you're in honky tonk Seaside Heights, NJ. Great restaurants everywhere and even better designer coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LandmarkfinderA
50,Another Day in Paradise,"It's not just a beach it's all inclusive entertainment area. You can sunbath and swim if you like, take a look at muscle beach (where once Arnold was training) and walk around the canals. There are plenty of graffiti around Venice area. Also do not miss Venice Beach Boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozgeun
40,I loved the place and my wife hated it,"I loved the place and my wife hated it, that's the type of place it is. We watched a Bob Marley relation perform a very funny show on the boardwalk, it's a bit grotty and worn, would I return anytime soon?, probably not, but found the experience worth while and interesting. So much potential to amaze it's visitors. Its worth a look if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catfishmick
10,Not a place for the family,"If you're into tattoos parlors, drunks, mentally disturbed homeless, people sleeping and living in the park, and the endless aroma of marijuana then this is your spot to vacation. However, if it's not the kind of culture you vacation and relax in then don't even consider it, even for a great hotel rate. You have to go through this to walk the beach or bike path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9694UMjennyb
50,Authentic LA experience,"Venice Beach is one of the must-see places in LA. It gets busy there on weekends though, so go early. Rent a bike or just walk around and catch the vibe. You can experience the total California scene: surfers, skateboarders, hipsters, psychedelic shops. I like it better than Santa Monica, which I find touristy and overpriced. But the downside is that the restaurants on the boardwalk are few and mostly mediocre or extremely busy – so it's best to park a few blocks away on the nearby main street and catch lunch or dinner there after a couple of hours on the waterfront. The Candle restaurant on the beach though does a fantastic breakfast and is very reasonable – a great way to start the day. The ocean is too rough here to swim though, and with dangerous riptides, hence the lifeguards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinf459
40,Just because,"This is one stop that is a must when coming to the LA area. If you are not used to seeing ""all kinds"" then you may want to avoid this area.Eat, shop, gawk...do it all here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallasnmichellea
10,Disappointing,"I wish I'd read these reviews before going!I was excited to visit Venice Beach because of its reputation of uniqueness. What we found were run down stores, questionable street vendors, lots of vagrants, and a heavy police presence. The beach is nice, but the boardwalks is terrible and seemingly unsafe. Definitely recommend Santa Monica over Venice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2480VSchrism
50,Very beautiful. Lots to do.,"From the Boardwalk to the Beach and everything in between, its a very beautiful and entertaining place to visit.The sand is great, water feels good, and lots of people watching to be had.I like to walk to the Boardwalk and see all the entertainers and the booths of cheap goods to buy.The food is pretty good also. I tend to stick to the bigger joints, but I have heard good things about the smaller ""hole in the wall"" spots also.Make sure to bring cash and stay away from the ATM's around, you can't trust that they aren't rigged in some way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oxx155
30,Ho Hum,"This was not what we were expecting. Maybe it was the time of year (end of February), but it was kind of dead. We visited Venice Beach on a Saturday thinking there would be all kinds of activity along the board walk. But no.The weather was gorgeous...mind you, we are from Canada so anything is better than what was happening at home! :) Even though it was only February, we rolled up our pant legs and waded in the surf for half the afternoon. In the end, that was a lot more enjoyable/memorable than seeing the spectacle that we have heard Venice Beach can be.Warning: the public restrooms at the beach were appalling, disgusting, revolting. Restaurants/businesses near the beach refused washrooms unless you were a paying customer. Wear your Depends!! :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lunchbag917
50,Love this place,Whenever we travel to LA we will always come here for a few hours. Love having a wander to see all the interesting sites and people here. We usually hire bikes and ride along the beachfront down to Santa Monica and back. There is always something to do and see. In saying that I don't stay in this area too late at night as I don't feel all that safe. But this part of LA is unique and not to be missed!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Argy39
30,Venice Beach OK burt nothing special,Venice Beach is OK but nothing special. We were visiting our daughter in the area and Venice Beach was on our list of place to visit during our stay. My wife had seen the beach on different TV shows and wanted to check it out. We walked the boardwalk that was loaded with street vendors. Some of the vendors had nice things for sale but most of it was crap. Most was crafts were handmade but very little of it was very good. Many had very little talent and looked like they threw together anything to try to get people to part with their moneyI have heard Venice Beach referred to as muscle beach but I could see little evidence as to why. There was a small area that had some exercise equipment with some well toned individuals working out but it was not that big a deal.My wife expected to find more street performers out on the boardwalk but we found very few.My overall view was that some hippies left Woodstock and headed west until they could not go any further and ended up at Venice Beach. Now their children are taking over.We were not impressed and will not need to experience the beach on future visits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nygf1
40,Great Place to People Watch!,Venice beach is a great place to spend a few hours in the sun and the boardwalk is a great place to people watch. Not sure I'd want kids with me on the board walk especially if pot heads doing their thing bothers you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomHerlihy
50,great LA vibes,"Great clean beach, with great vibes. Lots of fun stuff to look at. Shops, places to eat, muscle beach, skate park.

50,Amazing people watching!,"Great place for people watching. You will see it all here. Great skateboard park, muscle beach, roller skating. So much going on. Plenty of shops to visit. The best fish tacos we had in LA! I'd go back just for more of those. O the beach was nice also but with so much other stuff going on it doesn't matter if that's not your main purpose here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kittyme2
30,Beautiful beach but adults-only boardwalk and shops,"My 14 year old son was very curious about Venice Beach so we walked there along the boardwalk from Santa Monica Pier. The beach is beautiful but as we got to the boardwalk and shops area of Venice Beach, we definitely saw that it was for adults - from faux ""doctors"" offering $40 medical exams for marijuana (""no pictures"") to scary vendors selling ""art"" with questionable phrases, it was quite an experience but definitely not fun for the whole family. Also note that the bathroom facilities were not very clean. Recommend using Santa Monica Pier facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UKMay05

50,Great bike ride along Venice Beach,Great way to spend the day. We picked up bike rental at Marina Del Rey and it took about 20 mins to ride to Venice. In hindsight probably better to pick up bikes in either Venice or Santa Monica and do a round trip. Found a nice cafe to sit on the sand and take in the views. Our kids loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulineb367
50,What a fantastic Boardwalk,"It is a must to visit if you are in LA, one of the most popular place to visit. And really really worthy! You have to walk there with an open mind because eveything can happen, and everything can be seen. Those are some of the reasons why a loved this place: skaters, vendors, Muscle Area, souvenirs, smoothies, fastfood, bands dancing, weird people... Sunday is the most popular and crowded day.Venice Beach is approximately 20 miles west from central L.A. Street parking, but parking lots are available around all the neighborhood. However finding a spot can be a tough job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmdarok
50,Stunning and satisfying,"One of the most chilled, diverse and beautiful beaches I have ever visited. It has everything from skateboarding parks to quirky shops.

50,The Californian dream,"One of the best beaches in the world. A fun place all year around with trendy hipster shops. Lots of cheap eateries. But this is a place to people watch, from muscle beach, street entertainers and local artists and fortune tellers. And plenty of eye candy. You'll never be bored at Venice beach. Parking at weekends can be expensive and difficult.A must if you are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/researcher59
40,LA at its Finest,"Really cool beach, full of artists, buskers and homeless people. It has a really great vibe.

20,Not so hot a location anymore,I brought some visiting friends to Venice Beach this winter (their idea). The place has gotten a bit seedy. The interesting street acts are gone and you have some pretty lame crud being sold on the boardwalk. rent a bike and go for a ride north. Santa Monica Pier and 3rd Street is more upscale and appealing to us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276kevinp
50,"Absolutely gorgeous, a must place to visit!",Went on a Monday and found parking right by Venice Pier. Rented bikes for three hours and rode to Santa Monica Pier. Best experience ever. Great weather and scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Machela567
40,You must visit VENICE BEACH when in Los Angeles,"You can hardly find anywhere such colorful and vibrant place as the Venice Beach in Los Angeles. It is a place where you will see people from every ethnicity, origin and culture mixed in friendly and healthy harmony.Street performers demonstrate their acrobatic skills, singers their voice and painters will display their paintings. You can also overcome your hunger with the wide verity of foods starting with a pizza slice and hot dogs, or the sit down full service restaurant. And of course you can always walk down to the water and dip your feet in the Pacific Ocean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElieB670

There are merchants selling just about anything on the boardwalk, the beach is so wide and soft and there are plenty of food truck options for a meal. Combined with Abbott Kinney and the Santa Monica pier, this can be an enjoyable day by the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaraMHutchins
40,Lots to see and eat. Must-do!,"As a tourist, this made my must-do list. There is a TON to see and do here- impersonators, musicians, artists- lots of carnival-style food and souvenirs for sale. And access to the beach if you want to swim. Just be wary of parking- very hard to find a spot. We parked a few blocks away on a side street and walked in. They do have a designated lot, but it's usually full. Great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tayrah

30,Should probably see this once in your lifetime.,"This is hippie culture at its finest, and some of the people are really old hippies that are probably still doing the Woodstock life. Venice Beach connects to the others along the coast, so it's worth seeing/passing through more than a destination. Kids at the skate park are amazing to watch; there are also pick-up basketball courts, ""muscle beach"" with a workout center right outside for all to see/join, a graffiti wall which you can paint on for a fee, and a sidewalk/shop area with shops on one side, and local artisans and panhandlers on the other. If you have younger kids or are traveling solo, come in the daytime only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandHopper011

20,Souvenir city with an abundant of homeless,Nice beach which has been spoiled by this junky development everywhere. There was filming on the site further restricting access to the beach. An abundance of homeless people some quite inebriated all over the place. Bathrooms badly in need of cleaning! My view is to skip it and go to Santa Monica or Manhattan Beach for a much more pleasant experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hflatt

50,Eclectic!!,"We knew it was best on weekends so we went on Sunday. Parked at Santa Monica Pier, planned to walk to Venice Beach then go back and spend day at Santa Monica Pier. Didn't go back to Pier until end of day. So much going on in Venice Beach. The muscle Beach area is fun to watch. Outside body building. The beach itself and waves were great. Groups of people all spray paining beautiful artistic graffiti on these long stone walls right on the beach. Only sad part was seeing some of the amazing prior artwork getting covered up. But each new creation was just as great. Skate park we could have watched for hours. Amazing talent. Break dancers in the middle of the street dancing to music. Groups of other dancers. Drum circle begins at 5PM and goes until sundown. Cool rhythms and beats that keep evolving as more join in. At 5:30 there were probably already 20 dummers and about 200 people all around. Lots of crazy characters in costumes etc. Walking distance to Baja Cantina restaurant which was amazing and a couple blocks away from the beach. So cool. But I wouldn't stay at night. I heard it can get a little shady at night. I didn't want to be there with my teenage daughter past dark. But during the day it's a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/croppingfool

50,If you want to see some of everything,"You see it all here. There are tons of street performers with varying acts from the hilarious, to the underwhelming. People will be wearing any and everything. Everywhere you look there is something to see. The food vendors and souvenir vendors can seem overwhelming at times.

30,Relaxing by the Beach,"Went there as a family in late march of 14' but I've been there on business trips multiple times. I must be spoiled by Florida beaches but I'm not very impressed with Venice beach... The boardwalk is neat and sunsets are nice. The water is very cold, the wind has been really high every time I've visited (and since it's off the Pacific Ocean pretty cool), CA beaches have course sand so a little hard on the feet. For people watching, playing volleyball, running on the boardwalk, and general sightseeing it's a decent beach and fairly clean considering it's right next to LA... as for the actual swimming and laying out on the beach... not so much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobn343

Take the time to go see it in real life.We visited in October of 2014 and got to enjoy the beautiful weather while seeing all the sights. The beach, the skateboard park, the gym and everything.If you want, you can take the time to walk the path all the way to the Santa Monica Pier, another local icon and knock those two California snapshots out of the way.Avoid the cafe's and restaurants on the boardwalk, but walk one block away and you've got good options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhU4916TC
50,You gotta see it!,"My husband and I went here while on vacation in Los Angeles. Venice beach is like nothing you've seen. It's miles of activity. All different ethnicities, cultures, ages, and class, just mingling, eating, shopping, and taking in all the beach has to offer. I got a henna tatoo, sandals, 2 massages (one body and one foot), a work of art, a poster, a hot dog, and a fruit cup...In addition to seeing 2 street shows all in about 2 hours time. Parking is only $6.00!! Venice Beach is a must - visit. P.S. I heard also there is an interesting freak-show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chyreller
30,Venice Beach,"Its film poster pretty, the Venice Beach you see in the movies but it is also rather shallow, commercial with a few hippies about ready to provide a stock image. Its nice to view but there are better beaches further down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
50,Relaxing. Music. Sunshine.,People randomly plays music on the street and full of art works along the beach walkway. It is totally relaxing and brings up your holiday mood. You can enjoy the sunshine as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicacW5331ZW
20,Overrated,"We went out of our way to go here as I had pleasant memories of this beach. Finding parking was a nightmare even if you wanted to pay $20. I was so angry driving around looking for a space that we almost left, but found a spot a mile away at the last minute. Standard boardwalk fair: fair foods, street performers, annoying people, crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetSetFiend
50,Popular and easily accessible,"Nice beach within walking distance of shops, eateries, and entertainment including jugglers, dancers, and muscle heads. The strip of golden sand is wide. A concrete bike path makes it easy for those on one- or two-wheels to get around beside the beach. There is a popular skate park next to shady palms if you tire of the sand.Cool mansions with water features along the wide walking path make for good ogling, and there are pockets of grassy, green mounds for anyone to sit and take a rest. Lots of tourist shops. I was there during the day and it felt safe for both unaccompanied teens as well as families. Overall a fun place to watch the diverse crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aerofaze
40,Day time crazy!!,During the day you will find interesting shops and people selling their wares. Late at night gets a lil more ghetto as the shops close and the the beach bums come out to their sleeping spots! lol Over all felt Safe the whole trip even at night and everyone one is very friendly and laid back it seems.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christoherw
40,Enjoyed it twice,Me and my girl friend visited Venice Beach twice while we were in LA and enjoyed it. There are some shops that sell touristy stuff but it is more so better for people watching and just enjoying the scenery and beach. We walked from Venice beach to Santa Monica both times and it was a great walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
40,Nice beach,"This is a nice beach to walk, take a bike or just stroll. We had Coldstone ice cream and tshirt souvenir. This is not far from Santa Monica Pier, so dont muss it. Wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliviaQ
40,You got to do it#@,Cool to stroll down the strand at Venice Beach on a beautiful warm day. You will see everything from Body Builders to chain saw jugglers to vendors selling all kinds of stuff to great little restaurants to grab a bite in. Entertaining but a little sketchy - wouldn't recommend after dark. You got to do it if you're going to Southern California Beaches,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjr88
50,Just like the postcards,"Headed down here for a quick trip in between meetings first thing in the morning as I really wanted to walk down the boardwalk. It's so beautiful, just stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stenkenbaum
40,Good people watching beach!,A concentration of weirdness by beautiful sand and varied surf. Great cycle path stretches beyond Santa Monica. Huge variety of great eating places for every meal. Lots of people to watch and life to observe at no cost!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davug
40,Great place for running,"Venice is one cool place. If you like running, the seafront route from Venice up to Santa Monica pier and back is 10km. The only downside if you are out early is the sight of the poor homeless folk along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/559adenk
30,Ehh..........,"We went on a winter afternoon, not really much to see. Lots of rough looking folks as you got past the rec center. Plenty of people down on their luck, or trying to advertise medical marijuana. Took a quick drive to the canal area - would probably be more fun in the warmer weather walking around the canal neighborhood. Enjoyed walking on Abbot-Kinney - several long blocks of shops, coffee and restaurants. That was probably the best part of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Detailsimportant
40,Bizarre People Watching Opportunity,"We'd heard about Venice Beach and how entertaining it is, and it is that! The beach was lovely and we paid to park right at the beach near the boardwalk, which was very convenient and not too expensive if you're staying awhile. I think it was around $10, but I can't remember exactly, sorry. It was a weekday, so not too busy, and maybe not as entertaining as a weekend would be, but we saw plenty to make us look twice and sometimes laugh. Almost a carnival feel to the shops and vendors along the boardwalk. The public washrooms were pretty yucky. I was glad we went but I don't think I'd go again since I'd prefer a more relaxed, family-style beach. Been there and seen that now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkpruden
30,A lot of fuss about a lot of tat,"Surprised to find the boardwalk at Venice Beach so tatty, run down and full of ageing hippies in denial. Such a beautiful setting on the beach but very little else of beauty! Underbelly of society? Not quite and not genuinely as posing seems to be the order of the day.Loved the short / paddle tennis and the skateboarders which contrasted in exuberance with the lazy, ""me"" and don't care attitude of the souvenir and snack shacks. Some good murals.Eventually found the canals and enjoyed the peace and quiet as well as good views of houses and gardens.LA - feel a little sad rather than glad about the state of Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danglishh
50,Venice Beach,"Really enjoyed walking around.Beautiful scenery and great to people watch.We were there about 4 hours and could have spent longer.Enjoyed peeking in the shops even though it was mostly the same items.Walked all the way to Santa Monica Pier, which was a nice walk.Wish I hadn't previously hurt my foots, would have enjoyed it a lot more.The only down fall is the amount of homeless people and the guys trying to get money for their mixed tapes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nykkyl
50,Love Venice!,"I wish I could live in Venice. The beach is beautiful, and there is so much to see. So many interesting characters and lots of excitement - a little bit sketchy but it adds to the character (nothing you can't brush off). Free spirits all over the place! If you're going to LA, don't skip Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabetha615
30,I prefer Santa Monica,Joe Weiders' Muscle beach is here and you can sit in the stands and overlook the flexing muscles. A couple of medical plant based businesses give this area a worse rating. Lots of homeless folks in the area hanging out. Be careful on the bike/walk path as so many things to look at that many accidents occur.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veni-vidi-vicidotcom
20,Meh,"Beautiful sunset. Thats it, the rest is a dump full of homeless people, marihuana, shirt, street food and souvenir shops. Go to Santa Monica instead",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorraines86
40,Eclectic; not scary,"I see that some people here gave it low marks for the quality of people. I am not a stuck up aristocrat, so I came precisely to hear the stories of those who call this place their home. They were funny and wonderful. There were some talented and not-so-talented artists, but they all had a story. I always felt safe, and had a good time seeing the shops, people and painted walls. I'd like to see less touristy shops (sunglasses t-shirts), but that's my only complaint. And the Green Guys are funny while drumming up business.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherryh351
40,Beach Day and Adventure,"I say Beach Day mixed with an adventure because that is exactly what you get by going to Venice beach. The water is your always great Pacific Ocean, so Beach day is sure to be a blast. Besides the iconic art wall,skate park, and muscle beach, Venice offers street performers, cheap souvenirs, and a Freak Show museum for $5. I can't get enough of Venice because it's a different experience every time. New street performers, new graffiti on the wall, and maybe you'll catch a movie being shot there. This is where the adventure comes in. You can walk to historic Abbott Kinney for a much more upscale experience, or check out the $2 pizza and guys doing back flips off of each other.Beach Tip: I prefer walking a bit past the boardwalk and going into the water in-between Venice and Santa Monica, much cleaner and less crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalkid714
10,What a disappointment!,"I last visited here (1994) and besides the cheap t shirt shops, it was pretty clean with the usual Muscle Beach gym and many locals and families using the beach.Well-it's changed!Full of drugos and even more knock off shops.Would now give it a miss-it's now more of a cess pit of life's undesirables!Caught local bus from here back to downtown LA which was more fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregNS68
30,Worth a walk,"An eclectic place with plenty of sights and sounds. However, like much of the ""tourist spots"" of LA, it's now inundated with tat shops selling tacky tshirts etc. Its also rather depressing to see the myriad of homeless people again, but then warming to see that some of them are trying to sell their skills to make some money (hand carvings etc). LA/America... Help these people! Certainly worth a walk to get a feel for muscle beach, watch the kids play basketball and so on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7nathane
10,An overrated dump,Don't even bother going. A disappointing blot on LA. The place is full of abusive (don't take their picture unless you are ready to pay) so called artists and homeless people. Stay with beautiful Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225mald
40,Funky slice of California life,"I enjoyed visiting Venice Beach because it shows a very interesting side of the culture of California. There are a lot of funky stores and even a marijuana selling store. Not for my particular tastes, but very interesting to see. I ate at a cute little sidewalk restaurant and watched the people run, skate or wander by and it was a wide assortment of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baylorgirls
40,Great Beach!,"I loved the diversity of Venice beach, you'll see all types of people there just for one common purpose....TO SOAK UP SOME SUN!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eekennaj
50,Fun area to visit,I felt like I got a true taste of California visiting Venice Beach. Was very entertaining just walking through. My girlfriend and I walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica at which point we were more than a little tired. Wouldn't recommend the walk back after dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericbL4533SD
10,Worst beach ever,This beach is so dirty and smells like trash. LA could be doing so much better. I didn't like it at all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gummygp
30,Rip off T-Shirts,Whatever you do stay out of the t-shirt shops that apply the Iron on designs. First the charge for the cheap material shirt then for the design and before you know your paying $45 for a shirt. They play the music so loud you don't really get until they ring up the charges. Total rip-off!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcmdonato
10,Great...if you want to see:,"Tacky souvenir shops selling all manner of useless junk while playing loud, obnoxious rap ""music"", seedy looking individuals ""hanging around"", homeless encampments complete with blue tarps and stolen grocery store carts, trash blowing around, $9 to park, and a sad, decrepit beachfront promenade. If you're a fan of the aforementioned things...you'll think Venice beach is...great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waveforest
50,Run on Venice Beach,Forget the Venice canals... Venice Beach is beautiful place but not similar at Venice Italy. There is no romantic atmosphere. Neither boats transportation. Just the canals. But they are very clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vkingeski
30,"crowded, different, good people watching better to rent a bike and get some sun an exercise.","i guess its a place to see because of the beach, but lots of shops wjth same stuff. good share of pan handlers trying to get some cash for entertainment. you'll walk down a long strip an back of different sorts of people with there pets, roller bladers an bikes. its ok...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinebA5016AI
50,Love it!,"This beach is amazing! You can never get bored in this beach because of the boardwalk. You can get a tattoo, eat delicious pizza, go shopping, buy cute souvenirs, etc. Totally rec coming here!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349hopel
50,Liberal beach with lots to seen,"I am from So Cal & love the beaches here ! Who doesn't love CA? Venice is old but has history to it, there is muscle beach and the Broadwalk & cafes. There is bums and yes be careful , but that's anoart of CA that has its own little gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsTeddy
40,You have to visit at least once,"We have been visiting Venice beach for over 12 years, since our kids were babies. There is always something to see or hear. The boardwalk (concrete) walk is about a mile long. It gets really busy on weekends and holidays. Here you can have a bite to eat, walk, listen to music, shop for odd art, ride a bike, see the skating park, play Basquetball or visit the famous muscle beach gym. There is a playground on the west part of the parking lot. You can pay and park at the beach or park in the nearby streets and walk a couple of blocks. On the weekend afternoons you can walk on the beach and go to the drum circle. Lots of people bring their drums and play at the same time and they all get a good beat. You can dance also. For $5 donation you can go inside the freakshow exhibit. As you can see there is lots to do here. You can also go to Santa Monica beach and walk, bike, skate to Venice Beach as they are only a couple of miles a part and walk back or viseversa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,Fun any time of the day,"I don't think anyone goes to Venice expecting a pristine, unspoilt golden beach. It is fun though in so many ways. A stroll at dawn will allow you to interact with the locals, during a sunny day it's busy with tourists, stores catering to diverse needs, good quality cafes and restaurants, etc. To me it is LA! Venice has something for everyone! Yes, there is an abundance of homeless people, and yes, they can be 'in your face' but this is Venice. This time around I took my wife and kids, we all had a great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebigdaz
20,"Dirty, crowded, and a tad scary","If you like an ocean front walk full of tattoo parlors, freak shows, junk shops, nasty restrooms, homeless rooting in the garbage cans all with the smell of weed in the air then this is the place for you. I can tell you as a family friendly traveler I was not impressed. We drove around for near an hour trying to find a place to park and if we weren't meeting a group there we wouldn't have tried so hard. The plus side was the sunset was beautiful and the pizza we got from Big Daddy & Sons Pizza was very good. My daughter (age 11) was not happy about hanging out and couldn't wait to leave. Want a nice beach - try Huntington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiffany830
50,Beach is beautiful,"The beach is easy to find with signs leading the way. Ample parking for a reasonable fee which is good for all day (no leave/return though). Beach is very wide which gives people plenty of room. Tons of volleyball courts. Sand is light and awesome, not hardpack. The pier goes out quite a way is a great place to watch a sunset. Tons of activity around the pier including surfers or just watching the waves crash in. Plenty of tourist stores to grab that stuff, some cool restaurants and bars. There are some interesting characters roaming around, no doubt about it. Just be aware of surroundings. Felt safe the entire time. Enjoyed it and returned multiple times during the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KampOC
50,True grimy feel for artists and locals,"I love Venice Beach. As a local to Los Angeles I know there's nothing like Venice beach.It doesn't have the glitz and glam as you'd get from Santa Barbara or Malibu beaches but it has young art and culture.You'll find the boardwalk filled with artists, jewelers , soap makers, and all kinds of vendors selling their products.Great prices! It's a deal lovers dream.There's a number of stores that sell cool t shirts and some great souvenirs for tourists.You'll see some stables like the guy in the bikini and the rollerblading guitar player. Take photos & have fun. Dress comfortably and try the fruit from the fruit stands! Expect the usual beach bums with funny signs.There's a variety of little restaurants and places to eat.You can take your food and enjoy it on the beach.They have muscle beach where you'll see guys work out and basketball courts that are always full.Locals love it and tourists will really get a locals feel of Los Angeles by coming here.If you want something more clean and glitzy go a couple of streets up and go up and down on Abbot Kiney.Don't forget to check out the Venice Canals while you're here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
40,Nice beach...not so much after dark.,"Venice beach has a great feel to it with lots of boardwalk vendors and plenty of space. We got there to catch the sunset with our kiddos and dogs after a nice dinner nearby. Great sunset, very quiet with not too many folks on the beach. We decided to take a little walk along the boardwalk on the way back to the car. Needless to say, we were disappointed about the throngs of not so savory characters that lined the boardwalk making us feel less than safe/welcome - luckily we were happy to get out of there without incident but not sure we would venture there again with our children after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missanthropchi

30,Only need to go there once,We popped in to have a look around Venice Beach. Lots and lots of cheap tourist shops selling the usual garbage. It's rather dirty around the shops as well and probably not somewhere you'd want to be by yourself. Lots of odd people wandering around. Been there and done that. No need to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyndyj2016
50,"Sun, sand,fascinating people","Venice is fun. Got a few hours? Take your dog, your companion and you will have a great time. This is a place to stroll, bike, skate while eating and people watching.. There are restaurants of all kinds, fast food to upscale, sidewalk entertainment, and all kind of ""stuff"" for sale. It is my favorite place to visit when I have a free day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonnie55555
40,Landmark,"After a considerable drive from our hotel we arrived to find the pristine sand and ocean of Venice Beach. The boardwalk is bustling with happy tourists, jostling for position in an attempt to secure that once in a life time picture. Take the time to eat in one of the restaurants, decent food at decent prices. Cabs are easy to find; however, try not to leave during peak hour traffic, it makes for an expensive cab ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460crashc
40,Very Interesting but Not a Place Children.,"It was my first time there. Lots of things to see at the beach and in the town itself. All walks of life. I would not recommend bringing your children here, at least not on promenade with the gawkers and street artists. Some of the people are very sketchy...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonf991

40,Great beach,Interesting place to people watch. The beach was nice and clean. There was plenty of parking available. The food I had on the boardwalk was a bit average. I highly recommend the bike rentals and peddling down to the Santa Monica pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anonymous59185
10,awful place,"not threatening, just dirty and makes you feel uncomfortable, there is no place to eat that looks clean in the main part of the beach and just lots of young drug users looking for money or more drugs, public toilet are disgusting smelly and dirty, don't go there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4443FWdavidc
40,Great for a Morning Stroll,"We had never been to VB before and on the morning we were leaving LA, we decided to stop for a look around. It was a wonderful beach to stroll. It was very clean. There was loads of activity everywhere. They had great walking paths that weaved in and out of beach area, shopping, cafes and volleyball, flag football, soccer, and beach exercise groups. It was nice that there was a parallel bike path so you weren't fighting the bikes and longboarders.We enjoyed walking down to where the shops and cafes were. The parking wasn't a bad price for 2 hours and it made the perfect amount of time to get a nice walk in.I wish we had more time to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jchuran83
30,Fun to walk around,"We went on a Monday so it was pretty quiet. We had t leave about the time things started picking up so we just got the full brunt of homeless people living on the street. Sat down at a patio bar and listned to some live music. it was ok, close to the airport. Can now say I have been to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4missym
40,I've heard it's the biggest attraction after Disneyland.,"Pacific Park a small amusement area on the north end. Great for people watching and musclemen, skateboarders and such. Plus there is the beach. Parking can be a nightmare in the summer (take public transit if possible-I've heard the EXPO like will almost go right to it)I'd say visit it, if only to have the LA beach experience.(note 'bathroom facilites' was checked-but I don't recommend them they aren't too clean, 'go' before you go there or find a place with cleaner public bathrooms)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surprisedtraveler

Abbot Kinney has so many good restaraunts, shops galleries and the best coffee shops in LA (blue bottle & intelligensia) The boardwalk is still the best people watching freak show in town!!

50,Bohemian,"Venice Beach: an amazing gathering of people from all walks of life. Very California style and bohemian in nature with so much to do; you can layout in the sun, go swimming, surfing, shopping or eat/dine along the famous boardwalk or along the more trending shops of Abbott Kinney. Just about everything is within walking distance or a short bike ride which is a more enjoyable way to experience Venice Beach. A definite must when visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9184JVjoem

50,A view of the crazy side of LA...,"When visiting LA, a must stop is Venice beach area. The best way to see it is to park at the Santa Monica pier, rent bikes and ride south to the Venice area. You will know when you have arrived at the ""core of crazy"". That will be Venice Pier. Ride a little further south and you will arrive at the Abbott-Kinney area of great shopping. My preferred plan would be to ride the bikes back to SM pier, continue a bit north to enjoy some calm, beautiful beach views, return the bikes to the rental and then drive to Abbot Kinney area for some great boutique shopping and dining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommaonthegogo

Don't worry about actually staying on the beach because its really only great for one day. Once the sun goes down the beach closes up and hobo's go to sleep there. The sights and pretty crazy during the day and can be a lot of fun to watch. Take plenty of small bills and don't miss the freak show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegas-rockstars

Intrigued with the freak show $5 to see but photos and specialty acts do cost a donation for each. So bring money or stay home plus be wary of the paid parking lots.

There are interesting things to see - Tatoo, art works by local artists like painting, handcrafts by different recycled materials, clothing...etc. There are coffee shops and restaurants where you can sit down and enjoy sunset. On the beach, there are skating park for your adrenaline, many volleyball courts. The safe bike path extends from Santa Monica all the way to Redondo Beach. You do not need to compete with cars on the road, except some part of Marina Del Rey. A very beautiful ride.

Actually worse than an outhouse at least in those they have those little pink deodorizing disks that help try to mask the smell! So many homeless people it was so very very sad! And don't even get me started on the pot! Seriously it smelled like weed every where. We stopped toilet out daughter play on the beach and the play ground was awful people and their kids were rude.

40,Plenty to see and do...,"I spent the weekend in Venice Beach in January. The weather during the day was warm, the beach inviting and I saw more things than I could possibly take in - including Muscle Beach. Walking, biking or skating is the thing to do when you're not basking in the sun on the vast beach area. There are plenty of beach stores, restaurants and street performers. Santa Monica Pier is close by (even if you get there by bus). At night it cooled down quickly in both the temperature and the activities. Restaurants and stores closed by 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. However, the main street about 3 blocks away from the beachfront remained open a little longer.There are two things I must mention: 1) there's a large homeless population and 2) there are a lot of ""smoke shops"" so BEWARE. There was also a great police presence in the area during the day and at night. I had a wonderful time during my trip. If you're in the L.A. area, I suggest that you take a day to visit Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldengirl1019

20,Beautiful but sad place...,"- No offence to Americans but most of their tourist spots are mainly a make-believe. After I visited Venice Beach, there was no such thing as living the America dream. It is sad seeing homeless people sitting on the sidewalk of the beach all doped up without a home. They were left alone without any help. Tourists continue visiting the beach and they must have seen homeless people along the beach but they were too afraid to help. It is a beautiful beach but truly a sad place too.- This beach is much more peaceful that Santa Monica Beach. It is better to start your bayside tour from Venice Beach then slowly walk up to Santa Monica Beach.- Lots of cheap surfing shops with some markets where people sell weird paintings or arts.- It is a good place to have a stroll but not sure how safe it would be at night?- I cannot see anything else that attracts tourists to visit the beach except the name itself.- A corndog cost about $2.75, tasted good, no complains. Probably cheaper than the ones at Santa Monica which cost us around $3.50.- I would recommend anyone to visit this beach during the day, no need to stay overnight.If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelQueenie365

40,Southern California Classic!,"I grew up in northern California in the 70 's & 80's, and our image of southern California was one of laid back beach life and dudes on skateboards shredding by the sand when the waves were down. I was delighted when I moved to Los Angeles in 1995 and learned that is, in fact, the reality. And this is where it happens. People who complain about Venice Beach just don't get it. The sand is perfect, the water (while a bit chillier than I recall in years past) is too. I had to be down there recently at 8 am on a Sunday and I pulled up 40 yards from the sand and parked. I walked down the quiet, porticoed sidewalk made famous in Orson Wells' ""Touch of Evil"" (it stood in for Mexican scenery, as Chuck Heston also did)....The smell of the ocean and the slight chill on the sunny winter morning made me feel like I was traveling in some exotic, worldly city. And I was - only I live here! It made me realize what we forget is right in our backyard - California perfection. And yes, I also passed a homeless encampment on that block. A woman was washing some dishes in the alley. But that has always been life at the beach. Pretty much any metropolitan beach will have that going on. But they are people too, so you deal with that or you don't go to the beach, right? If you are visiting Los Angeles, don't miss this slice iconic SoCal experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntravelguy

I didn't reply and sat at my gear and waited for other people I was performing with to come out. Two did, the three homeless guys moved away and one smirked and nodded at me.

30,Let the Freak show begin....,"Let me start by saying that I have been coming here over thirty years! I have lived 10 of those just a block North.So you are visiting Venice Beach, you came from a nice town somewhere east of California. Be prepared to be amazed, come in Spring, Summer or Autumn, CA hates Winter just as much as you do! Temperatures can be in the 40's or 50""s.... After you get over the long lines of 18 to mid twenty year olds standing in line to get medicinal marijuana, presumably for that chronic debilitating illness called life. You can then begin to enjoy Venice Beach. Cheap trinkets abound, art that you have never seen before and some that you will never want to see again are presented for your enjoyment from multiple vendors along the boardwalk, who doesn't need a tattooed Marilyn Monroe poster with her toting a gun? Wow! I didn't know that there was a dire need for Henna tattoos, but you will find no shortage of purveyors of the art. Some ""trendy clothiers"" are trying to commercialized this cesspool of humanity, good luck! You will find several good restaurants and bars. But more vendors all hawking their substandard junk food. Be prepared to be amazed by an old ""Jew"" ( yes, folks, his Ima (ee-ma) Mom would be proud) dressed in silver on roller skates with an electric guitar to annoy and bother you, a 30 year plus local. The beach is there to impress you with quite a few beach babes on bikes in the summer. Enjoy! The homes on the boardwalk cost more money than you will ever have in your retirement account. Also don't let the salt water corroded metal parts of these homes come in contact with you. You will also find homeless men that enjoy a good roe with each other, do not make eye contact! I used to walk this boardwalk every Friday afternoon in Spring and Summer before going to work. Yes, the street art is fabulous, some people have great talent, the beach is awesome, the gym is OK, the vibe is electric.

We had an enjoyable lunch there was a decent view but it wasn't really what I imagined compared to say famous beaches I’ve been to in Europe or Australia.I think if you want to go there and ride a bike or skate to DelMar or over to Santa Monica that would have been relaxing. The restaurants in the area are so so, more like run down cafes here and there. At the beachfront you will see big signs where the govt won’t allow dogs, no alcohol, no overnight visitors, no bikes in the path, no this, no that.I wouldn’t describe the people there as “creepy” as per some posts I read below – but don’t expect this to be the posh well-dressed RodeoDrive crowd at all. There are all sorts of life. Some (really bad) artists trying to sell some work. Some youngsters on skateboards, some homeless people. So it may be intimidating for some. We spotted 1 or 2 police cars when there.The beach itself is pretty, the palm trees are nice.

It seemed like most of the ""vendors"" we're homeless people who had all their possessions with them. They were dirty and downright disgusting.If you really want to visit, then go straight to the beach, then back to your car. It's definitely NOT a place to take your children.

I love Venice, people watching is always fun here, great restaurants, play basketball, take a stroll right by the shore and if like you can just walk over to Santa Monica. This is my 2nd home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindyr561
40,Iconic beach,"We didn't spend a long time here, but you can't go to Los Angeles without visiting Venice Beach! We stopped here after seeing the Santa Monica Pier, and it brought back many memories of various movies and tv shows. There were all the usual tourist shops, but we loved watching the skateboarders. It was great fun watching them drop down in the bowl and then come flying up over to top. I got some really good pictures here. We didn't really see some of the stranger sightings here, but then we didn't walk that far or stay that long. Glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111murielp
50,My first visit to Venice Beach.,"As a East Coaster I loved seeing Venice Beach. The carnival like atmosphere was reminiscent of my childhood years on the Jersey Coast.Definitely a daytime outing given some of the seedy types hanging out here. Nike have a big semi truck there allowing skaters to test their newest skater shoes, fun to watch.Bought a silver ring here from a local vendor after we negotiated a reasonable price.One of my friends I was with had never been here either so we laugh about the fact we will never forget the fact we can now both say, we are not Venice Beach virgins! A fun day with great, long time friends. A memory I will always cherish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobR2012
50,freakshow in LOS ANGELES!!!!!,everyone that has a gimmick is here. i mean they have anything fm tattoos to the herb doctors for your medical marijuana card for 30 dollars. great place to take in the scenes and a good brisk walk. be very cautious as not to stare to much because they will come at you and ask for money justlooking at them. snake charmers to hobo's playing the guitars and drums!!!!! everyone has some kind of art for sale and some things are pretty original!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewH408
30,Worth a visit to see the local freaks,"Skateboarding dogs, octogenarians in bikinis are just the start. The beach itself is lovely but there is a total lack of decent bars and restaurants and places to sit out and just people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlogan1302
30,Weird and wacky,"If you have a spare hour or three, head to Venice Beach to see the wonderfully tacky side of the good old US of A. Lots of outdoor stalls and cheap food. Recommend coming during the day, as it gets a little less secure at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonsonator
40,Very Interesting,"A very interesting place! Full of characters.We walked in December, the weather was good and the place was teeming with people, did not feel too crowded , Look out for the bearded lady and the cycling dwarf, apparently there is a snake with 2 heads in that place!Lots of street dancers, muscleman and personalities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick5963
40,Wide Variety,Spent a couple of hours walking Venice Beach on a recent Wednesday afternoon. There were all walks of life inter mingled on the street and beach. It was a pleasant afternoon with plenty of different personalities to observe.My only disappointment was the street dancers who were not overly polite to the public and kept saying that the show was about to start. We waited for a while and then walked away as did many others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adkeats
30,Pretty Grubby,"Pretty grubby place, I hired a bike from Santa Monica and headed down to Venice, it's a bit dirty and there a questionable characters around but it's not like a super dangerous place, it's just not somewhere you would hang out for a while in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441LukeB
40,Good atmosphere !,"We got the bus from downtown (lots of characters on the bus, including a Marilyn Monroe), Venice Beach was busy, with lots to see on the broad walk, skate parks, basketball courts' an outdoor gym, with people showing off their muscles. Lots of things being sold along the way, lots of people watching, a nice beach backdrop, a good walk to Santa Monica where we got the bus back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomorrowsj
40,"From Mussle Beach to ""Wackey Tobacee""","Having family in Marina Del Ray, we very often take a stroll along the walkway to ""See the Sights""Including the people, the stores, the eateries, skateboard park, the mussle park, and the beach.Not a lot to do other than shop, eat, see ""The Doctor"" if that is your trip, and people watch but anFun way to spend an hour or so",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbE8998FX
30,Fun to hang out,"Chill place, fun to hang out. But not really a lot to do. Most exciting thing was someone's parrot doing tricks. I guess more fame than real entertainment these days. Unless I missed the real fun. Restaurants and souvenir shops around, so that is OK too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyR956
40,A must see.,A great walk to see an eclectic crowd of people. Check out the skateboard park and interesting shops along the boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityHopper1010
50,WONDERFUL!!!,"It was even a rainy day and this was a lovely trip! Lots of great food, entertainment and shopping plus the gorgeous beach!Slight homeless situation, but still really nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agmilano1
50,The wackos of the world unite!,Venice Beach is a really unique experience. It's very cool to see the shops and the people and the performers of various types. It's like all the odd people in the world gathered together in one place. There are also a few medical marijuana dispensaries along the boardwalk which are kind of entertaining. Definitely worth coming to for an hour or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pabloB22
50,Nice place to visit and walk,"Wow! Very different from PC Beach in Florida! Sand is brown but nice waves and lots of surfers! Huge beach area for recreation. Interesting shops along the boardwalk. Lots of homeless and you can also see a real Marijuana store! If you like people watching, this is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12jennifera
50,Great place to see,This place is worth a look. It is nothing like what you see in the movies. There are a lot of characters there and plenty of shops/stalls to have a look at. I would only do one day there but it is definitely worth going to. I was surprised by how many homeless people were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3warwickb
10,We Didn't Get It,"I'm sure a lot of people love it here, but we, quite frankly, didn't get it. The surrounding beaches are beautiful, as are the beaches in Venice Beach, but overall the surrounding area is a kind of laid back. Venice Beach is anything but. Its overly arrogant. Its trying way to hard to be trendy and cool. Its trying to be so cool, that its too cool for cool. Go there if you want to be yelled at or told to ""look away"".If you want southern California, go somewhere else. Anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregS798
50,Fantastic BIG beach,"Great bike and walking paths plus the odd roller blader and scooter rider....we walked to Santa Monica and back.Awesome for people watching, there are all kinds of interesting characters along Venice beach....lots of buskers, market stalls, locals, tourists and homeless all mingling together to make for a great way to spend a day. Lots of eateries from sit down to takeaway. We sat and had a relaxing lunch and spent a pleasant couple of hours watching the world go by. I can see how some wouldn't like the vibe of Venice beach but we think it's a must do whilst in LA even if you only have a couple of hours go see for yourself....like no other beach we've been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy-wanderes
50,"Must see! Not necessarily for its beauty, but for its charisma","The beach itself is just like many others along South Cal, but the ambiance along the walkway close to the shops by the beach is quite unique.All types of vendors, musicians, freaks (they call themselves this way, so I assume I am not offending anybody), people dressed in multiple and fascinating ways... you name it.On a sunny weekend, even in Winter, you will see action here.There is so much variety that it is hard to recommend a coffee place, or a restaurant, or a shop, or a street vendor. If I need to pick one thing, the drummers session on the beach or by the walkway is worth seeing. Only happens on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, an hour or so before sundown.In the summer, almost one hundred drummers get together, with no official invitation and with no other purpose that have some fun while finding a common rhythm. People walking by tend to stop and dance for a while, completing the whole ad-hoc show. At some points it may be deafening. If you have any percussion instrument, bring it with you. No invitation or special permission needed.Even if you do not know how to play drums, you can mingle and have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colesterol
50,"Beautiful beach, great people watching!","My boyfriend and I stayed on Venice Beach at the Cadillac Hotel in October 2014. We absolutely loved it! You could walk forever (or rent bikes and really cruise) and there were so many shops and restaurants/bars along the way. The most interesting part were the people. So many street performers and some of them were very talented. I didn't feel bothered or threatened by any of them at any point. Even at night we felt safe, the police did a good job of patrolling up and down the beach, and we never saw or had any problems.We loved Venice Beach and will definitely go back!! If ""a little rough around the edges"" isn't your thing though I would suggest staying on the Santa Monica side which is much more upscale but if you like the fun and quirky side of life then you'll love it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderWoahman
30,Gotta experience Venice Beach at least once in a lifetime!,"Out of towners must be sure to plan an afternoon trip to the iconic Venice Beach boardwalk area - it is a people watchers dream! You will see some memorable characters - performers and beach goers alike! There is an seedy quality to the area, with a touch of crazy Fo sho, but super entertaining none the less. This is not the kind of beach you want to necessarily bring the family to for a nice day at the beach- so don't pack the cooler and sand buckets (there are many more such beaches along hwy 1 for that)--- this is like a stroll the boardwalk, grab a bite, watch the groms at the skate park & colorful character kind of beach area ...... And yes, the still have the little beach side out door muscle gym made famous by Arnold and Lou back in the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissyco
30,A Bit Tacky!,We went to Venice Beach as part of a LA bus tour. It was December but quite a bright sunny (not warm) day and the area was still very busy with lots of tacky souvenir shops. Lots of dodgy looking characters around trying to sell you CD's (that are apparently empty). I'm glad I've been to see it but it's nothing to write home about. I wouldn't feel safe there on my own or especially at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823carmelf
50,Interesting Beach Town,"Venice has a very nice beach and boardwalk. If you like to walk, run, or ride a bike it is great. I went swimming in January. You will meet many interesting people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayb858
40,Stay in he Abbott Kinney ares,We stayed in a condo a few blocks from the beach in near Abbott Kinney. Lots of great places to eat and shop within walking distance. Really nice bike paths along the beach - can easily bike down to the Santa Monica pier. The boardwalk is crazy on the weekend but calmer during the week. Can be a little intimidating with the number of homeless people. The canals are beautiful. Glad we came!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/722LauraD
50,Perfect summer location,"I loved it. Massive beaches. Side shows, side shops and food. Massive walkways to skate and walk down. Huge clean beaches and volleyball nets and all. Perfect for a summer vacation",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alyssssymarie1990
50,Something different!,"Love, love, love Venice Beach. I must recommend that this beach isn't for everyone. I thought I'd do a little exploring in my fav city of LA, and decided I'd go check out the well known Venice Beach. The environment isn't for everyone, but it was completely awesome for me. A early 30 yr old male. It's a young adult hot spot, not for the older generation. Weed smoke in the air, tattoo parlors, muscle man outside gym. And you can't forget the infamous basketball courts. The beach itself ends up connecting to Santa Monica beach which is more should I say uninteresting. One spot that I'd like to mention that is a must see before you leave is the Venice Beach Canals. It's a mile walk off the beach and into a community of homes, and it's really really pretty. Could be prettier when they clean the canal, the locals are real nice and don't pay you any mind taking photos. They filmed one of my favorite shows right there, ""Californication"". If you like good vibes and want to feel young, energetic, Venice Beach is for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358ronaldg
20,Tacky,"I went there 20 years ago, and I think it is just as tacky now. People selling all kinds of junk as art . Not worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaI431
40,"Beautiful views, interesting people, and cool vendors.","Parking is $6 all day by the beach. We arrived at noonish and had no problem finding parking. If the real world and all it's beautiful people scare you then this is not the place for you. There are homeless people here, some of them talk, laugh, and sing to themselves but not one of them was rude or out of line with me or my family, although a big buff guy who was flexing outside of the fence at muscle beach was rude to my husband because he had on his Go Pro Camera and was recording. There is plenty of carnival type food to choose from, fresh fruit, and small stands selling knick knacks and souvenirs and there are little shops selling shirts and souvenirs. There are also Cannabis clubs and smoke shops. You can rent bikes and take a stroll along the paved bike path to Santa Monica. There are basketball courts and playgrounds for the kids. There are many artists selling their beautiful work out there too. I have been here once before and I am glad I came back with my kids and will definitely come back again I'm a couple of years. Bathrooms are filthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isisg81
20,Only if you MUST,"The beach itself was typical for this area. I certainly would not have walked barefoot in any sand near this area! Water did look dirty. My suggestion: if you do find yourself in this interesting area, go inland a couple of streets and explore the quiet canals (hence Venice) and the lovely homes and waterways!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifesAnAdventure216
40,Go to the Freak Show,At Venice Beach and all there is to see and shop not to mention the beach and my granddaughter says oh just remembered the Freak Show is here. She saw it on TV and wanted to go. Well it is $5 to get in and she thought it was great to see all the people that she had seen on the series. She got to take pictures with most of them. Worthwhile just for the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RicMar
40,Fun!,"It is exactly as advertised. Fun, weird and great for people watching. Definitely worth wandering along the beach boardwalk ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerapah
30,Touristy but Fun,"One of LA's most visited sites. You have the street vendors, performers, skateboarders, drug addicts, legal marijuana sells, and a wide variety of other characters. Well worth working up and down the boardwalk to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aarond712
50,Way cool,"For a 50ish Midwest conservative couple from a small town of 1500 people. Wow, this place was way too cool! We really enjoyed seeing all the sights, sounds and aromas! What a flash back to our lives in the 70's. It was fun to see people just being themselves and living life. All the neat little tent type shops selling trinkets of all kinds added to the overall experience. We shopped with confidence, ate at the food vendors, watched people dancing, skateboarding, riding bikes, flying kites and enjoying a day at the beach! The views were spectacular and we wished it had been warmer and we could have spent the entire day basking in the sunshine. We will definitely make this a destination on our next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R440Richards
20,Not so great,"This place is probably a heaven for skaters, hippies, and homeless. Cops giving out citations left and right on the beach even on the least crowded day of the year (Xmas morning). The public restroom wasn't horrible at the time we used (you don't have much expectation anyway). The beach is nice and it is good for a short walks. Like everyone said, this beach is not good for family with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leep770
50,Time warp.,Beach great. Boardwalk full of varied interesting people. Lots of talented people and a few weirdos but always entertaining. Great cafes and shops. Just go with the flow and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevthetyke
40,Still Interesting,"Did another walkabout/stroll through Venice Beach day after Christmas. Quite different than in the hotter months. Still active and busy, fewer vendors along the way but still an interesting and fun walk. A few characters about and lots of runners, dog walkers and couples having a leisurely stroll",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyoty
50,"Lots of fun, GREAT PEOPLE WATCHING spot","Had been to CA about 10 times but Venice Beach had always managed to elude me. Finally got around to getting there and it was all I expected and more. All sorts of neat things to see for individuals, couples or family even--not all families. Go a bit further and you're in Santa Monica and that is a great spot too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalGold
50,OMG!,"This place is full of every different kind of person you can imagine, and then some. There are amazing artists, drummers, and atheletes to watch. You can ride a bike, roller blade, jog or just people watch. WARNING!! Lot's of ""medicinal"" maruijian smokers all around. On a different note, we went for a walk at night, it was a little seedy. Other than that, it's a great place to vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3128JSsharong
20,Don't Waste Your Time,"The beach is very nice, but the rest of Venice Beach is a dump. Tons of tacky shops line the main walkway. Muscle Beach is an antiquated gym. There are restrooms on the beach, but they are nasty. Buildings have bars on the windows and doors. If you have a desire to say that you have been there, by all means go, but don't expect very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artskillman
40,A great place to people watch !!!,"We have been up and down the boardwalk every day that we visited, you just can't get bored. There are people from all walks of life , doing their thing.Street performers, artists, food along the way. Tourist shops are abundant with entry of shirts and souvenirs. Watching outdoor sports of all kinds.A place you should experience when visiting this wonderful city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/537seanw
50,No trip to LA is complete without a stop here,"Love the vibe and the people watching. It's a great place to hang out for a couple hours. It's fun to hang out and watch the people working out, playing handball, skateboarding, and the street performers. There are lots of typical little shops with every souvenir you could need. We enjoyed an hour or so here in the afternoon, but then about 4:00pm we noticed the crowd started to change. A fight broke out in the street (including weapons and police), homeless people appeared in hoards, and it started to feel a little ""rough"". We decided it was time for us to go before the sun set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoMama33
40,Quirky and cool,If you are looking for diversity and fun then Venice beach is it. Hire a bike and cycle down the beach path. You will meet all sorts of interesting characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natashas286
50,Awesome beaches and coffee shops,"Love the beach, vibe and all the coffee shops in the area. Great place to relax and still feel you are in a cosmopolitan city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwurbina
30,Beach with people watching,"Visited to see muscle beach and walk along the beach. Boardwalk has standard Boardwalk shops. The beach has a nice bike lane, basketball courts, platform tennis and handball courts. It is definitely a place to go people watching. Otherwise, not a place you need to spend a real long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norjeff2
20,I felt unsafe,"it's one of those places that you have to go to see yourself but:- quite dirty- lots of homeless people- lot's of pot and the smell of it in the air (this made me think that people must be peaceful :)) - doctor is always on duty...- quite crowdy- i think that US in general is safe place but Venice Beach was one of those places where I wouldn't take the turn from the main street to one of the alleys as I would be afraidI dont think this place has anything to do with artists, but as said at the beginning you got to see yourself to know that you do not need to come back.if you are a surfer or skateboarder you might like it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krakowiak81
40,Fascinating but there are better famous beaches,"Very much worth a visit to soak in the sights, culture and atmosphere but very commercial and not the relaxing beaches found down Malibu way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesH659
10,Ghetto,The sand is soft. The water is blue. The homeless are everywhere. The waterfront stores are dumps. The worest part are the drugs. This is a place to buy drugs. It is dangerous. Do not take the kids. A naked man ran through the hotel lobby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesc408
40,Fun exotic place,Love Venice beach! It's dirty and there is a lot of pot but it's fun. Don't go unless you want to see craziness. We seen a girl get punched in the face while she was writing her skateboard. Very crowded but I love crowds. Beaches aren't that great but still fun! Lots of great little restaurants on the boardwalk. I had the best fish tacos of my life on the boardwalk! Plus it's only a mile walk away from Santa Monica pier. Will be going back again this March so excited for our visit coming up!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136mariahm
30,Good for a quick visit,"We had a quick Sunday visit here. Enjoyed looking at the artwork for sale on the street market, and had a hot dog from one of the takeout places there. Interesting to see the skate park and the artwork on the buildings there, but I don't think I'd recommend it for a full day out. Get some great views across the bay, though, so it's worth taking a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/292judep
50,Amazing place for the day.,Street shows. Nice stores. You can rent a bike. Rollerblades. Skateboard shows semi professionals.Good Resturant. Enjoy the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3747QD_
10,Not for old ladies,"It was late afternoon on a weekday in June. We drove around forever looking for street parking--thankfully we didn't have to pay for our short visit. We didn't see much of the beach because the boardwalk was so ""interesting."" Scary, really. The tacky little shops were closing up, the street performers were mostly gone, and we just knew how icky the bathrooms would be. And we had to go--so we went ... elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961nancyw
30,Not for Family with Small Kids,"We went to Venice Beach only to find out that this the place where selling marijuana is legal, here, lots of junk Tshirt and many funny and interesting stuffs that's include the freak show. Definitely not reccomended for small children. We were here for just less than 15 minutes. Disappointing. PS public toilet was unbelievabl very dirty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AL080808
20,Not all that.,"Been to the States 3 times, and finally went to Venice Beach. Walked from Santa Monica.Was very disappointed. It was gross, dirty and there were a lot of people trying to sell you junk on the side of the street. Plus all the 'legal' marijuana stores. The whole thing was tacky.If I were to choose I best bit, it would have been watching the guys in the outdoor gym.Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261dainab
50,"If You Want Crazy, This Is The Place","If you've ever watched movies or television shows situated in Los Angeles, it's most likely that eventually you'll see scenes from Venice Beach. Beautiful beach in itself, but what it has that most place don't is a different cultural atmosphere. Lot's of street vendors selling just about anything, lot's of small stores and quaint restaurants selling their good to visitors. Well worth a few hours for the adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRRosa
30,Walk through,The view is great but the atmosphere might not be very family friendly. I enjoyed seeing all the interesting different people but some where questionable. Lots of small shops that you can get great deals on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968cristinas
20,Markets by the sea,Yeah what can I say not the prettiest beach in the USAFull of homeless people surviving on the beach frontThe shops are market type $3 shirts and crapInteresting people walking along Boardwalk though which was the highlightMust to see once but would not hurry backAs they say done tick,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8108FGmarkb
10,Don't go!,"The whole area was run down, dirty and filled with the very people you don't want to associate with on vacation. Please close any number of other beautiful beaches close by. Try the Santa Monica Pier - only a 5 minute drive away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9110wendyk
40,Lots of surfers,"Nice beach to walk and people watch. Saw a few people meditating, tanning and jogging. A place to do you. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammied3000
50,you wanna see real LA - come here ;),Nice place near the ocean with a lot of freaks around.Minus: some freaks are old and disgusting. Parking is expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gertrud708
50,Camden-on-Sea,"If you are from London, you will have see all the freaks around Camden Town. Put them on a beach and here you go. What an amazing place! Lots of fun. Highly recommended.If you walk up to 'actual' Venice a few hundred yards away, another world awaits, one of affluent tranquillity as you walk the canals past beautiful houses.Once 'freaked out', you can escape VB by walking to Santa Monica, a most pleasant Pacific stroll where normality regains prevalence.PS 'the bearded lady' sauntered out of her theatre into the daylight as I passed, and appeared to be a female dwarf with a rather-rubbish stick-on beard. Sorry if that explodes the myth for anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinP403
50,Must see,"We walked the Venice beach, I guess I would say a board walk with a lot of shops and VERY DIFFERENT people. WE people watched and that was very interesting, we seen a lot of people walking there dogs. It had been raining there and the temps were cool that day so we were told by others that there was a lot more people when the weather was good but we liked it because it wasn't crowded, it was nice just to sight see and the different people, the beach was beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwalker11
10,Nice beach- that's it!,"It is actually a nice beach, but everything else down this way is tacky and dirty. Keep walking and keep your belongings close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zilhills
10,Not what I expected,"Driving from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach was like driving through the scenes from Grand Theft Auto V. Whatever you do in LA, don't take short cuts and don't follow suggestions for a ""quicker route"" from the Sat Nav. Driving down a back street ""alley"" you come across all sorts of ""characters"", from drunks to druggies and what looked to be a ""transfer of goods"" from one van to another.Trying to find a ""safe"" car park was almost fruitless so we got out of there as quickly as possible. Obviously the only was to see Venice Beach is on the tour bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trav_vels
50,Awsome long beach,"A fantastic place. You can see al kind of people here, and I really mean all kind. Check out the outdoor gym and also the skateboard park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielKif
40,Interesting and entertaining.,As I have been there before I just wanted to share the experience with my husband.We had a great time on the beach which we found to be clean and were impressed by the lifeguards that made sure we were always swimming in the specified swimming areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdewar
50,WOWWWW,Venice Beach is huge and nothing I expected. The amount of people who are there and the different things happening all over the beach is nothing short of amazing. Great experience and glad I got to see it :) Great tourist spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214pepef
40,Different,"Venice Beach is totally different from anywhere else in LA and there's a bit of everything here. I found the boardwalk a bit overcrowded with stores selling all the same stuff (tshirts, henna tattoos, souvenirs) but the beach is nice and there are quite a few nice cafes off the main ocean front. Worth a visit certainly, but I felt I'd seen all there was after one morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gesaj2014
40,Venice Beach ...worth the exercise to check it out !,"Suggest parking at Southern end of Venice in the public lot on the beach. Walk, (or rent bikes there and go) North towards Santa Monica pier. Pretty good hike, start early ! Check out the different shops otw, and public display of some talented and eclectic folk that hang there. Get lunch at the pier, good views, rides activity, ect. on SM pier. The area seems to have cleaned up since we here last in 1990.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/473craigs

50,Venice Beach,"Beautiful beach, beautiful people, many souvenirs shops. Strolling along the beach, walking. It's great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betinab2013
20,Not sure why you would bother to travel to this beach,"Perhaps arriving on a weekday didn't improve our perception of what appeared to be beach dwellers (sometimes with their dogs), many who sat on the ground, their possessions covered by tarpaulins behind them trying to sell their wares. They were selling cheap tourist jewellery, dream catchers or other handmade works of ""art"". I've heard the street entertainers at weekends make for a more lively scene and perhaps we struck a bad day.The choice of eating places was also limited and not very attractive but perhaps I had unrealistic expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendylizjohnson
20,Disappointing!,"I really wanted to like Venice Beach- I thought I would love it. Instead, I found it a bit too weird. All I could smell was pot the entire length of it, and to be honest I didn't feel totally safe there.Wouldn't recommend unless you're super into the surfie/stoner culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessaLynch
30,Depends where you go,"The boardwalk area and shops on the boardwalk were very dingy. The view was not as stunning as it should have been as there are many makeshift homeless tents set up all along the boardwalk which is truly very sad. Hard to enjoy a beautiful view knowing there are so many homeless individuals. However, a few blocks away are some truly wonderful restaurants and high end shops and a very nice shopping area. We did not enjoy walking on the boardwalk although we saw many sights from well dressed people to people in rags, we found this to be depressing and sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiouspb
40,Dirty but you kinda need to stop,OK so Venice Beach is very difficult to describe. The beach is beautiful! The shops are just okay. You won't see good deals. I even though that most of them had prices I wouldn't even pay in a nice clean store. Still there's a lot of souvenirs for clothes and accessories. Very SADLY dirty with lot of homeless people. Kind a sad place when you walk near the shops. Not how I was expecting it.I suggest you take a ride with a bike from Santa Monica Pier toward Venice Beach that way you'll see and get the pulse of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
30,Looking tacky,"We arrived and didn't intend to stay for too long, this was an ""en-route"" pit stop. Felt that the area had deteriorated. I've never been here before, but my friends have and they felt that it was not as interesting as in previous years. Didn't feel like I was in a ""safe"" area and was happy to leave after about half an hour. Maybe it will still appeal to much younger teens/twenties, but I found it rather tacky and run-down",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3946GZjeanp
10,Over Rated,"Terribly disappointed with Venice Beach. The boardwalk was dirty, it was full of grafitti and there were heaps of homeless people camping. The beachfront houses are run down and constantly smelt like marijuana. Spend your time further north at Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordanr185
50,"""Popular Southern California Attraction""","Venice is a very popular spot worldwide. Best time to visit, if you don't want to be in large crowds is during the week. Weekends are busy and crowded with tourists and locals. Venice Beach offers cafes, shopping (near the boardwalk and around the beach area), roller skating and bike riding on the path to Santa Monica and back. These restaurants are great to visit on the boardwalk: ""The Sidewalk Cafe"" (reasonable prices) and offers weekend brunches and Venice's organic gastropub ""Venice Ale House"" (reasonable prices). Enjoy the ocean breeze!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstherM687
50,Must Visit if in the Area,"There is soooo much going on in Venice Beach. You HAVE to visit. One of my favorite places to visit. So many cheap stores, artists and activities going on: muscle beach, basketball, paddle board, handball, skating and people watching. It is soooo laid back.TIP: Instead of paying the high prices for parking - drive over to Marina Del Rey and park in the FREE Dock 52 area. Walk down to Fisherman's Village and rent a pedal bike ($7 hr). Get on the bike trail that takes you over to Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier. Its a good way to take in everything at your pace and you can cover alot of ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nattysimps
20,Sad,"We took the family and paid a fortune to park and walk down to the muscle beach area. While it was marginally interesting for me, my major problem is the ubiquitous pot paraphernalia which provided a teaching moment for the kids but also was just plain disgusting. This place should be avoided.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6881IXpauld
40,"Nice walk, lots of tourist stuff","We drove here to have a look around as it seems to be a popular attraction for LA.First thing we noticed was parking was expensive. The first place we pulled into was $20 and we didn't know there were more so we parked there. When we walked closer we found more places that were cheaper.The beach was nice and we went for a walk down the side walk and it was filled with entertainers and shops for tourists, people passing out their music CD's etc.Nice area, didn't stay too long as we were tired from a long day and parking was pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camperth
30,Wrong place,"We where looking for the Venice boardwalk area and ended up here paying $9 to park for a 15min walk on the concrete pier.My mistake.The pier was dirty and all concrete. I am used to others like Oceanside that have a little character. It was Dec. so not many people on the beach. There where some families with kids using snow disks to ride down the large sand hills they had piled up.You probably wont see that to many places in the country.The beach is wide and looks like it would be a decent place to go if you lived in the area.Street parking is hard to find, so look a few blocks away or pay the $9 for 6 hrs of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muykido
50,First Friday of The Month Gtidlock,"Venice California on First Friday Night. We're talking blocks of bumper to bumper food trucks with bumper to bumper auto & pedestrian traffic.

40,Great spot,"We love this place. make sure you go there on a Saturday for markets. parking is crazy hard to find, so go early in the day. great stalls and performers, muscle beach, allow about 2 hours or so.

There are nice cafes and boutiques there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madartist54

50,Venice Beach is beautiful.,Venice beach is beautiful situated around 15mins drive from LAX.The sunsets are amazing if you get to see them.There is a skateboarding park on the beach itself.Santa Monica is practically next door with loads of shops & Malibu is a little further up the coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pauly26
30,"Been there, done that...wouldn't go back","Everyone says you've gotta go to Venice Beach if you're visiting California for the first time. You can read my detailed review of the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Sadly, that experience probably tainted my view of Venice Beach!This is the first time I've seen a beach with Palm trees that are covered in graffiti. I love Palm trees but had never seen them like this. It was kinda interesting, but also sad at the same time. The walls were also covered in graffiti and there were guys there painting over it with even more graffiti. Apparently it's legal cause there was a large cop presence but they weren't paying the graffiti artists any attention.There is a skateboard park on Venice Beach that is interesting to stop and watch the skaters. They are so brave and luckily we didn't see any wipeouts while we were watching.I guess it's worth mentioning that Muscle Beach is also on Venice Beach. This wasn't what I expected. It was basically just a bunch of exercise equipment out in the open where you can watch people work out.The most amazing thing to me was how wide the beach was. Of course this was my first time in California and Venice was the first beach we went to during our trip. It seemed like we walked forever from the boardwalk and through the sand just to get slightly close to the water. However, we found many more beautiful and clean beaches on our trip...so I can only rate Venice Beach as a 3.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
30,It's what you expect and more-all walks of life come together,"Venice Beach and Boardwalk is a surreal experience where people from all walks of life come to hang out from the truly destitute to the extremely wealthy to the occasional celebrity to the self proclaimed ""freaks"" to the marathon trainees to your ""average Joe"". The boardwalk is truly an eclectic gathering of sights, sounds and smells all while having the beach as its backdrop. There are many unique artistic items to purchase as well as many souvenirs. There are a few places to eat and/or grab a beer. A fun way to spend an afternoon and a must do if visiting LA.**Warnings: it can get very crowded. Be prepared especially if you plan on going with children; it is truly all walks of life and an almost anything goes atmosphere-some marijuana smoking out in plain view, some almost too explicit PDA (public display of affection/attraction), some very outspoken people expressing religious, political, racial, sexual, etc.. views, some inappropriate for children logos on merchandise, green medical dispensaries, questionable bathrooms and other such things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/701laurag

50,Unique experience,"Street performers, outdoor vendors, beautiful beach, a truly bohemian experience although very commercialized now compared to when it made its name.

50,Something for Everyone,"Since I live on the beach I am a bit biased but believe this is an amazing place. The south end is relatively quiet but there are shops, bars, bike rentals, and the like. The boardwalk is on the north end and has a much higher energy level with street performers, muscle beach, public art, and the like. Something for everybody. It is a beautiful beach. Naturally, the best times to visit are the dry months ... probably March through October.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalJack
40,Gotta love it!,"The uniqueness, people, shops, etc. are all what make Venice Beach so special. You can walk for miles and never run out interesting things or people to check out.

30,Venice Beach,"I had the opportunity of visiting Venice Beach in October of this year on a bright and sunny day. It had been two years since my last visit and the first thing I noticed.......it certainly did not change much at all. It's still a good place to go to buy inexpensive t shirts ....all of them appear to have Venice Beach plastered across the front, which is a pity. The store holders are always friendly and helpful. Also the area is well policed and dogs appear now to be on leashes, which is all very helpful. BUT this area needs a total makeover. The restaurants mostly need updating and menus a little more creative .... Still an enjoyable afternoon for out of state families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blackrock747

40,There is nothing else like it-,"Venice and it's cast of kooky characters is something you will never forget. This little strip of boardwalk is one iconic melting pot of America. Be forewarned that there are ALL types of people here and you should come with an open mind. Parking is a crap shoot so pack your patience as you meander the streets for a spot. Better yet, take public transportation and ""walk in LA.""Better restaurants are popping up all the time but you CAN expect to find a wide array of cheap sunglasses, skateboards and street music/performers.

A great place to people watch, lots of interesting characters. Fun atmosphere. One thing I didnt care for was the odor in the area, not sure exactly what it was, not sure if i want to know! Smelled like trash and something else. Other than that, a very entertaining way to spend a day! A must to visit while in L.A.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LZtrvlGrl

50,Better than Baywatch..!,We enjoyed a lot the visit to the Venice Beach area. A lot to do. Lots of very good local restaurants and bars to grab a bite or a cold beer. No tv show or video make justice to this beach area. We were surprised by the length of the sand to the water we live in an island were sea is no more than100 feet away from the start of sand in venice beach easely is 500 feet away. White sand. Nice pictures oportunnities. Lots of parks at the beach. Must do visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelerPRUSA
30,Interesting...,A place that i will proably not go again. The beach was fairly dirty (compared to Australian beaches) and there was lots of weed and big guys trying to push their music on you. Was probably the most unsafe we felt during our America trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3MP5
40,Interesting,"We spent an afternoon at Venice Beach and enjoyed watching the skateboarders and other assorted people. As mentioned in other reviews, it's not the cleanest place. There are a few tents for long term dwellers parked around, and they are messy. I took my shoes off to walk in the sand, but thought better of it and put them back on for fear of glass. It is an interesting place to be. The market kind of scums it up a bit, still, it's worth a visit. I've seen Venice Beach in the movies and now I've seen it in person. Keep in mind that to park close will cost a few dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eliza5000

20,Not worth your time--Faded and Dirty,Venice Beach was disappointing. The beach itself was gorgeous and the facilities for skateboarders were impressive. But the overall feel of the walk was dirty and there was a place to buy medical marjuana and they were actively marketing it to everyone passing by. The Muscle Beach consisted of one person lifting weights. It may have been a great place once but now it is run down. Your time is better spent at the Santa Monica Pier. Go there instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em1232013
30,A Love/Hate Relationship With this Place,"The Good:1. I love that you can see all walks of life at this place. Some people complain how touristy it is but that's part of the charm as well. You can see people from all over the world as well as street performers ( a guy walking on glass, comedians, dancers, etc.) entertaining them.2. You can see really good basketball players playing a full court game during the summer.3. You can see all different kinds of street art, souvenir shops or buy souvenir T-shirts or sunglasses4. You can buy a hot dog, a slice of pizza, cheap Chinese food, ice cream, or eat at the Sidewalk Cafe which has really good food.5. There is a skateboard park where you can do it yourself or watch others.The Bad:1. If you go in the peak of summer, the parking is EXPENSIVE ($20), so you might have to park a few blocks away if you don't want to pay too much. If you go during the fall or winter, the parking is a lot cheaper.2. You might get approached by people to ask if you want a free medical checkup for medical marijuana with a wink.3. There are a lot of homeless people. They're harmless but some might ask for spare change.Depending on your point of view:1. Tarot card readers2. Tattoo parlor3. Unique art from India4. The smell of incenseAn honest review would be 3.5/4 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASeoulGuy
10,Disgusting and unsafe,"Our family holidayed in the US from Sydney. We have seen and read all the hype of the iconic Venice Beach! Clearly those days are well and truly over. It has deteriorated into a strip of beach that is a full time home to the homeless and drug addicts of California. It feels seedy, smells like a public urinal and is so unsafe for children. The characters that you think of at Venice Beach are not in sight and given the shambles the place is in it is no surprise. Santa Monica is a little better but again disappointing. Unfortunately Venice Beach is not a place I would recommend for anyone let alone families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camille04011972
30,Spoilt by tourism?,"I thought Venice Beach was gonna have a real cool, chilled atmosphere but it was the opposite, a bit disappointing. If you visit, make sure to go to the Northern end near Santa Monica pier. The Southern end just had a horrible vibe, the sidewalks full of desperate peddlers seeing you only as a walking dollar sign.The main path just had tacky shops with no personality. After walking a distance of about 100 metres, me and my husband had already been accosted by 2 separate guys bullying us into buying their RnB CDs, an aggressive charity guy, and another guy hassling us to go on his Hollywood celebrity starline tour. We avoided the path as quickly as we could after that, but it had kind've already spoilt the mood for us.When I went to Santa Monica pier the next day though, the vibe of Venice Beach at that end was a little more interesting. It had seafront cafes, skateboarders and an interesting park where cheerleaders and stunt men seemed to train. That was okay for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KumaTzu
40,Worth experiencing. Fun place to people-watch & the beach is beautiful,"Some reviewers are slamming our beaches due to parking, and homeless people. Have a little patience, please. Parking is a premium in Southern California and there are so many residents living here, competing with employees, and tourists for parking spots. Parking can run from $18 an up with time restrictions (parking tickets galore so pay attention!)If you are parking fee-adverse, here's a tip from we locals- Save your money, map out the area, find a parking spot up in the residential area, or near the enormous dog park I will reference for your convenience, and walk down to Venice Beach. (if you have dogs, this is a bark dust, not grass off-leash HUGE dog park with good designated parking lot for your dogs to exercise. REMEMBER laws passed recently prohibit plastic bags so you will not find pick up your dog waste plastic dog baggies here, or anywhere, bring your own stash.) Here is the website of the dog parkhttp://www.laparks.org/dos/parks/facility/dogparks/westminsterDogPk.htmThe sidewalks are notorious for being in bad shape, and in need of repair. Please watch your step. Patience is required and yes you will find the scene chaotic at times, but...Beautiful, vast beach and it is fun to walk the boardwalk. Better yet, block a half day, get your group on beach cruiser bicycles, or roller blades rentals from Jay's in Venice, and enjoy the trip up to Santa Monica Pier, and back. Really beautiful, and easy on the pocketbook. Supremely nice team at Jay's! Really friendly.There is a little something for everyone including your standard boardwalk fare of street performers, and circusy freak shows, touristy shops, ""Green Doctors"" for a fee, will ""examine"" you in private, and prescribe ""medical marijuana"", artists, people trying to sell you their ""masterpieces"", CD's, etc. If you are not interested, just walk through, avoid eye contact and no one will bother you. There are plenty of so-so restaurants, and pizza, burger joints. Love the gelato shop.The Skate Park is impressive and we enjoy sitting on our towels, hanging out, and watching the amazing skaters' stunts.. These skaters are amazing!Fun place and yes, there are homeless but there is a police presence, and security teams patrol on foot. We feel safe whenever we come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalSiren
50,Feel the spirit of Jim Morrison at every turn,"I am a big Doors fan and being an old haunt of theirs I wanted to experience the vibe of the place for myself and build a nice family experience around that. The touristy shops & stalls were not a huge drawcard for us, but it was a heap of fun wandering along the Venice Beach pier, swimming in the ocean and hiring pushbikes to ride along the bike path. Sure there are lots of freaky looking characters walking around but we never felt worried or threatened at all even with three small children in tow but definitely keep your wits about you. We hired our bikes from Jays rentals and I can't say enough about how helpful these guys were. we hired our 3 bikes and one tandem for an hour for $24 and that was enough time to ride from Jays up to Santa Monica Pier and back. It was a beautiful day and I would really recommend this as it is one of the highlights of my three week trip to the USA, such a great way to spend some time with your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEPlatt
30,Not Sure Why All the Hype,"Don't get me wrong, Venice Beach is a kick - BUT, it's a typical boardwalk with typical ""low end"" stalls and shops and the same greasy pizza, burger and fries that are found on just about all boardwalks all over the world. This is not high end; in fact, perhaps the appeal is in the ""low end of it all.""Again, it's fun but I cannot figure out for the life of me why it's considered a top attraction in Southern California. When it's a nice day, a walk along any of our beaches is wonderful. The only thing you add when you go to Venice are some crazies ranting; lots of people such that one can hardly move, and shops that are good for bad food and cheap T-shirts. Fun for a short while and perhaps to see. Not a Southern California highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918
30,Too touristy...,"Liked the bike ride, the view, the skate park, the urban art....hated the touristy crowd. Parking was a rip off as we paid 20$ For 2 hrs we were there. Better check few parking slots first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldCTZenT

10,Disgusting,"Overrated. Dirty. Not worth it. Trust me, don't waste your time. We went because I feel like it's one of those places you must experience once in your life. It was pouring with the homeless. It was like the circus on crack in a trash can. I usually love new places and interesting experienced but really, it's so overrated.

40,Venice Beach and Boardwalk is a life lesson,"I go to Venice Beach, Bike-path, and the Venice Boardwalk fairly often. It is always interesting and you never know what or who you will see next. There are multimillion dollar homes and there are plenty of homeless people. The entertainment is quite often good and sometimes excellent. I like to walk from the Venice Pier to the Santa Monica pier (it's about 3 miles apart so 6 miles round trip). Sometimes I head up to the 3rd street Promenade in Santa Monica which can add about another mile. The art's and crafts in the Venice area can be very good. If you have never been here is definitely worth the trip. Warning Parking can be rough (especially on the weekends).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardL819
50,Lives up to the hype!,"Not only a great place to see the bodies working out on ""Muscle Beach"", but also a place to see Michael Jackson impersonators, a great skate park, the sale of any and everything and of course, a beautiful beach! There are also some great homes (celebrity and otherwise) along the canals...just a beautiful place.The downside is that there is a lot of crime--enough for the tour operator to give ""dos and don'ts"", homelessness and beggars...but, any big city suffers from these issues. In my opinion, it does not take away from the beauty of the shoreline and the carnival atmosphere of the street.We stopped here for 45 minutes during one of those LA tours and I'm looking forward to returning to spend more time--mostly in a bathing suit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJackson50

20,Home of the insane homeless.,"the area is beautiful. At first we enjoyed the carnival like atmosphere. The constant beating drums get old real fast. There are too many homeless people wandering around that it only reminds you of how sad of a society we have. We spend billions waging war with other countries but we do nothing to solve our own problems here at home. When I vacation I want to be reminded of what a beautiful world we live in. This may be a cool place for the teenager types... but it is not for me. The beach is beautiful and well maintained , great for bikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rivergirl
50,Gorgeous,It's a beautiful beach. I stayed in Venice for a few days during my first visit to Cali in October and had the opportunity to walk along the beach a couple of times. No complaints. It can seem a little sketchy along the boardwalk at night but all in all a a nice place. Be sure to check out The Cow's End Cafe on Washington Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/npptravels
30,Umm where did we end up?,"Walking from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach on the boardwalk was really interesting, as you begin to enter Venice Beach the serenity changes. It loses some appeal but it is was definitely something that was great to see, especially the Muscle Gym on the beach. That blew me away, watching people work out on the beach in open view of everyone! The shops sell lots more tourist based items, cheaper clothing and lower quality. You can find juice bars and fruit bars and pubs that have cheaper meals here too, one we did not take up as Santa Monica had cleaner options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AleniM
20,Nice beach,"Nice beachfront area, but would not say the same thing for the boardwalk shops - extremely dated (looks like something from the 60s-70s hippie era). Not impressed at all with boardwalk and if you are looking for a clean nice area to take kids - this NOT the area. Again, the beach itself is nice, just if you could get there without having to go by the boardwalk - that would be great! There are better beaches around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shmay10263
40,Awesome but...,"... the ""musicians"". Leave me alone! To all these guys asking you take their cds - do you really think you will become big artists by doing this? You create more enemies than followers by doing this. Annoying.Beach is beautiful, it is worth walking from Marina Del Rey all the way to Santa Monica Pier. Many little shops with hand made products, really love these, would buy it all! I loved the architecture of the beachview houses. Therr are many activitirs along the beach - gym, tennis courts, volleyball, street workout place, soccer, yoga place etc etc. You will never be too far from toilets, there is plenty of them.One thing that surprised me was that even that its 90 degrees outside, the water is sooo cold!!!! Not many people are swimming there also and I saw some signs saying not to swim because the amount of bacteria is over the limit. Hmm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78andrejt

40,Freak Show worth visiting.....,"Venice Beach is great place for people watching and atmosphere. Seedy?...yes. A bit of a ""freakshow""?...yes. That is what makes it such a unique, fascinating and interesting place. I would hate to see it ""gentrified"" and upscale.... worth exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vidal3
40,Venice Beach Experience,Diverse fun exciting as well as relaxing. Venice beach was surprisingly a very hip eclectic and wonderful beach. I had the best time of my life exploring all of the shops along the boardwalk. I spoke to people from all different backgrounds and more importantly enjoyed the beach itself. It was clean and peaceful and far enough away from the boardwalk to enjoy meditation. My sister and I had the best experience ever!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superbad
50,Jim Morrison Mural,"Colorful and interesting place a must place to visit be sure to go .must say of lots of shopping to do and of course food outlets but don't buy from the first shop you see as further on down rows of little shops might be cheaper ...remember to take water bottles.stroll down to the beach and see where Bay-watch was filmed , and Old Arnie was discovered at the outdoor weight training facility. Look for the tree house with chandelier hanging in the front room and see all the houses been renovated . DONT take any CDs that people try and give you as once you take it it's yours to buy. For the adventurous person they have Kush Doctors use your imagination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lieblingb
40,Crazy and fun Venice Beach,"Venice beach is a must visit if you are visiting southern California. You can stroll the walk, rent bikes, lay on the grass or enjoy the beach. You will find a variety of characters to entertain you as well as beachy to artistic gifts to purchase. There are a few sit down on the walk way restaurants, as well as many stands selling pizza to icecream. You can view muscle beach, watch a paddle ball tournament, basketball or just watch the rollerblades in their everyday attire, which can be entertaining in itself. have fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/134dinas
30,Creepy...,"The place looked pretty nice from the car, but as soon as we got off, things started to get creepy. There were a number of homeless or strange people either walking or sitting on benches, making us quite uncomfortable.The views were OK, but it was quite windy, and combine this with the lack of street parking and the creepiness, I would say this is your choice to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MARKL455
20,"Bums, bums and dope heads","What a disappointment. Bums sleeping and peddling their junk everywhere. Most of the shops along the strip was either a ""medical marijuana"" dispensary or shops with t-shirts that had something cute to display about marijuana. Mistake taking the young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wingnut457
40,"Sun, Surf and Sights!","You can walk, bike or rollerblade along the boardwalk as you go by lots of little touristy type shops and outdoor stalls with crafts for sale. There are many places to eat and lots of different choices from burgers and fries to sit down restaurants. This is a place to walk around and people watch. There are all kinds of street performers and some are quite good....others...well, just walk on by! You are near the beach and the Pacific ocean so that part is very nice! But...It is not the cleanest area...the bathrooms are...well, beach bathrooms so full of sand. It's worth a walk to see it but don't plan on much more than a few hours at most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60lorim
30,"All I can say is ""wow""","This was the first stop in my all day LA tour. I always heard about Venice beach/muscle beach and it certainly lived up to my vision of what it was. The beach itself was lovely.. the stores and people were sketchy. Lots of homeless people around too and people trying to get you to take their ""free CD's"" but then wanted money for a ""tip"". Skateboard park was nice to see. I'm so glad that we didn't take the time to drive there on our own and pay for parking. I definitely would never go back or bring my kids there. Save your time and check out Santa Monica pier instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuliplvr22
40,A Los Angeles Experience you should not miss.,"Venice beach has been a unique experience for decades. A beautiful clean beach with an active boardwalk and bike path. Many individual venders and street performers along the boardwalk. Many places to eat, from pizza slices to patio high end eateries. The area draws many of LA's most eccentric and colorful folks. Avoid the beach restrooms if at all possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettP775
30,Beautiful trainwreck!,"What can I say! Venice beach is one big trainwreck! If u like to people watch and feel like u are amidst a comedy film...make sure and visit this beach. However, words of wisdom...this is NOT a place for kids! The boardwalk itself is a cool place to walk and visit shops selling clothing, skateboards and accessories, but the main attraction are the drug parapanelia shops and medical marijuana doctors and solicitors that's will hit u up in the open as u stroll down the boardwalk. Remember people, marijuana is legal for card holders in California, so it's not illegal to buy parapanelia and it pay a visit to one of the many alternative medical doctors that will diagnose and write u a prescription for marijuana for a small fee under $100. The beach itself of course is gorgeous, but it's super crowded. Renting a bike and or roller blades should be rented on a weekday, as it is less busy. There are plenty of cool bars and restaurants to stop and eat or grab a drink and continue to people watch. U can see muscle beach, where everyone working out looks roided out. Or the many acts along the boardwalk in which collect money in their hats throughout their shows ....while also involving passerbys in their acts. There are plenty of henna tattoo places and creative folks painting and drawing pictures. There is a really cool skate park that would be great for kids to go to, but the park itself is too full of crazy things, that I wouldn't advise bringing your children. Bottom line...it's a place u must visit when in Southern California for that trainwreck experience. I could go on and on about the madness of what u will see, but u should experience the trainwreck for yourself. But remember...do not bring ur kids!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelQueen90211
50,Venice beach is an experience,We hired bicycles from blazing saddles on the pier and cycled down towards Venice beach. It is a colourful place and full of colourful characters. There are quite a few down and outs down there and the smell of cannibis was quite strong. Even with that it is something you must see. Muscle beach is worth a look too. We saw a street show that gave a very positive message and was quite amusing. Its pretty safe but we wouldn't recommend going there at night. The sunset is worth waiting for and the cycle path is flat so not a hard ride. You can get a discount on the cycles if you have a tour bus ticket..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldS2258MT
40,A taste of Los Angeles for out of towners,"If you are from out of town and want a uniquely ""LA"" type of experience Venice Beach is a great choice. Start your adventure at the west end of Washington Bl. where it meets the Pacific Ocean. There is paid parking right there but I strongly suggest instead of driving yourself take advantage of Uberx, Sidecar or Lyft. Do a web search for promotional codes for first time riders from each of the services and your rides could end up being free.Walk north along the bike path (or maybe rent a bicycle?) slowly making your way towards Muscle Beach (another famous landmark). There are hundreds of table top vendors, small store fronts and solo entertainers performing for tips. You'll also be amazed at the number of ""doctor's offices"" here where residents can Skype with a doctor and walk out with a medical marijuana card.There are plenty of places to stop for something to eat or drink along the way. However, I prefer to frequent the mainstay bars on that last block of Washington Bl. were we started our adventure. Budget at least 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569edr
50,Daughters 30th birthday,"stopped by Vince beach before taking my daughter to the airport its a treat to go there to me, Muscle Beach all those good looking guys, if you want to watch basketball or play you are able. I have seen pro ball players there as well as movie stars. I especially love to watch the roller skaters dance, Vince beach is where it all started so funny to see the street entertainers. The beach is ok but I am from California and I like to go to the smaller beaches with less people along the coast, Vince Beach is a artsy place to let your hair hang down and see a lot of interesting things and people. DO NOT COME TO LOS ANGELES AND LEAVE WITHOUT GOING TO ONE OF THE GREATEST BEACHES IN CALIFORNIA. You will be happy you did",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/photomama17
50,Santa Monica pier is worth the trip,"Don't get me wrong there are a lot of people, but you must go while in the area. The beach is great, but you must take in the whole area, the pier, the boardwalk and the beach. Be sure to take a cab down to avoid the traffic and parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478cindym
30,Mixed Bag,"Venice Beach is both an interesting and exciting part of Los Angeles in good and bad ways. It is the home of the body building, skateboarding and artistic community of Los Angeles. Clearly, it took a downward swing at some point as there are a large community of homeless people as well as some areas that feel dangerous. It is also the home of Abbott Kinney which is one of the most interesting and creative streets in all of California. Some of the best restaurants and boutique shopping reside on Abbot Kinney. The Venice Boardwalk and surrounding area are like a Carnival during the Summer time. Venice is definetly up and coming. But as a resident of Los Angeles. I would rather stay in Santa Monica or Marina del Rey and visit Venice Beach during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGA1075

40,Fun in the sun,"A walk down the Venice ""Boardwalk"" is definitely worth the time. The stands selling all kinds of food and various items of clothing, keepsakes, etc, the entertainers, musicians, the body builders, the terrific roller bladers and skaters, walkers, sunbathers and swimmers, the athletes on the walkway and the sand, jogging, throwing frisbee and balls, playing volley ball, the bicyclists, dancers, jugglers, acrobats, California girls in bikinis and other attire, the colorful locals and even the crowd of tourists are a hoot, especially on weekends. And you can rent bikes, skates, blades, surf and boogie boards, stroll, jog or just hang out, on the walk or the sand. And you can go for a swim, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobH105

30,A mainstay but a place in disrepair,"I used to go to Venice Beach every weekend. There were and still are vendors where you can purchase inexpensive souvenirs as well as restaurants and entertainment. I enjoy the Fig Tree Cafe situated right on the beach where you can people watch and enjoy good food. Venice Beach is a fun place to visit but beware; it has become an unofficial hang out of the homeless. It's taken the charm out of the beach. I recommend going on a weekday in early afternoon. The weekends are crazy crowded. The beach has an area for roller blades, a bike riding path and of course muscle beach. There are good restaurant in walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imoobear

But if you want people watching, none better. My favorite thing to do is bike along the beach. It's so relaxing, and great exercise. There are a couple of places to eat along the way, but nothing is great. The pier is right there as well, just down the bike path. Plenty of cheap gifts to get your friends. If you like to skateboard, its great, can be a bit busy to carve. But plenty of good boards to watch. The gym at muscle beach isn't good, sometimes can be fun to stop and look. You can also layout down by the water, there are bathrooms that are not nice. But can be used.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3yarddogs

50,Venice Trippin,Great place to walk and bike. Best to park in large lot south of pier rather than in the Pier lot on PCH. Get off 10 Frwy at 4th street and turn left onto 4th. Go about 3/4 mile and turn right on Pico. Take Pico about 1 block to Ocean/Nielson Ave. Turn left and keep to the right as Ocean Ave Y's into Ocean Ave going down to the right but becomes Nielson Ave if you keep left. Then turn into main parking entrance about 1/2 block on right. From there it's a short walk to pier just North or to Perrys Pizza just south to rent a bike. Otherwise walk the path along the bike path. Note about 2 miles south you'll reach the Venice Pavilion area with the Sidewalk Cafe a good place to eat and enjoy the view. The best bargain is almost next door to Sidewalk Cafe at Big Daddys Pizza. A big slice of pizza and a coke for about $5.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmoThai

50,An inexpensive family adventure,"Venice Beach has something for everyone. the boardwalk is fun for the kid in everyone. Kids love all the odd balls and kitsch and cheap toys and street performers. If you want to go upscale, go a few blocks east to Abbot Kinney Blvd. Eat at Gjelina's (at Plam) if you can get in, if not, grab and go at Gjelina's Take Away, next door. If you're looking for good, sit down sea food, try Salt Air, about a block South of Gjelina. And if you're looking for a place to plug in and get some work down, go to Zinc cafe, on the South side of Venice Blvd., but still walking distance from all the great shops--all on Abbot Kinney. There are high-end stores, hippie-type stores, beach store, retro or vintage shops, excellent restaurants and fast, inexpensive mixican or pizza shops. Very elegant stores like Mona Moore o Kendal Conrad make it easy to spend a grand on one item, but worth the expense in quality and uniqueness. There are cheap T-Shirt stores and very creative, well designed shops as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariachurchill

It represents all the craziness that is Los Angeles. There have been quite a few quality restaurants that have sprung up close to the beach, also. A bike ride on the path can either be very fun or very dangerous, depending on the ratio of clueless tourists who believe it is actually their own personal walking path. Just go slow and take care. South of Washington Boulevard is residential so there aren't the vendors and sideshow element. Much chiller (with a parking lot at the end of Washington Blvd.).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTravelJones
50,Gorgeous.,"The water is ice cold, but the views are spectacular! Unlike the Laguna beach area of California, where its usually foggy, the Venice beach area is very clear and clean.

There were many vendors, restaurants, and souvenir shops and it was perfect for first time tourists like myself. The boardwalk was handicap friendly and parking is free during the week if you have disabled plates or window hanger. Muscle Beach was pretty cool, if that's your thing. Keep in mind that there is some pot smoking going on on the beach, which didn't bother me but may really bother others. I wasn't able to actually swim in the ocean but I was able to put my feet in. The beach is clean and beautiful and I hope next time I go, I can actually swim in the ocean.

40,Good Time - if your open minded,"We (me, DS 13, DS 10 & DD 10) stayed at Santa Monica and rented bikes and rode down to Venice Beach on a Saturday morning. We loved this ride with fantastic views, wish I had something more like it at home. Venice Beach itself I also like - I love the people watching, the street entertainers and all the people out in the sunshine being active: skateboarding, tennis, basketball lifting weights, swimming etc. Yes people try to sell you all sorts of things but I just said 'no thanks' and kept walking if I wasn't interested and I was not hassled any further. I had read other peoples comments saying don't take your children but my kids enjoyed it and well did they get to see some stuff that started conversations (e.g. the marijuana shops and homeless people) yes but I'm ok with that, I think those are conversations I need to have with them anyway. We had ice-cream and sat in the shade under the trees to watch it all go by for a while. Beach area was clean and water was sparkling clear blue!

Since we stayed right on Hollywood Blvd we had become used to the big crowds, the homeless and the CD/DVD pushers. Still, Venice Beach was a spectacle. The weird, the wonderful and the downright peculiar hang out here. The skate park was full of kids doing death defying stunts without helmets. An on-duty cop did a few pull ups in the outdoor gym at muscle beach (in full uniform). A lady was selling ready made cardboard signs for beggars?!

One Life-guards dived into the water first, followed closely by his partner. Then Life-guards in boats raced to the scene to back-up the rescue. A helicopter circled overhead. Next, the L.A.Fire-truck pulled in on stand-by. Bam-Bam-Bam -- It all happened very fast. Amazing to watch!.

20,What a Surprise - Really Tacky!,"After visiting Santa Monica Pier, Malibu and then heading to Manhattan Beach, I was really surprised by Venice Beach. It was like visiting East LA between beautiful beaches. While it does have a beautiful beach, the promenade is full of tacky tourist stalls including marijuana ""doctors"" approaching you every few feet. There are many homeless and poverty stricken people, some trying to make a honest living, others just hanging it. It was ok to see once but it was a bit uncomfortable and not pleasant so we likely won't return. We were lucky to find parking close by on the street for $1 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunSeeker37
50,Well worth a visit,"We did this area on the hop on hop off bus. Unfortunately we did the red route first and this area last so time was limited. It was well worth a visit with nice shops, plenty of sea life and music playing with people dancing in the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIDINGAROUND
40,Go visit and see for yourself!,"Yeah, it's pretty unique and has to be seen - it's a feast for the senses:)Went at the weekend so plenty of people about and stalls lining the walkway (shops on one side and stalls with beach behind on the other) - artists of all kinds displaying their wares; paintings, drawings, skulls, fabrics, hummingbird wind decorations, clothing...everything you can imagine, even a fairground style 'come and meet the freaks' type show. Tattoo parlours galore, homeless, skilled skateboarders showing what they can do, people doing magic tricks, cyclists out on the cycle path, palm trees galore, beautiful golden sand beach, basketball match taking place, body builders pumping iron - it's all happening.Take time to sit and watch the skateboarders and take in a basketball match. The folk are friendly, there are worse ways to spend your time and this is a great place to people watch.Was told to hang on to my bag here so keep your valuables safe. Not sure if it's a real concern but doesn't hurt to listen to local advice.Worth seeing for sure:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safarinjema2014
50,Venice Beach,"Nice place, hard too get a car park and be care full if you park where the kerb is red you may get booked. LOTS of pubs little bit of walking great food and you can walk along the pier nice place during the day unsure at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woody724
50,Incredible access to a beautiful beach,"Skip the tacky souvenir shops other than for some interesting photography opportunities, and stay focused on the sand, surf, surfers, bikers, and sun bathers. $10 is the going rate for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadTownAdventurer
50,FAVORITE PLACE,"I was born and raised in Los Angeles and Venice Beach is one of my favorite places in the entire city. To me it is everything that LA is. It is gorgeous and relaxing. The ocean water is cold and always is, regardless of the time of year. Lots of shops and vendors. Great place to buy cheap sunglasses or get a henna tattoo. Also a great place to rent a bike and ride around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaj404
10,"Tacky, trashy",Nice beach but thats it. The promenade is just one tacky souvenir/t-shirt shop after another. Dont go out of your way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/im44
50,For Tourists and Locals Alike,"Venice Beach is a great place for tourists and locals, alike, who simply want to enjoy its sun, sand, surf and palm trees. Strolling along the sidewalk is an adventure, in itself, as you pass an array of vendors, artists, musicians, and entertainers. There is also a wide variety of people visiting from far and wide which makes people-watching interesting and fun. It is not unusual to see people riding bikes, skating and skateboarding. There is also an assortment of stores for souvenir shopping and restaurants where you can get a quick bite to eat. Muscle Beach is always a fascinating stop as you meander along your way. The extremely casual, and often quirky, atmosphere of Venice Beach always makes me feel like I'm on a mini vacation even though I'm just walking as a form of exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13
50,Hippie style,"Great beach to relax! Don't expect warm water, water is really cold even on the summer time, but doesn't matter because the atmosphere is amazing, very relaxed place to visit during the day, the walkway has a variety of craft products to sell.p, all hand made, the freak show is also there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthacajueiro
40,People Watching Fans Will Love This Beach,"Great beach to sit on and play in the cold surf. Lots of food/ drink places to people watch form. Lots of interesting people to watch, markets stalls and shops for gifts and ""pot"" medical referral shops for added interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClareF732
40,Enjoyed,Sadly didn't get to spend a lot of time here but from what I saw of it I liked.Lovely beach and the facilities are great. Plenty of places to grab a snack and stalls selling various bits and pieces.Watched some skateboarding and of course had a look at the famous muscle beach which was fairly quiet but still something.Would love to spend a full afternoon here although I hear it's not the best place after dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkgirl86
50,A must,"No place better for people watching. Fun time watching them at Muscle beach, or playing basketball or watching the entertainers. We didn't wander off the beach are but there was miles to walk. Fun to rent a bike and go down to the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marymM3919HL
30,Bit of a curate's egg,"Something you have to check out as a tourist in LA. But while the beach is nice (and very well maintained) and the cycle ride along the coast (most tourists way of getting there) is great, the truth is that this a rather sad and tacky area. Lots of 'rough sleepers', rubbish stalls and tacky down-market shops. While as a New Zealander it's tough to say nice things about Australia, Venice Beach doesn't compare overall to say Manly or Bondi as a quality tourism experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanJGJ
50,Day trip,"Were there last weekend. Skateboard park is a must stop - lots of young riders showing their skills and some nice aerials as well. Not much action at the hoops courts, but the weather was warm and the waves were nice. Nice for a low key day of people watching and grabbing a bite to eat with some local flavor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marksG7602PN
30,Typical Beach,"Venice beach is ok, it is not much different to many other beaches other than stalls of merchandise e.g markets. I went to the beach early so i didn't see much people working out at muscle beach but i did she a lot of people playing basketball. Alot of people ride bikes and young people on skateboards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriannae2013

50,Spend about a week in Venice Beach,"One of my all time favorite beaches. This is West Coast all the way. Fun boardwalk with an assortment of stores. Great people watching here. People just letting their freak flags fly:) Hippies, hipsters, artists, junkies, skateboarders, tourists, magicians, performers, and the list goes on... I can easily imagine what this place was like in the 60s. Muscle Beach Venice is located here as well for even more people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hppyadv
50,"Great Place for people watching and letting your ""freak flag"" fly","I LOVED Venice Beach and recommend anyone over the age of 18 to visit. If your children are well traveled they could probably go when they're a little younger but there is a lot to take in. Venice Beach offers a true ""California"" experience and was everything I expected it to be and more. Within the first 45 minutes of being here we encountered a drum line, roller skaters, tandem bikers, surfers, body builders, legal ""tagging"" and head shops. It is a true melting pot of cultures and everyone was friendly and co-existed peacefully from what I could see. This is a great place to just sit and enjoy a sunset and relax. I didn't venture into any of the shops but among the head shops there are your typical beach wear places and several trendy eateries. I also was surprised by the number of small ""canals"" and am guessing that's where the ""Venice"" comes into play. The whole area is just great to walk around and look at the houses. It seems to be a safe and friendly area (not sure about after dark as we left shortly after sunset). You need to go, it's well worth the short drive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollikm83
40,It´s a beach !!,"A most see place as it´s well known, but ""hey ! it´s just a beach"". Lot of space so very easy to find a quite spot in the sand - especially to the south. On the board walk it´s 'plastic fantastic' - not much different from other tourist trap beaches. Remember to walk alongside the canals, pass ""Muscle beach"" and take a look at the skaters at the skater park. Bring extra money for parking and food, as it is ++ compared to quality,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinl570
50,Weird and Wonderful,"What can I say Venice Beach has to be one of my holiday high lights i just fell in love with the place and very minute I spend there it was wacky, weird and wonderful. If i ever have the chance to go back to LA I will definitely be staying in the Venice Beach area..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicholaJ_13
40,I Enjoyed the people watching aspect,"Well it took a bit to get there, but we made it. We bought a 2 day hop on hop off pass. We caught the red line from Hollywood to Beverly hills and changed to the yellow line which took us to Santa Monica beach, about a 2 hour site seeing trip, hot but not too straining. From Santa Monica we took the green line to Venice Beach, probably only about 15 minutes, but we waited about 30 minutes for the bus to arrive ( we must of just missed one )We then walked around Venice Beach for a while we walked down to the water, had a look at muscle beach watched a basketball game and did a bit a of people watching. Lined up to use the toilets for about 45 minutes, of course we got in the wrong line and even though there were about 6 toilets on our side only 2 were operational ( i swear homeless people were sleeping in 4 of them as no one exited them the whole time we were there and I went up and tried the doors and they were locked.We walked along the boardwalk back to Santa Monica beach which although I had hurt my leg and was limping, it was quiet an interesting walk. It maybe took about 1 hour casually walking.There are lots to see along the way arts and crafts, Dr weed stores, t shirts stores, vintage shops, tarot reading, freak shows, homeless doing all sorts, acrobats and even Rumba classes.I loved the atmosphere. It maybe a little touristy but hey that's what I am and I get caught up in the touristy stuff. I would of loved to have spent more time here but we were tight for time and wanted to eat at Santa Monica. Been there done that now, loved it, would do it again one day, but wouldn't rush back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keenastraveller
10,Down and out in LA,"A really sad place. This is where you go to see those who missed out on the American dream. Epitomised by the ratbag who was charging people to pat his dog; above which was a sign saying: ""This aint Disneyland"". Got that right at least. Couldn't get out of there fast enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891petera
40,A little bit of everything,"We began opublic wahsoll at Washington Boulevard and ended it at the Santa Monica Pier. If you have a couple of hours to spare and want to get lots of sun, this is the way to do it. Be sure to take suntan lotion, a hat and sunglasses though...or you can pick these up from one of the many shops. There are pedicabs and bike rentals too if you want to speed things up.For me, personally, Venice Beach is the right mix of weird and non-threatening. Yes, there are down and out folks on the walk, bad art for sale (you know you want a surfing Spiderman!) and at least one head shop in every block of shops, but you would also miss a lot of cool stuff like murals, the sound of the surf, buff dudes working out, bushes of birds of paradise and carefree skateboarders winding in and out of the crowd.A bank of public washrooms marks each avenue, and the one we used was a lot better than I thought it would be. There is also the occ asional shower station. Actually the whole beach is very clean and I felt safe walking there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillKeats
40,A must go place,This is an amazing place to go the restaurants and shops are unique. The people who populate the beach and surrounding area are unique to say the least.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-retired
20,Sad,"Venice beach is one of those places you feel that you must see when in LA and probably nothing I write will deter you, but it is a sad place populated by down and outs, tacky commercialism, souvenir shops all selling the same junk. No restaurants or decent bars. The only vaguely decent things are the skateboard and the occasional good musician. The only highlight was the Wee Chippy just of the Board-walk which sells the best chips ( French Fries) that I have ever had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveMWirral
40,Very Fun Venice Beach,"Our trip to Venice Beach was fun!! There are great restaurants and shopping on Abbott Kinney. The boardwalk was fun especially if you are a people watcher. there isa skateboarding park thatch provide lots of entertainment, and the graffiti is really artistic, in fact we walked around and looked for more of it on the side streets. We went to James Beach Restaurant to have lunch, which I recommend. There are plenty of little t-shirt shops along the boardwalk. Some fun vintage shops. It's definitely a spot to not miss when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EquestrianTraveler4

40,What's not to love about the beach?,"My cousin picks me up from the airport and asks what I want to do while Im here. Of course, the first thing I say is the beach!!After taking a few trains and a bus we arrived at Venice Beach. I had never gone there before but its just what I thought it would be. Very Californian. A lot of shops, hippies, bicylcers, roller bladers, skateboards, surfers, hotties, and smelly homeless people. The view of the beach is beautiful especially in the evening while the sun is setting. I visited San Diego back in May and Venice Beach reminds me of Pacific Beach except bigger with more places to shop.My favorite thing about going to these types of board walk areas are the shops. They are always selling cute cheap clothing and souvenirs.My cousin and I found this really awesome Egyptian store!! This guy had a lot of different Egyptian things and his Papyrus art glows in the dark!! If you are into this type of stuff like me you definitely have to go to this place. I am not sure of the exact location but it was back up in some brick building area that had other shops in it too (you had to walk up a few steps). It said Egyptian Museum on the list of stores out front.If you do happen to visit my friend at the Egyptian store dont let him fool you into the thinking he can't take credit cards because he does. He also let me haggle with him on some of the prices which is always my preferred way of shopping.There are also a number of bars if you want to turn up while at the at the beach.The bathrooms are kind of gross but its the beach what do you expect?!Overall its a great place to shop, drink,and hang out at the beach. You must visit here at least once!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravelTaurus
20,Disappointing,"We had high hopes but were surprised by the state of Venice beach: it was a dump. Crappy toerist shops, very poor food options, a LOT of homeless people and 'hippies' (not the good kind), it smelled like urine... I did not feel safe, and we were there during lunch time. If you do consider it a must see, check out muscle beach, the skate ramps and the beach. We left within the hour and had seen it all. Parking is expensive (9-15$). Someone here wrote about the Venice canals which are nearby. I would consider it a good combination for a half-a-day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniquej865
30,Yeah...it's exactly what you think it's going to be...,"By the title, I mean what I say. If you're young and looking for exciting, different people to observe, surf, skateboard, rollerblade, be seen by others and take in the oddities, you'll love it. If you're a tourist looking for the local beach flavor (and scents) it's what you'd expect. If you think it's all a bunch of hype and overpriced t-shirts and 'locally made' souvenirs, it's all that too. As teenager of the 80's it reminded me of the movie Lost Boys and the fictional town of Santa Clara with it's boardwalk life. Decent enough in the daytime, but as the day winds down and night comes, there's a whole different vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMIndiana
30,Nice clean beach,"The rating would be higher, except for the fact you have to brave the dangerous Boardwalk to even get here. The sand was clean, and free of trash. As I got closer to the actual beach, the sounds of the Boardwalk were replaced by the soothing ocean waves. There were a few people here catching rays or swimming (although no life-guards were present). Given more time, this would be a great place to spend an afternoon or weekend (although expect it to get crowded then). Would like to come back here in the middle of the day again when it was pretty empty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471davem
40,The end of the line,"The famous author Jack Kerouac once described Venice Beach as ""the end of the line"" or a ""slum by the sea"", these days however, even though elements of the 50s remain, Venice beach is so much more!!Connected with the more polished Santa Monica by Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile pedestrian-only (bikes and roller skaters allowed as well) promenade that quite simply moves at it's own rhythm, some have described Venice Beach as a human zoo, a freak show or twisted carnival, yet quite simply it is a must see encounter with wannabee Schwarzeneggers, snake oil skin salesman, fortune tellers, hawkers and everything else in between. The smell of hash radiates through the streets, whilst performers scramble for you attention and $.Venice Beach, simply puts together, in such a ""cool"" way all those elements of everyday America, that would make you uncomfortable anywhere else. It is hipster heaven, where everybody is welcome. Guaranteed to be like nothing you see anywhere else in the world.Probably not the best place though to bring small children or young families, given the inevitable awkward questions that would arise.Ohhhh, and I forget, the beach isn't bad either...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneySarajevo
30,Enjoyed the skateboarding the most!,"I have mixed feelings about Venice beach. We started at the far end, with the beautiful houses on the beachfront and walked right down to Santa Monica Beach.It gets more and more touristy and tatty the further along you go. It changes quickly from $11m homes, to people sleeping on the sidewalk and the beach.It was however an experience to be there. We watched the sunset, from the beach, which was beautiful and also spent some time watching the skateboarders, which was probably the highlight of Venice beach for me!Parking is difficult and there isn't much free parking available. If you are lucky you'll find something for free on one of the streets. However if not then you will have to use on of the public parking lots, which can vary in price. Average is circa $9",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellover6128
40,Nice,Venice was nice to see however it was very dirty in some areas. We rented bikes and rode to Santa Monica and had a swim in the ocean. Be careful if swimming in the ocean as backpacks / bags get stolen from tourists regularly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jakemccauley
40,Great attraction,I would say this is really a great place to hang out and spent some free time. I like the boardwalks and basketball courts the most. There is definately some shady people on sight and street vendors that can be killing your vibe :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896stans
30,Blackpool with sunshine,"don't set the bar to high on this visit as you will be disappointed.if you like crowds,noise and lots of tacky boardwalk stores this is the place for you.the only thing going for it is the sun, but there is nowhere to sit to enjoy it. We were warned not to use the restrooms !!!!!!!!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidP448
50,Must go,"Loved this place. Its full of fun, surprises and things you'd never think you'd see. A lovely beach very lively and friendly, a lot to do including nice little shops, street entertainment and of course relaxing on the beach or volleyball. Would definitely recommend going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB0022
40,"Disneyland meets Burning Man. Add in homeless, hawkers, shady folks and carnival food.","Supposed to be the second biggest tourist destination in southern California after Disneyland, Venice Beach is a perhaps the most provocative place you can visit in the country. A great paved walking path that is part of the 26 mile bike/skateboard/walking trail along the coast west of LA separating beach from hawker, this strip is everything LA, and then some. The number of homeless here would make you uncomfortable anywhere else in the country, but they have a certain cool element here. The street artists are unbelievable: a grand piano with a player to match, quite talented musicians playing for tips, indie film producers shooting scenes: it's all here. Folks from every walk of life, more languages than almost anywhere else, sun, sand, dogs, shops, designer fashions, tattoos, medical marijuana prescribers and people, people, people, people.If this is your gig, visit. Bringing kids under, say,12 here may not be appropriate, and those over 11 may ask inappropriate questions. But it is a blur of human life in the sun. Almost year-round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1187RJdavidp
40,Well worth a visit,"This really famous beach is a mix of interesting, weird and tacky. We'd been warned that it was quite seedy looking so we weren't surprised to find that the beachfront looked rather dilapidated. AS with the beach at Santa Monica, there is a broad sand frontage leading to the clam beauty of the Pacific Ocean. There are numerous and diverse shops lining the beachfront and a host of colourful characters manning less permanent stalls. We saw a man in a gold-sequinned coat and a lady wearing a multi-coloured top-hat, amongst others. We also witnessed an altercation between a lady musician and a beefy bloke, which the lady won hands-down after filling the air with some truly amazing invective. Venice Beach has a vibrant air and buzzes with people. There's a wide dedicated cycle track (not that pedestrians pay much heed to the 'bikes-only' signs) which makes it a pleasure to cycle along and take in the sights. You have to be careful of strollers and skate-boarders and roller-bladers, but all in all cycling is a great way to experience this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295kathys
30,"A tacky iconic attraction, keep your expectations low!","The beach is beautiful but the rest of it is a mixture of tacky brassy commercialism, boring souvenir shops selling the same junk, t-shirts etc.. peddlers selling anything. I was very disappointed. The only cool thing was watching the roller skaters, some of them were very good.If you are in the area, stop and see it. It is a very iconic area but be sure to keep your expectations low!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pomerols
30,Tourist area,"Although having already been to Venice beach almost 20 years ago, I was keen to come back & experience it again, as the last visit was part of one of those quick stop tour buses, and the teenage kids were going to put a different perspective on it this time. The beach was great & in fact probably looked better, but the promenade hadn't changed much. It was still slightly seedy with the same tacky style outlets. Our visit was during the day, so probably didn't quite have the same amount of colourful characters out & about. Interesting to do, but not a place to spend a lot of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdY6254YU
20,Glad I've seen it; conflicted on rating.,"Honestly, I rated poor, but I am not sure, so I hope this review will still be helpful.I was really happy to rent bikes in Santa Monica and go all the way to Marina Del Rey. We had a bit to eat at the Venice beach skate park; and took pictures by the beach and the graffiti walls.The beach is beautiful, large, and the ocean amazing.The tacky walking boardwalk with shops and sellers (you cannot bring you bikes in) was not fun, so we spent about 2 minutes there.Even on the bike path as I was scared. I thought that being early AM would be good and not so full of homeless, but I forgot to realize that they'd still be there and asleep; and waking up searching for their fix.So even on and from the bike path, there was a ton of homeless, people smoking dope and scary looking folks.The good thing is that there are bathrooms and bike racks everywhere.So I am glad I did it; but was very happy to be on my bicycle as otherwise, I would have been really scared for my daughters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaz936

50,Depends on what you call fun!,"Absolutely beautiful beach! There's no stands renting chairs and umbrellas so if you're visiting from another state take a short drive to walgreens $12 a beach chair &$9 for an umbrella you'll have them your whole visit on your last day give them to a homeless person (there's plenty of them unfortunately) My husband loved the crazies and the people watching, the freak show and the tacky stores. I love the white sand and beautiful ocean. We both enjoy the street performers and artists that struggle to make a living. It's all about what you like for us we could spend days here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteamyRice
30,Didn't stay long at Venice Beach,"I visited Venice Beach as I've heard a lot about it, especially Muscle Beach so thought I'd check it out.It was an interesting experience, I was able to park up in one of the carparks along the beach which had exemptions for people with the disabled placards. I used my UK disabled blue badge as under Californian law they have the same privileges that the American version has.Once parked up I was able to wheel myself all the way along Ocean Front Walk to check out the sites.Basically I would say that this is just a tourist trap and that you should really only go here once as once you've seen the touristy things then there's nothing to really keep you here. The area if full of homeless people and can look unwelcoming.A word of advice, be careful what you are taking photo's of as a number of people there don't like their picture taken and also will insist on a charge of a dollar or two for the picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisabledTraveler
30,"Beach Good, Boardwalk Average","We were on our first vacation from South Africa, to the States, and Venice Beach/Boardwalk was one the the sights that we had on our list of places to ""Must"" visit. Especially since we see it in american music videos and movies.We were staying in Hollywood and had to take two buses to reach Venice Beach. On the second bus, we felt very uneasy and unsafe, and being from South Africa, that is saying much, but it turns out that there is a lot of weird people in this area.Venice Boardwalk for us did't live up to the expectation. It was average at best, looked untidy and dirty at places. The vibe and atmosphere, though was good. It very quickly became packed and it felt as if we were walking in the streets of New York.While it did not live up to our expectations, it is really a must visit, to tick off the bucket list, even if it is purely to see so many weirdo's in one place.The beaches on the other hand were stunning. We took the liberty to dip our feet and it felt good.We were impressed with the variety of food that could be bought from the food stalls. Our favourite was Jody Maroni's. Even had a Corn Dog for the first time. Not so great but worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravesh

50,Great place,"Venice beach is a place u must visit in LA. Went there summer time plenty of things going on nice houses, only wish i was living there ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanR43
40,Nice,The place is big and crowded. I just walked around the beach at the sunset and over the píer. It´s no so special as the movies show. At least for me. But it can be a romantic place if you are with your mate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisandra11
50,Super Cool,"My hubby and I visited Venice on the last day of our holiday. It was super relaxing after a packed schedule. I let hubby off the lead to splash in the waves and watched him lollop around for a good hour whilst I relaxed on the sand - wonderful! But beware of sunburn - it is considerably cooler because of the breeze but I got badly burnt despite the sun screem. Toilets are fairly plentiful but not verypleasant so use a restaurant one if you can. We wandered along the boulevard and enjoy the variety of market stalls and shops. Look for your best price - they will vary a lot, but many include tax already. This is the place to buy art and souvenirs. Many items were much cheaper for standard souvenirs. There are also a range of art to suit many tastes. Hubby and I spent $80and came home with some 7 pieces of art we love. Unfortunately there are also many homeless people and amusingly, if you are able to breath, it seems, you can get a diagnosis for medical marijuana from one of the many 'clinics' that line the boulevard. Parking is about $10 which is not bad, considering theme parks' shockingly cheeky ask for $16 after paying for the park tickets. Take a morning at Venice and enjoy breakfast, the beach and a browse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SozzyBear
40,Interesting Place To Visit,This was our third trip to Venice and we do love spending time on the beach. The boardwalk always has an eccentric group of people peddling their wares. The coolest thing that happened there was onour second trip when we saw P!nk stake boarding down the boardwalk. Everyone needs to go to Venice Beach at least one time in your life!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeth758
30,Nice beach to visit,"Nice beach. Parking is expensive.It is sad, but there is a lot of homeless people around. There they have the amenities. There are a number of artist around too selling their art work.Some of our party took surfing lessons.It is a bit of walk to Santa Monica Pier. It was a nice stroll along the beach by the water to the pier. The boardwalk was great. It did make it easier to walk back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jchintor
50,Must Visit,"Amazing atmosphere - great beach, so many cool things to see.It will make you jealous of your beach back home - where ever it may be (except Thailand)..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/743bradb
50,A great vibe and entertaining area,"Venice beach was a fantastic destination for our young family visiting from Australia. Local art, street performers, skateboarding, street basketball, markets selling local goods, dancers, roller skaters where do I stop. It has an awesome vibe and so many things to take in, allow at least a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949tg
10,Interesting,"We arrived early in the morning - around 10am. It was interesting, but something I don't ever need to see again.I had my 2 14 year old daughters with me. They were frightened and said they didn't feel safe. They were intimidated by all of the ""medical"" marijuana signs and shop trinkets that promoted doing drugs.Needless to say, we didn't stay long.Parking was $30 for 2 hours - maybe because it was a holiday weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvHaleiwa
30,big beach with a lot of attractions around,"the beach is sandy and big but unfortunately it wasn't sunny when we visited it. the major attraction is just beside the beach: when we were there there was an Indian festival with stages, gurus, peoples singing, praying, survived hippies from ancient time... the shop/bar owners in adiacent roads are very unpleasant; we were clearly foreign tourists and we asked to change 1$ into quarters for the parking meters: all of them refused with an excuse. we found only a mexican small grill who allowed us to use the tip box to change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiuseppeG834
40,A Walk at the Beach,"The Venice Boardwalk is a GREAT place to people watch! And a nice place to take a stroll any day.It is not nearly as dirty or ""bum"" infested as it once was. Good food, actually clean beach, and lots of patrolling to make sure there are no problems,. We go down a couple of times a year, and are even thinking about renting a place for a couple of days on the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tobi1254
30,Great scenery - Natural and Human!,The walk itself along Venice beach it wonderful and you will of course meet weirdos and odd balls along the way. Hey..this is LA remember!! It is a real pity that many homeless people seem to congregate along the way which will taint many peoples experience. Even Muscle beach seemed to attract those down on their luck. The place could do with an uplift somehow. Glad we did this area but wont rush back again too soon. Go watch the young skateboarders doing their tricks. Top tip = Be warned. Use the restrooms in the bars or restaurants as the public ones need much attention!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyH896
20,"Cool to see once, wouldn't return","We came to Venice Beach on a Saturday morning, because as tourists, it was one of those things people said we had to visit at least once. We found parking on the street because we knew we weren't going to be there for more than 2 hours so we weren't paying the insane amount for parking at the beach. Walked along the boardwalk, passing the ""freak show"" and Muscle Beach, where not much was going on at the time we were there. Apparently later in the day they were hosting a bikini contest but we didn't plan on staying there long. Also passed by the skate park, which was pretty cool.I'm not really one to get weirded out by things, I'm from NYC so I've seen almost everything. But there were a lot of sketchy people around. And there were homeless people EVERYWHERE. They even were using the public restroom sinks to clean themselves. Ew.I would never want to go there in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniann1518

10,Disgusting / dirty,"I've visited Venice many times in my 18 years in California. The bums pretty much guarantee urine is detectable everywhere. And the available public bathrooms are not only too few, but are never stocked with TP. Yesterday, my sons had to stand in line so they could take turns standing in 1/4"" urine puddles on the floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959phillips

50,Great summer weekend at Venice,"Apart of people watching (every one has a weirdo inside) you can lay down in the sand and tan while the breeze touches your body, in a very summer day the beach is pack of people getting in the water shaking the heat out. It's an amazing place to close your eyes and relax while you heard the waves and the smell of saltiness. When ever you feel taking a stroll there is a place call Bombay where the make amazing samosas or grab yourself a Peruvian mix ceviche and walk you way out of the crowd while enjoying this amazing people call Californians",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carmenmadani
40,Fun but slightly overwhelming place,"Venice Beach is a super interesting, eclectic melting pot of people from all walks of life. Alongside the beach-front sidewalk, lined with boutiques, cafes, and souvenir shops, you'll see the typical street performers (usually hip hop dancers that do crazy jumps/tricks), homeless people, skater punks, meat heads, tourists, trinket and craft sellers, musicians, and stoners-- with most partaking in or offering some sort of weed-related knick knack or experience. It's a fun place to be, but also overly crowded and overwhelming at times, especially on weekends in the summer.Definitely a great place for people watching though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celiastar

30,"Only good for ""people watching"" Not for kids","This place has changed a lot over the years. South Venice is still fairly nice and not too crowded. North Venice is dirty, crowded, a bit sketchy and strong smell of weed up and down the boardwalk. If you're into eclectic scenes & people watching, it's fine but be prepared to deal with strange crowds and terrible parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockChalkJessHawk

30,Another West Coach Beach,"I went to Venice Beach with a guest of mine at the end of August. We drove up from San Diego to see LA attractions. After trying to find a parking space for 30 minutes, we ended up finding one up the road about 5-6 blocks. Parking was definitely a downfall. After getting to the beach, I felt like there was nothing that really made it stand apart from any other beach up along the southwest Pacific coast in the US. With that being said, save your time and frustrations of trying to find a parking spot, and go elsewhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jvanderhofe

40,A must see at least once!,Visiting Venice Beach the 1st time with 9 Chinese Adults/Minors was definitely a trip! So many sites or freaks depending upon your point of view and smells/deals! Everyone was thoroughly amused and glad they were able to see the brach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMan20092014
30,Surprised by how run down it is,"As a lifetime east coaster, I'd forever heard of Venice Beach, CA. I was staying with my family in Santa Monica for a few days, and decided to rent bikes to ride along the beach and check out the sights in Venice Beach.I was struck by the beauty of the beach itself, and also how convenient and smart it is that there are separate, dedicated paths for bikes and pedestrians.But I was also struck by the sheer number of homeless folks in the area. Born and raised in a big city and currently living in a largely urban beach resort town myself, I'm no stranger to homeless people, it's just that I've never seen them camped out (and asleep) at the beach before. It was a little unsettling for my kids. I didn't mind so much (hey, they need to know there's a ""real world"" out there), but the kids felt uneasy.The ride through the canals was interesting.If you like shiny, glossy, high-end things, then skip Venice Beach. But if you like ""character"" then this is a good place for you. It was interesting to me to visit once and see it, but I'm not hurrying back any time soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CleveRocks
40,LOVE this crazy place!,"For us a visit to LA is not complete without at least a quick trip to Venice Beach - the quintessential crazy LA suburb. I know a lot of people who just see the seedy side of VB, but I'd say that it's somewhere you need to STAY at least once during a trip to LA. Visting it for an hour on a tour bus won't give you a real taste of what the area is like. You need to see it morning, day and night - it's like 3 different places & it's I especially like the early morning when all the little quirky VB things start to happen - although most people would probably prefer it mid-morning till late afternoon when it's busy, crazy and full of interesting things to see.I have been surprised by some of the locals who we've seen around on just about every visit for the last 25 years. Yes, they're that notable that you'll recognise them 5 years later after only having seen them once!We've stayed at the Venice Beach Suites, which is right on the boardwalk, and has quirky little rooms which are fresh but still retain little historic features in some rooms, like claw-footed baths and ornate old radiators. We really liked the place, the staff and the location. We'vw also stayed at the VB Inn, which is a renovated motel around the corner, just past the canals and close to the marina. We also found the staff lovely, the rooms very clean and very comfortable (great beds!) and the complimentary breakfast is a nice touch.VB is really close to LAX, so as either your first stop or your last stop after flying in, it's in a great location to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
50,Loved the atmosphere,"My husband and I visited here, and loved it! There is definitely tons to see, and lots of unique artwork to be seen. I loved the shows and creativity there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helicecm
50,Would go back to in a heartbeat,"It was probably one of the best parts of our trip and regret not getting to spend more time there. It was like everywhere you look there is something new to see, whether it be a person selling their art on the street or the venice beach freakshow it never seemed to end. The talent that is harvested in this area was unbelievable. Whenever my family talks about going back to california, the one consistent comment made is spending more time at venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megangushue
20,Very disappointed!!,"This was my first visit to Venice Beach and most likely my last. It wasn't at all what I expected of the tourist attraction that I have heard so much about. After strolling along the beach and storefronts, I just didn't feel clean and hurried to my next destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mschiffon
50,People watching in Venice!!,"I personally think that Venice Beach is ONE of THE best places to visit in L.A! It has such a strange mix of locals and tourists from all over the world that it is really one of the funnest places to people Watch.... From the big muscle men pumping up at Muscle Beach gym to the various people selling their wares and products on the boardwalk....Years ago, one of those strange street performers included me in his act by putting me up on his shoulders and carrying while he walked across a pile of broken glass strewed along the pavement!!! Out of this world!!! You will see ALL types and all walks of life out on the boardwalk.Stop for a henna tattoo (but not the black ink, it isn't good for you), grab a bite to eat, have an ice cream, buy some cheap sunglasses, or have your picture taken with an alien. You'll find it all there.... And it's safe! Biking riding, rollerblading, skake boarding, jogging... can all be done on the bike path that goes farrrrrr up the coast.If you want something a little more tame, try Main Street, just a few blocks up from the beach and you can have lunch, browse the shops and boutiques or even rent a bike for the day.Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesag2013
20,A real disappointment,I had been looking forward to seeing Venice beach for years and was so disappointed when I eventually got there. The place seemed run down with lots of homeless people everywhere having said that they weren't bothering anybody. We were there at around 8.30am and most places don't seem to open till 10am so maybe it would have been a different experience if we had arrived later. We did have a lovely stroll on the beach from Venice to Santa Monica and that was lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCClare
50,"Great place for ""People Watching""",We enjoyed our walk through Venice Beach. There is every type of food available whether it is a sit down restaurant or a walk up counter. If you go early in the day you will enjoy a quiet walk along the ocean. The crowds increase during the day with crowds gathering in the evening. There are numerous street performers from musicians to snake handlers. You can stop by the skate park and watch locals practice tricks and sometimes witness a few falls. Muscle Beach is an interesting stop. You may see a few athletes working out but for the most part it is just a place for average people to test their skills. We saw all types of people. If you have time find a place to sit and enjoy the sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjwright
40,Good trip out,"Continuing on from Santa Monica Pier & Beach, we found our way towards to the equally-famous Venice Beach. The famous street performers and stalls selling souvenirs and gifts were in their hundreds.

40,Bohemian atmosphere,"Nice beach, less crowdy than St. Monica. Crazy guys performing, little shops with all kinds of staff and a 60's atmosphere.... We went, we saw and... that's it. We had lunch there, I would prefer not to (due to the constant urine smell), but we were realy hungry! It's actually a beautiful place but in my opinion not respected enough by the visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aikasmy

50,It is a happening beach,"Venice is the most happening beach I have ever been. There are so many people with so many different things. One can pretty much spend the whole day watching people. It is the best place for watching people and live performances. Beach parties are awesome. I go to Venice beach every time I go to Los Angeles. I always talk about Venice beach a lot and it is one of my favorite destination.I have been asked many times, what is in Venice beach that I liked so much? Just a little background. I grew up in busy metropolitan where there is always enormous activity on the street. Not all cities are like that. New York has that same feeling. I have been into many big cities but very few has the street activity. I guess growing up in a city like that Venice feels like a home. It is unlike any beach, it is more of market than beach. If you are thinking of having a relax time in the beach or just lay around, I would recommend some other place (like Malibu), but Venice beach is for the people who wants to have some fun in the beach.If you like watching people Venice beach is the place. If you want a beach, go somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhaboghure_jhor
40,Venice Beach.... creative minds and relaxing attitude.,"Venice is a very relaxing beach in California near LA, a ver interesting mix of people, please bring your low profile and be ready to admire a very creative minds who work and live by the beach, some ""homeless"" who enjoy the Beach.I wouldn't bring kids but young adults is fine, I did not stay but enjoy the sunset and quiet time with friends.God did an amazing job in these califonia beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victortriper
40,Be Brave and Risk It,"The family and I used to visit Venice Beach on Sunday afternoons on a regular basis. We enjoyed the fabulous people watching, eating brunch in one of the trendy restaurants, walking the strip, enjoying the street performers and just experiencing the bohemian atmosphere. Be prepared to be handed CDs from independent artists (don't take them unless your willing to hand over a $10), be approached and told ""the Doctor is in"" by the many medical marijuana places, and be shocked at the talent and artistry that abounds. Beware the public restrooms, but enjoy the sand and ocean and exposure to different things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amysZ3119LM

But, crafts and cheap t-shirts are available, the beach is superb and safe, and warm. Images of LA are often of Venice Beach, and it doesn't disappoint in real life. Britain's equivalent is Newport Beach. scruffy but worthy of a day trip (and avoid at night). Santa Monica is just a few blocks away if you tire of Venice, but the latter is faithfully an LA attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulybear
30,Interesting for an hour or two,"Venice Beach is one of those places that you have to visit even if only for an hour. It has lots of quirky people and things going on. There were folks on muscle beach and people in the skate park that provided some good entertainment. Other than that, the walk along the beach promenade was filled with weird folks and people doing anything for a buck. I would not recommed eating anywhere here. It felt like nothing would be 'clean' or fresh. I would still recommed going...if only for the experience and only for an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teresuzza
20,Ugly!!,The best you could say about Venice beach is that it use to be nice! It is just plain ugly and dirty up on the boardwalk area. Take the walk to Santa Monica instead!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimRodB
30,"Worth visiting, for an hour max.","If your traveling to Los Angeles and you're around the area this place is worth visiting, but you don't need to spend much time there.Start off at muscle beach, head over to the skate park and then walk along the boardwalk.Muscle beach is a great opportunity for a humorous photo while it's cool to watch people skating in the park. I personally found the boardwalk tacky and full of strange people with their shops but it's case of why not? It's just a short walk.What I did was take a day to do both (very beachy day). Rent a bike, see the Santa Monica pier and then hit the cycle paths from there to Venice Beach or vice-versa. This way you get to see both beaches and have a beautiful cycle along the beach pathway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherRobins
30,Oh My,"The beach itself is amazing, but the place itself I found a bit scary. We were on a tour and the guide did warn us not to wander too far, and it was easy to see why.

40,An experience and a beautiful beach!,"OK, so the vendors sell some cheap stuff...but there are some who actually make their own products! It's fun to walk along the boardwalk and look at the people, shirts, art and vendors. The beach area was large and although we weren't there for swimming, it looked like there were plenty of people in the water. Parking was $9 for the day, at a nice and close lot. We didn't look around too much for something cheaper, as we thought it was worth the cost, to have a short walk! Lots of bikes and wheeled things to ride that you can rent. Be careful in the stores. One of them...with VERY loud music, told my daughter she could get ""any print on any color shirt"" talked her into getting a common print on a black shirt(they actually had only 2 colors of 1 style of shirt)...and then charged us $42 for a ""custom"" shirt :( Except for that, we had a fun 3 hours strolling, listening and watching. Of course, we all came home with treasures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KansasCouple_20

Amongst a variety of different spectacles, we saw a guy with a broken arm challenging passers-by to a sparring match. A certain aroma is abundant throughout. I would say hang onto your valuables and keep your wits about you and try and not make too much eye contact with certain types. In all honesty, it was an anti-climax after everything we had heard about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1960ju
20,Just what you heard!,"Okay, so I did read the reviews and new what I was expecting and yes, everyone was right! Nothing but crazies, shops all selling about the same thing and just miles of the same things. Tourist, walking, homeless all around, art being displayed but I wouldn't consider it much art and except for the beautiful beach, I would say, I would skip it next time I am in town. Nothing worth going to see unless if you are like us, we had to experience it to say we saw it, but once is enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmvizzo
30,One far corner in the multi-dimensional space that is California,"I recently visited SoCal with a small group of friends. I had never been to the Getty. I'll have to return to that.As for Venice, I'm marking it ""done"" on my list. Yes, you go to see weird people as much as anything. What you mostly see is hawkers of cheap, stupid t-shirts interrupted by vendors of bad food.Still you might want to see it. I did. I also made a trip to Haight-Ashbury in SF.Compared to what I was told to expect, the drug pedaling has probably been reduced by legalization of marijuana. Still, there are plenty people using. And that's not the only thing you're going to smell.My only regret is that it was overcast and we were late in the day, so I didn't see any Baywatch women roller blading wearing dental floss.I made the trip, and I won't need to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
40,Shall we say...interesting!,"I was a little skeptical about going after I read some of the negative reviews - especially from people with children. I really didn't know what to expect and wondered if I should bring my kids here (12 and 15). I have to say we really enjoyed the atmosphere and went back a few times - we biked from Santa Monica Pier through here, shopped, and ate around the corner from the Venice walkway. There was good touristy shops and local artists, etc. that you can get some interesting things from. I found a shop nearing one end of it and I bought some nice clothing for work. I was surprised to find a store like this. There are a few bikini shops with a zillion bathing suits crammed together if you are looking for some. They were just making the set for ""American Ninja Warrior"" there as well. There are some strange characters around for sure, homeless people (never bothered though) and the smell of pot is everywhere. Some are noticeably high. The Muscle Beach area was fun to watch guys working out and there were some other sports going on. Yes, it is a little dirty along the strip. The beach itself looked fine but we didn't walk all the way down to the water - we were just there to look around. If you want a little culture, enjoy people watching, and are in the mood for some mild, free entertainment - check it out. But I do not think it is for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tafierce
40,A relaxing stroll,"The boardwalk has a huge range of shops/stalls with all sorts of things to buy. The beach is huge, muscle beach easily accessible and other activities for the energetic. Murals capture the history of the area and are quite spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279TracyH
40,Real beachfront community,"Venice Beach was on our list of must sees when visiting LA and we weren't disappointed. OK there are a few homeless people but they kept themselves to themselves and I can think of far worse place to be homeless.The Beach was fine and safe to swim in with alternating areas for swimmers and surfers.Along the promenade there is a cycle/skate/board path and all of these are available to hire. Plenty of shops, stalls, food outlets, the iconic muscle beach and some great street entertainers. The whole place seemed safe and was hassle free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S-Harris66
40,Great athmosphere,"Loved the place. Very relaxed, great for young people that want to chill. Loads of different things going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SashaEl
30,Fun but dirty,"The beach in Venice has a lot to do, but the smell of urine everywhere gets old. It's fun to watch the skaters and the weight lifters, shop for souvenirs, and eat at the stalls and restaurants on the beach. I just can't get over the grit though, especially when you can go to nearby Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach which are both much cleaner and have cheaper parking. Still worth a trip to see such an iconic part of LA, just don't go barefoot. Plus, the neighborhoods in Venice are nice and worth exploring. Spend an hour on the beach, then go see the canals and art galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144adamw
50,Amazing Experience,"Sun, Sand, Pacific Ocean and very amusing local people, muscular guys working out at the famous Muscle Beach! What more could you want???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheJedi
40,"Very umm interesting , but not what I expected.","Ok it was finally good to see Venice beach and the great variety of t shirt and medicinal marihuana shops. I bought a cd from one of those guys hawking cd's , but my Italian companion pulled me away. I lot of interesting characters. And I picked up some great t shirts. It's walking distance to both Santa Monica and the canals, I was disappointed I didn't find the jim morrison mural. But the beach is actually very nice, the architecture is great. I thought it would have a more alternative feel. But was very touristy.The medicinal mariijuana shops were of no use to me. But a seasoned pot smoker may find the idea tantalising. Saw a guy on roller skates in leopard skin print speedos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650scottm
30,Been there done that,It was definitely not what I expected. If it wasn't so littered and didn't smell like urine the beach would have been nicer. I'm glad I saw the place but probably won't go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sznngalvin
30,Smells like pot and looks like skid row,"If your visit to California will include beaches, visit Venice Beach AFTER other beaches. This beach is not one to memorialize a trip to California. With bums, pot, stench, and congestion, this beach does not make the best impression of a California beach.The workout area was interesting to see, but the other beaches are much better for a true California beach/tourist experience. Skip this unless you want the California ghetto version of a beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee
40,If you want to taste the feeling of LAs beaches.,"If you want to ""taste"" the LA style and the famous Californian beaches you have to walk on the roads and on the path close to the Ocean.You can find fantastic houses and cottages and funny people.If you will have time, wear your running shoes and run for some miles to ""smell"" like them the life in Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mCZ_reviewer
40,Californication ;),"This is California..I really loved this place, wide beach, young people, you feel alive and free..there are plenty of bars, restaurants, tattoos saloons and all kinds of other social places..don't expect a nice color of water though, as the sand is quite dark and water is quite cold as the californian current is cold in its nature...this place is not about the color of water, but about lifestyle, surfing, skateboarding, enjoying life, etc..I personally loved it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishii_mis

( if you know what I mean!) ,people watch,skateboard,sedgway,cycle,sunbathe,eat,shop,listen to a band,watch a street entertainer, you can see it all here,very strange,interesting,enjoyable and fun place. Beautiful sandy beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs21
40,Outdoor gym,"Visited the outdoor gym which was featured on television. Did not see anyone working out there, probably because it was too early in the morning or because it was closed. The walk along the beach was refreshing. Bought a few t-shirts as souvenirs in one of the many souvenir shops located along the pedestrian walkway. It was November 2014 and so there was no one soaking in the ocean. Did see a couple of street performers and food trucks along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EF71R
50,Love it!,"I just love Venice Beach! It's very busy, entertaining and fun! I have seen reviews about people complaining about the homeless and drug users, but unfortunately they are at the Santa Monica pier as well. I just take it all in as an experience. Great place to people watch, or to go shopping, or to eat or have a beer. Muscle beach is close by too. Also the beach itself is huge! I was shocked how clean it was since it's so big and busy. I would definitely stay here again. You won't be bored!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelFit
10,Venice Beach,"Wow! I have always seen the famous Venice Beach on TV. I pictured it as being a Whole Foods/Sprouts, eclectic type beach community, only to find homeless, drug addicts and pan handlers all around the beach. Not to mention the stench of urine and trash laying around. It was such a big disappointment. Hollywood has truly glamorized it in their movies. Its too bad. I will never bother returning. I'm heading to Huntington Beach now. Hopefully that's a better place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindagI8178LX
30,Not so good beach.,been to this place. the people were of not that good quality the stores in the shorelines will scare you. the beach was fantastic. we didnt see people playing music in the street though. new port beach is much better than this though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanmugamrs
50,A variety of unique people.,"Venice Beach is high energy. Despite being a beach, I didn't see or even think about swimming. The street performers, artists, skaters and people in general will keep you occupied for the day. There is some cool graffiti all around the beach and tons of affordable art to buy from the street vendors. Don't be surprised if your offered weed prescriptions--there are no shortage of weed doctors along the walk. The vibe is fantastic. Bring a carrying bag along because I would be shocked if you left empty handed.I would have to say it is apparent that this attraction is a daytime attraction and I wouldn't think about going at night as I can imagine the sorts that would lurk around a unique place like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExportLove
40,A real smorgasbord of culture,"If you want a taste of the culture of Los Angeles and its people, check out this place. There is quite a variety of booths, restaurants, and grass roots entertainment. You will not be disappointed, in fact, you will be amazed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94ChrisR94
10,So dirty.,"A good friend lived in Venice for most of our college years. The first time we walked our dogs there it seemed like a good idea until we realized the number of homeless, drug addicts, street vendors and general deadbeats that harass you. And don't get caught there after dark! If you're visiting and want to just say you've seen it, go mid-day on a week-day - outside of that be cautious and careful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigthm
40,Something for Everyone,"Had to make a stop at the world famous Venice Beach. It was well worth it. Such a mix of people, entertainment, and food. Even managed a quick workout! It's a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adrenaline21
50,Had a blast...fun place must see (bucket list),"Hey...this is an iconic place, got some great photos of all the interesting people. Did not do the bike think since really the frontage area of the shops was more interesting. Everything from trinkets to painting can be found. Okay let's talk parking...avoid those guys with big signs saying public parking, we paid 30 bucks and just down the street near the beach was 9 bucks and realistic public parking. We got toasted on parking but everything else was great. One more thing for those city type of people...take your flip flops to trudge across the hot sand to the beach, and your regular walking shoes for the boardwalk. Have Fun...We did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sesshi101
40,People Watchers Paradise,"We spent a day at Venice Beach, interacting with the many local characters, vendors, artists and musicians along the boardwalk. There are some nice shops and restaurants. We were lucky enough to see a tv show being filmed on the beach. We were talking to some of the extras and actors, and one had grown up in Nashvlle, where we are from. There were some homeless people sleeping under the trees, but nowadays you will see that most everywhere. We never felt that we weren't safe and there were uniformed police officers visible. The beach is huge and it is quite a walk to the ocean. If you know the history of Venice, CA, you know that there were canals, instead of roads. We parked our car in a lot off one of these old paved over roads. The curb was exceptionally tall and the road was very narrow. Venice Beach was one of the highlights to my L.A. trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T6682SZsharons
30,Not your average beach,"I enjoyed my time at Venice, it's a very different place. The shops and people are very interesting, and you also have nice dinning spots. People are always doing shows and all sorts of things, which makes it fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amonge89
40,fun experience,"I would have to say that people watching here is pretty great. Just like the rest of LA the wealth gap is extremely prevalent. DO NOT GO IN THE WATER!!! Everyone advises against it, just don't do it and don't let your kids go in",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonnyPuertoRico
50,"Artsy, urban beach!","We loved Venice Beach. We walked from Santa Monica Beach to Venice (about a 20 minute walk on the bike path), and stumbled into the many artisans and musicians that line the walkway through Venice. Their colorfully painted hippie style vans greet you here as well. This was my favorite part, since it seemed artsy, urban and authentic. As you get much further down the walkway, shops crop up that are more souvenir based, and there are far more tourists. We did not care for this part of Venice as much, but still I would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691sharons
10,Unsettling,"I am 52 and admittedly from a sheltered bedroom community in Canada. My need for security is very high and that colours my experiences so recognize that when you read this review. Venice Beach is not for everyone. I found it to be unsettling. My husband and grown kids were amused by the ""characters"" but I just felt uneasy and insecure. There is nothing fun for me to be immersed in that environment with drug addicts, beggars, tough types... I travel the world and I hated this experience so intensely that I literally got in the door of our hotel and wrote this review. In balance, the beach is fabulous but we went quite late in the evening, not long before the street vendors were closing down (at sundown), so I wasn't there by day. I just felt uneasy. I wouldn't want to wander down the wrong alley there. Maybe I am all wrong but there is not sense in anyone like me going there just to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bridlewood
50,Gotta Go,"If you are visiting LA, you HAVE TO go to Venice Beach. Art, Activities, Entertainment, Food, and the beach……Can't beat that! Sure, you have heard about it, but you must see it for yourself. I was entertained by street performers, asked to purchase a medical marijuana card, bought a souvenir, watched some buff dudes work out, AND was told I was going straight to hell if I didn't repent my sins…….all in one block! It doesn't get any more LA than this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckster2232524
40,Good one!!,"Nice beach busting with loads of activities along with bars & restaurants. One of the must thing here is to go cycling and a must watch are the drummers who play everyday during sunset..if one is interested one can take there drums & join the group. Although after dark it gets a bit dodgy, but still a worth watch when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saikiran9
40,Entertaining!!!,I expect the unexpected every time I visit Venice Beach. I enjoy it. One end is relaxing and quite. The other end is strictly entertaining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WGwiz
40,You just have to go,There is nothing like Venice Beach. You don't necessarily go to lay on the beach you walk and watch people. Listen to people sing and dance. Look at the art work. Go window shopping. There nothing like this anywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriemabel

50,A Must See if you're visiting LA,"I love Venice Beach. As a resident of LA, I go there at least a few times a year. It is very eclectic, diverse & a hip place to go for a stroll. People watching, lots of casual restaurants, street performers, one of a kind vendors, spectator sports, and a beach all rolled into one. Just a short stroll from Santa Monica, but feels like a different world. Always entertaining. The only thing I don't like is the influx of medical marijuana places over the last few years with their annoying signs. I would definitely also recommend that you be aware of your surroundings and watch your purse, there are all kinds of characters about. I would recommend weekend, daytime as the ideal time to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaG1969
30,Funky,"Fun place to just people watch. Full of a lot of characters. Cheap souvenir stands along the strand. It was pretty crowded walking as it is a popular tourist destination. There are many homeless people living on the beach, but they did not bother anyone. Parking was pricey in the lots (17.50). It is probably possible to find a spot along the streets and walk to the beach, we just didn't take the time to do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamV265
50,Great way to spend the day in Santa Monica,"Loved going for a refreshing swim to beat the heat. Seeing all the people working out on Muscle Beach was quite the sight, as well. If you get the chance, the Venice Beach Ale House serves up a fantastic drinks menu with some excellent people-watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller88
50,Good Vibes,"The 1970's skate vibe still exists here at the right time of day - but maybe avoid the place at night. There's a large number of crazies hanging out here at all time - but at night the area can get pretty dodgy. Regardless - a great place to visit and experience the basketball, skating and biking happening in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fieldnotesau
50,Eclectic fun,"Wonderful place to visit. Beautiful beach, fun shopping all the gift shops. Great entertainment. Only downside was parking prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/376annieg
10,True Venice,"This place should be avoided by all means : filthy streets, shop tenants that will try to steal from you with all tricks. I personnaly got trapped by one that was selling sunglasses. They will pretend you scratched a lense if you have a pair of sunglasses fall and will ask for money. The local police was helpful and understanding but I eventually gave up on 10 dollars to leave in peace.The only interest is the charming neighborghood with the canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Typh00n202
50,Weird and amazing,"Venice Beach is a bit of a Rorschach test. If you enjoy a weird urban scene and have a high tolerance for grit, and you aren't intimidated by homeless people, you'll love it. But if you haven't had a lot of experience with that, or just don't like that scene, then by all means find a different beach--there are plenty of them.Our family wandered through the beach scene for several days in a row and never felt unsafe (though the skateboarders zooming by came awfully close a couple times). It's true the bathrooms are filthy, and so are some of the people who sleep there. But the beach itself is enormous and gorgeous, with swimmers and surfers, runners and yogis everywhere.We loved it, but it's easy to see how someone could also hate it. It's an extreme place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichJohn
30,Gym and skateparks was cool but trashy place,Finally came to Venice beach after seeing it on TV and reading about it on the Internet.The place was cool with skate parks and basketball courts. I finally got to see the place where Arnold Schwarzenegger worked out! The gym looked pretty rundown which was a little disappointing.Venice beach had a few local shops but nothing worth buying. Mostly junk. I also felt it was a little dirty. Santa Monica is a 100Times better!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandonk813
50,"don't grow up, it's a trap!","Some people are just so judgmental, sad, old and boring ... Open your eyes: Venice Beach is a definite ""must-visit"", it is a geyser of urban creativity, a melting pot of all walks of life, a beautiful beach line which, contrary to many other public or ""posh"" Euro-trash beaches, is clean and full of real life! Stay in Rodeo Drive with fashion junkies if your thing is shopping ... Go to St Tropez if self contemplation is your thing ... Venice Beach is about people, humans, a picture of the great casino of life....and the spray paintings, murals are amazing...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giampigiampaolo
10,"Dirty, crowded, scarey people, toilets overflow - yuk","We went to several beaches in LA and the OC, this was by a mile the worst. We stopped for an hour and with 20 minutes we wanted it get our kids out of there and back safely on our tour. The second we neared the beach we had armed police, police on Mounties and police on bikes around us; good because there were homeless people everywhere; clearly drug affected people and the muscle beach and famous basket ball (white men can't jump fame) was crowded with some very scary looking individuals, there was rubbish and fifth everywhere, toilet queues and you could see over flows trickling out and the beach was dirty and rough; with people and their stuff everywhere. So very different to what we had seen in countless tv and movie shows and compared to our western australian beaches just plain yuk. We liked and felt safe at Huntington Beach and found Santa Monica ok, but equally drug affected homeless people all over. We went to Venice early afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timhartland
40,Really nice beach,"This is one of the many beaches in the LA area that all kind of run together. This particular one is famous or infamous for its colorful places like muscle beach and colorful people and shops. Explaining what a medical marijuana card application place is to the kids makes for an uncomfortable conversation, but hey...it's LA. If you walk far enough you run into Santa Monica beach and that is also very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wyomingdan
50,One of a kind! Check it out!,Venice Beach is one of those unique places you have to see at least once.It is a blend of people from ALL walks of life.If you are open minded and non-judgemental you will have an awesome visit here.Some people say this place is trashy.These comments come from a lack of understanding of the human spirit.Just because people may appear to be homeless does not mean they are unhappy.The earth is our home.Not your cookie cutter box house in suburbia.Appreciate this place for what it is.A beautiful place of every kind of humanity co-existing at the beach.Relax and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seank0
40,Real LA,"This is a very nice beach – long, wide and clean. And with all the life guard towers you can’t help feeling a little bit as part of the old Baywatch TV series. If you want to swim and sunbath stay away from the area around Tower 23 (where all the fun happens).If you are into sun fun, some real LA and some people watching go to that area. Even if there is a LA police station in the middle of the area don’t go there at night.Muscle Beach is kind of cool, but not really any of the super big guys we had expected. Basketball courts, skater ring and racket ball areas were really interesting.The food from the beach vendors is average at best. The parking is very difficult and the price is horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hotfarm
40,"Look, it's real life.","Not an attraction. Not cleaned up or sanitized. Not Disneyland. It's Dogtown. It's what it is, plain and simple. Homeless, vagrants, drug addicts--a gorgeous wide beach and the dichotomy of 6 million dollar beach mansions beside the real mess of life. Gorgeous sun and sand with lots to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PB99power
20,Very Trashy,We are visiting LA for the first time and someone recommended that we visit Venice Beach. I wish I had read some of these reviews earlier.... Scary and very trashy. Homeless and drug dealers everywhere..... Our teenagers were disgusted and wanted to leave. They kept asking if it's legal to smoke marihuana in public like that...We did not spend much time and didn't buy anything...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elladah
20,Meh,"A bit of a let down, though muscle beach and the lagoon areas behind the Venice beach strip were cool. Venice is a bit seedy, a bit repetitive and a bit sad. We had the sense it was trying a bit too hard to create a feel and in doing so did not succeed to do so. Walk through to be able to say you have been, but time better spent is at the Santa Monica pier and third street promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royn98
30,Unique beach in LA,The beach and ocean are wonderful but there are many homeless people in the area so not as clean as other beaches in LA. Nice restaurants and coffee shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaL21
40,Beautiful beach overlooking blue water,"This is one of the cleanest beaches I've ever visited. Of course, most of my beach experiences have been on the east coast of New Jersey, so I don't have Hawaii or the Caribbean to compare.Muscle Beach is kind of cool, although it looked more like a cage with animals to me. I had pictured it to be a series of workout equipment surrounded by a low fence, but it looked more like a cement playground where I had to peer through the fence to actually see the guys working. Just average guys in there. Nothing to write home about.Like I said, the beach itself is fantastic. Lots of room to spread otu and the water is a beautiful blue. There are lots of eateries and shops to explore along the way. Outdoor bathroom areas with water fountains in several spots along the way make it a comfortable experience, although the stall I went in wasn't the cleanest.Rent a bike, and be sure to visit some of the side streets more inland so you get a real sense of what this fun place is all about. P.S. I wasn't there at night, but I heard it can get wild there after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freed0mt0travel
10,Scary!,"Not a place to take your family! Homeless and drug addicts everywhere. We were very scared and couldn't wait to get out of there. Beach area was fine but the boardwalk and just the walk from the car was scary. Also, the bathrooms on the beach were unsuitable for animals! Too disgusting to even describe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniehar
10,open restroom urine smell,"Yes ,I got to see the characters of the macadam boardwalk. I also saw all the homeless people...LOTS of homeless people...Sad, and the dope doctors trying to cajole people to come in and a get doctors prescription for medical marijuana! The beach was no great shake but I had to go see it for myself. Jersey shore, you ain't got nothing to worry about!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/potsietp
30,OK... not for a long visit !,"Venice Beach is one of those places that you feel you absolutely have to visit, then when you do it, you find that it's not quite like you expected. Now if you are wanting to enjoy the beach and watch the people, there is a lot of that, and the beach is really big and beautiful. There are a lot of people to watch... But there wasn't much for us after about an hour. The food from the beach vendors is average at best. The parking and the price to park is horrible, especially when you have to park in one of the parking garages away from the beach. But we are glad we went. For this one time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IverJohnson
10,Venice Beach/Trash City,"Do NOT go. Wife and I walked down from Santa Monica. It was so nasty we got on a bus back to Santa Monica ASAP. Drugs, gangs, people on drugs, homeless laying around.....NOT a tourist place to visit.Felt unsafe and it was daylight. I would not go back. Go to Santa Monica or Huntington Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylcampbell56
50,An LA Must-Do,"Venice Beach is a scene not to be missed! Street shows, t-shirt shopping, green doctors, craft vendors, spray painting graffiti artists, skateboard park, beach, muscle beach, and an active board walk just to name a few. We rented bikes and went from Venice Pier to the Santa Monica Pier and then walked around and experienced the sites and sounds of Venice Beach. There are plenty of paid parking lots within walking distance. If you're looking for food....I'd wait and hit a restaurant on Abbott Kinney just a short distance away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643karent
50,A Good Two Hour Walk--And Two Hours Therapy,"This is a great free attraction. I can´t resist going back to Venice Beach every couple of years when I am in LA. There is, of course, a wide sandy beach there, however, the crowds are all on the walk along the front. People watching each other watch everyone else. There are 75 year olds on skate boards, people dressed in buckskin, guys just standing around showing their muscles, numerous opportunities for tatoos, full body or otherwise and that´s just a start. Given what I observed I would not be at all surprised if the complete works of Rilke are available for a tatoo. There is the same great line of t-shirt shops that one sees in Blackpool, or Brighton, UK, or the Costa Brava in Spain, but these t-shirts seem to be mostly dedicated to dysfunctional lives, phobias and psycho drama. Mostly of them read like hostile bumper stickers. For Londoners this is Camden Lock taken to the 10th power, but absent the Salvation army band. It´s a little difficult to decide whether this seafront display is just fun or a kind of outdoor asylum giving therapy for $14.99 a shirt. The Whalers beach bar is a great place to stop for a drink to recover or take your medication. I heartily recommend it. Come and see it and be seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570RobertW570
30,Fun for brief visit,"I grew up in LA, but haven't been to Venice Beach in over 30 years. We had several hours before our plane departed so we drove the rental car up Hwy 1 to Venice (about 15 min north of LAX). DON'T park in the overpriced, private lots off Lincoln ($30!) go straight toward the beach. We paid the $9 and found a spot right next to the pier. We rented bikes for an hour and rode toward Santa Monica. A fun ride, nice to take in the crazies, bohemians, etc., all while traveling just fast enough not to get hit up by panhandlers every 90 seconds. If you have never been here, it's worth coming, if you have, it's still the same, perhaps a bit dirtier than you remember. But, WAY better than sitting in the airport for a couple extra hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMT56
40,The Little Things,"Like all hyped-up tourist attractions, Venice Beach has a reputation that I don't think it will ever live up to. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't visit.When visiting, focus on the little things like the sprawling beach, the various street acts, and, hopefully, a golden sunset. Soak up the sun, people watch, and enjoy being out and about (instead of crammed up inside).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheKyleMyburgh
40,Interesting place,My friend and I went down early and parked by the beach. We had a walk around all the canals in that area and then we went for a walk up and down the boardwalk. It was much quieter first thing in the morning. We spent a few hours on the beach and then went up again later on. It was extremely busy in the afternoon and there were some strange stalls.There was a fitness and bikini contest going on down at Muscle beach.It is really busy and there are quite a lot of homeless people but it is worth going down for a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bumblebee_bay86
20,"Grotty, dirty, same old tourist stalls","We visited Venice Beach on a hot dry day. As we weren't there for the swimming we were very disappointed with the dirty and dusty streets and paths, the poor quality of the shopping and the general 'down at heel' vibe of the place. Running the gauntlet of hawkers was also not appreciated.It may be fine for swimming... it may be fine for young party types at night... but we didn't enjoy it as a destination, wouldn't stay or visit again, and would definitely not recommend it for families with children. What a dump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjw2013
30,Over reated!,"We had heard so much about it that we could not wait to visit. When we arrived it was crowded, there were several little stores with everything from sunglasses to clothing. The ones that sold food did not look like a place we wanted to grab a snack from. The street performance was ok but they were a little rude and took forever to start, which was surprising since they wanted tips.

40,Famous,We went there to see this famous place. Tons of people. Quite interesting and fun people watching. Nice beach but also lots of homeless people. Not the pretties place but worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banff2013
40,Great for People Watching,"Went to Venice Beach 2 weeks ago. So many little shops to venture in and out of, and a lot of performers(magicians, sand sculpting, painters, etc.) to watch and tip. Not enough restaurants, but plenty of tobacco, ""green"" pharmacists, t-shirt and souvenir shops and more. We parked for free a couple blocks away and saw the cutest little creek with kayaks and canoes. The facilities were plentiful but rather dirty and smelly. Enjoyed walking along though and watching the ocean, the awesome people and ambiance. I would love to go back when we have more time to play around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyfamilyMacomb_Il
40,Beautiful Beach,"Great waves, clean water, and beautiful sand. We got there early in the day and had no trouble finding a spot on the beach. Parking in the lot was $9 for the day which seemed reasonable. There were public beach bathrooms but they were not clean. Very fun to walk around and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovesTheSunshine137
40,Great leisure activity,"The best thing about Venice beach is the skateboard park! It is way back on the beach and so much fun to watch! There are also plenty more interesting things to see on the ""boardwalk"". There are tons of small shops and street performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lea_4nj
10,Muscle beach,"Muscle beach that is all! We really dislike Venice Beach! Crowds, bad food, dirty, ugly shopping, no parking! Why would anyone go there??? Cute canals to walk by. That is it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451kellyr
30,Okay Beach,Was very busy with lots of activities on the sidewalks. The area needs a bit of attention as it looks quite rundown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FemiL
50,A strange place but fun,"I love Venice beach and it's fun to walk and see the strange people. It can have a very strange vibe though for those who spiritually sensitive. Just to be ware, that some people feel dizzy or nauseous while others dont notice anything at all. Wear sun block in the summer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ducknc
40,Very eclectic place,"Got there last weekend, it could get pretty crowded with all shops around, parking is not easy, better not bringing the car or you end up paying hefty price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmie75
40,Great place for people watching,"Venice is a great mix of people from all walks of life. I can come across as quite rough but for the most part this is a very pleasant and relaxed place to enjoy a few hours. The shoppings is a mixed bag of anything you can and can't think of (masses of tourist junk :-) ), there are street performers trying to sell you their CD's and there is of course the open air gym and skatepark which are both classic landmarks. Parking is a bit of a mess, and although plenty a good approach is to plan it at least a little bit if only to ensure you end you in the vincinity of where you want to be, The beach is huge and the walk from Venice towards Santa Monica offers some great California beach community views. The beach itself is huge and quite nice but the water was surprisingly full of junk. Swimming in the Pacific is of course a must-do in the summertime",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassilis666
50,a must do,"parked our car near the beach for the day. Approx $15. It was great here, although it was a Friday, it was buzzing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baileys456
50,People Watching at its Best,"Lose the car so you don't have to park. Spend the day ""people watching"" at Venice Beach. We visited on the 4th of July and SOOOOO glad we didn't have the car. Took the Uber taxi down -- best idea of the day! Lots of bikes too.People watching at Venice Beach is a really fun and unique experience. The boardwalk is walking-friendly. Lots of local artists, musicians, singers, crafty-type of art, cool murals on the buildings. Be sure to stop at the Venice Beach Freakshow; for $4 you get a dose of unique entertainment. Then stop at one of the open air cafes and join plenty of other laid back folks enjoying the Cali sunshine. The boardwalk has plenty of room to walk and Muscle Beach is fun to see. Of course, the beach sand and waves are beautiful too!As another reviewer mentions, cops police the area so it felt pretty secure. On this 4th of July, there are police cars, walkers, cops on horses, on two- and three-wheelers ... all sort of security for those who need that.All in all, we spent the whole day with loads of fun at the beach! People watching was amazing and great. Come one come all to Venice Beach and enjoy the Boardwalk!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaelyA
30,OK,"Wilson and I spent 3 hours at Venice Beach on Saturday morning June 28. We parked at a private lot with the attendant Cyrus. He charged us $15 for 3 hours. There are official parking lots just a bit closer right by the beach for $15 so make sure to head right to the beach before you park. This is the only place my feet touched the Pacific Ocean. There was a skateboard park, lots of places to eat, plenty of goofy art, odd people, street performers, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Packerfancheesehead
40,Pleasant Atmosphere,"Along the beach you'll find some interesting shops as well as recreational activities. Overall, the atmosphere is pleasant and secure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998carmenj
40,Come for the shopping and people watching.,"Venice Beach, like Venice District, is an eclectic melting pot of cultural, socio-economic, political, and musical ranges.The shopping is fun, great for getting touristy junk, horrid to great food, and amazing people watching.Parking is about $15, including disabled (handicap parking free Monday through Friday, though).Leave your valuables at home/hotel. Dress comfortably. Enjoy the beach and the strand. Rent a bike. Visit Muscle Beach. Drop-in at the skate park.Bring your camera, your curiosity, and your thick skin. Venice Beach is a must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deputy5211
30,Please understand it up front,"I am a travel snob but I think Venice Beach is a bit misunderstood and may have some misconceptions associated with it. Is it dangerous? Not anymore than Chicago or Phoenix, in my opinion. Police are very present, made me feel more secure. All the beach ""inhabitants"" were either good spirited or quiet and kept to themselves. They don't bother you if you don't bother them. Is it dirty? Yes but it's a beach, not a 5 star resort. Who do you think is gonna clean up after everyone? The chambermaid? I imagine Venice Beach was frozen in time maybe around the late 70's. I would guess this is what all of So Cal looked/felt like back then. Does the whole beach smell like pot? Oh yes it does! It kind of adds a hippy, peace and love, nostalgic vibe.This beach is not a benign, kid-friendly, tourist trap type of place. It's not full of wholesome goodness and ""midwestern values"". I can say that, I'm from Illinois. This is a beach bum laden, pot smoking, skateboarding, hole in the wall cafe, hanging out selling trinkets and playing instruments, forgot-what-decade-it-was beach. Go there with an understanding of what Venice beach has to offer. It's different, always interesting, lots to see, and actually great places to eat. There are also quite a few Europeans that vacation here. I heard more people around me speaking a foreign language than English. That just adds to the VB interest as well as the diverse offering of food and beer.We stayed at Venice suites right in the heart of it all. We walked up to Santa Monica pier and back down the other way, all the way to Marina Del Rey. Two totally different walks! Going north to SM pier, it's pretty and the hotels are more $ per night than I'd ever pay for a California beach. The pier is kitschy but fun to walk around. Then walk south through Venice beach to Marina Del Rey and the show begins. There are cafes, stores, little food stands, entertainers galore, lots of cool graffiti art, muscle beach and interesting people everywhere selling trinkets, art, crystals, healing and fortune telling. They aren't trying to sell you drugs, they want to sell you sage so you can smudge your new pad, man. Put your wallet in your front pocket but walk confidently. You are not in danger. It's just a bunch of people all doing their own thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachesinaz
50,Exciting!,"Beautiful long beach of white sands and clean water. Busy and vibrant place with lots of cool shops, different entertainers from magicians, dancers, to the muscle beach Venice with guys working out in scorching heat and the famous skate park as well as the basketball courts with competitions going on.A must visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexanae

40,Try the funnel cake,"Just as expected - cool little stores, skateboarders, street performers, people of all walks, the beach. It was easy walking around just watching everything happening. Venice is want you want to make of it and is absolutely worth taking a drive to see. The funnel cake is awesome and there are bars, restaurants and food trucks to grab a bite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newbag
10,Terrible disappointment,We couldn't wait to visit Venice Beach and let the kids skateboard at the skatepark from the awesome brochures.Yuck! After paying to park and walking through several villages of homeless people we found ourselves surrounded by people drinking beer and smoking pot while screaming obscenities at each other. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting and the entire park was seedy. What a shame. I would be furious if I owned a million roast property and paid taxes to the city of Venice CA. The police do absolutely nothing to control the fighting and drug use in the public beach and park.Don't visit if you do not want your children to smell marajuaina and watch drug deals. Shame on the city of Venice CA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmybabies
20,full of homeless people and drugs,"We were so shocked going to LA, our second day we went to Venice Beach and Santa Monica pier, I was actually concerned at Venice Beach, there were so many homeless people which was sad, but some weer affected by drugs ( could smell pot as you walked past the small lane ways) 2 guys were threatening to ""off"" each other in front of everyone and looked clearly affected by drugs, their are random things everywhere but if you even look at them they expect a tip, we are polite when travelling and take tip money everywhere, but we would of needed a thousand $1 bills to tip everyone there and if you miss someone they get annoyed, we ended up racing through, a few shirt shops with now prices were on the way, got to the Pier and had a look around, but we were really shocked and disappointed travelling so far to see how bad the situation was there with homeless and problems..The public toilets there were disgusting beyond anything I have seen in a civilised country, we had to dine in the boardwalk restaurant to use a bathroom and even that was pretty bad.. I wish I had something better to say but if your travelling from a long way and expecting something magical here then you will be bitterly disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel_4075
20,Should be called Tawdry Beach,"I always thought Newport Beach was a little sleazy, but after coming here, Newport looks like the beach equivalent of the Ritz. Crowded, terrible traffic, lots of colorful folks, LOUD, dirty....just would not go there. The canals of Venice, however, are beautiful. But to pay $25 to park for a half hour walk seems a bit steep. Skip this beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susanbunny_8
20,Not what you would expect,"Took public transport here which I wouldn't recommend for a variety of different reasons even though the only other option is to taxi which is very pricey (try asking for a flat rate before u hop in). Once we arrived we observed numerous homeless people and beggars along with the occasional drug deal. If you want to hire anything please note that they require you to physically hand over your license and your credit card for ""safe-keeping"". The majority of items being sold can be found on eBay for much cheaper, which is probably where it all came from originally. The outdoor gym was pretty rad and it was great watching all the people have a go in the skate park. there are also a lot of cafés etc to choose from when u want to get out of the sun and grab a quick bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439krysk
40,A must see while visiting CA,"This is a great place to buy tourist items, get a henna tattoo (or a real one), eat, drink, see weirdos (yes, lots of them). If you are doing the strand (right along the beach itself) go during the day, sundown changes the personnel and you don't want to be there with the kids. During the day you will see the original Muscle Beach (with newer equipment). Venice beach as a whole is a lot of fun. Abbot Kinney is great to shop but the old cottages are mostly gone, replaced with newer shops that aren't that ""Beachy"". Venice used to be old and quaint and really interesting with antique shops and cute little houses converted to shops. Only a few left but worth a visit to see them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shobs59
30,Venice / Muscle Beach,"The actual beach here is somewhat sterile for my tastes, very long very straight very flat. Venice itself is a pretty run down poor neighbourhood with lots of oddball / weird characters. Lots of beggars and also street merchants selling mainly rubbish.For anyone interested in old school bodybuilding, it is essential to visit Muscle Beach to say you've been there. Not the original location, but still iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clive_Sally_H
50,Loved Venice Beach!,"Venice Beach is totally unique! The shops are great, the vendors that set up are all quirky and the people watching is without doubt the best part! It's really chilled out with a friendly vibe, vi would totally go back and sit with a drink in a beach cafe and watch the world go by!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annie6678
30,Dirty!,"If you want to experience a different type of CA beach environment, this is it, dirty almost uncomfortable if you have kids. On the other hands, the residential area on the canals in Venice Beach has a great feel. It is nice to stroll around that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louay
40,"Funny place, funny people!","It's a real mess. A meltin'pot of colours, smells, people, situations... You won't bother there, even if you don't know what to do! You can listen to a improvised concert on the beach, do some shopping among the stands selling jewls, t-shirts, beach wear... you can also pay a visit to one of the several beach phisician shops to breath in a puff of cannabis. Or you can just stare at the hypnotic waves coming to the huge beach and relax under the sun. It's up to you! There are plenty of things to do here!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CristinaFabSer
30,Nice beach...,"*I actually went December 2006 and July 2013, they make you put a date*I liked Venice Beach. I didn't go there for swimming or to tan, I was a tourist. There are so many nice shops along the beach walkway, and it's just very relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tk1323
20,Better ways to experience SoCal,"Venice beach has been a tourist destination for many reasons; all usually inspired by Hollywood. For example, I was just there over last weekend and noted one of the unusual ""characters"" who are known to always be around the Boardwalk at Venice was there and he has appeared in numerous movies, usually in the background. He is older but still the dressed the same.Many of the historic parts of that beach are now overly controlled (like Muscle Beach). No longer interesting or fun like it used to be.The homeless population is tragically growing and at night the character of the boardwalk changes yet again.If you choose to visit I suggest you bring a bunch of food and go there at night and feed the homeless people that need support. I fed 33 just the other month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikf605
50,Always Something Interesting to Look at!,"You will never have a dull moment walking along beautiful Venice Beach. There are so many eclectic people and things it is truly one of a kind. I especially love the drum circle that happens on Saturday's and Sunday's - personally I think it's a must see/experience. The only drawback is being there at night...it can be a little seedy - many homeless people - found them to mostly be harmless, but you never know. Overall a great place to see at least once in your life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0se_S121
40,Very Interesting Walk,This is definitely a unique place to visit. There's lots of places to buy souvenirs and the people-watching is amazing... like pretty unique. Perhaps not the best for little children just because there are so many marijuana signs and homeless people. Muscle beach is pretty funny because of all the guys trying to look cool while working out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmb222
40,Great place to walk and people-watch.,"It's been years (like 25 or more) since my last visit to Venice Beach. The beach itself is really nice, but the real fun is just wandering up and down the boardwalk, checking out the little shops, watching the street performers, and just generally taking in the Los Angeles beach culture. Whether you're watching the body builders or listening to the people still living in the sixties, it's all good fun.If you're up to a nice walk, take the mile and a half stroll along the beach walkway (or rent bikes) to the Santa Monica Pier. From there you can check out the Promenade, which in terms of shopping is the polar opposite of the Venice Beach shops, before heading back to Venice.One word of caution, if you're like me and are horrified by overpaying for parking, beware of some of the private parking lots a few blocks from the beach. The charge a lot and they up their prices as the crowds increase. The public lot along the beach is a fixed $15 but we took the first lot we saw which was $20 as we were driving up, but just before we got there they changed the sign and it was $25 when we got to it. When we picked up the car several hours later they were charging $35. Also you have to leave the keys and they keep moving the cars around because they fill every available inch of the lot. We had to wait about 20 minutes for them to dig our car out and it was in a much different spot then we parked it. Basically, go to a self-park lot where it's cheaper and safer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyblue

40,Unusually weird !!,"This is somewhere you must visit with an open mind!! People walking around doing their own thing - singing, dancing, trying to play musical instruments etc and not bothering anybody. I found it a fun place to visit where anything goes!! The shops are interesting and I got most of my souvenir's from here. It is somewhere you must go to at least say you have been on 'muscle' beach. Everything is 'cool' here and you can even sign up for medicinal cannabis with the 'green doctor'!! You come away thinking .... what is normal anyway??!! A good afternoon out not to be missed whilst visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeJ437
30,If you like crowds,"This is the place to see a lot of people. You might recognize it from the movies. People skating, running, tattoo parlors, cheap food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTorre
50,Always good for people watching,"This place is not for everyone, but if you want to see all kinds of people, have some cool street vendors and walk along the beach for a while ... then this is a good place to go. You aren't far from Santa Monica Pier, so that is a great walk or you can hire a bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregP352
40,"VENICE BEACH--MUSCLE BEACH, BEATNIKS, HIPPIES AND HIPSTERS--WHERE IT ALL BEGAN","Venice beach is one of those fabled spots where a number of very powerful American dreams were made sometime before the mid-20th century. Some might claim that the southern Californian culture of the body beautiful and the culture of car beautiful along with sun worship, surfer culture and beach bums were all born, along with others. The beach now--she is a dowager--in some ways down at the heels and dowdy--in other ways revitalized and brilliant. But always entrancing. The natural beauty of the sun, sand and surf are spectacular. The system of walkways, bikeways and sand dunes make the beach more attractive and accessible to families and singles, young and old, staid and wild. All in the shadow of ""medical"" marijuana ""clinics"" whose fumes are detectable, if only in your imagining. Muscle beach looks to be a silly parody of its former self--a rather small area enclosed by cyclone fencing, where a lone body builder or two come out to strut their stuff here and there in the sun. What I found most astounding was the Skate Park, where young people, those approaching middle age and kids who look as young as 5 or 6 years, go whizzing by at breathtaking speed, cutting capers that look to be death-defying. They all seem able to dismount in a split second and to roll away from potential crashes with aplomb, standing up like so many phoenixes arising from the burning ashes of smash ups that vanish into thin air. The danse macabre that you witness performed endlessly by the skateboarders is the best free ballet you will ever see anywhere in your life. As for the rest of it, there are some good deals to be had at some of the tee shirt shops, along with other peddlars of tourist junk (all made in China of course) and the appalling diet of junk food that seems to attend the glittery and mardi gras culture of the seaside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dh0414
30,Weirdos come out to play,"Venice Beach is interesting with all the hawkers on the promenade who are averse to having their photo taken. In the morning all sorts of people emerge from the buildings behind the beach. I guess it's warm so there is no better place to be. A great place to relax and watch the world go by, in all it's different forms. Watch out for the super diligent parking attendants. Picked up a $63 fine when I overstayed the meter by about 5 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forestaus
40,The Beach was clean and Muscle Beach area is neat to see!,The beach is clean and is not overcrowded. Probably the most fun was the shops to browse and take home souvenirs. I would definitely recommend! The parking area is not overcrowded as well and reasonable ($8-$10).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YearoftheRabbit
40,Soak up some local culture,"There is a beach at Venice Beach, actually a very nice one, but that's not what will impress the first time visitor. It is a vast collection of tackiness and funkiness, street performers, exhibitionists, gawkers, and weirdos. It's fun and amusing if you accept it for what it is. Definitely worth visiting if you've never seen before.On a practical note, parking is limited and a big hassle, so if you see a space, grab it, and be prepared to pay up accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasr439
40,Great people watching!,"Had a fun time just walking around people watching here. Food on the boardwalk wasn't my style, but really enjoyed the fun atmosphere. A must see if you are in LA for the first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Astinson
30,Touristy and kind of sad,"As far as beach fronts go, Venice beach is kind of sad. Lots of homeless and lost souls hanging out. Just not the most uplifting place in the world.

It feels more like a touristy, bad art, herb smoking, wanna be trendy mish mash of god knows what.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetSet1959

The beach itself is outstanding and the water is not too cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/551stevew551

We walked out on the Venice Pier for the first time this trip out. Great views of the beach and surrounding areas from the pier. They really need to increase bathroom facilities. There was a long line at the public one, and most restaurants won't let you use theirs if you're not a paying customer. Much of the shopping is t-shirts and trinkets, but everything is budget priced, so you can easily get great deals on t-shirts here. Some very good restaurants along the walk. We ate at the Terrace. Great food and has indoor or outdoor seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha

30,Lots of Hype About What?,"I have heard so much about this place and we eager to see for myself. I can't say it was impressive or even overly weird, like I had heard. There were panhandlers, people selling crap, lots of t-shirts with vulgar sayings, ""medical"" marihuana shops, and food. The most interesting thing I saw was the open-air gym with guys working out.

Lots of rubbish shops and stalls selling the same stuff. Each 100 yards is like a repeat of the previous 100 yards. Medical marijuana, henna stalls, souvenirs, hair braiding, tattoo parlours etc... Lots of homeless bums and crack addicts but all part of the experience. Was very busy and I wouldn't walk it late on a night. We saw some real sights, the people walking around are hilarious, some people have no shame. We had a good laugh. Parking was tough to find and not cheap, we found one $15 all day opposite the place off the film 'I love you man' that does the best fish tacos. We went for a walk round the canals in Venice, really nice and quiet with some nice houses right on the canals. A great place to live I imagine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcWins
10,"LADIES, BRING A GUY!","The quirky commotion of Venice makes it really attractive to tourists.....but honestly, I feel that the old Venice charm has dissipated into nothing.While it seemed not that bad of an idea in the first place, some of my closest girlfriend and I (5 ladies) wanted to explore the infamous attraction. After spending an hour looking for parking, we stepped out of the car, only to be hit on by a large group of men. OK, just one time that's fine! When we walked TWO BLOCKS to the boardwalk, it became evident that more and more men kept hitting on us (in a SINCERELY creepy way). When we finally got there, we were taken aback by the amount of groups of guys looking us up and down and following us. One time, we had to walk into a store it got so bad ( they started to grab us to face them when we tried walking on!)Mind you, we are not Kim Kardashian looking dolls, we were dressed modestly in dresses and showed minimal skin. I think the overwhelming part was that they would approach us in large groups, outnumbering us, and lowering our chances of getting out of there in one piece. We were a group of 5, so if you dare to go without a man, bring a rape whistle or whatever HA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561oliviak
50,It's not Tahiti,"Venice, like Ocean Beach where I'm from is an Urban Beach Community and tourists who don't live by the ocean or don't live in a big city by the ocean have a distorted view and think it's supposed to be the Jersey shore or Miami Beach! That's what makes it special, the people/ tourists who complain I can pick out easy, they wear denim jeans, fanny pack, Crocs', Teka sandals ( Jesus shoes) , white framed glasses, Walk-Mart trunks cuz they can't get board shorts in Kansas, camo- shirt, hat, socks........ and most are over weight who have no business wearing anything but a snuggie!!! The ones who complain the most are the ones who are intimidated by others who are in better health and shape.

20,Parking is a nightmare!,"I went there at about 4pm on a Saturday and it was heaving with people and cars. There was no on-street parking left, pop-up parking lots charged anywhere from $10 to $30 to park! I went for a quick walk down the beach and all I can say is that it is not worth the parking cost! Dont get me wrong, its colourful, lots of activities and street performers and shops full of cheap rubbish, but it was not my cup of tea. Wall to wall with people, not really a place that you would want to spend a lot of time in. Muscle Beach was interesting, there were the heavy weights pushing weights on the beach whilst right next door there was a bikini contest - how 80's and sexist is that! Would not go there again, but interesting to have been there to tick it off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukmorrows
30,Probably best people watching in America,"You will not be bored with the sights, sounds and ""street performers"" with a stroll through Venice Beach. Dirtier than I thought it would be but entertaining and pleasant people nonetheless. Stop by the skate park to see some talented youth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahElizabethSch
10,Scary,"Not the Venice Beach of bodybuilding fame of yesteryear. What a dump, full of bums and scary people. Cops were arresting scumbags as we walked by. Only spent 30 minutes there and got the heck out. Never felt safe the whole time. Seedy, period. Spend your time elsewhere. The people that find it charming must be on drugs like most of the inhabitants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457ThomasK457
40,Lots to see!,"We wanted to visit a beach during our stay in CA and decided on Venice Beach. It was an interesting experience. The strip is full of souvenir shops, cafés, and bars. There are tons of artists who have their work displayed along the sidewalk. As others have mentioned, there are several shops which are not recommended for children. However, there's lots to see for people of all ages! The street performances draw large crowds and are quite entertaining. We saw one street performance with a man sitting and standing on glass. He did make fun of several people who didn't offer a donation for his performance, but it was in a joking manner and not meant to offend anyone. The beach is nice and offers a great view of mountains in the distance. It was nice and relaxing to lay on the beach and catch a few rays. Definitely go at least once if you've never been before! PS- you can bargain with the street vendors and nearby parking lots!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinyAtlas
50,A Stimulating Visual Experience,"Venice Beach, WOW, what can I say? Actually a lot is to be said about Venice Beach, its really a visual overload. Once you take the 20 minute stroll down the boardwalk from the Santa Monica Pier there is no mistaking you are in Venice Beach. Full of the most colourful people, crafts and shops, restaurants and bars, the experience is like no other. It takes you back in time, hippy dippy, crunchy granola time, a little reminiscent of Woodstock or Folk Festivals. What we really enjoyed was shopping for unique gifts and crafts and talking to the artists who made them. So many stories to share so take your time as you visit each table or tent, listen to who they are and talk of their passions for life and love. Look for the unexpected, tons of entertainment from musicians to magicians, actors and actresses, we happened to walk right onto a photo shoot for Ralph Lauren where an artist was body painting naked models. They allowed us to watch them film and found it really cool. This is a must see, must experience no matter what your age. Be prepared, sun screen, hat and sunglasses and good walking shoes, Oh and a word of caution, don't try to take too many pictures, the artists are very protective of their work, taking pictures of the streets and shops and people were never a issue. Very safe, lots of law enforcement in the area, but we were cautioned to head out of the area before dark around 6:00, so plan your time and have the time of your life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrysP53
30,maybe for the younger set?,"I went to Venice beach as a matter of touring LA. I thought that Venice beach had a lot of bright artisans. There was a super nice skakeboard park. Some people were selling their wares - mostly tourist things like sunglasses, t-shirts, lotion, skateboards and the like. There was a lot of graffiti and it seemed like a party beach to me. For a little nicer beach I would try Santa Monica Beach and Pier, although Venice Beach was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawJ811LW
40,wind of pacific,"LA is a beach city we can say and Venice is one of the nice option among them. You can walk ahead to pier and enjoy the wind.

10,Even worse now,We went here as kids and it was weird but at least semi descent. ...now u can forget it. So dirty and trashy. Street performances nearly demand your money. Awful. Food is lousy.

But not tacky stuff, ok yes there are some tacky things but there is a lot of amazing organs art work, canvas paintings and things I had not seen anywhere else...

You can get a cheap bite to eat and anything else you desire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blacky008

Every block there is a little pop-up shop offering to do a medical marijuana exam for $40 - how is that even legal?? Memo to the old dude in the speedo - you don't look good body building anymore. Give it up, bro. If you're into smoking pot, getting drunk with coeds, and being in a college sprink break destination, this is your place.

50,Must see,Perfect place for people watching. Had the standard fun tourist shops all along. But I recommend the bike ride down the beach. My favourite part.

10,What a dump!,"So not impressed at all. Really off color characters (I was with young people watching an impromptu basketball match and had to get ask the person next to me to stop swearing and calling women ""C's"" and ""B's."") The marijuana smoking is bad enough but it's a bit depressing to see 70-year old body builders that refuse to acknowledge that dressing up in speedos and combat boots does not a macho man make. Besides the rather enjoyable skateboard rink, I find the place has an air of ""last exit to relevance"" about it. Will definitely not go there again. Ever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joymariek

40,muscle beach,"Honestly this place is long and if you take a bike you could ride all the way down to santa monica beach. However it can be very over crowded at times. You will get a mix of tourists to homeless people. There are food places to eat at and many stores to find bargains.This place I must say does have the first outdoor gym to which you can go and see its patrons posing or take a seat and watch a game of basketball with the locals.I came here with my children before I flew out.

40,"Weirder than a middle aged, single woman with 3 cats...","So there we we were, cruising on a sunday, gigantic Red Dodge Ram, wrong side of the road, stereo pumping, looking for trouble. We decided to go down to Venice Beach and have a poke around.Firstly, good luck parking. Especially on a nice day. Normally, because Americans hate walking, you can just drive 2 blocks up and find a plethora of spaces. However, Venice Beach was packed for about 10 blocks, but that's ok, it's quite a nice walk.So once you get to the beach it's visually spectacular. There's all sorts of weird things going on. Bodybuilders flexing at muscle beach, a homeless guy on rollerblades playing guitar, some kid trying to sell me a pink hat. It's great.We only had a couple of hours to poke around, but I'd recommended getting there in the morning and making a day out of it. It's just so eclectic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milvey
30,HAD to visit Venice Beach!!!,"Wanted to visit Venice Beach, especially to walk the beachfront shops and of course see muscle beach!Knew from reading online to expect it to be a bit dirty, maybe a little rough. It wasn't scary, it was just as predicted. Lots of shops and food choices for expected beach fare. We didn't shop and we didn't eat anything. It was in the evening and there were lots of tables being set up on the beachwalk with artists and other selling their items. Some REALLY nice sugar skull items to be checked out.A few shops were playing very loud music which was fine, but one was playing rap - definitely NOT the radio edit/clean version.Biggest put-off was noticing that nearly every 5-7th store was a medical marijuana dispensary with employees wearing scrubs and all apparently having a dr on location to get you sorted. We only walked about 1/2 down before turning around and heading back to the car park which was in a much nicer part of Venice with some nice beach front restaurants.No fee but we did have to pay for parking. There were lots of public restrooms but we didn't venture into them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBS398

10,A flea market in Tijuana would be nicer,"This is Venice Beach? What a dump. If you like cheap, funky t-shirts, carnival food and pot then this is for you. This isn't the place to bring kids unless you don't care about them. The beach itself and the bike path and skatepark is nice but that's all. There's homeless people everywhere smoking their pot and have mini villages set up on the grass.They don't really bother anyone but it just looks so bad. There's medical marijuana shops galore with the smell of pot everywhere.Cops just seem used to it and turn the other way.The food is cheap crappy carnival type stuff. The shops aren't even worthy of buying a overpriced postcard. There's also those annoying street performers who do silly stunts then demand money. The area is interesting for people watching, there's plenty of that. The only thing that looked like doing was going to the Freak Show.It's $5.00 to get in but we passed as we saw enough of that for free while walking around. We walked here from our hotel so I can't comment on parking. The best way to see Venice Beach is rent a bike and ride along the great bike path, and keep riding right past this area up to Santa Monica Pier where they care about the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aerowing
40,Fascinating place,"Great place to people watch or shop, not so much for relaxing. Crowded, especially weekends and holidays. Get there early to find good parking and expect to pay for it. Most businesses near the beach or on the boardwalk don't have public restrooms. Public restrooms on the beach may have a waiting line. You will probably see street entertainers and people watching is free, but Venice Beach is a place where cash changes hands. Most everyone there is either there to pay to be entertained or to make money....nothing is really free. Also, most places on the boardwalk are cash only. That's cash only, no public restrooms...get the picture? Still, a really interesting place to shop and eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahJ52

30,I wouldn't go out of my way to visit,"I was really disappointed in Venice Beach, the parking wasn't easy, most of the shops were selling tacky t shirts, it doesn't have an upmarket feel in fact it feels the complete opposite. Nothing really gets going until past midday. There wasn't anywhere really nice to eat , it all felt a bit rough and rundown . My 16 year old daughter seemed to like it so maybe it is for the youngsters who think they are a bit hippy. Overall I felt it was a wasted journey and a disappointment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeylaGR
10,Dreadful,"This was many years ago a fun place which over the years got very seedy and run down.

We loved it because it was quirky and fun and not your typical day at the beach (come to think of it I didn't even make it down to the water to dip my toe in). Just back a block or two from the beach is some excellent shopping in custom boutiques with everything from clothing to art and there are numerous interesting restaurants as well!

50,Interesting and Amazing.,"I am a Central California native and have visiting Venice Beach since I was a child. I have always loved the weirdness of Venice Beach and to those of you complaining about it, you need to stop, that's the charm of this place. If you want some haughty beach club vibe, go to Malibu. Venice is fun and offers many things to do for free. Over the years they have made a great effort to clean up this area. When I was a teenager the beach was full of transients who had made the big concrete stage and picnic area their home, that area no longer exists and all that remains are a few pylons and a wall. The police have a major presence and a station right on the beach so if you're worried for your safety, don't be, you'll be fine. There plenty of places to eat, have a beer, hang out and people-watch, and just be generally free while inhaling the wonderful smells of the ocean breeze. The beach itself is clean and inviting, and it's only about 30 minute walk down to Santa Monica which is a whole other vibe from Venice. We bring our kids here and they love all the crazy people walking around, the little booths along the boardwalk that sell everything from art, to sunglasses, and everything in between. The city built an amazing skatepark right in the middle of the beach area, there are drum circles, long boarders, dogs, musicians, artists, partiers, old people, young people, rich people, and poor people. Venice Beach really envelops that Cali vibe of mixed cultures, and it is definitely one of my favorite places in the L.A. to visit.If you're easily scared by what's not considered ""the norm"" then Venice is probably not the place for you, but you're down to see some interesting and different stuff, then definitely make Venice Beach a stop on your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packyourheart

A few of our favorite places for dinner are Hama Sushi on what was the grand canal, several places on street Abbot Kinney - Primitivo, Gjelina - are wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsMLB
10,"If you love crowds, weirdos, and horrific parking, go to Venice!","When I have visitors in town, I'll take them to Venice or Santa Monica if they want to go, but I'm SO relieved when it's over, every time. The ocean is nice and all, but the boardwalk is constantly busy, and as much as I hate Santa Monica, at least they have parking structures. Venice has jammed street parking and lots that I don't know how the hell you'd ever get out of. I took my visitors there the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and granted, I'm sure that makes it more packed, but we ended up at the Venice Ale House. While we got one of the better outdoor tables, everything here is CROWDED, PACKED, and OVERPRICED. My brother couldn't get to the restaurant's bathroom because the place was so crowded, he literally could not physically get there, so he used the bathrooms on the beach. As did my husband. Both came back asking me for baby wipes because the beach bathrooms were so disgusting.

Street parking is a nightmare at best so park in the downtown Santa Monica parking lot at the mall at the beach and take a shuttle that will drop you of a short walk to the main area,its well worth the few dollars for parking fees and the shuttle fair.Near the parking are their is a long street blocked off for walking only with some nice shops and restaurants so you can make a nice day of it for only a few dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anodynemed

The beach walk path is nice enough too with skaters, cyclists and dog walkers joining you. Then you arrive atMuscle Beach and the tourist trap area. Whilst it doesn't feel unsafe, it is just unpleasant, with CDs being constantly pressed into your hands, hawkers everywhere and homeless asleep on the pavement and sides everywhere you turn. ( I do realise that they have to be somewhere). The shops seem to contain only offensive t shirts or marijuana and contain nothing of interest to your average tourist over the age of, say, 25. I guess I'm just describing the character of the area and the way it's always been, and maybe I'm just too old to find it of interest. In my view, if you're over 25, you'll find nothing here.

40,"proceed with caution, but def proceed!!!","To begin, I have only been once, got there just before the sun went down . It was a lot of fun however even with a strong police presence just about everywhere you look, there's a whole lot of ""shady"" characters, enough that you don't want to let your guard down, stay aware of your surroundings. Now, with that out of the way, it IS fun, there are street performers who are engaging and funny. The shops have fun eccentricities, and your typical boardwalk food, funnel cakes, ect. Maybe part of the fun was the edginess, the apparent regulars can pick you out as a newbie it seems (and I like to think I'm pretty confident & under the radar), there were several comments from workers that were a little suggestive/inappropriate. (was with my daughter & her man, a former Marine, so felt safe, wouldn't have if he hadn't been along). The weed doctors were pretty interesting from an East coast perspective, to see someone in lime green scrubs with a huge picture of MJ and the words ""weed doctor"" perusing the boardwalk, and indeed having a shop on the boardwalk with many weed doctors on hand (NO pictures, they will be on you QUICK if you try, I didn't see the sign that said no pictures...... oops) . So, what makes it great and fun if its ""shady""? The guy juggling construction cones, the guy on roller skates with crazy dreads carrying his loud boombox blaring heavy metal with a smile like no other,the group of street performers that dragged my daughter into their routine, the flasher dancing crazily through the intersection, awesome nightlife at the clubs, lots of rooftop bars, passing by crazily stoned people oblivious to your presence. It was just crazy, sometimes we need that,I did.In summation, if you go at night, go with someone who has got your back and be aware of your surroundings, I can only imagine that the daytime would be more tame, but just as awesome. I'll go during the day the next time I'm in California.

20,What happened to such a Beautiful area.....,"Been some time since I have been to Venice Beach and the Pier. What a travesty! No pride anymore, and the Pier itself was filthy. Fishing bait and guts from weeks and months ago....grab a water truck and hose the thing down. Homeless people and trash everywhere...and the walk back along Washington Blvd. was like something out of 'Mad Max'.....what a lack of respect for our environmental treasures....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danny5k
30,A bit off.,"This place has some restaurants and bars for adults and the skatepark is great for kids to watch. Spent our time there admiring some homes along the boardwalk. Beware... At dark it gets too WEIRD. It's already a but ""different"" but the tourist balance it out during the day. If you have kids I'd suggest checking out the grove instead of this place. And go to Santa Monica pier if you want a beach day experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/853cristinas
30,Expected nicer environment,"That is the famous Venice Beach? The surrounding looks not so representative. The beach itself is nothing special, just sand beach. There are just a few restaurants and that's it... It is better not too lose time there and go and visit some beaches south of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valdothebird
20,Sad to see so many freaks,"We used to enjoy the sights of Venice Beach but either it has gotten worse or we have gotten too old. It was really sad to see so many young people completely stoned, tattooed and appearing really wasted. I would never take a child there, not a good example of humanity. After walking from one end to the other, I was really depressed and don't care to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyandretired318
20,"Okay beach, rear is nasty, tacky and unsafe","We had just spent a pleasant couple of hours at Hermosa Beach, which is pleasant, quirky and untouristy. We were told by friends to visit Venice Beach, which was just a short trip away.We first popped into Starbucks, where there were three down and outs outside- really not a nice vibe! And the shops and cafés leading too the beach are quite run down too. The beach is okay, but a bit dirty. Saw three dead seabirds amongst the trash as we walked along the shore! The shops and stalls alongside the beach are very tacky and we were approached by a few down and outs and druggies. Smell of weed everywhere. Coming from London, we are all pretty streetwise, but felt unsafe and couldn't wait to get out of this place. It's like a really downmarket Camden Market, not nice at all. Don't bother to visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shortlineski

50,Marina del rey is a great place for kids,"There are so many things to do and I see we didn't know where to begin. Our first day we went parasailing and the kids had a blast! We found a place in the Marina del rey harbor and made reservations. its was easy, safe and they loved it! Second day we went boogie boarding on the beach. Kids made sand castles and mom relaxed with a book in the sun. We walked to Coldstone Ice cream on Washington Blvd (corner of Pacific Aver) afterwards and cooled off. Third day we went to the new Tongva Park in Santa Monica and I let them play in the playground while we admired the botanical gardens. Then we went to the amusement park on the santa Monica Pier just across the street and kids rode the roller coaster and played games. Then we ate at Bubba Gumps Shrimp and took a walk on the beach at sunset. I bought the kids some kites and they enjoyed playing with them when the wind picked up. We always prefer to stay in Marina del rey over Venice because its cleaner and safer but still close to the fun stuff we love to do in Santa Monica and venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethE696
50,Like no other place on Earth!,"Venice Beach is a must-do. You'll see street performers, artists and just about every other thing you can imagine. Its a very friendly place where everyone is nice. That said, this is a place that is cool to visit however I would not look to lodge in VB. The streets can get kind of shady at night, defiantly a daytime only place. Also the beach itself is not all that spectacular. Sometimes they have sewage problems that cause them to close the beaches... if your looking to swim in the pacific I'd do some research and look elsewhere. Come to VB to people watch, its worth it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmK9447PM
40,Interesting & Fun,"I enjoyed visiting Venice Beach, as a Brit the nearest i can relate it to is a kind of Camden Town on Sea. Interesting street performers, beggars, stalls and general people. It wasn't as weird as people had made out and i found it quite tame being from London. I'd recommend going with an empty mind and if you're weirded out by the homeless people maybe try and remember they're just people!The ad-hoc drumming on the beach (Sunday afternoon) was really cool, people just turn up with their instruments and play together, no real structure but it flows despite there being like 20 drummers and various percussion!To come here with the mind set of seeing a freak show is bad, instead come here to see the rich tapestry of life in all its colours and flavours, you'll enjoy it more ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevens
40,Good and bad,Visited mid morning one day with my family and hired some bikes. We rode along the bike track which winds along the beach itself. It was a great time to see the beach before the crowds and see how wide the beach is.The only down to this was that you got to see first hand the homeless and how many there really are. It was sad to see so many people sleeping along the grass areas and you can't help but feel bad for them.As a tourist it is a great place to visit and you must either walk or ride along the beach. We rode almost up to Santa Monica before turning around.It's another part of LA that you must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattmboom
40,More than just a Beach,"""Pigeons killed my family. Need money for BB Gun."" -Sign of Boardwalk BeggarWhat a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Arrived here around 2pm this past Saturday of St. Patrick's Day weekend. The place was swarming with cars trying to find parking as far as 4 blocks away from the beach. We were lucky enough to blindly make our way to the beachfront parking, pay $9 and find a person leaving a spot steps from the sand. I would start by recommending the $9 lot near the beach but there is no guarantee parking is available. There are various lots throughout the area with prices ranging from $12 to $25. The time you arrive will obviously dictate the probability you will be able to snag a spot.The reason I enjoyed my time here was because there is quite a bit to see. There were basketball courts with a full court game going back and forth. We got to check out the skate park that had skaters of all ages doing all kinds of tricks and grinds. An outdoor weight lifting area with huge guys flexing and showing off for tourists. They even had the set for American Ninja warrior out for filming later that evening. There were people break-dancing and thunderous religious debates being had. All while people stood outside of medical marijuana shops with signs saying ""The Doctor is in!"". There were tons of places to grab a bite to eat like Schulzies Bread Pudding (from the t.v. show Shark Tank) and Poke Poke (fresh fish) to higher priced sit down restaurants. There are also plenty of places to get your cheap souvenirs if that's your thing. The beach itself is okay as well. General appearance of the sand was clean and the cold water had its fair share of surfers in wet suits and sail boats floating around. When you combine all these things with an active beach community filled with volleyball, Frisbee, cruiser bikes, and rollerblading (rollerblades are available for rent for approx $5 an hour) you are bound to have a beach day packed with things to do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelOT-Mike
40,Its Venice Beach!!!!,What would you expect. A lot to take in. It is a fun place to walk around and enjoy a sunny day at the beach. Rent a bike and take a ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taters54
50,Be prepared for a surprise,"We came out of our apartment [50 metres from the water front at Venice Beach and new comers to the area] at about 7 pm on a Saturday evening. We were totally dumbfounded as we turned onto the boardwalk and came face-to face with 'millions' of people: this was totally unexpected. What an experience! During the four days, we loved every minute; from people watching to cycling along the canals [link with Venice in Europe]. Hiring a cycle is a must as is walking to Santa Monica. We watched a very interesting tennis game along the boardwalk which is played with short rackets: a local tennis coach answered our questions with great patience. The 'green doctors' added an extra interest to our curiosity. Definitely, a place to go back and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynfaGloucesterUk
50,Worth the trip from Hollywood,"Great place to spend a sunny day.We hired some roller blades for $5 and spent the whole day looking at markets and taking in all the unique and wonderful sights and people. The beach is nice and wide and easy to get a good photo at.If you have a car and are staying in down town LA or Hollywood, I would highly recommend making the effort to drive down for a day. Definitely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmO6405MS

Worth checking out for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neleroux
30,Recommended but disappointed,"When my friends heard was headed to Los Angeles, I heard nothing but recommendations to go to Venice beach. My friends and I stayed in Santa Monica but drifted down to Venice on bike for the afternoon. Honestly, it was OK, but a little dirty. People watching very interesting here. Overall, I would stick to the Santa Monica beach because of the ambiance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allsmile07
20,Did not enjoy.. Weird place,"Thought this would be a good beach location to relax and enjoy some sunshine and peace… Instead it was crowded with weird people with a variety of different stalls and shops selling weird things! Did not feel very safe to be honest, and was designated in a run down area.. Would recommend finding another beach to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurdeepc2014
30,Not for everyone..,"If you are not into the freaks and weed or a beach person this is not for you. Finding a parking on Sunday is hard, people are every where. we did stop to watch people playing a tennis match but after a couple of hours I was bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/widelyneb
40,It's a chill place to go. safe in the day,"There are so many beaches in LA, we had to pick only one. We chose this one, because we were curious about the ""people watching"" .Boy we weren't disappointed. We actually found the boardwalk much more interesting than the actual beach.It's true there are a homeless people having a nap on the side, but they actually were the least bothersome. They won't beg you for anything. There weren't that many tourists when we went and not once did we feel unsafe. It was in the late morning. Evenings might be different, I can't say.Most ""people"" are just fun to look at. Some don't like pictures, so be discreet, but definitely try to get a shot. Lots of shops, often selling the same stuff (lol). Check out the big Transformers statue in metal!There were more entertainment in the mid day to afternoon, with hip hop groups dancing, musicians playing. Actually fun!The only bothersome people I noticed were trying to get donations for a variety of causes. Nothing wrong with that, but some were too insistant. And some young artist would give you a CD, sign their name, and then ask you for a donation, so just be aware. Again, they're promoting their music in all fairness, but I'm not keen on this approach.As for the beach....well.......it's a long and wide stretch that was a little too cold for us to swim into. And we had a windy day, so we couldn't even stay and lie down. No worries.There are public bathrooms, but they're not the cleanest.A little hint for parking: If you go early enough, even mid-morning, you might still find parking in the streets, a few blocks away from the beach. If not, paid parking isn't bad: 5-7$ for the day.Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy_stomach

It's laid back, there are all kinds of people around, everyone seems to be on a skateboard or rollerblades....There's a lot of cafes where you can sit outside with a drink and people-watch.One of my favourite parts was watching all the skateboarders practise and have fun in the skate park - it was quite scary to watch sometimes!! They were so cool, lots of tricks and showing-off! Really, really cool to watch.I would suggest putting on comfy shoes and just spending a day walking around the area and people-watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieSparkles101
50,So unusual and fun to see,"recently enjoyed Venice/Santa Monica for a 5 day stay and really enjoyed the sights and sounds of the boardwalk.If you want to see every walk of life this is the place to be, yes there are homeless people and lots of unsavoury characters but also a tremendous amount of California history and very friendly people!I have read many say they felt unsafe which I think is absolutely ridiculous! Maybe if you have never seen or took time to understand that some don't have it as well as you and your family it would be unsettling. At no point did we feel unsafe or uncomfortable, yes it can be gritty but if you treat people with kindness you generally our treated the same way back. We spoke with many people on the boardwalk of all walks of life and felt better for it.On top of that the beach and views were spectactular!!Something in my opinion that everyone should see once, as I know that once is good enough for some but for us we look forward to heading back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redwoodsbay
40,Best People Watching Place in the World!,"I've been to Venice Beach countless times and every time I go to Los Angeles I have to visit each and every time. Venice Beach is hands down the best people watching place in the world. I wouldn't go there necessarily for the food or shopping, but the variety of people all looking at one another would be the price of admission.The sidewalk entertainers are special and unique, but watching the people watching the entertainers is what gets my attention. I know that there is a beach there but I couldn't tell you anything about it because I'm too busy watching what is going on on the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJL117
30,Venice Beach is different,"Venice Beach is different. If you have been to Santa Monica Beach or Manhattan Beach or Redondo Beach, you can tell the difference immediately. There is even an aire of difference as you walk through the area. Obviously the sand is the same, and the water is the same...Venice Beach is a little dirtier than Santa Monica Beach and definitely more homeless people on the walkway.However, Venice Beach also has more shops too look at if you are in to that kind of thing. You will also find tons more tattoo and piercing shops. I can't say much about their quality but apparently a lot of people come here.Overall, I would rather hangout out at Santa Monica Beach if I was on the beach but if you are looking for a different experience, then Venice is definitely different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast

There wasn't any crowds at all so we pretty much had the beach to ourselves. It was a little cold when we went, but the sun came out long enough for us to have a dip in the Pacific Ocean. The boardwalk was really interesting. It was cool to see Muscle beach and all the vendors for yourself, but there was a lot of homeless people everywhere.

There are lots of canals in the residential area & if you're a fan of NCIS Los Angeles, this is the area you've seen many times. It's also been in lots of other movies & TV shows.

As many beaches around Los Angeles you can enjoy a lazy day on the sands, rent a bike, or walk in the long stretch of bike/walk way that extend both way from the main entrance at Washington Blvd. I pay $6 to park, and that was the easiest way to park and visit on a weekday visit.

Among all KINDS of other stuff.My advice to you:STAY FOR THE SUNSET and walk along the beach where it hits the ocean.Be confident. Nicely say ""no"" to the people peddling stuff to you (they hear it all day long). Drink lots of water, since the walk can get long and you don't even realize, and use lots of sunscreen.It's touristy, so that's why there's so many people trying to sell you something. I personally love the little brick & mortar stores that are just off the walkway, they're eclectic and clean.

Be careful biking on the bike path here because pedestrians cross without watching for cyclists. The kiosks are interesting, but merchandise is over-priced. If you like booth shopping, try any of the wonderful farmers' markets all over the city or the Rose Bowl Swap Meet on the second Sunday of each month. This is not a family friendly venue; if you bring your children, be aware that it can be kind of scary for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy

We loved walking the beach, the sun, the waves.The activity on the beach could be fun. There were tennis matches, skateboard competitions and beach volleyball. Lots going on.We hated the riff-raff. There were tattoo stands, sleazy t-shirt shops, tattoo and legalize marijuana shops everywhere. And every block was a repeat of the last. There were also a huge number of homeless shelters set up on the beach to the point that it almost made it hard to get around. Not sure I would or should associate that with the other riff-raff but it definitely does not add to the allure of the beach.Weather in mid-april was decent. Water was really too cold for comfortable swimming and it was borderline sweatshirt vs t-shirt weather. Sun was very warm but only after the fog lifted.Parking ranged from $9 to $20 so be careful not to get taken by some of the locals trying to make a buck.It is a halfway decent time killer close to the airport and a good way to get some exercise before a flight, but as far as time spent in LA I would not recommend this as a top attraction or a top beach, especially for families.

I also really enjoyed the sushi at Poke Poke. I got to see some of the characters from Freak Show on AMC which was cool. However the beach was littered and I saw seagulls eating trash. Where ever there was a crowd the police were there which made me think things could easily get out of hand. The homeless guys and pot heads were just sad. Me and my friends got cussed at for unknowingly being on the bike path (we didn't see any signs or symbols that it was a bike path or bikes for that matter when we first started walking on it).

There is muscle beach where people work out, local basketball competition, roller bladers, food stalls and in general a group of interesting characters to watch. It's well worth a visit for a fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargitM288
40,Never a Dull Moment,We've stopped at Venice Beach to spend a day on each of our trips to Southern California. It's cheap entertainment and there's never a dull moment while people watching here. It's a little gritty though - not really the type of place I would bring small children to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunsetCatcherz
40,People watching afternoon,"Hilarious afternoon sitting outside a bar on Venice beach, the entertainment from the locals was simply priceless! Fitness freaks and crazies, muscle men and hobos, musicians and tourists. A great melting pot. And coming from Brighton in England that says something!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/986JoG
10,April 1 2014. A car bombing?!!!Very creepy but nothing on the news.,"Was anyone else in Venice on Tuesday April 1? I am a teacher in northern California and My daughter and I were Rollerskating in the ocean path. There were ambulances, fire trucks, police, news crews and we passed by what looked like a blown up car with other cars damaged around it....very scary. It looked like a crime scene and officers were taking measurements. Yet, nothing in the news ...????!!!! What was this???!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11thchild
40,What a place,It's exactly what you expect it to be. If you've ever seen any pics of Venice beach it's exactly that. A place to see that's for sure. So many characters walking around. Thoroughly entertaining. Also made it into the water for a swim (even though some people tried to scare us saying sharks were gonna get us). HahaAbsolutely worth the stop. If you're driving try and go closer to Santa Monica pier (about midway down the boardwalk). I noticed that parking was a little bit cheaper over there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/743laurenr
40,Great wide beach and people-watching,"This is a very crowded area on a weekend afternoon. If you stay on the walkway you are surrounded by multitudes walking both directions. There are dozens of funky beach kiosks selling all the usual hokey beach food and souvenirs, as well as many street performers of varying talents. As you walk out toward the beach you see many people who look like they live at the beach. There are sleeping bags and small encampments that look much more permanent than an afternoon at the beach. A sad reminder of how many people are homeless and down and out in our midst.There are many public restrooms along the beach, mostly kept in good condition, with outdoor showers and faucets to wash off the sand.The beach is very wide and can accommodate a lot of people without seeming crowded. More people-watching opportunities. There are dedicated bike paths and we saw many rental places that offered prices as low as $6 an hour to rent a bike.A little something for everyone. If you want a more ""refined"" dining experience, main street is just a few blocks inland with many bars and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkrissel
50,Great excursion from LA,"I went to Venice Beach during a weekend in Los Angeles. I was expecting it to be kind of crazy with lots of music and weed shops, and that's what it was. It was so lively with lots of cool little shops, performers, people playing basketball and places doing henna tattoos. The beach is beautiful and lovely to walk down, I personally thought it was too cold to sunbathe or swim in March but other people were doing that. If you come to this area, I would suggest checking out Abbot Kinney blvd which is a short walk from the beach. There are a lot of very nice (if a little expensive) clothing and design shops there as well as nice cafes and restaurants, it's a very different atmosphere to the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannat2013
40,Venice beach getaway,"For someone who lives where there is no beach near the area, this is something you would be excited about. But I have been to many beaches...white sands most specifically, with warm water, so I am not too thrilled to see the place. I love the stores near the area...we walked endlessly looking for souvenirs to bring to friends back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samh210
30,Reviewing Muscle Beach area only (that's all we saw),"One intention only by visiting here: to see Muscle Beach (even though, yes, we knew the ""original"" location of Muscle Beach was actually in Santa Monica). Completely frustrating drive through traffic from LA to get to Venice Beach, completely frustrating time to find parking, but find it we did (on Pacific, in between North Venice Boulevard and South Venice Boulevard) - can't remember what we paid for parking, but I'm convinced it was probably too much for the amount of time we spent. However, hubby wanted to see, and he'd gone with me to Rodeo Drive earlier in the day, so who am I to argue? Teenagers spent some time watching the players on the basketball court, we took a look at the beach, took some snapshots of Muscle Beach, stopped in at the first Gold's Gym (ok, previously mentioned hubby is interested in this whole body building thing). We were out less than an hour after we arrived, though Hubby was happy he saw what he came to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamc40
20,not what i expected,I guess if you want to walk a board walk of weed shops with a bunch of people smoking joints on the side of buildings while you have a bunch of nut cases bible banging and such then venice beach is the place to be! the beach is pretty crappy filled with stones as well as there is a grafitti wall were people legally can tag it up (which is pretty cool) and they have a skate park which has some pretty talented people skating. Overall my experience I guess you could say is like much of how people make california. It is over glorified and not as amazing as people made it out to be. If you are looking for a great beach with a nice clean boardwalk this is not the place to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196keving
30,Had to see it...once,"I know that if we hadn't made the effort to see Venice Beach while in the area I would have been disappointed. That being said, I don't plan to return. Only day we could go was Saturday so yes, it should have been expected to be crazy busy. It was both crazy & busy. Drove around endlessly to find a place to park. In desperation we parked at a place with ""valet"" (not sure if that's the right word) for $35; seriously?! Walked from parking to the beach. Every imaginable sight & sound. Body builders of course. Musicians, vendors of every type, interesting people. Just way too many people. Waited for long lines at food, rest rooms. The beach itself was pretty clean. An experience yes but not one I want to repeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBS323
50,COULDN'T KEEP AWAY,"Recently spent six nights in Marina Del Rey,a stones throw from Venice Beach.What a place,so weird and full of very very strange people doing very weird things.It was mesmerising and so interesting that we spent three mornings just walking up and down marvelling at all the sights and sounds.A real must for all LA visitors,and the best part,its completely free and very safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike503734
50,"Weird and fun place, amazing part of LA","I spent 8 days in LA, and I have to say that this was the best! I loved the weird quirkyness of this place with all different things to see and hear. I loved that it was a world away from Beverly Hills and Hollywood - like London's Camden - a world of its own! A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sacha0910
50,Really fun and interesting,"The area with the ocean view and fresh air was great. Lots and lots of interesting people, from the weightlifters to the eccentric characters. Fun shopping and friendly shopkeepers. Nothing bad to report, just fun and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U55SQandream
40,Nice Beach and Fun Shopping,"Our visit to Venice Beach in Los Angeles was very enjoyable. We visited in March so the water was cold. Most surfers were wearing wet-suits to enjoy the water. Daytime temps were in the 70-s. The beach has a nice long walkway with lanes for joggers and bicyclists. People watching was a lot of fun. The walkway is lined with various types of shops where you can rent bicycles, long boards and shop for souvenirs and gifts. There are many sidewalk vendors who are peddling their artistic wares. Most of the restaurants were very casual, dine in your bathing suit type places. We found an upscale seafood restaurant, Lobsters, at the entrance to Santa Monica Pier. It would have been cheaper and more fun to eat at Bubba Gumps, right on the Pier. This is a great place to spend the entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocman
30,Unique Venice Beach,"The largest part of Venice Beach was its colourful boardwalk. A unique place with great scenery and the atmosphere was funky. It was foggy whilst I was there. There are street performers, artists and hundreds of streets vendors that makes this place so bizarre. If you have a little time to spare, then this is one place to drop by cos everything is so weird esp. watching the muscled men in their action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesschua61
40,Pretty beach,"We enjoyed visiting the beach, although it was too cold to swim. We parked a few blocks away on the street for free. We had a long walk from where we parked to the Boardwalk, which was OK. Lots of things to see and buy (and people approaching you to sell you things or ask for money).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmyMPLS
40,Venice beach,"We went off season and found the beach to be very relaxing. A stroll along the promenade was pleasant with lovely weather conditions for late February with hardly any crowds. there were plenty of shops and restaurant/ cafes and lots of different shops with things to do.Muscle beach was very different from how it is portrayed but still quite interesting place to see. We also found lots of cycle hire shops hiring at very reasonable prices but they don't cater for babies in terms safety seats etc. so we were unable to take advantage. Prices maybe different during peak times so not sure if it is always value for money. We also find the prices of cycle hire to be more expensive than those in the streets surrounding the beach.The beach is quite long and it can take a long while to walk along it at leisurely pace. Parking was relatively cheap where we parked at $2 an hour but i understand that it can be quite expensive in designated parking lots.Overall, i found the experience a pleasant way to while away an afternoon if you want a relaxing day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdul7829
30,"Nice beach, but no surprise",We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. The beach is average. I was very excited to see the gym and the muscled man training outside. It was early in the morning and quiet so I was a bit disappointed. We shopped the small stores to buy souvenirs and we continued walking back to Santa Monica. There are a lot of homeless people in this area and my sister and I were not feeling safe. I would possibly return but during a weekend afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cecile633
20,What a waste of time,"This is very over crowded beach.There is free parking available on the street but because of the crowds, it is difficult to find a spot. There are parking lots available as well, where you can park for $10 or soYou may wish to skip it and save some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smhr
50,Very entertaining!,"Must see if you haven't been. Lots to see here-muscle beach, shops, bars and eateries. Street show by the LA Breakers was very entertaining!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JYD48324
30,nice beach,"We've been to beaches around the world. Comparatively speaking, this would be in the average range. It was clean, especially compared to Redondo, and large. Not crowded, but not especially beautiful. Would return if in the area, but won't seek it out as a stand alone reason to visit the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelh906
50,Wow! Spectacular Venice Beach!,"This was our first stop when we arrived in California and wow!!! What gorgeous scenery! We were here early afternoon on a weekday and it was very quiet and we found some free street parking fairly easily. Beautiful beach, and our first steps in the warm Pacific Ocean. Very memorable! We enjoyed walking the beach and taking in the sights. The walk back on the boardwalk was a bit of a different experience- touristy shops, some interesting characters, Muscle Beach...maybe not quite our cup of tea;) But the beach we highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaChHa
40,fun,"I love the boardwalk and the beach. It's definitely a different environment but everything is so weird, it's impossible not to love. The beach is beautiful, the stores are fun, there are like 10 medical marijuana shops trying to entice you to be clients, lol, and their are a ton of street vendors with very interesting tricks, and things to sell. I hear it's a little sketchy at night, but during the day it's a blast, nothing to be afraid of! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kath1031
40,Fun to See,"If you go on the walk along the beach many different types pass you either by foot, bike,skateboard, or on inline skates. Great place to get tee shirts, and assorted stuff. Fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
50,Highly recommended..,Very enjoyable. The beach is lovely and the warm Pacific is very inviting for a paddle or swim.We hired cycles in Santa Monica and the ride along the Beach broadwalk to Venice Beach is lively and entertaining . A stop off at the Skate Park and Muscle Beach is a must to watch people working out . A enjoyable walk along to the end of Venice Pier and a sit down to take in the stunning view is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pop900
50,Tacky but irresistible!,"Venice Beach has to be the tackiest! But my word, what a fabulous place to people watch! The entertainment along the Beach is varied and very interesting, and often very weird, and covers most genres! From the skate boarders in the skate park, through the magnificent LA Breakers dancing to the guys playing blues, from the rough sleepers to the crazies, all life is here. Loads of retail opportunities, loads of eating opportunities, it's fabulous. You must go there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moiraf624
50,Fun & eclectic,"Just love this part of the world. So much to see and take in. Highly recommend the walk from Santa Monica pier down through Venice Beach. Great shops and cafés. Daytime a great spot for families with plenty of okay areas. Stop and shop with local artists, lots of unique buys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarMar71
20,Home of the posh homeless,"Unfortunately neither the view of the Pacific ocean nor the amazing waves can counteract the disturbing images of blankets, pillows, shopping bags full of clothes under the trees and scruffy homeless people loitering around the beach. Visited twice and the picture has always been the same. Tried to blame it on the weather and the time of the year but had to realise, this is how it is. One of the many things which I did not like in LA; it is sad to see the hypocrisy when you are just 10 minutes drive away from some of the most expensive properties in the US (if not in the world).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankieinLondon
20,poor hangout,We visited the place twice and found it so disapointing. Possibly the aussie beaches we live near being clean with white sand spoiled it BUT the sad sight of the homeless people tucked in to any available shelter particularly when LA just has had unprecedented rain was the clincher. They are not what I expected to see in such a supposedly iconic place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scozziegirl
50,A must visit!,"Very neat unique place. Highly recommend visiting at some point if your in the area. Walk along the beach, lots of shops where you can purchase souvenirs and neat items. There is even a gym along the walk. Something to see for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChelseaJ791
20,crazy walkway/boardwalk but nice beach,"lots of action on the boardwalk. skaters, runners, bikers.......watch out for the guys trying to make money on their music and trying to sell it. they start by having you listen to their music. then ask for money if you like it. how can you say you dont! police seem to let this go on year after year. homeless all over too. hold onto your purse and wallet.plenty of tshirt shops and restaurants in the area. usually park about a block away for like $5. the bathrooms in the area aren't the nicest. use one at a restaurant where you eat.dont forget to see muscle beach and the skate park. bring your camera!! you never know who or what you might see here. the beach area away from the boardwalk is real nice.hope you like the pictures with this post",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonystewart14
30,Ummm.... Do u smell that? Yea....,So last week after dinner we walked the beach and tons of pot smoking people everywhere you looked. Not that I'm looking down on it. Just kinda culture shock coming from Chicago. And if not used to the smell every so often don't go after dark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89timw

30,Must at least Once,"My first time to Venice beach, stayed 4N a few streets away. This is a place that you should visit once in your life before it goes away, all sorts of strange characters walking around, however, I was turned off by the large numbers of homeless, the boardwalk is a funky a mix of T-shorts stores, tattoo parlors and run down mom and pop shops. Muscle Beach was a disappointment but the beach is very nice. Overall the place seems very run down walk a half mile either direction and it totally changes. Glad I went before it all changes, not a bucket list location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cruisinbob
50,Beautiful Beach with a Fun Atmosphere!,Venice Beach was on my list of things to see and I'm so glad we did when my husband and I visited in April 2010! The beach and boardwalk were so busy and there was so much going on but it was very exciting! We loved all the shops and even got tattooed while there (just outside the beach area).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsrelly
50,Action,"With so many activities in Venice Beach, it is almost impossible not to get excited with something. There is a great number of options or you could just admire the ones that are taking part! If you're near it, don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rigasspy
40,An eye-opener,"Along the Ocean Front Walk, the variety and frivolity gets thick and interesting. The Ocean Walk is lined with market stalls and some quite talented buskers. You will see all-sorts here, from the weird to the controversial. The Venice Beach doctors’ surgery is filled with Santa Monica’s young ones waiting for their medically-prescribed marijuana. This is legal in the State of California, and these shopfront dispensaries are not trying to blend in. You can also pay a visit to the Venice Beach Freakshow if you’re not the queasy type.Read on at : http://www.twoprettybirds.com/2013/10/13/so-cal/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzeC276
30,A little tired,"The beach itself is really nice but in the evening there seemed to be a lot of homeless people hanging about which gave an uneasy feel to the area. There is a pungent smell pervading a lot of establishments that claim to be medical testing clinics !! Don't inhale too deeply!! Getting very run down and tired could do with re-inventing itself, not as arty as it pits itself out as.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaRB
20,"Disappointing, overcrowded human zoo","I might have overly romaticized notions of what the place would be but this felt like a semi-voyeuristic open air circus rather than the last bastion of counterculture I was expecting.I was interested in the so called ""graffiti park"" which was a massive let down. Five Pointz it is not! You will see better variety and quality art by wandering around Loz Feliz and keeping your eyes peeled.As to the rest, it basically felt like Camden Town on the beach: trying to cater to every appetite for the ""different"" and therefore somewhat sordid.Walking along the beach from Venice to Santa Monica is a better alternative and will give you a more interesting and authentic sense of the beach lifestyle",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Chuck_2011
40,Not your usual beach,"If you're looking to see something different, ie not your typical refined vacation beach- then this is the place to go. It gives a bit of a hippie feel but overall, you'll find people of all 'culture' busy doing their own thing: surfers at the beach, roller-skaters, skateboarders, basketball and tennis courts actively occupied, and guys practising gymnastics on an outdoor gym. There are plenty of tiny shops and kiosks selling cheap and likely imported goods. There are a few punks and gangsters here and there and some homeless people every now and then too.This place is full of life and activity. You could spend hours there just watching your surroundings. Feels like a scene out of a movie... Don't let the negative reviews sway you. It's only a negative experience if you're expecting a picture perfect beach with only upper class tourists on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mytravelid
50,Beach + art + sport…what else do you want?,"Great beach where relax watching the sunset! the area it's full of life, it's a big flow of people among shops, fast food restaurants, artists and sports complexes. I like the combination of all these factors. I suggest this beach to the young, probably families look for something more quiet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew_G66
10,Don't let fool you,"False advertising!! These people advertise all over Venice boardwalk $40 medical evaluations, what they are trained NOT to tell you is that your license is also $40. Total of $80 and valid for only 3 months!! Such a ripoff and a total bait and switch, they dont give you actual prices until after you have your ""evaluation"" and after that even if you change your mind because they are WAY too expensive, they still except you to pay the $40. People come to Venice from all over thinking they will get a deal for driving so far, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.! like everything in La this place way over priced and a total ripoff. $80 -3 months $160 for 6 months and $250 for a year. The best place to get your medical license is in the IE, $50 for the whole year and no hidden fees or charges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5024YCpatriciam
40,Always interesting!,"Venice Beach is what it is. I enjoy people watching and all of the interesting art and things for sale. Love to walk out on the pier and enjoy the ocean. Fantastic views. I always make sure I stop here on my trips to California. I brought my children this time, and they enjoyed it as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H0llyw00dM0m
30,"Blast from the Past - been there, done that, won't bother again.....","I was in college in the 70s and felt like I was there again. Only difference - medicinal marijuana.I would not bring my young children here. Just a bit too ""left over hippie"" for what I would want my young children or grandchildren around.Beach is great - no problems there. No problems with feeling safe. Some of the places to eat seemed less than clean. I would not eat in the area at many of the places, myself.tacky and seemed like the area is ""leftover"" a place that time has forgotten. Not in a good way.Always wanted to go - this one is a ""been there, done that, won't bother again.""Beach was lovely. Would go back for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEVenturer
30,Wow a different place,We visited Venice on our first day on our trip to LA always wanted to walk down Venice beach and hearing so much about it it was different experience it is hard to explain what it is like it is a mixing pot of all different types of people from buskers to pro formers to tourists to hippys you name it you will find it at Venice beach I am glad that I went and experienced it first hand it is something I will not forget but if we return to Los Angeles I will not be disappointed if I did not go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jwarran
40,Venice Beach is a cool place to visit,I think Venice Beach is a cool place to visit because there happens a lot. There was some cool street artists who did a very cool breakdance at the street.I also liked the cool graffiti arts here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadsP_12
20,Somewhere to miss!,"So we visited out of season in January. But nothing had prepared us for the sheer tackiness of it all - compounded by the huge number of poor vagrants about the place. We'd walked down from Santa Monica Pier, past the 'new' Muscle Beach and the smart hotel fronts and - having enjoyed the promenade - were looking forward to the famous Venice Beach. What a let-down! The retail parades were largely made up of shops full of down market goods (almost certainly not produced in the USA) and worn out fast food outlets. Some might be attracted by the ""medical marijuana"" outlets - and some on the sidewalks clearly had been. Some of the homeless had set up their own pitches to sell stuff they had made which, while laudable, was not exactly souvenir or art worthy. There were one or two stalls worth looking at - and a couple of musicians. But the rest was just awful. If you really enjoy looking at a load of tat surrounded by dubious 'artists', weirdos and more pitifully, the lost souls of some of the 160,000 homeless who ""live"" in California then you'll really have fun here. If not, avoid the tourist hype about alternative or counter-cultures and enjoy the rest of LA's great beach fronts and many other attractions that the city offers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex

30,OK,"It's like an item on your bucket list people say go and see it for yourself. Not for kids that's for sure. Not really offensive, just not of any value either. 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica much more civilized option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/429robd
40,Muscle men in Muscle tees,"Venice beach lives up to its reputation...the gorgeous beach, sexy men at the muscle gym, the basketball courts, the stalls and unlimited supply of paraphernalia. Venice beach and boardwalk was great to spend some downtime, take some pics, buy some cheap-ish muscle shirts and souvenirs. You need to at least go once to say you've been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/331merea
50,Paradise with a city edge,"A little more rough around edges than your standard holiday beach, though beautiful the it encapsulates the diversity of the city which makes it so interesting.

40,Cool but strange place,"If you go to LA and do NOT go to Venice Beach then shame on you! This place is full of life, culture and over the top interesting people. lolThe promenade is a very good stroll. Don't be freaked out by the abundance of the doctors in the green outfits. They sell Mary Jane right there on the beach walk, yep that is right it is legal for medicinal use so it is everywhere!There are weird things going on down there and to each his own, if you have smaller kids and are easily offend by strange happenings, people who dress the way they want, do what they want and free spirits I don't know about small kids unless they are small enough they will not remember what they see.It really is just one of those places you really need to visit at least one time in your life..It's cool, different and culturally diverse!The beach is huge and beautiful!! It was very clean too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karibensea
40,Interesting and a little weird,There are some unique and interesting people in this area. And then there are some really super weird people. The shops are quite cool but some are a bit junky. Taking a walk down here is something that is well worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BagmanNZ
50,Great place for Breakfast and stroll along the promenade,"Visited Venice Beach on a Friday morning in early December and the area was buzzing with buskers and stalls. Had breakfast at one of the cafés on the promenade whilst listening to the music of a band playing nearby. Walked the promenade down to the Santa Monica Pier and back a nice stroll. A good place for a bike ride or to rollerblade ( hire places available if you don't have your own) or for those less energetic pay to have a ride on the back of a tricycle. The shops range from Tshirt and tacky souvenirs and as other reviewers have pointed out medical marijuana. Some of the stalls had interesting artwork and it was pleasant browsing with no hard sell from the stall holders. The beach is nice, hardly anyone on the sand or in the water with a large area of sand between the promenade and the water line but I would imagine on weekends and during peak summer season it would be packed. Definitely worth visiting for a half day, taking in breakfast or lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iitravel
20,More crazy people here than a GTA game,"Coming from Australia, I had big expectations of this world famous beach. And to be honest, it was mediocre.It was not at all pleasant to walk by the number of drug users loitering the area asking tourists for money. It's also very weird to see so many ""Green Doctor"" practices in the area...It was an experience, to say the least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KD128
40,Packed!!!,The beach was fun but just packed with people. I had a nice funnel cake and I could of got a medical marijuana card for $60. LOL. Bathrooms are gross and lines are forever long I wanted to visit the freak show but I didnt have time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisyA
30,come here to see the weirdos or counterculture,The only reason to visit this beach is not for the beach itself. Its for the large gathering here of counterculture. You walk along the boardwalk and there can be sights you will not see anywhere else in the greater los angeles area. This place probably has the highest density of medicinal marijuana shops. And definitely vendors selling all kinds of artsy products you would be hard pressed to find at the getty museum. In warm weather its a great place to people watch just for the high number of strollers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01

10,Forget 'artsy' this is plain trashy.,"This is not a comment about the long, wide beach areas between Santa Monica and Marina del Rey which are generally very attractive and blessed with a wonderful, sunny climate. It is about the built-up area of shops, stalls etc known as Venice Beach boardwalk. First of all, the they say that you only get once chance to make a first impression but, boy, did Venice Beach boardwalk make a bad one on me.Maybe mid-morning was just the wrong time of the day and I didn't see it at its best. But my overwhelming impression was of tacky, rundown shops, just a tiny smattering of art that showed any talent, insight, creativity or eccentricity, and lots of people just milling around and, well, milling around.I had gone expecting the street performers of London or Paris mixed with the zany, carnival atmospehere of New England's Provincetown and with that Californian counter-cultural feel but it just looked like Amsterdam after a bad night before the city authorities started to clean up the red lights districts and close some of the ""coffee"" (ahem, weed) shops. Add lots of poor souls who are clearly destitute and have de-camped to many of the areas with public seating and the overall impression was one of deep social malaise.Yes, there was the occasional piece of genuinely good art and I saw a street performer in a loin cloth with snakes wrapped round his well worked-out body (nice!) but the overall atmosphere was dismal and depressing.God knows what it's like when the sun isn't shining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloholics
10,Not recommended.,"I echo the sentiment of the other poor and terrible ratings. I don't recommend going at all! I can't even call it artsy. The only nice attractions are the pier, the skatepark, and the occasional musician.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennepasta
40,Go for the Venice Beach vibe,"I'll start with a caveat, if you're looking for a classy beach without bums and hippies then this beach is not for you. However, if you decide to overlook that then you should be alright. I actually like the artsy vibe Venice Beach gives out. You will see vendors along the boardwalk selling original artwork, music, handmade jewelries, and more. If you want some LA souvenirs, this is the perfect place to buy too. If you're looking for traditional LA, Venice Beach or Muscle Beach merchandise, make sure though to check out a few shops before buying because it is common to find a better deal in some shops compared to the others. Muscle Beach is worth checking out too. There's a free outdoor gym and you can also watch the Muscle Beach gym enthusiasts workout. Once you're done with the boardwalk, you can head out to the sand and enjoy the view or watch the surfers. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathc2014
50,Very Interesting,"Well this is a California version of a Board Walk. It is a beautivul beach location with the famous Muscle Beach exercize gym in the open. The boardwalk consits of all kinds of places to eat as well as stores on one side. The beach side of the boardwalk seems to be more street vender setups. Everything from food, art, fortune telling.....This is an interesting spot and a required spot to spend a day between lounging on the beach and walking the boardwalk. Visit the restaurants and the street venders and keep an eye out for the roller skating Jimmy hendrix ish guitar player.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeltaBiker
10,disappointing,"extremely disappointed, smells like urine most likely due to all the homeless people sleeping along the grass. Their tents, trolleys and sleeping bags are scattered everywhere...a bit of an eye sore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cupcakebaby1
40,Cool beach town with funky vibe,"The beach here is clean and wide. There were many surfers to observe. The pier is free but no rides, etc just some fishers trying to catch a meal. The little town area has a few cool bars and restaurants. Worth a drop in. Public parking lot was $6 and plenty of spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2traveldaworld
50,I Love LA and Venice Beach,"If you LOVE the beach, visit LA and Venice Beach! Absolutely beautiful! Lots of shops, bike rentals, gym on the beach, just nice sitting on the beach and watching the sunset or rise, which did both! Just a fun place to see and visit! Will definitely visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/487JoanG
30,Tacky Venice Beach,Venice Beach is still as tacky as it was 30 years ago the last time I visited there. I think some of the same homeless people were still there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117WayneG117
50,Nice and fun!,"This is one part of a long beach that runs from Santa Monica down the coast. It's beautiful. It's funky, too. It's great to walk and walk. Perfect for a sunset stroll. Perhaps a bit scary after dark, too. You will meet some questionable characters and want to buy thirst with words on them that you'll never wear back home. It's a LA experience not to be missed. If you want fancier go to Santa Monica too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/careerguyn
40,An Extended Stay at Venice Beach,"Venice Suites proved to be a pleasant and comfortable place for a week at the beach. However, be advised that parking is a pain. Garage space provided is a good 10 minute hike from the hotel and makes in and out activities not so easy. LA is a city built for the automobile. Want to see stuff and get in and out of your apartment? This may not be for you.No nearby, easy walking distance, Quick Stop type stores for mini-supplies. No daily newspaper racks handy.But the Suites are pleasant, nicely furnished and well maintained. Managers Robert and Mark could not be more helpful. They get anything not working fixed right away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harlan3h
50,Maybe most beautiful place in LA,"I didn't expect Venice Beach to be that beautiful when I went there. It is such an relaxed area, it doesn't even seem like being part of such a large town. Friendly guys over there and a great atmosphere, full of arts and artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juleswtal
40,Must try once,"This place is like nothing you've ever seen. Very glad we went although I kept a keen eye on the people around us and made sure my wallet was still in my pocket the whole time.Shops sell all the same rubbish and a bloke in an Egyptian shop tried hard to trap me into a sale. Lots of homeless and musicians trying hard to sell their demos.The mixture of rollerblading, skateboarding kids, pot smoke, sun, good art, terrible art and strangely dressed people make for an interesting and enjoyable couple of hours.The beach looks nice but not too impressive compared to most Australian beaches. I'm sure it's packed in summer.At the end of the shops, there's a nice cream shop. Awesome and very worth it for the walk back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PerthMackem
40,Great for people watching,"My wife and I spent about half a day visiting the beach, boardwalk, and canals. The beach was fairly empty for a clear sunny September day. We walked the boardwalk which was crowded. I'm sure it would not win any awards from a health inspector. We encountered no problems, and enjoyed the people watching and the unique stores, many selling drug paraphernalia. Muscle Beach was empty (i guess it was too hot). We walked the paths and bridges of the canals which were unique and colorful. Over all, an interesting stop.The downsides were expensive parking ($ 15) at a beach lot. We got tired of looking for street parking, which is free in places, but hard to find, and many tow away zones. The beach bathrooms were mostly locked, filthy, with long lines waiting to enter the few left open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HunkyJoe
30,Expensive parking for overhyped gawking,"Well, now ""I've been there, done that"". Lot's of things to see and look at, but nothing outrageous as expected. As for what they sell, I haven't seen so much junk even at a flea-market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norway_in_Stamford
50,Stunning beach,"Wasn't too busy, the sights were beautiful, and the sand was great. The water was FREEZING! There were a few people out in the surf braving the temperatures, though. I bet it's nice and warm in summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/painted_duchess
30,Typical tourist spot,"See during the day, but no need to spend hours there. It is great people watching, though beggars, and homeless people there. Watched the skateboarders, breakdance kids on the sidewalks. Wanted to see painting of Jim Morrison and Arnold on the orange muscle beach building. Lots of odd people, vendors, but did walk the beach a bit and see a pod of dolphins.Would be cool to rent a bike and ride down to Santa Monica. Look out for Venice Beach physicians-meaning certified to diagnose and prescribe you a medical marijuana card. Very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dolittledigger
10,Dreadful Place,For me this was a dreadful experience..... from being harassed to buy music discs and the terrible stench of cannabis.....tacky shops well over priced..... really not a nice place to visit at all..... my advice would be stay away and choose another place....this is not an area for families with children,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan278
50,Great Place To See Nature Of All Kinds--Human and Not,"Venice Beach is such an eclectic mix of people and things to see, taste, smell and experience. No two visits are the same. Bring your dog. There are lots of areas to walk/run on. Wear comfortable shoes. Take your bike. Bring a few dollars so you can get some fresh fruit from a street vendor. Bring your camera. Sunset here is something to see. You will find yourself coming back again and again. What a neat and beautiful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanEsq12
20,Terrifying no go for weekends,"Venice Beach gets a lot of hype and as soon as you get there, you see why. It is like no place you have ever been. The skateboarders and break dancers were cool and kept the vibe positive, but as soon as you stepped away from the crowds, you were accosted by people begging, others digging through trash, smoking joints openly, and general debauchery. It took me back to end of exams at college or maybe more accurately spring break. Also, other than the boardwalk that is plastered full with junk and medicinal marijuana shops, there is really very few clean places to have a drink or go to the bathroom. If you still want to brave the chaos, don't go on the crowded weekends. Definitely skippable on the LA scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eilla883
40,Great place to watch the locals,Loved this place! As soon as we got there a local introduced himself to us and he just happened to have the same nickname as i do back in Australia! The people and attractions here were great and we will be back for sure when we visit again in 2015. Places like this are great to sit back and take in a perfect part of America!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birdman426
50,Excellent people watching!,"I had the time of my life in Venice a few weekends ago. I rented a bike (steal of a Groupon for a full day rental) and cruised the bike path all day long! I rode from Venice down to the Santa Monica Pier and over to the Will Rogers State Beach, where the bike path ended. That ride took less than an hour and was nearly completely flat - perfect for a beach cruiser. I rode past Muscle Beach, some fancy beach homes and then back down to Marina del Rey. I got a little confused here because the bike path weaves back in through town, but the stretch from here to Will Rogers was plenty. The had plenty of public bathrooms along the way but I wouldn't recommend them for germophobes. t loved watching the taggers at the graffiti park, the roller skaters, dancers (70-year old man in high tops and swim trunks), etc. But beware - if the smell of marijuana nauseates you, steer clear! Otherwise, an eclectic neighborhood with cute shops, interesting art, beach cafes (a bit overpriced - my veggie burger and fruit from a shack cost me $20). A great way to spend a sunny California day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayB35
10,Venice Beach dump.,"Don't waste your time. What a dump. Dope heads, drunks, transients and old hookers. Ran down old slums and over priced shops. Stick to Santa Monica. Yeah it's middle class, but a least you would eat there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schuptar
50,always great,"This is our second stay in Venice near the beach and we love the location. Wandering the beach, looking at the all the goods to buy, checking out the basketball and weight lifters, and of course the people watching, all of it is hard to beat. There is also plenty of food options. There is a fairly good population of homeless but for the most part nobody harasses you.We're here for Christmas and one of the fun things was in some locations the sand was piled high so the kids could ""sled"" on plastic saucers. I don't like doing vacations twice in the same spot, but Venice/LA is the one exception.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
40,Fun Daytime visit to an Iconic Spot,"Venice Beach has its own iconic character that is worth experiencing, if only once or for a few hours. Yes, there is weed (they'll be glad to give you a prescription!) and there are less savory types around, but if you know that, it is easy to avoid such and just enjoy the circus. It's fun to look and buy from the beach-side line of crafts and shlock, or go to the storefronts and look. Some stores are decidedly better than others. Sometimes you'll get a bargain on a t-shirt or encounter a culture surprise like I did this time when an oriental-culture storeowner literally shouted ""NO!"" at me when I presented my credit card. He only took credit for over a certain amount, but had a very non-western way of communicating this with his customer.In Venice Beach, you go with the flow and just take it all in with a grain of sea salt.The beach is wide and pleasant away from the storefronts and the ped and bikeways. This was my second visit here, and I parked both times down at the Washington Street beachfront parking lot for $6. That way, I could walk down the long fishing pier that extends from there and look at the water and watch the surfers up close, then walk up to the main VB commercial area, passing in front of the (I'm sure fantastically expensive) little houses that line the beach.Venice Beach is a fun day-visit counterpoint to the more straightforward and cleaner Santa Monica Beach, which I also love to visit. Also worth seeing here are the ""Venice"" canals a few blocks inland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaguarFeather
40,Worth visiting once to see it,"We visited Venice Beach right around Christmas time. It was great people watching but it definitely was rougher than I expected.It is worth a stop on your drive up the coast but know ahead of time that you will be seeing a very ""interesting"" crowd. Quite a bit of panhandlers and an overall rough atmosphere. Not great for children but teens will be amused by the people watching.The good thing is there are segways available for rent as well as bikes. They are less stringent on age restrictions on the segways than most people so if you have teens who have always wanted to use a segway, this is a fun place to do it.Lots of places to eat and little fun shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneeFlorida27
50,Wonderful Beach,"I like visiting Venice Beach, tho a parking garage is needed, every time I am in LA for all the sidewalk showoffs And the beach views!Manhattan beach gives me oil rig tar on my feet. Redondo is nice but further. Santa Monica is lovely but even harder to find parking; parked a mile away last time and walked. (hint:build more parking garages!)This last time I walked for hours and kept my wallet in my front pocket, eating at a very good , side street bbq place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivanRaj
50,Great board culture,"Skateboard (all of the kinds) , rollerblades, surf and a lot of beach sports. This is a board paradise, either to practice the sport or just to hang out talking to people. A lot of interesting foreign people and locals too. For a mexican, I can say that the water of the beach is not warm, but also not cold enough to prevent you from swimming. Shops with cool things and not very expensive. Beautiful and interesting people, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0gee
30,Not the best for children.,We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach.There was a lot of what seemed to me like bums or homeless people once we reached Venice Beach. And the smell of reefer was annoying as I was constantly thinking that the kids are going to be stoned if we lingered to take too many photos.There were many cheap shops though and the food was surprisingly good where we ate.The outside gym is definitely worth a look at. The guys are pumping iron and then flexing in the mirror during sets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConfusiousGuy
50,Walk from Santa Monica to Venice and back!,"This is by far the best thing in LA, the walk from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back. Venice itself has some charming things to see as well but the walk along the beach just tops everything. And if you dont have a lot of luggage with you, you can even rent some skates. Make sure you have sunblock!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeLondon
50,Go during the day,Lots of crazy things to see. Do not recommend taking your kids at night there are lots of people smoking. Great view and you can walk to Santa Monica from here. Bathrooms are super gross. Drum circle can be dangerous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineg600
40,People Watching Paradise,"There are all kinds of interesting characters (people) and happenings on this beach. People of all ages are enjoying swimming, surfing, rollerblading, biking, walking and just relaxing and watching the body builders showing off their muscles. Lots of action at all hours. Venice is a very interesting community of Canals if you get off the beach and walk east. Houses are very interesting,with every style of architecture imaginable, ducks, canoes etc. Venice is a great place to walk the beach north to Santa Monica. Lots of shops, food and vendors and always plenty of action. You will never be bored here. Most fun beach in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mermaid322
40,Relax and walk down the beach,This is just like the movies portray it. All kinds of people young and old enjoying the view of the ocean or selling their stuff or art and music etc. Have some ice-cream and take a walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bowiebow
50,Sunday drum circle,"We walked from Santa Monica to Venice beach Sunday later afternoon. Venice Beach is more interesting than clean Santa Monica. Shops by boardwalk is tourist-trap, but other side of brick-and-mortar shops is vendors selling mainly hand-crafts, Mexican skulls, and art, ...etc. We heard a loud noise from the beach while walking. There're drum circle playing impromptu songs/dances. I don't recommend if you're with kids as there're a LOT of LOT of alcohol/MJ consumption among participants. Personally it's a good surprise on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Wonderz
40,Great spot for a nice walk by the beach!,"Venice is a very nice spot for a walk by the beach and a quick bite or drink.Plenty of stores and little bars around the area.If you are visiting LA you can't miss it!Very close to Santa Monica, Playa del Rey and Mar Vista.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caffep2013
50,"Sensory overload, in a good way","What can one add about Venice Beach? You can go early in the morning and be with the fisherman on the piers, or in the evening and watch the surfers as the sun sets, or any time of day for an overload of sound, colour, movement, energy, and all kinds of things to see.So it’s not a traditional beach, with the sole purpose of sunbathing and swimming. It’s much more touristy than that, with its shops, street vendors, street acts, fitness enthusiasts, bikers, and of course the tourists themselves - lots of them, like me. And there’s the ever present weed. You might not see it, but you know it’s there.Overall, it’s a fun, quirky way to spend an afternoon, if you like variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40JeffP
40,A “must” when visiting Los Angeles!.....,"Venice Beach is an important part of experiencing Los Angeles. It’s not beautiful, it’s not nice, is not normal and is VERY far away from the “typical” image of a beach - if there is such a thing; it is … just Venice Beach and there’s no place like it!Venice Beach is crazy and wacky and wired and crowded and freaky and mad, then it has the sounds, the smells, the images, the crowed … You have acrobats, fire eaters, comedians, vendors selling anything you can imagine, food stalls, a few small restaurants, bodybuilders, girls with bikinis made out of what in other places would go for dental floss, gangsta’ types, fortune tellers of all denominations, tattoo parlors, henna painters, an assortment of graphic artists ranging from “your name on a rice seed” to spray can painters, dogs with caps and sunglasses, weed doctors, singers, roller bladders,Best time to see/smell/experience all of these: mid afternoon, on a weekend, preferably on a nice, sunny weather. I would not stay after sunset, although there’s plenty of police and the place is pretty safe. For a more normal and nice place, try the crossing of Third Street & Promenade in Santa Monica, or go a little further down on 405 S, to Manhattan Beach for a nice sundowner..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldnomad_01
50,Stroll along the beach,"Experience the quintessential endless summer in Los Angeles. Venice is one of the best beaches in LA. Relax, romance, watch the sunset, look for dolphins, bring your yoga mat, surfing board, bike or rollerblades, meet people, take photographs. Check the Landmark architectural homes: Frank Gehry's ""Binoculars Building” (is now home to Google Los Angeles) or his actual place of residence, also located in Venice. Eat, shop, visit art galleries on uber-chic Abbot Kinney Blvd. There’s something for everyone on the boardwalk: there are specialty shops, restaurants and uniquely designed residences, street performers, artists, and much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tatianng
10,Tourist Trap Extravaganza,"We really put high value on meeting people that live in the communities we visit. We like to get a feel for the local vibe and pace of life. The only people hanging out on the Venice Beach boardwalk are Tourists and the non-locals that want to sell stuff to Tourists. If you wanna spend an afternoon with everyone from baggage claim, and everyone that doesn't actually live in Venice, the boardwalk is perfect..We used the parking lot on Rose Avenue to avoid the traffic. A smart move for sure. Bought lunch from a little hole-in-the-wall place called Zelda's, just off the boardwalk, the food was pretty darn terrific. We walked down to the Venice Pier, even saw a pod of dolphin. We ended up renting bikes. Bike routes are pretty scenic and great for escaping the tourist crap. We biked to the Marina and ended up making plans to return the following day to take a group standup paddle board class. An unexpected addition to our journey and really fun, albeit slightly chilly..Venice offers up a pretty typical trashy tourist outing. If that's what you are after, you won't be disappointed. If on the other hand you want something more authentic, rent a bike and ride on through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKJonas
50,Well worth seeing,"Start at the southern end of Venice Beach and visit Venice Canals. Wander up and down this area looking at the most beautiful small, individual properties, backing onto the canals. Each one is very different with some truly wonderful colours and architecture. Fascinating. Then wander along the walkway beachside towards Santa Monica. Watch the skateboarders and look at the local artists' wares. Stop for great ice-cream/snacks in little cafes. Stand at Muscle Beach and watch the guys limbering up. Eventually arrive at Santa Monica Pier after padding in the Pacific. Catch bus back to L.A. or Venice Beach to collect car. A really lovely relaxing day people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seelie_11
40,`A fun and happening place!,"There's a lot of stimulation here…. the crowds, the people, the vendors, the stores, the beach, the air and on and on. You'll meet a various assortment of characters. Among my favorites… ""Mo,"" (for Mohammed), the watch vendor, who, although in his sixties, often dresses as if he was nearby on Muscle Beach, nearly naked (save very brief shorts) and well-tanned. You'll meet the ""hooker"" for Dr. Kush, a medical marijuana dispensary, You'll also meet John Scott, who produces signs saying he's ""world-famous,"" and who autographs various memorabilia that he produces. There are some interesting shops, and interesting architecture. There is a really good bike path that runs along the beach from Malibu to Palos Verdes. I live nearby and advise you not to be put off by homeless people who frequent the area… in general they are not harmful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enable
50,L.A. Fun,"It is a great place to go and just walk up and down the boardwalk. The restaurants are varied and mostly good,especially for breakfast .you can shop or go down toy he beach. People watching is a hoot and there is always biking or roller blading. It is a fun day to go to Venice .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevens834
30,Where the weird and strange come together with fun,"Venice Beach is a very strange place. If you are a ""people watcher"" you will really enjoyyour visit here. There are plenty of people to watch and events taking place all the time.Parking is fairly good and walking the walk along the beach is the most fun. Of coursethere is bike riding on the beach, but you miss some of the events taking place alongthe walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardL624

20,If you like Venice I have a bridge to sell you,The Venice boardwalk is a gimcrack strip of tacky shops and overpriced parking. There are some good restaurants back over on Abbott Kinney Blvd e.g. Hal's. If you are night owl you might see one of the Kogi trucks parked outside. Also the best beaches are further south about 12 miles in Manhattan and Hermosa.Much of the culture center of this part of LA has moved east to Culver City along Washington and Venice Blvds. The area around the old Helms Bakery is bustling. This is always a destination for me when I'm back in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pasquinob_13
50,Nice way to spend an afternoon,"Venice beach/boardwalk is still a nice way to spend a casual afternoon. Lots of artwork, jewelry, clothing booths to peruse. Entertainment is free and abundant.

30,Iconic but Edgy Part of LA History,"Muscle beach, marijuana shops, a history all unto itself, with the famous and infamous boardwalk. As one other person said, every oddball person or at least their cousin is down here, so you might want to seriously watch what's going on. Lots of cops around which should give you an idea that this is not the safest of places, yet there is also the beautiful Pacific and a gorgeous view of the mountains. People watching is a major event here. Daytime is the best time to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calizen
50,Then go to Disney Land..,"Hi Gang,I live here, so naturally, I don't visit Venice beach that much, but it is something to see, it is a slice of life, to me it's reminiscent of being in a bazaar with all kinds of stuff going on around you in some of those post apocalyptic movies or a scene from Casablanca, I like it, it's loaded with odd balls and oddities, pan handlers and what have you, there are quite a few decent restaurants in the general area close by, like on Ocean and Main streets and there are plenty of places to snack along ""the board walk"", if you walk up to the Santa Monica pier, there are even more restaurants, for instance Bubba Gumps (yep, from the Movie), and other seafood restaurants. Venice beach is like a county fair that happens everyday of the year, with the exception that Venice beach has a bit of an edge to it if you know what I mean. Most Angelenos know that when you go, you should enjoy yourself, but have your game face on just in case. Like any place else, you should always be aware of your suroundings remember that and you'll be okay, there is a very good police prescence during the day. Most importantly, it's not a place to take that after dinner stroll at night! if this is too much doom and gloom for you,...then go to Disneyland. :-)P.S. the next place I review, I'll be sure to have pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrEasy724

It may not be for the squeamish of faint of heart but those into movie, television and music history can have a day's worth of significant moments. The old out door gym is still there, the original Muscle Beach. You can sit in the same clump of beach where an acid drenched Jim Morrison first read his poem, ""Let's Swim to the Moon"", to an absolutely floored Ray Manzarek and also saw a beautiful black woman who was his inspiration for ""Hello, I Love You"". If you've done your home work you'll know where the Doors' house was. You can walk the Venice Pier and hang at the old Bistro where Venice's beat poets used to hold court.

Some, really good and some so-so to no-no. When walking the boardwalk look for the muscle beach area. This is where Arnold got his start. Also a great skateboarding area that is fun to watch. When walking the boardwalk try not to even make eye contact with the many 'vendors' trying to sell CD's, and what-ever's. While in the area check out the Venice canals nearby. It will be a fun day and don't be scarred off by some 'unusal' folks. Most are harmless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49
50,A trip. Literally.,"Always make time for a stop here when I am in LA. Art and homeless people and marijuana all juxtaposed into a semi-dirty beach with more character than most other areas nearby combined. Beach is huge. Boardwalk is great and stroll along Ocean Front Walk to experience weird shops, performers, artwork, and amazing homes. Truly sums up the hippy, vagrant, California vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rufusNY
10,Horrible!,"The beach is fabulous - inland is where it all goes horribly wrong! The boulevard is full of serious oddballs and some very shady types. The shops are full of overpriced, cheap rubbish. The whole place has a shoddy, depressing and worn air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TumbleWeed_9
50,One of the nicest beaches one can imagine,"The beach is clean and the mountains in the background make it a great place. The fact that smoking is not allowed on the beach should come as a surprise to nobody, but there are signs that say that ""smoking is not permitted in the park""; it is good to know that ""the park"" includes the boardwalk. While they are very nice about it, you can be fined if you are caught smoking in that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reage55
40,Very artsy place,"This beach is unique. You'll find just about everything there from skateboarding to panhandlers to strange joggers. It's a very interesting place. Lots of outdoor shops, restaurants pretty much anything. Not very clean; no not clean at all but interesting. It's worth taking a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharon557
50,like no other beachfront boardwalk!,"what a show! all kinds of weirdos, and all kinds of others- skateboarders, bodybuilders, freak show (too bad was closed that day!), just has to be seen to be believed- what an experience to ordinary people like us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSvin
40,Best vacation,"For you that prefer sand and sun instead of glamour fom Hollywood, it's the perfect place, I strongly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luizfernandos713
40,Like Camden with a beach,"I walked down from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and it's well worth a walk/bike/skate along the front there. Visiting the skateboard bowls is very cool and walking up to the canals is quite a relaxing change of pace from the front with all the shops and art and crafts stalls.As the title says it really reminded me of the Camden area in London with the stalls, without the crap weather and with a beach. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/799SteveH799
20,Not the nicest place,"My wife and I walked down the path from Santa Monica on our last day in town to see the famed Venice Beach. All I can say is that it's run down and the merchants are selling some pretty crappy stuff. The person who said it was a dump was about right. The skate park was interesting, but if you only have limited time in the area, take a pass on this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeathH375
50,A must for tourist visitors to LA,"A great way to spend a day - check out the unusual shops, stalls along with sporting sites such as muscle beach, basketball courts etc. Then hire bikes and cycle along the boardwalk - you won't be dissapointed - a great way to people watch and take in the craziness of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllieKaballieUK
30,Very different and quite unusual,"Probably the most unexpected place I've ever been. Venice Beach is different, very different from what I had expected. Ocean Front is a hotch-potch of fairly similar tourist stores interspersed with pretty ordinary restaurants. There is a good deal of homelessness here too which takes away the California beach gloss but in a strange way adds too the character of the area. It's not for the faint hearted and the poverty was a real shock when just a few miles away in Beverley Hills you have almost offensive displays of wealth. We stayed on the Front and enjoyed long walks to Santa Monica and back. You get to a point on the walk when you cross into Santa Monica and the whole atmosphere changes to a more sterile environment. Venice Beach has an edge. If you enjoy quirky left field this is definitely for you. If you want slick veneered beach go north a few blocks. We used Venice Beach as a base for two nights to explore LA - we had a hire car - and sort out the tiredness of the flight from London. Probably would try somewhere else if we came again but not because we didn't like the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamlh58
10,What a dump!,"We were taken to Venice Beach as part of a tour around Los Angeles. While the rest of the tour was great, I cannot for the life of me work out why we were taken to spend half an hour here! It is very seedy, dirty and full of hippies and hobos. It reminds me of the worst parts of Blackpool if there are any Brits reading this! The driver told me that people either love it or hate it and I must say I hated it. Don't waste your time, go to Santa Monica, or anywhere else for that matter, much nicer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenpEdinburgh
30,"Quirky, Good for a Walk Through Once or Twice","My sister lives near to Venice Beach so we always like to go walk on the beach on the way up to Santa Monica Pier. It suits her personality which tends to be more indie and hippie-ish, but it's definitely not so much more of mine.PROS:- clean- lots of food stores with carnival food so you know you're not going to starve- atms (in case you run out of cash)- local art exposure- more low-key (in Nov) than Santa Monica Pier due to popularityCONS:- frequent smell of weed due to all the ""green clinics"" and legalized marijuana. Don't care for it but don't like it as THE pervasive scent on the BEACH of all places.- take a picture, pay for it --- everything costs these days, even a memory- ""up-and-coming"" struggling musicians who will try to solicit you to buy their cds, originally by first ""giving"" it to you to get their way into talking to you.- TAR bits on the sand. It's so sad to see pollution but it's worse when it gets stuck on your shoes and then you track it home!Honestly, in the morning, it was AMAZING place to run as it was so quiet and nobody was out yet. However, there is no sunrise as it is on the WEST coast but will get a good sunset. Always cool and refreshing when you're closer to the water. I'd definitely still treat it as a favorite morning run spot when I visit my sister though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rammiegirl
40,Find Your Inner Hippie,"They say that if you remember the 60's, you weren't there. Well, catch up on what you missed by strolling the boardwalk at Venice Beach. A fun trip among artists (so to speak), musicians (so to speak), and every manner of craftsman selling every manner of, well, anything. Capitalism is alive and well at a left over corner of the beat generation and its spiritual descendants. It's an experience for the eyes, ears and, unfortunately, nose. Nevertheless, much fun and amusement, including stops to see the skateboarders and body builders at muscle beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartb554
40,Well worth a visit!,"We enjoyed an afternoon wandering around here with our mouths hanging open! There is no end of street performers, skateboarders, people playing all different sports or just jogging along singing! It is a very lively place, however then you can just find your spot on the golden sand and lie down to chill and listen to the waves. Very enjoyable day afternoon out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraY883
20,So what...?,"Living in Brighton UK, I found our beach-front/promenade to be far more eclectic and full of interesting people and sights than this overrated stretch of LA beach-front. Visit to tick it off th elist but don't expect to be astounded (unless you come from somewhere very dull!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkhigham
40,One of the Most Eclectic Places I've Seen,"As soon as I stepped onto the sidewalk I knew Venice Beach was different from any place I'd been… and by different I mean weirder. I'd definitely recommend this as a stop on any road trip down California's coast. It was one of our most entertaining stops. Go with an open mind and you will enjoy it the most.It is an eclectic community filled with hippies, artists, surfers, and tourists all mingling along the boardwalk. Artists and musicians set up stands to sell their work; there are plenty of tourist shops; and the beach is nice.My only warnings are that it's a little dirty (especially the bathrooms), parking can be expensive, and some parts may inappropriate for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CourtneyB445
50,another legendary place to visit !!!,Its like the time stopped....from the 80's with Roller Boogie and 100 more...it was just wonderful to see the sunset with all the skateboarders around...very hippie...very vintage..if you are a movie fan..you must visit this place...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaPrince70
50,AWESOME,"I was there on Sun 9/8/13. My friend and I spent 4 hrs walking the boardwalk. Nice stores but be careful and check the merchandise before you buy. I was in one tee shirt place that was charging 14.95/shirt and they were all damaged, not what I would call first quality?? My only complaint. If you are a prude stay off the boardwalk too or you'll be disappointed, but if you are open minded no matter your age you will have a blast. We popped into a 10.00 massage place and got a foot massage for 10 bucks and it was just what we needed while walking the boardwalk. There were street performers who were dynamite, and just people watching was an education too. A fun fun day. We then walked the Venice Canals.....NOT TO BE missed...!!! So so pretty.!!! Venice is hard to describe it either grips you I guess or it doesn't and it certainly gripped me...~~~!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolk148
50,Day at the beach,Highly recommended fun spot to hangout eat /shop/ enjoy people and beach. Can run into a wide variety of visitors of all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414gregb
40,Huge beach with wonderful people watching,"Nice place to walk or take a bike ride along the beach. Tons of people to see surfing, sleeping, or whatever. The beach is huge and clean. The water is too cold to get in as far as I am concerned, but still worth spending time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulZ46033
40,"Touristy, sure. But I love it.","I've heard all the bad things about Venice. It's a dump. It's touristy. It's crawling with pushy street performers and homeless people. The beach is lousy. On and on and on... But ya know what, I love this place. There's just some sort of vibe down there I love. Stroll along Ocean Front for some awesome people watching. Rent a bike and cruise up the bike path to Sunset. Plop down on the sand and stare at the Pacific. No matter what I always enjoy my time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
10,Warning LA is still not safe,LA is a very unsafe place to visit. My daughter from Australia got beaten up last night and robbed of all her possessions. No one helped her. The police were not interested and recorded the stolen goods as lost - less paperwork they said. Women are totally unsafe in LA. There are plenty of other places to holiday in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barnaust
50,WOW,"Venice Beach is far the best beach i've been too , there are tonnes of things you can do there , rents bikes , play basketball , do a work-out at muscle beach and so on. Everthing is just stunning especially at sunset because you get to see the sun gentle sinks into the horizon.BIG TUMBS up for Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francoisg740
30,Beach Bums...And more!,"Ok, think beach...then think bums, what do you get? Lots of beach bums...I visited with my daughter and WOW! Try it once and then find another beach for sunbathing...don't get me wrong, what a site and quite entertaining for people watching...lots of trinkets for sale at ok prices. BUT Venice beach is famous and known for people of all kinds...so no judgement here, just sad to see people begging and so dirty. I enjoyed the walk along the coast and can say I would not do it again...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy_colts2009
40,"Freaks, food and stuff","It's very hard to describe Venice Beach to people. There are a lot of normal people mixed in with freaky creatures, street performers, food, bodybuilders and the beach. It's definitely someplace you have to go once in your life. There is also a bike/jogging path along the beach separate from where the shops and restaurants are. You can get a decent meal, buy a ton of stuff and see a lot of weird things. It's like no other place I've ever been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/musclegirl68
40,Nice beach better canals,"The beach is nice and vast, very californian but I think it is worth going there for the canals around, amongst the very nice american houses. It is pleasant and relaxing to just get lost around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lpb_38
40,fun to see venice beach,"Its worth a few hours to see the beach and the madness on the boardwalk, and the skateboarders, and the characters",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallacecollins
30,A weird take on LA,The beach is lovely but the crowd along the board walk pretty depressing.many homeless young people and tons of tourists.There are many more beautiful beaches in So. Cal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psychjudy
20,Venice Beach,"Over-rated. We spent an hour here during a bus tour of the city. We were truly disappointed. It seemed dated, worn out and sad. We saw little in the way of unique artisans and each ""shop"" seemed to carry the same type of cheap touristy junk, little that was unique. It was crowded and not worth the time we took from other sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NursebakerToronto
40,Very Interesting,"Venice Beach, this is an adventure. This beach is dog friendly, so I brought my Black Lab as I was training her to become a Therapy dog. I thought that this would be a good place to get her used to loud noises and many people. I was right, however, I did not know where to look first. I was fasinated by all the people playing instruments and dancing on the sand. I loved that and wanted to join in. As you stroll along the walkway you notice people lined up selling all kinds of goods. However, the incense was a problem for me as I have allergys. Walk down a little further and lo and behold there are muscle men working out. Now that was extremely interesting. I really enjoyed my day at Venice Beach, it was interesting, different, exciting and I love the fact that it is pet friendly. In fact that alot of restraunts accommodate your pets. You sit outside on tables and as long as they dont run around and just lay under your table you can have them there. I enjoyed the music, the friendliness of the people, all the different sights and sounds that go with Venice Beach. I would certainly recommend visiting this beach, its different and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zenakitty1

50,Beaches,"I can't rate Venice because I never go to the boardwalk... Venice as well as All the South Bay beaches are hone , I look at them as a native not a touristGo in the fall .. The colors and smells are differentIf you aren't from there , you won't pick up on the subtle differences but they're there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avaerly
40,Joy from sunning and walking around,This place is one of the most popular scene in Los Angeles. Sometimes it is really overcrowded however this is must see place. I like to just walk around. On street you can see a lot of street artist which create incredible atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justandrej
50,A Great Cultural Experience!!,"My husband and I visited as a part of our trip to LA. I loved, loved, LOVED seeing so many artists, unique shops, and street performers in one place along the beach. The atmosphere is like nothing I have ever experienced before. My only regret is that we didn't allow ourselves enough time to spend there. We could have easily have spent an entire day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415crystalc
40,Get bikes,Venice was great with all of the vendors and people to see. Get a bike so you can ride up the bike path and make sure you get a lock as well because you will want to make stops. Travel up to Santa Monica on the path and hang out at the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408ChrisB
10,"Very dirty, felt unsafe","Was really shocked at Venice beach, everyone gives it a must see. We was on a day tour got off bus walked around and was back on the bus after 15 minutes. So dirty, lots of homeless people was really disappointed. Been there done that won't go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_fratus22
30,See all types of people,"Stopped by on a layover and spent a few hours visiting. Great place to people watch. Some crazy, some more normal. Fun to see a video shoot in progress and watch younger people skate boarding and palying basketball. I would keep a tight hold of your purse or wallet. Tons of panhandlers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/919AnneS
40,You need to see it but not too often,"Venice Beach is the land time forgot or a place to avoid depending on your take. Full of street people, both entertaining and annoying. Lots of tourists, energy and something thing for everyone. It's entertaining just to take a stroll and check out the total cast of characters. The Day of the Locusts in real time. It's a must see for tourists for sure and for locals once in awhile. It's also depressing to see so many homeless panhandling, sleeping on the ground and generally looking out of it. Perhaps its an indictment of us all to allow this show to be here at all. Make no mistake about it , it's a show of extremes. Make the visit here and make your own decision. I come here when my out of area friends want to see the "" Beach "". Not for those who want a quiet walk to see a beach in a tranquil spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
40,Afternoon on the promenade,"Great way to spend an afternoon, either hire cycles or just stroll along the beach. Great to sit and listen to the local bands playing music and bvery relaxing.... Beautiful sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynH57
50,A must see,"I visited Venice Beach with my husband and teenage son - an obsessed skater! After having read reviews on here I was a little worried that we would be be met by marauding pot heads and forced to partake - nothing could be further from the truth. People have referred to the over whelming smell, I didn't smell anything - yes there are the Green Doctors but if you go somewhere canabis is is legal what do you expect! For people watchers like me Venice Beach is amazing the variety of people you see is unparalleled. It is a little disappointing that most stalls have signs saying no pictures but if you take the time to talk to the stall holders you can see they have to make a living, offer a dollar or 2 and most will happily allow a photo. We watched the skateboarders on the park - the adults were good, the kids were brilliant (scary but brilliant!). We bought some fruit for a few dollars but didn't try any other food - most smelt good and the prices weren't bad. The public toilets were awful, but I usually have wet wipes and tissues with me so this wasn't too much of anissue. We saw no evidence I crime and apart from one drunk who swiftly departed when told to we weren't harassed. Overall Venice Beach is well worth a few hours of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caremc
40,Back in time!,We visited later in the evening after a day on Hollywood Blvd! It was nice to walk along the beach and then the little commercial area people watching! A bit of a throwback to my earlier life!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyW898
40,Worth a visit.,"Definitely lively and interesting. Great to see the Jim Morrison mural nearby. I don't think you need to spend more than 2 or 3 hours visiting, though. Glad to have visited....but going by other reviews, I'm glad I didn't need to use the public toilets!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavyW692
40,Doing Venice,"Venice Beach is without a doubt one of the craziest places on earth. Anything goes, and is going on all the time, night or day. It is a must stop when visiting Los Angeles if you have any fond memories of going to the circus as a kid. This is a circus like no other. I grew up in nearby Brentwood, Pacific Palisades, and raised my kids in Malibu and Manhattan, so I do not consider myself a tourist when there, but I have to say I do become one the minute I step onto the Venice boardwalk. The sights, the sounds, the smells....there are no words to describe the freaks in and amongst what appear to be normal folks in the crowd. And crowded it is. Hard to walk a straight line while dodging roller bladers, even though there is a bike lane for those with wheels.And speaking of bikes...that's a great thing to do...rent a bike and experience the whole shebang that way, stopping whenever there's something you wish to explore more. And there's plenty to explore!There are other parts of Venice, though, worth the trip as well. Main Street is a great shopping street and there is a parking lot behind it where incredible food trucks gather on Tuesdays and that is an experience in itself. Then there is Abbot Kinney Blvd...another fabulous street for off beat boutiques, furniture, great eateries, etc....a bit reminiscent of the old days of Melrose in the West Hollywood area.In the 60's the area was a bit depressed and many artists took over some of the historic spaces and turned them into their studios. Even Jim Morrison lived there in the abandoned Pacific Ocean Park! So Venice became a mecca for the happening artists of the time, and many still live there or maintain studios there. They are scattered all over the place in and around all the little winding streets off of Abbot Kinney or the walking lanes off Main Street. There is such an aura of history with all the old style beach bungalows...very charming and appealing if you have any hippieness left in you.Then there are the canals...which gave the town its name...really incredible to score one of those places to live! There are teeny homes next to mega mansions, some walled in for privacy, but smack up against the neighbors anyway. You can boat through the canal system, for a view of many of them...or just walk around, crossing the many bridges, and get lost. Such a unique place to live.I will always love Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilkmaidTS
50,walking along Venice Beach can give you visual whiplash...,"it's people-gawking to the max! Crowded stroll along storefronts made famous from 60s beach films and patience needed to browse the smaller shops. Impossible to get into a restaurant or bar that day but several food vendors, not very tasty and expensive but the shops weren't. Prices varied largely for the same item just a few stores away so walk around a little and do some serious gawking.The public restrooms were filthy, only 2 (a 3rd boarded up) and far between so prepare yourself. Once you navigate through the athletic zone of volleyball, skateboarders, cyclists, skaters, joggers, runners, weight lifters, rope climbers and hula-hoop fanatics, the beach itself wasn't crowded and had a much more relaxed vibe to enjoy a funky day in sunny LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeeheeInk
30,Very Colorful,"A lively bunch of characters - street performers, artists, bodybuilders, skateboarders, surfers, vendors - mixed with unique shops make this place a interesting place to visit. Definitely a great place to people watch. Beach was ok and restrooms were deplorable and should be avoided at all costs. Not a place to bring small children but a place to party for adults. OK for families during day but I won't visit at night. Exactly what we expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvdisney6
50,Great boardwalk,i rented some skates at santa monica and used the boardwalk to venice beach. Different one for walkers. There are really a lot of little shops at the boardwalk with shirts. There are also some musicians. Great view of the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelholic80
40,Venice Boardwalk is definitely not boring,"If you're in Los Angeles check out Venice Beach. It's a free place to walk along the Pacific, take in the ocean breeze, and see the freaks. People of all kinds are here--fishermen on the pier, surfers, beach bums (literally), tourists, shop owners, locals, entertainers of all types. It's a fun place to be. We were there on a First Friday and there were a lot of art events going on. Not sure about parking as we were staying with a friend who lives a few blocks away and we walked from his apartment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AudKat
30,Good beach,"The beach itself is, of course, what is to be expected in California. The shops along the beach are quite unique to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chessie22
50,Carpe diem!...as you imagine the party face of California,"Venice is known for its canals, its sandy three-mile beach and circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a pedestrian-only promenade that full of performers, fortune-tellers, artists, vendors of everything you can think of more stranger, instrumental musicians, singers, jugglers, acrobats, mimes, comics, magicians, prophets, psycologists. You will see people with tricolor hairdos, painted faces, weird tattoos, and outlandish clothing or lack of it. There even is a vendor of good ideas!There are courts for basketball, handball, shuffleboard and paddle tennis. Muscle Beach is a special area where fanatic bodybuilders pump iron in a public show of strength. There are many shops of medical marijuana where doctors prescribe you two doses, one to smoke there and one to take-out. People are happy and with no worries, as the Latin poet Horatio said: ""carpe diem et quam minimum credula postero"" (that means seize the day and think as little as possible to the future).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GdN80100
30,"In dire need of working, clean rest-rooms!! Please!!","The beach was nice enough but in dire need of working, clean rest-rooms. Of course, parking is always a hassle so we park the car 2 miles away, check out the galleries at Abbot Kinney and ride to the beach on bicycles. We ride on the bike-path all the way from Santa Monica, pass the canals for the views, to the Palisades.Cabo on the boardwalk has good tacos and Magaritas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells

40,Certainly different,"Great place to people watch, so many things happening. We didn't have much time to see too much, but it certainly had a lot of entertainment happening and lots of stalls. It is the first time I have seen a place you can buy pot for medical purposes!!If you are in the area, it is worth going just for the experience.Parking is a bit of a problem, there are some spots that are free for one hour, but getting one is up to timing it just right, otherwise, the parking spots are about $10 close by. If you are prepared to walk a few blocks, you can find free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMLE

40,Fun place to people watch,"We started out at the pier and worked our way south, watching the variety of people along the way. The beaches were very clean, surprisingly so with all the people. You can rent just about any form of conveyance (not sure of the price though). A little further south are more shops along the walkway but they were really just tourist traps. We rested at the gym/tennis/basketball courts and that is where we really enjoyed the people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyW626
50,Great for the Odd and Unusual,"I actually love this place, it is a throwback to a time and place that used to be. It is odd, it is different, and it isn't so much for the prim and proper. You will be asked numerous times to buy music, see a doctor for medical pot, donate to a cause here, or a cause there, but a simple no thank you will be respected. You can also find ample art work from various folks that is unique and different, and some quite good. It is also possible to see The Freak Show, (a real television show on the beach and it is fairly priced and well worth seeing.) This has to be one of the top people watching locations in the world and while some won't like it, for those that do, they will also love it. I love the oddities and everything else about this place, but I guess I am weird like that, one of my favorite places to visit. Not so much for the kiddies, but a great place to see the very different of America. While at times sad, it is also refreshing to see many of those working to make a living whether from playing their guitars or making some type of art work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikefurches
30,Very crowded,"We drove around for a while until we found a free parking spot a few blocks from the beach, where parking was $10. We only wanted a short walk on the boardwalk which was very busy.

We went to Venice Beach during our tour with LA City Tour. It's a pretty cool beach and a great spot to shoot some hoops, run and do a bit of a workout.I reckon you wouldn't want to hang out there at night though. It looks kinda dodgy to me and it would be a little freaky at night.There are shops and places to get some food and drinks and it's a touristy place as well. My mate was over the moon and he kept crapping on about how this place was once the home gym of arnold schwarzenegger..

30,Must see to experience the famous skate park and Muscle Beach,"The area still has the funky artist vibe, but despite what some other reviewers had to say, we felt safe and fine checking it out with our children. The kids thought the skate park and muscle beach were awesome and got a big kick out of the self proclaimed governor riding around on his bike entertaining everyone. Out of all of our stops on our tour, this one probably had the least expensive nice souvenir tees for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutha2s
20,Very depressing,"This area is not worth going to. Lots of people on the streets looking for handouts, smoking pot, not a place I would bring kids to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationlady1
10,Unimpressive,We walked from Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach and it was very unimpressive as the stalls were like op shops gone wrong and it was not a friendly area.Would not waste your time and effort to commute here!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneen856
40,Funky,We went to Venice Beach as part of a car tour; so we were able to enjoy the view; lots of interesting buildings and canals; a very different vibe; I think that we felt much more comfortable not getting out and walking around as there were some very unusual looking people there as we are from a small town not quite what we are used to;,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996KateG996
30,Only rate as Ok.,"Walked from Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach, walk was good but if you want to buy stuff it is just like a market where every 2nd store has the same product. Good people watching and very busy. If staying in Hollywood catch a Taxi and not buses as it is very time consuming. Taxi from Venice beach to Hollywood was $50 but I made sure I asked for the maximum it would cost before I entered cab, it cost $46... but lots better than catching the public transport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewM742
20,"If you like feeling depressed, go to Venice!","Oh my god. It's like I was warped into a bad dream. It is literally impossible to enjoy yourself AT ALL when every 5 steps you take someone is panhandling you. The worst was the guy with the headphones and the demo CD. Sure, I get it. You are a starving artist trying to get people to buy your music. I'm sure you love it, buddy. But literally, every 100 feet, there was someone else with a walkman trying to hustle you for a few bucks.Other than that, there is a fair amount of weirdo circus people there. Mostly trying to find a niche to use to justify their means to make a living off of your tips. Perhaps the most depressing was the homeless kids and their dogs.The scenery isn't even something you notice when there is all of that stuff happening. I literally had anxiety the entire time we were there because of being approached for my money on several occasions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xcraftykittenx
30,It was okay,A little too crowded when we went there so we just sat in the sand and watched the sunset! The rides are simple. It is the beach that we loved!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLF16
10,very disappointed,"we were there on labor day (public holiday in usa) .. we walked from santa monica toi venice beach .. i thought it would be a pleasant walk, but it's bare and boring and never ends ! i thought it would be lined with pretty cafés and souvenir shops but there was nothing .. the odd wooden hut selling a can of coke ..finally u arrive at venice beach .. i'm still young at heart and was travelling with a young adult and we were both horrified .. it's dirty, packed with people, u passively smoke pot as u walk and there are tons of wannabe artists (u will occasionally find a good one) .. as our hotel told us .. not a place to go after dark .. tons of families with strollers and small kids, but there is nothing there for toddlers !i also wanted to see muscle beach .. it's tiny .. what a disappointment ..the odd public toilet we saw along the way had a wait of 15-20 people ..so - been there, done that - not going back any time soon ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggof61
50,You have to come here for the experience!,"Ok, I've seen the other people here talking about the weirdos, homeless, drug addicts, etc. That is true but I still enjoyed coming here just to look at everyone as there are people from all walks of life strolling on this beach front. We were there for about 2 hours and were told that every Sunday they have a ""drum circle"" where large crowds gather together on the beach for drums playing, dancing etc. We saw all the people gathered on the beach yesterday & thought it might have been a wedding ceremony; ha. On the beach sidewalk (where you can stroll); you have artists performing acts, you have craftsmen selling their art, you have body builders lifting weights and showing off their ripped bodies, & I enjoyed seeing all of this. If you are stuck up & pretentious, do NOT come here as you won't like it. However, if you're cool, don't mind seeing some weirdos, can handle smelling all the incense, then check it out! My husband and I ate at the Sidewalk cafe which served good food. I had the chinese chicken salad & he had a turkey sandwich. We both had iced tea & our bill was $33.00 which was decent. Also, we were able to find street parking for free as we drove around until we found a space. Otherwise, I saw signs for $15.00 to park which I wouldn't pay :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaram780
40,Has to be done.,"A definite must for anyone's ""to do"" list.It is such a laid back, hippified kind of place, but is still modern if you want it to be, and has some superb architecture, food, and hotels to see. You have to rollerblade, segway or rent a chopper - if you don't do this, you will be too tired to see all of it. You can also see SnapChat's offices, the offices of The Chive, and pick up some good bargains.The street performers are good fun and you will enjoy their showmanship, unless you are a miserable so and so.Venice Beach Skate Park is famous and you have to watch the guys there, which can be mesmerising!The beach itself is clean, and has beautifully coloured hot sand. Perfect for chilling on if you want to get away from the hubbub of the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarryS288
10,So disappointed,"When you see this on the TV you see modern area with nice people and no down and out""s. Sorry it's loads of down and out's, lot's of people selling rubbish along the beach ($5 for a Blue stone) really why would you.The area looks tired, in need of some money spent on the place. Do away with the drug scene, and return the Gym area. Restrooms were so bad just couldn't go in.Sorry just not got it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt656
10,"So, so tacky and horrible.","You see Venice beach in the movies and it looks very glamorous. However, the reality is quite different. It was tacky, noisy, cheap and generally nasty. Avoid it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rick61
30,Like a set out of Star Wars,This place has the biggest gathering of weirdos I have ever seen !!!! This place is a good example of why not to legalise weed!! These people are not chilled they are disfunctional.The area is a filthy dump and the district ought to be embarrassed. Full of homeless people sleeping at the beach and smoking weed. The sights of people were an eye opener. At times felt a little unsafe.I was keen to see muscle beach but even this was under welming. A let down!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowleyal
10,Grotty and seedy,"Think of old-school Amsterdam, add in a little Camden Market, and cross that with present-day Blackpool. There you have Venice Beach, where the air is thick with marijuana smoke, shifty-looking people will eye you up at every corner, and streetside performers and hustlers will try and milk you for all your lovely tourist money as you walk past all the run-down buildings.Venice Beach clearly tries to market itself as ""arty"" and ""vintage"" but really it's just a shabby student house turned into a couple of miles of beach. If you're looking for a nice beach to chill out on and look at the Pacific, head a couple of miles further south to Manhattan Beach instead. It's an affluent area full of unique shops and amazing seafood and a quiet, well-policed beach to die for, with cheap parking right on the beachfront.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scruff_UK
40,Interesting,"It was one of the more interesting stops on our visit. The shows put on by different performers were fun to watch. It's a great place to spend the day - always something to do and see. 'Muscle Beach' was underwhelming, just a couple of guys working out and one buffed up old man lifting weights, not at all what I thought it would be.The beach was really nice, but a little creepy to stumble on people sleeping around there. Made us a little cautious to leave our stuff and go in for a dip. There are a lot of stores and food vendors to try. Took most of our day there to see it all so be sure to plan to leave a chunk of time from your trip to visit - especially if you're going to visit the pot shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fourteenth

40,It's Interesting!,"So, Venice Beach is the home of all walks of life...international visitors, drug dealers, performers, muscle beachers (tanned guys wearing little to nothing), families playing in the sand and water, cheap keepsakes, legal marijuana stores, interesting food and a pretty ocean. One son played basketball in a pickup game; I read and relaxed and hung out on the beach.There are public beach bathrooms but they aren't great- not clean and a little stinky. Felt the need to find a real, clean bathroom upon leaving.Did pay to park right at the beach/ocean. Can't remember the cost but it was reasonable. Never felt unsafe although we were approached by a musician hawking CDs.Fun for a short day's visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happymallqueen
30,Everything goes here,"Venice Beach is a chill place and also a shabby place where everything goes, from selling pot over freak shows, Muscle beach from the typical shack shops to rapping dudes, Rastas, R&B. Everything goes here!The beach is really nice.My impression that it was very atipical to the rest of of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pasqua68
20,Not what we expected,"We had a different idea of what Venice Beach would look like and to our surprise the real thing couldn't have been further from our perceptions. This was the first stop on a tour we were on and we arrived there about 10am-ish to find not much happening, was basically the people on the tour there and that's it. We ventured onto the 'boardwalk' to find loads of interesting characters, graffitied shop fronts, strange smells and a very neglected and run down looking muscle beach. It is what it is and we are thankful for having visited the area and it all might be very different once there is more foot traffic there at a later time but at that time of morning 20-30mins was more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136AndreaS
50,"Shabby looking, but well worth a visit","We didn't stay very long here, but definitely well worth a visit. On the surface, it does seem quite shabby looking and run down. However, there are some good eateries and very talented people roaming about and selling things. We bought some very original and impressive skater art from a local.Would definitely recommend spending half a day here or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soph_ee_london
40,unique experience,"The boardwalk had so many types of people it was hard to know where to focus my attention! Loads of little shops, street performers, and did I mention interesting people... make sure to check out the skate park, we saw some incredible skaters :) fun way to spend a day if you are not easily offended! (might raise many questions- if you take kids be prepared!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/little_rigger
50,A paradise,"It's a place where you feel as in a movie. You walk near the Ocean or better near the beach and you begin to dream about ""Bay watch"", the atmosphere you breath there is great, you feel free, you see a lot of great unknown artists who sing, dance, make sand scuptures and much more. Going direction Marina del Rey you see the canals of Venice with so marvellous houses. If you go to Los Angeles, don't miss Venice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxyG1
30,Wonder why it's so famous,"I've been to quite a number of beaches and this is not one of the nicer ones. The beach itself is wide with fine sand, but the boardwalk is quite run down and trashy. Probably interesting for young partying crowd.Definitely not a must see on a visit to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael-Traveller-JP
40,Nice beach full of life.,"Nice beach to spend your day. However, a strange lot of people seem to hang out here and make it seem a little intimidating. Not sure why this is. Beach however itself is very sandy, and overall clean. Water is so blue and nice for a long walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/211erict
30,A Different Slice of Life,"It isn't just the 60's hippies that end up here, it's all kind of others who prefer a different life style. And we end up going there to watch them as they figure out ways to hit us up for some money. Clearly there are many people here who don't fit normal stereotypes and some seem to have been here for a long time. We were nervous about some of the food, but the popcorn seemed like a safe bet and was fine. We didn't feel unsafe or intimidated at all, although the bike, skateboards and some roller skaters were all around us.Just north of Muscle Beach (which is marked on Apple maps) is a large V and beside it is a roller skate pad which is interesting, and also a skateboard park. The riders in it are worth watching. Because there are so many and so much is going on, you need to get a spot at one of the rails, pick a rider and watch him (we didn't see any girls on our visit -- perhaps caution over valour) go though the course they pick, sometimes horizontally in the bowls. They are amazing. We saw one who did apparently hurt himself, as he limped away.P.S. Public washrooms are beyond description so go before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YongeEgTripper
50,Quirky shopping and people watching at Venice Beach!,"I did not know what to expect when visiting Venice Beach, but it was the coolest place I think I have ever been to! There were so many different shops, stands, markets & eateries that it was hard to decide where to go. If you like walking, browsing/shopping, eating, people watching, this is the place for you. Loved it all and you can take long walks on the strand all the way down to Santa Monica Pier and back. I'm ready to go back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancy217

40,Nice beach,"Very nice beach with beatifult views. The sand is very soft and comfortable to walk on, can be bit hot during summer though :)The beach is long and very wide so there's plenty of space even though it's a crowdy day. It's very convenient that there are so many stores, cafés and restaurants nearby since you don't need to think about bringing your own food if you don't want to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joky80

20,Ho Hum,"I don't understand why this place is so popular. Having heard quite a lot about it, I thought it would be worth a visit. Wrong. The place looks run down, tired, sad and dilipitated. The stalls are uninteresting, the people bizarre and the overall atmosphere is unpleasant. If you have come this far, keep walking towards Santa Monica and you will much prefer it there. Even the so-called Muscle Beach looked like it had sand kicked in it's face.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zodiac6573
30,Not what I expected,If you are in the area you have to go to Venice beach. If you are English it reminds me of Blackpool promenade. Busy and lots of cheap souvenirs. Muscle Beach is worth looking at but is now at bit past its prime. Lots of skateboarders and places to get marijuana prescriptions. I think it will always be a busy place and dont dress up as it is a bit down market. The toilets were really not pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jl502
50,"The good, the bad & the ugly","While not for the faint of heart, Venice beach is a fascinating, one of a kind place to visit. The beach itself is beautiful, and the people who spend time there range from the ordinary to the bizarre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billp768
40,Not bad,"Great bargain shopping, pretty lay back, great entertainment along the beach to watch. Fine to walk along with young kids they get a blast everyone scooting past or watching the entertainment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blewbay
20,Venice...Muscle Beach,"My husband was interested in seeing THE Muscle Beach while in California. Even though it was a weekday, the boardwalk was reasonably crowded. We walked quite a distance to get to Muscle Beach. I found the area to be quite trashy, not in litter but in clientele. Several men were attempting to seduce young ladies as they walked by. ""Medical"" workers were advertising their low cost medical marijuana permits to anyone and everyone. This was in the middle of the day; I wouldn't want to be there at night! We stopped for a bit to watch the weight lifters at Muscle Beach. It was interesting that the well-equipped workout facility was in the middle of such a classless area. I'm glad we went for my husband's sake, but the rings, balance beams, etc. at Santa Monica Beach is much more worthy of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blabink
40,"Beautiful, almost perfect beach","Although Venice Beach is probably better known for its rather eclectic denizens, who are indeed interesting and colorful, the beach itself is a Southern California gem! A huge, wide expanse of soft sand and gentle waves (when we were there that is; maybe it's different when a storm is coming). Great place to sunbathe, paddle, and swim (if you don't mind cold water). No seashells though. Not sure why. Parking near the beach is only $9 (it's more a block or two away!) and if you arrive early, you will probably find a spot with no trouble (on a weekday; can't vouch for the weekend).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRANDDADGREENGO
40,Nice but very busy,"We briefly visited the beach when we were in Los Angeles. The beaches are certainly nice and there is a nice atmosphere with many different activities along the beach, but personally I would prefer a quieter place with more nature. If you want to be surrounded by many people then this is your place, but if you like a quieter place, than visiting one of the beaches further outside LA would be a better choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thijsmm
50,Awesome,First time here and I love it. Will definitely return. Great for people watching. Beach is fantastic. Lots of surfers. Cool shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/true443
40,Definitely go,"OK, perhaps as a beach it is only a three, but as an experience it is better as a four. You really should go. Forget the beach, there are many much better cleaner more attractive beaches north and south, just go for the array of weirdness. It is different here than Hollywood and though definitely weird it is still safe to wander around. Plan on spending a full afternoon, buy a couple beers sit and people watch - don't just stroll you will miss a lot doing that. Open your mind, enjoy a slice of California that is not the beautiful people, though some of them will certainly be on parade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twistoffcap
50,Love this area!,"This review is not for the beach itself, but for Venice Beach area. I stayed for a few nights at a beautiful studio (booked from Airbnb) just a few walks away from the Venice Canals. This area is beautiful. Very quiet at day and night. Don't forget to visit the Farmers Market every Friday. Cute houses to see when you take a walk around the area. Abbot Kinney is a must - lots of fashion & interior shops, healthy and unhealthy (but delicious) food and properly made coffee! Very close to Santa Monica, downtown LA, and LAX. If I ever go back to LA, I would definitely stick to Venice Beach for accomodation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicloe09
40,Hipster- cool vibe,"Went to Venice Beach on July 4th with two of my friends and watched the fireworks here. Seems to be an area that attracts hipsters. Cool vibe.Skateboarders all around- the shops play loud music and sell urban clothing. Some of the shops were a bit pricey for the quality, but that is to be expected at any beach location I suppose. The beach is lined with beautiful beach houses.Cool place- especially for the younger crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDiary
40,Fun and Interesting,"Just spent a few days there.. Aug 3/4. .Reading some of these reviews I suggest some of you people get out more and stop judging..great people watching, some interesting characters, always enjoying seeing more of what this world has to offer the the people that inhabit it.. yes the shops are old, worn tourist traps with the same trinkets and tee shirts.. but if you stop, look and listen with open eyes maybe you could expand your horizons a bit or think about what is the reality of this ""American Dream"" we are fed..loved the vib.. far better than the crass commercialism of Hollywood blvd..the food in the 2 boardwalk cafes we ate at was excellent..never felt unsafe.. every place it what you make it.. we love travel and embrace the differences rather then turn are nose up at them... will come back..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaLovesAdventure

40,A must for skateboarders!,"Whether you enjoy Venice Beach or not really depends on your tastes and interests. My 17 year old son loved it (being a skateboarder and festival goer) my 15 year old daughter didn't enjoy it at all. It's great for people watching as there are some very interesting characters there...the rollerskating, OAP guitarist, the semi-naked guy with a snake around his neck, the bearded woman, the octogenarian body builder at Muscle Beach...to name but a few. As others have mentioned there are quite a few homeless people but they weren't threatening and when we were approached by some young guys selling CDs they accepted us turning them down, no problem.The skateboarding was great and there were some pro-skaters there when we visited so watching the skateboarding was good too. Having said that the skaters were of all ages and abilities and the atmosphere was fabulous.The 'shops' and stalls weren't anything special...far too many hand painted Bob Marley/Jim Morrisson bits of tat. Oh and several 'green doctors' offering to cure your aches and pains with their medical marijuana.If you go park to the north of the beach away from the shops. The public car park cost $10 as opposed to the private ones behind the shops which charged £30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trago
30,Interesting beach!,"We went to Venice Beach in the morning when it was still cloudy and chilly. There were still lots of people around, vendors, skateboarders, etc. This is definitely not a beach I would spend more than an hour at. It's worth a quick trip if you are within walking distance just to experience the crazy atmosphere, but I wouldn't go at night or pay to park. Head to another area for a better beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaF752
40,We went for The Freakshow!,"We were making the trip to LA for my son's 13th birthday, and definitely had to visit the Venice Beach Freakshow. After watching all the episodes on TV, we wanted to see it in person. Venice Beach is a ""hippie-heaven."" Lots of flea market shops, medical marijuana shops, and lots of homeless people. Many of the hobos have come up with performances to try to make some money. Some of them are very entertaining. Beware though, if you stop walking long enough, you may get pick-pocketed. The Freakshow was so much fun, and we got to take pictures with the performers. However, not all of the freaks are there every day, like on TV. We met Asia and Morgue, who are there every day. Todd Ray, the owner, stands outside and greets customers with that carnival-type schtick. The show is $5 to get in. Well worth the visit, and will definitely go back next time we are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirll_13

40,Venice Beach,"I visited Venice Beach for the first time. I was shocked to learn that you have to pay to park $20! Well, you better bring plenty of food and a change of clothes to get your money's worth.There are the craziness of entertainment to be seen but not to overwhelming.Bring warm clothes because it will get cold. I wish i had known. I would have left my bikini at home for my 2pm trip in August.I miss the free beaches like padre island, Miami and Daytona beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoWBe

20,Not what I expected...,"As I approached Venice Beach from Santa Monica I asked a local couple a question, and they told me that I'd see everything I needed to see of VB within 2mins. I walked for about 30mins and they were right. It didn't get any better. Most of the people looked like they should have been locked up.I was too busy focusing on my personal safety, that I didn't really see the beach. (In hindsight, the area was safe. I was just a little apprehensive at the time)Rather than walking all the way back to SM, I ventured into the streets behind the beach to catch the Hop On Hop Off bus, however after 10mins I failed to find the bus stop, and felt this area was worse than the beach, so I went back to the beach, and walked back up the coast walk to SM.I'm glad I saw it, yet it was a waste of time which I could have spent elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sawnbay
30,Bohemian and funky,"Quite a hippy district, but fun to walk along the long beach strip. Lots of typical seafront type shops and you do get interrupted a lot by street sellers (mainly guys getting you to buy their music). Some good street artists and worth a stop for an hour or two. The surrounding area appears to be a relatively poor sub-district of LA so I would recommend going during the day time.The water is clean and a bit fresh - not many people swimming but a few ankle-waders!!!Parking is $9 all day which isn't too bad and lots of restrooms along the front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RooActon
20,Whats the attraction ?,"Go to Santa Monica .Its just down the beach .This strip is a poor excuse for an attraction .Aside from enumerable facilities offering to set you up with a medical weed card there is nothing to see.The schlock that is being offered by "" artists "" along the beach is nothing more than tripe .The closer it got to sun down the more nervous the tourists got .There were vagrants EVERYWHERE .These guys were not simply sitting on their duffs watching the world go by .The clouds of thick dope smoke were everywhere .Runners were moving up and down the strip on bikes moving product between the suppliers and end users .Their were clusters of unsavory people everywhere .It really was a place best left to those who live there .Those passed out on the pathways ,sand and grass .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19

50,What a hoot!,"Venice is always guaranteed to be sensory overload, but it excelled itself his time. Walked in on a Hare Krishna parade that was being heckled by what could only be described as a crowd of placard waving ""nasty bastards for God"" so called Christian zealots. These were big, mean and ugly types complete with minders. It is good to know that the spirit of egalitarianism is alive and well in LA and that almost 100% of the bystanders were on the side of the gentle face painted people.

20,A post-apocaliptic nightmare,"Im a very tolerant and liberal minded person as it relates to acceptance of my fellow human beings, BUT I do not take pleasure in watching people that are homeless...addicted to drugs...mentally unstable...and criminal minded. Nor do I take pleasure in walking, sitting or eating in filth. Venice Beach is reminiscent of a post-apocaliptic nightmare. Yes there are street performers that woo in crowds as they perform their talents against the back drop of the ocean...but there are even more people on the boardwalk in need of counseling and medical attention. There is nothing hip or exciting about seeing so many people in despair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReservoirDog

What all the reviewers prior had said its true!I love the crazy looking people from all walks of life, the vendors and the food. Even the segalls and pigeons are fun to watch as they scramble for food.The beach is wide and open. The bathrooms are digusting. The boardwalk is filthy and there's a LAPD substation on-site.What else do you need?Seriously, Venice beach is totally safe with plenty of LAPD patrols. There is nothing really to do after the sun sets but it is definitely worthwhile to visit.Eat some great unhealthy food, laugh at the crazy people and buy a souvenir or two.Have fun and remember parking is way cheaper the more east you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bohalltrips
50,Busy Beach,"Such a unique place. The actual beach is pretty nice, usually somewhat crowded. Most people come for the boardwalk. There are a lot of unique vendors, street performers, a graffiti art wall, a skate park, a kiddy playground and amazing alternative culture. There is a pier as well, where many fish and some just stroll about. The bathrooms seem to always have long lines and they are pretty horrible. Parking is usually $20, from private lots a few blocks from the beach. There is parking at the beach, but you need to come early to get a spot. Though the walk to the beach is pretty interesting as well as Venice also has the same alternative culture with hostels and unique shops.You can also walk to Santa Monica Pier, though it is a bit of a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utopianidealist

Don't waste your time at Venice Beach unless you are casting a remake of Desperately Seeking Susan (a B movie starring [sic] Madonna and a degenerate group of characters). The area reeks of urine, and at least five clinics tried to diagnose my glaucoma so I could buy their pot. The dirty stoners and the begging (and also high) homeless people were pathetic and more than faintly scary even at 10 a.m. When I am on vacation, I don't want to rub shoulders with people who have not washed their hair or nether regions in the last year or more.

We went there on a Sunday night around 8:30ish and there were some messed up people and crazies everywhere. We got harassed by a man as we parked the car who refused to leave us alone when we didn't give him any money. We literally got out of the car after find rockstar parking by the main entrance, walked down to the sidewalk that parallel the beach and turned back around to get back to the car.

40,Can be really cool or really grungy,This beach is very eclectic and artsy. It attracts all types of people. Alot of the vendors here are icons cuz they been there so long. Same for performers.I wouldn't recommend getting in the water here. I say go more south to Manhattan or hermosa. Since this place tends to attract more people beach can get busy. And parking is a nightmare. The boardwalk is cool for just strolling along. I've rented bikes and gone to santa monica.I would say Venice is like Santa Monica's little artsy brother who just can't get it together.It's a fun place. The Venice ale house is a local favorite.

The Caroll Canal St. Area is actually crisscrossed with canals and dotted with lovely homes. To visit Venice Beach, one should start at the Muscle Beach end of Venice Beach... Plenty of Street parking and all the ""wonders"" of Venice Beach-- roller bladers, bikers, tattoe shops, souvenir stores, sidewalk arts and craftsmen, rasta types, sweaty muscle bound wonders, derelicts, overpriced food and drink concentrate at this section of Venice Beach. If up to it, one can walk along the shoreline or the boardwalk all the way to Santa Monica for a more kid friendly beachy place.Venice beach is really a place roller blading and for gawking at its exhibitionistic denizens.

30,Do You REALLY Want To Go Here?,"I'll assume that if you're reading this you are planning a few days' sightseeing in LA. I've lived in Santa Monica for 17 years. If Venice Beach is on your itinerary, here is what to expect.The ""boardwalk"" (car-free street, really) running along the beachfront is always crowded with (1) tourists and (2) an incredible assortment of crazies and lowlifes who would be more than happy to separate you from your money, legally or otherwise. Sure, it's a ""scene"" you can tell your friends about when you get home, but if you want to enjoy the Southern California beaches and avoid the grunge, go to Manhattan Beach (where there are families, surfers and pretty girls playing volleyball) or the Santa Monica Pier (where the beach is beautiful and you can go inland to Main Street or the 3rd Street Promenade.) The only place in Venice that I would recommend you explore is Abbott Kinney Blvd., which starts 3 blocks inland at Brooks and slants away from the shoreline. Great shops and restaurants. And much better people watching, unless you like to look at the kind of kooks that hang out in Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandFF

Parking prices are about $6.00 to $15.00. Be prepared for lots of walking, although there are many places for you to rent a bike.

If you like people watching you may enjoy it.If you head over to Abbott Kinney you will find pricey restaurants and shops. The best place is walking around the Venice Canals where there are some very fun homes to look at. Not a great place to take the kids though. Venice is more of an adult place and at that I would have other plans when you get tired of the freaks. Go early since the parking is not the best. 3rd Street Promenade is not far away when you escape from Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bohemian63

The shops are ultra-expensive for clothes and beach items, but that is not unusual for a beach city. Counterculture element is very present, due to the medical marijuana clinics. I do like watching the buff guys work out at the outdoor gym. For a clean and safe beach, I prefer Santa Monica State Beach, which is just a short walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evep469

We stroll, people watch, stop for smoothies and then watch the skate park for awhile. Sometimes we eat at the Sidewalk Cafe, which is excellent. Sure if you are uptight, weed smoke and homeless people offend you, by all means avoid this place. There is the most interesting mix of people: hippies, punks, young, old, crazy, beautiful etc etc but not for kids to me would be blantent sexual activity, open gratuitous drug use (other then weed) and anything else purely adult. Venice is not that. It's tourists and open minded people with a sprinkle of edginess. It's funny the people on Abbot Kinney look so bored! To each his own, but I recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyDyz
40,"If people watching is your favorite pastime, come on down","We spent a day at Venice beach during my recent trip to Los Angeles and I could literally stay all day to watch the various walks of life. It is never-ending. You will see just about everything there. The day we went was sunny and the ocean water felt nice on my legs. I enjoyed a funnel cake and watched the guys at Muscle Beach for a little while. Then I watched the basketball games, the kids at the skate park doing tricks, the boardwalk vendors, the street performers. For me, it was nice to just stroll along and take in all the sites. Yes, the bathrooms are hit or miss, but I've come to expect that of any public restroom. I just assume it's going to be kind of gross because millions of people use it a day and everyone doesn't have the same hygiene standards. If I had young kids, I probably wouldn't want them to use the bathrooms there. As an adult, though, you can manage it. Maybe just have a pack of tissues with you so you don't have to rely on toilet paper being there. And bring some Purell and wet wipes for your hands.

Our trouble was in locating it again after swimming or shopping! Even marking landmarks didn't help much! But we aren't used to such a large beach, either.The surf was enough to knock us off our feet at times, but not high enough to worry this landlubber mama, but my 3 kids who were in the water are strong swimmers. The beach has a very gradual slope out into the water and doesn't have a close sudden dropoff like a lot of CA beaches north of LA so the waves roll in.The sand is soft and pretty clean.The bathrooms and showers were yucky, and always had long lines.Parking was atrocious because of the holiday, but we still found a spot 2 blocks away.Definitely stroll through the shopping and Muscle Beach.

30,DISSAPOINTING,"Comparing Venice Beach with Mediteranean blue sea where my Island is and Fig Tree Bay which is one of the 10 best golden sundy beaches in the world, i have to say that i was dissapointed a lot.Maybe if i was youger would like the activities there, but gererally is not a place that i want to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AthinaT_13
30,Somewhat disappointed,"Definitely eye opening, people from all walks of life. The morning we were there was foggy so maybe we did not experience Venice beach at its best. My first impressions was it was dirty and unkept. There were souvenir shops, street artists, clothing, jewellery, food etcThere were loads of bike rental places at reasonable prices which would be a great way to see the sights as they have a designated bike path which goes for miles, and would be safe to use by all ages. There is a big skate bowl on the edge of the beach, fun to watch for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandras23
50,A must visit when in LA,"A walk or ride on the boardwalk is a must when in LA...Venice beach is so entertaining and fun....great artwork available, tshirts, jewelry and the best people watching anywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazygirl708
50,Crazy But FUN!,"We have been a lot of places on our travels and seen a lot of crazy people and crazy things, but this place tops them all! Rent a bike and just ride and enjoy the sights! Greatest people watching place, period! A must see for everybody!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimbosold1
30,too many crazy people,"it was a very eye opening experience , a lot of ""crazy"" peopleit kinda reminded my partner of bali , if you want wee d venice beach is the palce for you , all in all its an expperience you have to take in there is a lot of good street artists and generally a lot of people it is just dirty and intimidating .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremyusa13
40,Crazy Boardwalk not for faint of heart,"Very cool place to take a stroll through. Liked it better 20 years ago when i was 20 years younger. Plenty of dodgy folks, panhandlers, scammers and freaks. Interesting and diverse. Liked watching paddle tennis and the skate park. Yes there was weed there both illegal and medical. Probably not for young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSouliere
40,The grand parade of humanity,"This probably isn't the attraction to visit if you're with kids, or have hangups about hippies, weird people, or pot. Otherwise, it's a must-see. Interesting people selling their art and even performing along the boardwalk in some cases. A free skate park where you can hang out and watch young and old practice their tricks and show off. A neat little ""allowed graffiti"" art area, and endless shops up and down the boardwalk. It's ok, the people are weird, but don't be afraid, they won't bite (probably).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benoc617
40,Beach with lot of activities,We parked on the beach parking lot located near 2100 Ocean Front Walk. This is ideal cos its centrally located and you will things to do in any direction you go from there! The beach is great with many things to do and we were able to do only 20-25% of what I wanted to do within time limitations.the water was pretty clean! The cops were just about everywhere so it was pretty secured. Perhaps it was an extra busy day as it was the Independence Day... But the lines at ALL the restrooms were toooo long probably cos they are all unisex!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TejasMehta
20,Interesting,"I went last summer and took my pre teen boys, not very smart. A lot of drugs and not so savory people, the sunset was beautiful and my boys loved the skate park there was even a famous skater doing tricks, that was neat to watch. We ate at a little place on the main strip, waitress was rude and so were some of the other patrons. As we left it was just getting dark and honestly I was scared, it was me and my 2 boys and men were shouting explicit remarks at me, could not get out quick enough and wont be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefanib154
30,Fun place but..,"This place should be awesome if you are single, childless and looking for some funny stories, definitely not for families with young kids. The place is full of colors, street artists, and guys dressed in green offering marihuana. The shopping there is good for souvenirs, for funny clothing and it is a nice walk to walk from there to Santa Monica, I had to admit though, that I did not feel safe due to the big number of homeless people and junkies, besides this part, it is fun to walk through Muscle beach and see all this guys working out, go to the pier and read all those beautiful quotes related to the ocean, and just enjoy the sound of the ocean, big waves if you like surfing and there are some people fishing too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabhoff
20,Poor!,This beach has over priced parking and not a lot of nice shops or anything. Kids did not really enjoy it. I would not recommend this beach for kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zonie0531
40,You have to come at least once,"I was recently visiting friends in CA and on their suggestion, arranged to meet and stay in Venice Beach. I'd been there about ten years ago and I've given it a 4 Star ""Very Good"" rating as although it can be a side show, what with all the street performers, artists and God knows who else, its a very special unique place to come to and experience. In fact throughout my extensive travels not only in the US but Worldwide I don't know if there is anywhere else like Venice Beach.Last time I was here we came with our kids, recently I was on my own and to be honest I was quite happy that that was the case. It was Memorial Day Weekend and the sidewalks were absolutely packed, not really the place for a five year old to be wondering about.It is though a unique experience to visit, and if you enjoy people watching, go and sit in one of the many bars that line the Broadwalk and watch the world go by. I spent a few hours wondering around before we ate at a nearby restaurant and even me from what I thought was a ""liberal"" and ""swinging"" London England, even I was amazed with what I saw there. Since I was last there they have these legalized Grass evaluations...not that I went in, promise, but if that's your bag.....Go and see Muscle Beach and the Skatepark all of which are a walk along the Broadwalk. Again you'll be amazed at the characters. One of the sights that will stick in my mind was an older gentlemen, most likely in his late 70's dressed in very very tight shorts and a cut off T-Shirt, dancing to Rap music in the ""Drum Circle"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rinkydinkpinkpanther
40,Cool place!,"I had an awesome time at Venice Beach. I'd walked along the beach from Santa Monica and it was so pretty. There's some great photo oppourtunities, and Venice is completely different to Santa Monica! Venice is pretty alternative, lots and lots of skaters, stoners etc etc. It's fun to see though. I had a $5 massage from a Chinese man on the beach front, it was good, but it was so strong! Watch out of the crazy guy wearing just Y Fronts stood on a stool with fake snakes because if you try and take his photo he goes a bit mental. It's def worth seeing though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah_11e
10,"Dirty, dodgy, disgusting!","I had great expectations of Venice beach but no idea what to expect. What I did not expect to see was filth. Are the people in charge too high to see how dirty it is? There is litter strewn everywhere and the walkway is so dirty I spent the whole time looking at the floor dodging filth, which was probably a good thing because the few times I looked up the sight was no better. Most of the shops are just as filthy. And the people??? Not a place for children and the few families we saw with kids were horrified and couldn't get their kids out of there fast enough. I needed a restroom but opted for a bladder infection instead.On a positive note, the skatepark was clean and entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeroBrisbane
40,Much more lax area than the rest of LA,"Venice Beach is a place where the younger crowd seems to congregate. Lots of suffers and artists that you’ll find along the boardwalk. It’s a little more free spirited than some people are used to. Don’t let it frighten you, as most people may look weird but are very friendly. There is a pretty basic pier at Venice beach which is really good for fishing. We’ve caught Mackeral and Guitarfish, and seen people pull some pretty good size sharks out of there. If you are looking for a less crowded beach or a less crowded pier than say Santa Monica or Malibu, this place is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanKelly
40,"Sights, Shopping, & Sea","We rented a vacation condo thru VRBO.com right on the beach 1 block from Washington Av, about 4-5 blocks from the actual Venice Beach boardwalk full of t-shirt, sunglasses, food, arts, crafts, bongs, & legalized marijuana evaluations. ha. Being from Nebraska, all of this was quite a site! But we like expanding our horizons, so enjoyed seeing (not doing) all the variety of this part of the country. People watching was fun. Yes, we saw homeless folk, but they didn't bother us, other than having thier donation can beside them. Always felt totally safe. In June, the water is only in the 60s.. a little too cold to really enjoy. But the temp was low 70s & felt great. WInd at night was a little cool. Street performers were entertaining. We did a lot of walking as we didn't have a car. Last day we used the hop on/hop off Starlight City Bus tour & made our way to the Walk of Stars/Chineese Theatre. Saw a lot of the city this way. Lots of places to shop by venice beach, but didn't make it them all. We were with our sons, and the boys are not ""into"" shopping. Make sure walk thru the Venice Canals..BEAUTIFUL and peaceful. 2 days is plenty at Venice Beach unless ALL you enjoy doing is watching the ocean (which is beautiful, but we like to DO and SEE while we are on vaca.) PS. Some comments here say how dirty it was... I disagree. Sure some trash in places but you get that anywhere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djvb11
30,Dirty and Mildly entertaining,"Venice beach is famous for a ton of reasons, so my friends and I thought it would be a fun little spot to checkout while we were in town. It is extremely dirty and a lot of homeless people asking for money, if you can get over that. There are alot of people performing street shows and they are pretty entertaining. Annoying how many people try and sell weed too you, a lot of police everywhere. Just a meh attraction I think",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieA132
30,A little too weird for me,"I have been to Venice beach a few times but this was my first time back in about 4 years. Now I remember why I don't like it....I really don't need people in green scrubs trying to sell me a marijuana card. The boardwalk is interesting but once you get the idea of the experience, it can be time to leave. I think the city (or whoever is in charge) should try to keep it cleaner. I know I sound like an uppity prude and I understand that this is how Venice is supposed to be, I guess it is just not for me or people like me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrslibrarian23
40,Venice beach,"An interesting place to say the least. There were plenty of cool dudes trying to sell my sons videos and other bits and pieces ... Capitalizing on their vulnerabilities. I found this to be quite annoying. It was fascinating watching the many types of people on display, all unique and very engaging with the tourists. Definitely worth a Bo peep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimF368
20,Freak Show,"If you want to expose your kids to the freaks in the world, then this is the place. We got to see an arrest, some people obviously on drugs, and countless numbers of tattoos. There were only a couple of muscle-heads working out, and those guys seem to spend their lives there. The Freak Show museum wasn't open any longer ( the one which they had an A&E show about), probably because all the freaks are out walking around. So many with people with body parts pierced that there is no way they could make it through airport security. This is America folks - not Norman Rockwell's America, but the America that's best kept here in Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qtipf16

Escpecially becasue of the spirit you can feel and breath.Must visit place in this wonderful city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_G8207CU
40,Did not disappoint,"Had a few hours to kill and it was our first time in LA so we headed to Venice beach. We went on a Wednesday at 1pm ad were able to park free on the side of the road. We walked down the boardwalk. Got to see the skatepark, muscle beach, weirdos and all the medical marijuana booths. Good hour or 2 seeing the famous Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drew-of-ten-sees
50,This place makes me want to move!,"I fell in love with LA (previously hated) with the help of Venice Beach. There is GREAT shopping, fresh fruit markets and beautiful beach.

10,I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A COMMUNIST COUNTRY ON THIS BEACH!,"As soon as we hit the beach we noticed cops everywhere patrolling and watching beach goers as if they were a criminal entity. There were really not many people on the beach I noticed and I soon found out why. Don’t even think about bringing a dog on the beach those are great things of the past in America. Although skunks, raccoons and other animals defecate on the beach God forbid you bring your dog. The police rolled up on us when we were sitting on some steps about to light a cig although had not done so yet when a rookie pimple face cop rolls up and ask us “what are you doing” What’s it look like I’m doing I replied he said it looks like you may be smoking some drugs” I am a clean cut white girl by the way no tattoos very all American looking so wasn’t sure why he singles my boyfriend and I out as he is as clean cut as I am and we are not drug heads or even drinkers. This is NOT the care free Venice beach you hear of in songs and hear stories of how great it was way back when this is a Gestapo run beach and I felt like I was in a thirld world country. The bums are also horrible and beg you for money and food constantly.I won’t go back to this beach it’s not fun at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LelaM315

30,"Grubby, but interesting for a while.",This is one of those places where people traipse up and down aimlessly hoping to see something happen. The performers aren't great. The stalls mostly sell hippy tat and junkie paraphernalia. The most interesting place is the gym where you might see some staggeringly impressive muscle in action.The best way to enjoy Venice beach is probably to rent a bike in Santa Monica and ride down the beach cycle path. It isn't far and the cycling is pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silkroadworker
30,Ideal for People Watchers - but not for families,"Venice Beach - muscle men, buskers, stalls, roller skaters, skate boarders, potheads, druggies, alcoholics, homeless and crazies. It's great for people watching because there are so many interesting characters and sights! But, it's not ideal for kids - my three felt uncomfortable and couldn't wait to get back to Santa Monica where they felt safer. We can say we have been there, but wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317KarenC317

30,It's big badboy of a beach,"I am concentrating on the big generally empty beach as there are other reviews available for the board walk and muscle beach etc.It a big flat white sand beach, there is little offered in terms of shade and the sea is defiantly the pacific. It's choppy with lots of waves. The few times I have been it has been almost empty or at least so large that the people on it make no impact.The sand is not coarse or really fine... it's somewhere in between.Almost forgot there are the bay watch style life guard huts. If you ask nicely the guy inside should let you take some pictures with his red life guard thing! Sad I know but there is little on the actual beach in terms of entertainment.where the beach meets the land is Venice board walk with lots and lots to do and see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebackandforth
20,a boardwalk that became a scary place,"My husband and I went to visit in the daytime on a Saturday. The people who hung around the board walk became increasingly scary by the way they stood around, seeming to seize people up as they walked by. Emphasis on the alcohol and drug lifestyle prevalent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annabell77
50,Beach and promenade great but don't miss the canals,"Venice Beach is an amazing place. There is something here for everybody. Your senses will be tantalised by the oddities and culture that will surround you. It has a great atmosphere (although often laced with a hint of marijuana). I went during the day and there were buskers, dancers, skateboarders, skaters, muscle-men and a few 'weirdos' on the promenade. There were also some great murals on the walls of the buildings. There are many food shops, stalls, tattoo parlours, artists, hypnotists - you name it - on the promenade to enjoy. There is also the Venice Freak Show. It costs $5 for entry. It had two-headed turtles, dogs with five paws, sword swallowers, fire eaters, wolfman - all performing some bizarre tricks.At the eastern end of the promenade you will find basketball and racquetball courts as well as Muscle Beach, the outdoor gymnasium where the less shy people love to weight train and pose with their musculature. Further towards the beach is the skateboarders rink. The skateboarders are good and fun to watch.The beach itself is very wide with clean sand. Many people sunbathe, swim and surf here and it is nicely isolated from the promenade due to the width of the sand section.But just a short walk away you will find the canals from which the beach gets its name. They are peaceful and nice to stroll along looking at the amazing homes and gardens. It is a sanctuary from the weirdness of the promenade. I really enjoyed my time there. To get there, walk south-east along the Ocean Front Walk and turn left at (South) Venice Boulevard for a very short distance.PROS- canals and beach are free- great atmosphere- great beach- nice murals- great for photographyCONS- there can be a few 'crazy' people there ie potheads. They aren't dangerous.- there can be quite a few homeless people after nightfall- there is marijuana available there- not an attraction for the prim and proper or the faint-hearted or easily offended- the canals are not suitable for wheelchairsVenice Beach is a few kilometres south-east of Santa Monica. There is a bus service outside Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach. It costs about $10 for a taxi fare from Santa Monica. For those staying in Los Angeles, Santa Monica is a stop on the Starline hop on-hop off bus (although I believe this bus route will be extended in May and will include Venice Beach.)Have fun there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roddlez
50,The best people watching of anyplace I have been,"Venice beach is a sight to behold for those who want to see what a true melting pot looks like. I would not bring the kids unless it is in bright daylight and there are lots of people around. Homeless people abound as well as potheads, crazies, skaters, etc. etc.Spend a little while and then you have seen most of it. Make sure you take in ""Muscle Beach"" although it's not like is used to be.The beach is very clean and nice sand.The skateboard park is simply amazing for a public park, but then again it's California where the Government pays for everything. (No wonder they're broke)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPinkerman
10,"Disappointing, Trashing and a Dump","The beach itself is gorgeous, but having cycled up from Hermosa and Redondo the beach isn't that great in comparison to those two. And the board walk, I saw mistreated animals as in dogs with paintings on them, eyebrows painted on; the worst was a dog who had been tied down and covered in money in order to get people to give the guy money. Street ""artists"" which were basically a load of tack. Tacky shops selling sunglasses.Not a true surfer beach at all. A sad, run down boardwalk which is stuck in the early 90s and overrun with weed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welshtravelbug

30,Welcome to Skid Row!,The beach is beautiful wide with golden sand and of course the Pacific ocean is magnificent.However the boardwalk is another story. Its very rundown and there are lots of people begging for change and openly abusing drugs & alcohol.We only spent 40minutes there as part of a sight seeing tour and that was more than enough for this life time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScubaJeffy

20,"As tacky as Las Vegas, without the charm or sophistication","Seedy does not cover it, this was a real disappointment. Venice Beach on the movies is full of beautiful roller-blading youngsters and chic people walking lapdogs. The reality is a cheap market with special offers including ""kick me for $1""', or have a ""doctor"" assess you to get you a prescription for medical weed, which makes cheap t-shirts with dodgy slogans seem the best option for a memento. Shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnotherEnglishman
30,Venice Beach is stuck in the 90s,One of the eseential LA experiences is iconic Venice Beach. We were excited to see Muscle Beach & the basketball courts where White Men can't jump is filmed (I couldn't think of any recent movies). At first it was enjoyable since Venice is a culture of its own and you can be free to be whoever you want there. But as the day went on more people came out to sell stuff mainly to buy drugs and it definitely got over stimulating. I would say check it out for a little while & then gap it before everyone tries to sell you their burned CDs and other random stuff. There are many arts stalls and various little shops to check out and you see how it is stuck in the 90s. But its walking distance to the Santa Monica Pier and the beach is right there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieR786

So much going on, music, shops, bars and sooo many interesting people.Especially loved the Arbor shop, can only buy this stuff on-line (arborcollective.com) or in specialist shops from the UK.Can't explain this place in words, you just have to experience it yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nhfc
10,Not worth it,Decided to take an afternoon adventure to Venice Beach while in the area visiting colleges with my Senior. Bad idea! It was a druggy paradise. Reeked of marijuana and there were so many people high and stumbling around. Not at all what I thought it would be. We stood to watch the skills of the skateboarders until someone higher than a kite stood next to us screaming obscenities at them. Won't go back again. We will stay at the beaches south of Venice. Much nicer!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jltplus3

Parking was hard, as in all of LA, so we parked in a parking garage near apartments and walked along the path. Lots of homeless people hanging out and did not feel safe in many areas.

Just be careful as there are a lot of homeless and they are trying to get money from you. Best to visit during the day. But there are also lots of night clubs if you want to be out at night. I personally prefer Santa Monica beach and pier which are just minutes away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanR306

You can find an assortment of people from body builders to homeless people painting art. Lots of quirky shops along the path will make the trip even more memorable. We saw break dancers( I thought that was a long gone talent)with unique moves. All types of fitness buffs along Venice. Awe inspiring is all I can say.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brightsmile1
40,catch a beautiful sunset here,"To avoid crowds, we went solely to get a nice view of the sunset, and it was in the off season anyway. I would probably not visit otherwise, because I enjoy quiet.Plan on a walk of a few blocks from where you park. Finding a spot is tricky, and you might have to walk through neighborhoods where the houses are just feet away.The sunset was amazing over some large rocks trailing into the water. There wasn't a crowd, so I was able to walk around to find the best views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AC301
20,Full of homeless and pot,"I was taken to Venice Beach by someone who had previously visited here many years ago with his children. My first impression of the beach area was not good as I felt unsafe by cyclists using the boardwalk, groups of homeless people hanging around and the smell of pot being used regularly. This together with some very strange people just made it feel like a place where I would want my children to be unsupervised. The beach itself seemed great being relatively clean, but the many street sellers and run down shops didnt make me want to go back. Although there were some glimmers of talent in the items for sale, many were just desperate attempts to earn a dollar or two. When we walked to the end of Venice Beach towards Santa Monica, it was clearly evident where one ended and the other started. Although there were police around I didnt feel particularly safe and would choose to go elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donk1
30,what a strange place.,"don't bother looking for street parking. parking will cost you $15-20. don't eat the food they sell around here..worst food I've ever eaten. its really over crowded. bathrooms are dirty with pee all over the toilet seat. people here are 420 friendly so don't be surprised if you smell a lot of weed! alot of pipe shops and regular shops. a lot of people asking for money or weed. there's a ton of weird people walking around. visit the frekshow. for $5 you'll see 2 headed animals, bearded lady, wolf man, smallest woman, electric woman and a man who swallows a sword, and a Man who was his whole face pierced. the jumping pog fred street performance is very cool, a must see! he was on the guiness book of records. we also saw some street dancers but they literally FORCED some girl to join into one of their stunts. she was pulling away and telling the Guy to stop and he dragged her. they also almost force u to give them money. they will put u on the spot and if u say u don't have cash, they'll tell u to go to the ATM which is behind. very rude! avoid if possible. overall the 2 performances where the highlight of Venice: jumping Fred & the freakshow other than that its like whatever. p.s the hotels around here are wayy too expensive and not that great. please eat before coming to Venice unless u wanna get sick!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabyrocha0
40,Weird but cool place,"The beach it's self it very nice and clean, we hired bikes and cycled down from Santa Monica in the bike path which was very safe and enjoyable.Lots of tacky tourist shops which were good for a few cheesy souvenirs.Lots of street artists selling art and funky things.Over all a very strange but brilliant place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyPenno
30,"Dirty with ""colorful people""","This is not a place I would encourage people to go to with young children. It's a rather sad place filled with a huge population of transient/homeless population. The sidewalks were filthy and the beach area was dirty as well. If you are looking for colorful people watching this is definitely your place. If you are searching for a nicer beach, Santa Monica is a short walk down the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennlarra
30,"The Beach with ""Colourful"" People","Was here on a guided tour. Had about 30 mins here. Took a walk along the shops and close to the beach. Lots of street artistes, hip hoppers, and simply ""interesting"" personalities. The beach lives up to its name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingWithWings
40,Perfect way to spend time in LA,"The Venice beach is really long and is easily covered if you just have time. I spend here several days relaxing. TIPS: Don't be afraid of the hobos, vendors or other ""freaks"" which you see at the side of the beach walk. In the skate park you can see amazing talents even if your not into skateboarding, you should go check it out. There are plenty of cafes, shops and other venues for your needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirRahikkala
40,Venice Beach,"Venice beach is worth a stroll down the promenade. There are plenty of unusual shops and stalls at the side of the promenade to browse and the beach was spacious and almost empty when we were there through the week.There are plenty of restaurants to get food from, so well worth a couple of hours walking about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77Emma
50,"Lovely place, nice atmosphere!","Venice beach was definately my favourite part of LA. We parked at the beginning and just strolled along the boulevard. This is not a place for shopping,i would say, as there is manly highpriced tourist shops. It is nice to observe people doing sports, street painters etc.We loved it so much we went twice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConstantWanderlust
20,Disappointed. I guess the freaks really do only come out at night.,"My wife and I walked along Venice Beach on a weekday and were hoping it would be a little more freaky. It has the fun corner shops selling touristy shirts and sunglasses. There are also many medicinal marijuana shops along the path if you are feeling ill. Not a place to take your children. We love street performers but the only people on the street were guys handing out their bootleg rap CDs. We passed by Muscle Beach and Skate Park and neither had any action. We did get to watch a shoe commercial being filmed but anyone can tell you that filming is a tedious process with lots of standing around. If my wife and I were alone and it was at night, I am hoping it would be more lively.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodhelmet
40,Venice has its character!,"I prefer Venice more than the touristy famous Santa Monica. Do not expect relaxation by the beach here, it is a place for entertainment with many interesting street performers at the boardwalk. Cycling is the best way to get to here from Santa Monica Pier and clycling by the beach is a great enjoyment. You can have the best beach view during sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/n0mas

20,Really nothing special about Venice Beach,"I took my family there to visit what I heard was a neat place. It is so worn down looking and it gets old the people with the ""Got Pot?"" signs. It is also very crowded on the board walk but the actual beach and view was nice. I would not be comfortable bringing my family there at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiki1314
30,Raffish and unchanged,"My wife and I walked down to Venice Beach along the boardwalk from our hotel in Santa Monica. The walk was pleasant. But Venice Beach, unfortunately, was not. I was there once twenty five years ago and she was there just after that. It has not changed--a long string of homeless and near homeless plying their limited skills' based products to an unwilling public. Across the boardwalk from them is a seemingly endless string of cheap restaurants and souvenir stands. This is what I remembered from years ago and it has not changed.There may be nice places in Venice--the boardwalk is not one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMLVermont
40,Beautiful beach,"This is a beautiful beach and a good place for sea glass. Also a great place to find used condoms, so you may want to watch your step.Lively place to walk, and great if you like long walks on the beach. It's easy to pop on and off the beach to get something to eat or drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steph1
50,Lots to see,"We walked along the boardwalk on a Saturday morning in January while visiting. There was alot to see, it was great. If you are visiting and taking in some of the very 'unreal sights' in L.A. you should probably see this very 'real' situation that is happening in Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishfarmfamily
50,Venice Beach,"Make sure to take an afternoon to walk down Venice Beach. We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach along the shoreline then took the boardwalk back.Beautiful and lots to look at!Venice beach boardwalk is a very colorful place but mixed in with the t-shirt shops, tattoo parlors and pot stores there were some really neat stores and attractions!There are people selling items in booths and others performing!Very enjoyable time and I would go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidaylink
50,"Wonderful fun, Los Angeles as I thought it would be!","Well Venice beach what can I say!, busy but fun a real atmosphere of people enjoying themselves, all walks of life and some great characters, we felt safer here than at Santa Monica , lots of tshirts and surf wear shops at good prices.I think if you like quirky and different places you must go to Venice beach, just remember that people are allowed to smoke marijuana legally here ( for medical reasons only ) so please don't be shocked!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mirbaby
40,Enjoyed this beach especially for surfing and fun with family,"Now I'm not sure if other people are reviewing the pier or a nearby area, but I had absolutely no bad experiences at the beach. We spent 4 separate days here, including a weekend and I liked it more than santa monica beach. It was more relaxing, less busy, clean, and overall enjoyable. I liked this beach for learning to surf and wading or sandcastles with the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/362DeannaG
50,great for tourist,"this is where i grew up, in the city of Venice CA. when you go make sure you visit the promenade as there a lot to see, experience and shop. there are also many restaurants and shops. go see the surfing in the morning maybe around 8-9 am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roxfun

20,Lost in the 60's,"From blatant pot smokers to vagabonds to bums, this place has gone down hill. Most sidewalk vendors are pushing junk. They seem content to take up space & smoke weed with their neighbors. Was very surprised to see a Green Doctor location on the boardwalk. They were offering medical marijuana prescription testing for $40. I questioned one of the staff who was high as a kite. It was comical. The highlight of the area was the skateboard park. It was very nice, on the beach, and well used. Some of those guys are awesome. Not going back there unless I need to get a prescription! Lol!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradfrance

50,"Step into a ""unique"" place.","If you want to step into an extremely liberal and ""1960's"" flashback place, one must walk the Venice Beach area. Other than it being extremely crowded (an extremely warm and sunny day in Feb), the people, the shopping, the food, and every other aspect of this place was amazing! Muscle Beach was an added bonus to watch. This is an LA treasure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMNewAlbany_Ohio
40,nearly killed me,My 2 days in Venice Beach when in LA for work nearly killed me - and this is a compliment. Probably wouldn't recommend it if you actually need to do any work but so much better than the soulless business hotels in soulless business area I usually have to stay in.Andy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy190482
40,Time stopped in 70s,"Near to Santa Monica and Marina del Rey, beaches are similar to Santa Monica ones but people around are quite different. Many of them remind the 70s hippies and the show is on the street, from a bodybuilding beach to a ""green doctor"" offering medicinal marijuana.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linkedinwitch
40,From England,We visited on a Sunday and all shops where open and many hopeless people begging for money and trying to sell things they have made. Some handmade stuff is really good so don't be thrown off by all the homeless beggars. Don't take a photo of the old man in swimming pants with a boom box as he chargers and will chase you angrily. All shops and stools have a no photo sign or pay a doller to take a photo. Skatepark is cool to watch for a bit and there was even a small hippy rave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devonstar12

50,Give it a Try,"I've come here several times and there is always a lot to observe. The first thing you notice once you get here is the smell of incense and smoke in the air.There are a lot of homeless people, hippies, and young people everywhere. It is not exactly the cleanest beach in California but there is nowhere else like it. The last time i went there was a drum circle in the sand where a lot of different people were dancing or sitting around listening to the music. It is a good place to buy California souvenirs. On the boardwalk there are a lot of handmade items or art that can be bought. There is also a long bike trail that I think goes all the way to Santa Monica. There is also a skatepark near the beach. I wouldn't recommend bringing your kids here though for obvious reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedesandreina

20,Not my style,"I believe it depends on where you come from as to whether Venice beach is going to impress or not. I come from Sydney, Australia; a city of 80+ beaches. Our iconic Sydney beach is Bondi. It's urban, in your face and not particularly spectacular when compared to the remainder of Sydney beaches - and that said, Sydney beaches pale in comparison with the rest of the country.I left Venice Beach feeling the same thing. It represents LA very well. It's brash, in your face and urban. It's a compulsory visit for anyone new to LA, but keeping in mind there are much better Californian beaches heading either north of south from Venice Beach. It's not particularly pretty.The beach seemed to have one of the larger collections medicinal marijuana stores. It helped the beach feel detached from what international visitors believe a clean Californian life to be.The food available on the beach is mediocre. I had to search for over 30 minutes to find a healthy alternative to the large selection of random fried, barely edible assortments. In part, walking along the beach felt more like I was visiting a run down amusement park than a beach.Once I drove further north and noted how beautiful the Californian coast is, I couldn't understand why Venice beach is so loved.Visiting July 2009",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bondiau
20,Unsafe marijuana den! Oh and don't forget the constant begging from homeless people.,"Hired some bikes for a reasonable price and took off along the beach for some sightseeing, being approached by person after person trying to sell us all types of drugs or beg us for money for Fake charity's really spoils the experience.On the plus side the beach and board walk was awesome, the boardwalk is right on the beach and all very flat for an easy ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazzyjjjj
40,What a variety,"You can definitely go people watching at this beach. There is a nice boardwalk that is close to the beach and another next to the stores. There are a lot of areas to eat at, whether you want a full meal or just a snack. Beware of all of the ""medical solicitors"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TitasTravels
40,Loved it,"I loved this place. We were there in September and it was baking hot, was really nice to walk along the beach and people watch. Yes there are hippes, drugs and it's not exactly clean, but people saying that the shops are run down are missing the point of the place. We ate at a mexican cantina place, i can't remember the name, but the tacos were amazing. Great beer too. Lots of music, random old hippes doing yoga, fun atmosphere and I can honestly say I didn't feel at all unsafe like some people are saying on here. I can see why it may not be everybody's cup of tea, but as a big Camden (London) fan I found it similar in a lot of ways. Some people don't like Camden because it has people that aren't the same as them and has lots of pubs and drugs around, but for those that know it and appreciate it, it's great. Camden vs London's West End, Venice Beach vs Hollywood. That's how I'd compare it.If you're visiting LA as part of a road trip (like we were) I'd definitely say it's worth having a stop at Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stellerton
10,Scary & unsafe on rainy days...,"If it is raining or cloudy on the day you plan to visit, I highly suggest you change your plans and do not visit. The walkways is dirty and the shops lining it are of no real value (unless you like cheap T-shirts and drug paraphernalia). I'm sure it would feel much safer on a sunny day, as I hear it is crowded and full of tourists, but on the rainy day we visited (we were on a tour bus which had a designated stop here) there were no tourists or friendly people to be seen, only homeless and degenerate people who ask if you would like to buy illegal substances... Definitely not worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleP638
40,so many differant people...,"Venice beach is a nice beach to view all kind of different people, the variety La has to offer. the walkway can be crowded on weekends but the atmosphere is part of the fun! just walk around, absorb the sun and do some people watching and eat in one of the restaurants in the area. make sure you see the outside gym with all the pump up guys that looks just like in the movies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amiroi

40,Venice Beach LA,"We visited Venice beach in Dec 2012, it was a great place to buy gifts for friends & family. Lots to see on the beach, Skateboard park was awesome to watch so was the people working out on the exercise equipment.Plenty of shops and stalls along the boardwalk. Its not a place id go on my own, it felt a bit like i had to look over my shoulder at times & be aware of my surroundings because of some of the types of people hanging out there in certain places but all up i liked the photo opp`s and got some great shots. Its about a 1 hr walk to Santa Monica pier, well that`s how long it took us anyway. I liked it and would go again when i`m in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonH553
40,Southern California's BEST people-watching beach!,"This beach has a huge selection of shops, restaurants, and a ton of people & street performers to watch!

However, this a unique beach to visit for anyone else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyalJerky
50,Take a bike or rollerblades,"Love to go here off season to ride bikes along 4.5 miles of sidewalk along the Pacific Ocean. Yes, you can visit weird and off beat characters too along the strip but that ride along the ocean is breath-taking. We go at least twice while visiting Malibu during the week. Make sure to take the time to visit Palisades Park across the bridge. It has a beautiful sight of the ocean from there. Parking is 6 dollars for all day. There is the famous filmed pier and ferris shell along with other attraction (famous Bubba Gump restaurant from movie Forest Gump)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyt980
30,Great for people watching!,"We only stopped off here briefly as we needed to get to our next hotel and had a bit of a drive ahead. The time we did have though was very memorable - we were there on Christmas Eve and watched the beautiful sunset as surfers caught a few waves, kids skated and played basketball and homeless people queued for the soup kitchen. I wish we had more time there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleSparrow81
30,Annoying!,"If you want to see a beautiful vista and a pristine beach, this is not the place. If you want to see a carnival of derelicts, weirdos and left over hippies from the 60s and be hustled to by drugs you might like it. To me, it's a MUST TO AVOID!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cayman08
40,"Great place for a weekend stroll, so much to see!","I love visiting Venice Beach every so often because there is so much to see here. There are plenty of sidewalk sellers many of which have handcrafted goods or artwork for sale. Recently I purchased a beautiful cross bracelet for $5 and I just love it. The people here are an eclectic mix and it's always fun to people watch. There are a few great restaurants here as well. On Saturdays and Sundays, you can catch street performers which can be entertaining and quite humorous. My kids always love watching these shows and have even been asked to participate. And if all this stuff is not enough, you have the beautiful beach to play on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Must Visit at LA,"I was In FL and I visited beaches there every alternative weekend. If I compare this one those In FL, I must say this one will be in the top 3. The adjoining road is cool to walk where you may purchase something from the roadside shops. The scenic beauty is awesome. The beach is accessible through buses as well. Bus stop is barely a min walk from the beach. Beach side restaurants are available to experience the beach side atmosphere while enjoying the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livewithdream
30,Too much hype!,"I just returned (mid-January, 2013) from my much anticipated trip to LA, I am nearing 60 and have wanted to go to LA for most of my life. I regret to say that I was disappointed!Venice Beach was part of my day's excursion which included Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive and The Farmer's Market.Although the beach itself is very wide and clean, the boardwalk failed to deliver. I have been to several east coast beaches (less famous) that were far more pleasing. My favorite boardwalk being Hollywood Beach, Florida, the sidewalk cafes and bars were more appealing than the tacky vendor's that served fast greasy food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucyJ723

One of the most famous beaches on earth is littered with peddlers of an illegal manner. I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life. Upset as well. It only took 1.5 hours to find parking.

30,Fun to do once,We had a few hours to spare so decided to visit Venice Beach. We went with my Mum and Step Dad who had been before so we knew what to expect.We visited on a weekday in January so it wasn't very busy. We easily got parking for $5 and even used the restrooms. They weren't clean but weren't that bad... been to much worse in Bali or Kuala Lumpur. Toilet paper and soap were available.Walking along is interesting and you will see all different types of people. The medical marijuana people are probably the most annoying along with the people trying to hand you their cd's. They were the only in your faces type of people.Everyone else was pretty laid back not really in your face. It was nice to walk along and browse the shops. I can imagine it would be a bit more stressful in summer with small children. We enjoyed our few hours in Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_Mallie

30,Once is worth it,"Had to visit Venice Beach while in LA to see if it compared to t.v. It was an eclectic experience but worth it. Parking was very difficult to find. The beach was beautiful. The playground looked clean and fun. We enjoyed the performers, the people walking the boardwalk and the vendors. There's a nice bookstore on the boardwalk.We didn't like the medical marijuana hawkers (did I really look like I needed a medical marijuana card?). Wait to use the bathroom elsewhere.The atmosphere was fun and high energy. Great to see during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollyt264
30,It is what it is..,"Within two minutes of getting out of our car we were hustled into buying burnt cds from ""musicians"" and the smell of weed in the area. There is the typical tourist shirt sellers and useless markets along the strip of run down 1950's spanish art deco buildings. To me this wasn't seedy, it was actually pleasant to see something that isn't so LA fake.Being from Oz - I am spoilt for choice for beautiful beaches and was actually surprised to see Venice Beach (the actual beach) was pretty and can see the attraction in the summer time. Unfortunately we were there in the middle of winter but it was still pretty cool to see the surfers and lifeguard towers (insert Baywatch theme music here) real white sand and not crushed shelly sand. Step away from the beach and there is the hang out of a skate park just for some 'culture"" and local buskers. Yes the toilets were gross and the some of the characters made me very slightly uneasy. But it is what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyM1408

30,Grubby,The trashier end of the beaches. We rode to here from Santa Monica Pier. Though it is only a ten minute ride......it almost like crossing into a new country.

There are the basketball courts and muscle beach as well, when busy either can be quite an attraction. Basketball tournaments can be as exciting as any other sporting event. The beaches there are nice, nothing special. This should be a must do on all SoCaler's lists as well as tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erik4Travel
40,"See it once, always something odd to see","Always take visitors for a walk on the Oceanfront Walk. Just weird enough it's unique, from the folks dressed in costumes, panhandlers, pot sellers, dogs, tourists, small shops, crafts, etc. Use caution if you're biking as most tourists don't follow the signs and walk all over the bike path-have nearly hit people numerous times and saw a crash last week. Walk in the pedestrian path, ride on the bike path. Keep an open mind and see an alternative side of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saranger

Police were not very concerned - dispatcher said we had to wait there for an indeterminate amount of time until someone came to take a report - while the dog was meandering with his belligerent owner toward the beach and tons of families with small children. We eventually walked to the beach and flagged down a police car, equally unalarmed about the situation. Got a lifeguard to clean and bandage the wounds. Unbelievable.

30,Tacky,You might enjoy the bohemian side of LA but it doesn't feel very authentic. Lots of pan handlers and people pushing everything from marijuana to CDs in your face. It's probably worth seeing once but it is not somewhere to spend more than a couple of hours. A tacky tourist trap is how I would sum it up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanZ123

30,Clean beach but a bit cheap.,"The beach itself was nice, but walking around the shops you do get hassled a lot by people trying to sell you CDs or marijuana (it's legal in California). The shops are quite cheap, poor quality t shirts etc. It's more laid back than Santa Monica, but I felt a bit grimier too. You can walk along the beach to Santa Monica in about 45mins, or the coastal path in about an hour ans a half which is a nice walk and provides an interesting comparison between the two places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityGirlAimee
10,Disappointing,"No glamour, nice cafes or anything, just a place for people looking for ""medicine marijuana"". Not even worth the time to people watch. Interesting to see middle age people skateboarding nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EBL_11
10,Disappointed,"The beach in all the movies and tv shows, the one everyone says you must visit.No. Don't do it.It's a dump. Absolutely horrible.Go to Santa Monica beach which is just a short walk away.Venice Beach is disgustingly dirty and full of old beaten up tin shops selling nasty things. It looks like a third world country, not LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693CatherineL
50,Well worth going.,"I found Venice beach to be clean and well maintained. There's lots of tourist gift shops, restaurants and scateboarders along the boarwalk. Might not be everyones cup of tea, but for others it can be a real eye opener. My favourate was the native american indian gift shop where I bought some cloths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR963
20,Don't Waste Your Time,"Couldn't come LA and not stop by the legendary Venice Beach, or so we thought. Took our teenage daughters with a realistic idea of what to expect. Never felt unsafe but it really is just a filthy, urine soaked beach experience. If you want to watch people living with addiction, mental illness and homelessness then this is for you. Plenty of people sleeping on the grass and benches, man barely able to walk while urinating in the middle of the park at 11 am, plenty of opportunity to see the ""Doctor"" for weed and buy from tourist shops. Graffiti area had some great art and the skate boarders drew a crowd. During our visit, the harsh reality of Venice Beach outweighed any of the ""entertainment"" aspect. There are so many other spots to see in this region, save your time and parking money and pass on this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roomforfour
10,Where the Tramps Live,"I was very disappointed by Venice, as soon as we got out of the car there were dodgy looking people walking about and i felt like i was going to get mugged. We walked onto the beach front where about 50 tramps has set up camp and there were people dealing drugs on the pavements, we stayed here 5 minuted and ran back to the car. It's such a shame as the place could be lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outandaboutwithliz

50,Completely worth it,"Okay first of all Venice is awesome. I came for the beach bum atmosphere. This is my first time here and I knew what to expect, street performers, wacky people, pot smokers, skateboarders and of course the beach. The vendors on the street are mostly selling items they have made, depending on what your looking for if anything, but it is great art. The homeless people mean well...we were not bothered once by anyone. After reading some of the review I became concerned, we are from Las Vegas, the street performers and homeless people are in great abundance....and will bombard you basically demanding money. So I just said we wont go out after dark...we decided to go away from the beach to eat dinner bringing us back to our hotel after dark (which was right on tbe boardwalk), no problems...no worries....completely safe, no more unsafe than Las Vegas. If your from a small town you may be thrown back a little, its normal. The restaurants are awesome, great food great service. You really have to be a special kind of person to appreciate Venice.....and Santa Monica is literally right around the corner. I came here with my husband for our anniversary purposely leaving the kids at home because it really is not a place for kids. If you enjoy hippies, people watching, good food and interesting entertainment, this place is for you. If you are expecting paradise with cabanas and mojitos go to Coronado Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MorganE1999
20,"Was, Is and Likely Always Will be a Collection of Freaks & Tourists","Not necessarily a bad thing. Definitely the best concentration of people watching on the planet earth. Somewhere, buried deep in the sand in the center of venice is a giant freak magnate. A definite must visit for adult tourists looking to see this part of LA culture and history. Tons of street performers, pot shops, self appointed profits, hippies, etc. All of it is in your face and immersive. Again, really cool if you are OK with this or looking for it. If you show up with your 10 and 12 year old, it can get pretty offensive and depressing pretty quickly. My advice is to keep the kids away/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kumstone
10,Pot and potty troubles,"So I take my family there looking for the California experience. Walking down the boardwalk we get booth after booth of drug dealers. Walking towards the beach, wanting to change clothes and use the restroom, the wait in line was easily an hour. Then to get to the beach you have to crossover a bike path with no traffic control (yes we had a bike/person accident). The beach itself is fine, the task of getting there is not family friendly at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimmyTwoTone
20,"The beach itself is nice, but the area is run down.","Venice beach and its surrounds are run down, it doesn't look like they have maintained the area for years, you can literally see a line in the road, where one municipal ends, as one side is all cracked up, while the other side has new tar seal. Apparently they are also looked after by different police precincts, which also shows. A lot of homeless can be seen in this area and we were told not to wander down this way at night as it could be unsafe. It was not a pleasant site to see homeless people sorting through garbage bins for food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwinoz1

30,Nice beach but full of ugly people!,"There are so many bums on the board walks that it make strolling along Venice Beach a very unpleasant experience.

40,Very interesting with plenty of variety,"Great place whether you are just want to stroll and enjoy or take part in a whole range of more active pursuits. The restaurants and shops are not of great quality and some areas a bit grungy, but still interesting. Loved walking the pier, watching the surfers and taking a bike ride. A great mix, full of life.

40,Not what I thought,"This is a must see but not in the least glamorous. There are lots of characters (mostly hippy and drop outs) even more dope shops!

Use public toilets if absolute emergency!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scttgraham
30,Nothing special,"Yes it's a beach, lots of people working out, out daughter enjoyed the playgrounds , nice to see but I would not rush back again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieMelbourne
50,What a scene from the old hippy days.,It is such an interesting mix up people that hang out here. You must go for a visit and check out some of the local stalls and small shops along the walkway. There is many things on offer from smoking pot to a nice cool beer or a shady nook to read a book and just chill and let it all happen around you. Thrilling to say the least. Even the homeless do not deter from its beauty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robyn-and-Rob

40,Great beach for the locals and tourists!,"I live about 15 minutes from this beach but don't go here as often as I would like to. The main reason for this is the parking menace I usually run into on a nice warm weekend (possibly my fault because I normally don't head out until the afternoon at the earliest). However, I still love this beach for its canals, beaches, the 2.5 miles pedestrian only promenade that fills with performers, fortune-tellers, artists, vendors, and is an important cultural center of the city. There is also a biking route that stretches very far up to Santa Monica Beach or far enough for a long day of enjoyable biking. For the past years, they built a skate board ring which is quite neat as you can relax on the beach while watching enthusiast boarders doing their tricks with the sunset in the background (I think it must be one of the coolest things you can find there).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaL143
50,Hippie Heaven,"Venice Beach is a blast. The vibe here is quirky/artsy/hippie and acts as a stark contrast to neighboring Santa Monica beach. Everything is just a little bit more fun here. I was approached by one of the representatives from the ""Green Doctors"" who evaluate you for medical marijuana. They were a riot, and made it pretty clear that it doesn't take much to get a positive evaluation. I took one of their business cards as a unique souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyssa_boone

30,Can be a great place to visit if the weather is great.,Can be a great place or can be a dive. Best visited in the good weather or at the weekends otherwise it can feel quite unsafe and home to some very strange people. At its best is a fantastic place to people watch and see some of the old California beach spirit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockkevin6
50,A place to remember,"I visited LA some time ago. Still, to this day, what sticks to my mind, is Venice beach. What a wonderful mix of people and interests. Rollerblading, working out, playing music, painting pictures, selling food. You name it! Venice is a wonderful way to get into the LA spirit. Enjoy with an open mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davmdan

40,A totally unique experience,"Like nowhere I have ever been before.Beautiful beach, very large area. Parking nearby was very expensive at 15 dollars. A very alternative scene, lots of tattoos body piercings. Tonnes of takeaway food places, music playing from shops, outdoor muscle gym like you see in the movies :) people dancing on skates, some guy playing golf, marijuana sold legally..it's all going on at this place.I enjoyed the experience and atmosphere but I would add that it's also a place that you tend to guard your purse a ill bit closer as the vibe can feel a bit shady at times.Kept your wits about you though and you will have a fab time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laura_Rose25
40,Stunning sunsets,"Venice beach is a must see....I guess you got to see it to believe it!The people Are interesting to say the least, every 20 steps someone is Asking you if you want a free evaluation for 'legal drugs' And in the same 20 steps you will see the most interesting sights with the people that Hang out there.There was a lot of police presence so you felt safe as that was a concern of ours due to reading other reviews about the beach but we were surprised by how safe it was.Highlight for us was def watching the sun set. It was stunning And something that I will always remember. The beach comes to life after the sun goes down that's for sure.Lots of Amazing little stalls with some great local art an lots of food trucks an stores. A must see even if you only stay ten mins! Def check out the muscle beach for all the old men working out in speedos that's very interesting to watch lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisacunningham01
30,Never expected this...,"The beach is clean, thats about the only good thing about the Venecian beach. There are lots and lots of homeless people, filthy stores and a lot of bad smell.

10,Disappointed,"I really thought that Venice Beach would have more going for it than it did, but I was sorely disappointed. Maybe it's because I was there at night, but I found it to be filthy, tacky and felt a bit uneasy just being there. It reminded me a lot of Coney Island. Maybe back in the day it was worth it, but that was a long time ago. If you have kids, drive down to the Santa Monica Pier or if you're looking for a fun place on the beach with shops and such, head to Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRK321
30,Not sure about this place,"Maybe its because the tour we were on took us there so early but the place was full of homeless people and it was actually really sad. The beach itself is lovely and it was great to see people surfing but I felt a little nervous walking the promenade, and I was surprised how dirty the place was. I felt a bit let down, it wasnt quite the sunny, cheery place I have seen on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thejonesmonkey
40,Venice Beach,"Due to LA traffic, we arrived to see the sunset. We took a quick walk & watch the skateboarders. Looked at some of the art. I REALLY wish we could have seen it during the day ... we just ran out of time during our stay. I looks like it's probably really cool during the day. When sunsets ... leave. We walked back by the boardwalk .. and it got pretty dark .. and I have to say, even my husband wasn't comfortable having me & the 2 kids walking in the area. A must during the day ... a DO NOT at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mersee
30,Good and bad,"The beach is nice as is the pier, we hired bikes and had a nice ride on the bike track along the beach, not much worth seeing along the ride, and there is the fair share of weirdos around, but sometimes thats what you go to see.

30,"Nice Beach, Less Shops and Restaurants","Venice beach was nice but there weren't many shops and restaurants nearby, as compared to Mahattan Beach. Very touristy and great people watching.

Great sidewalk along the beach front for riding bicycles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetraveling8804

30,"Venice -- great history, but stay on the boardwalk and donlt inhale!","Venice Beach is rich in history. You must visit once. In the Summer. The air is fresh. Find a restaurant on Abbott Kinney for brunch or lunch, first. Then, make certain you have long term parking (cheaper), lock your car (nothing visible through the windows) and walk to the beach. Enjoy the day sightseeing and people-watching. Avoid the sunglasses booths, the ""Med"" clinics (for the 420-smoking crowd) and watch those bicyclists -- they can be mean! Otherwise, enjoy yourself, and leave by sunset before the Vampires come out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHSwift
40,not for everyone,"Faint of heart stay away. As mentioned in other reviews, Venice Beach is full of tacky tourist traps and drug addicts.

I especially enjoyed watching the kids in the skate park - some of them are really talented!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraC214
30,a bit tacky,"I was really looking forward to this place but its living on its past glories. The shops are a bit tacky, lots of medical marujuana shops. Sitting down to eat is not easy- not many places on the main strip & they were packed.Quite a lot of drunks lying about. The houses and canals are worth a quick look at. The beach is OK, Santa Monica is nicer. As for the muscle beach, not much going on there- there is a gym which was pretty empty, and some free equipment we had a play on. If you want a rude t-shirt its good place to go. if you only have a day, go to Santa Monica instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cejob
50,More than meets the eye.,"We arrived just as Venice was waking up. People were starting to get out and about. The market style shops along the front of the beach walk are touristy but fun. We recommend renting a bike and going for a ride. It is a great way to see the length of the beach and all that is going on. Don't miss a walk around the canal area which is absolutely gorgeous and as lovely as when depicted in movies. This is just a nice contrast to the other side of Venice along the beach front. The canals are clean and the unique architecture of the homes is set off by lovely gardens and a real sense of community. I wouldn't personally go to Venice too late in the day, but during the day, it is just pulsing with individuality. It's not the place for children and even think about your teens and whether it is right for them. I'm sure they would think you were cool to take them there but be ready to field questions if you do. There is a real presence of pot and the doctors are always ""in"". Keep your wits about you and you will really enjoy the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobaltravellerAus

50,An absolute must !!,"When you first venture onto Venice Beach, L.A. it's like stepping into a movie. It has been featured in so many films it feels like you've been there already !! It has to be one of the most fun, crazy, psychedelic, bursting with life and fascinating places I've experienced !! It has all of life's weird and wonderful characters, parading, roller skating, skate boarding, uni-cycling, cart-wheeling along its promenade. Film and tv crews are everywhere and the rich tapestry of human creativity and self expression is free for all to see. The beach itself is vast with huge sand dunes and massive breakers where the surfing tribes do there amazing stuff. The restaurants and cafes and hundreds of craft stores are excellent. I loved it. The vibe is 'free for all' and fun. Of course some dodgy characters and goings-on but be sensible and just enjoy everything it has to offer. Talent scouts and supermodel spotters are everywhere so if you've got what it takes - just show up !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalbuddha

They have the 'muscle beach' there where people be swinging from poles and doing acrobatic stuff. Its kool to watch. I would have love to seen more beautiful women with hips and breasts.

There were a lot of shops and a lot of medicinal marijuana storefronts with ""doctors"" readily available to determine if you were eligible to have the medicine. There was a strong smell of marijuana all around and a lot of drug paraphernalia shops. Some sketchy characters but overall it was something to see and the beach was nice.

Looks like all the ""medical marijuana"" shops attract a lot of dopes.The water is BEAUTIFUL and the sand is hot as heck so be warned. Walking along the water was very pleasant. Muscle Beach was kinda bare...minus the ill-looking old dude who's been in the sun too long.Eating choices seemed the same as at any other boardwalk. Ditto with the shops, although there were some pretty unique ones with local works.There were some street performers there doing acrobatic feats which reminded me of similar acts in NYC.Venice Beach just seemed like an enclave to chill and unwind for a couple of days.

50,A place to be yourself without judgment,"Venice Beach was a nut house on the loose. I went for the L.A ratha yatra. So it was already naturally pretty nutty. After it was all cleaned up though the craziness didn't end. Homeless, artists, and all around sketchy people covered every inch of Venice beach. It smelled of Urine, smoke, and broken dreams. Everybody was yelling about religion, or getting high. Conspiracy theorists everywhere and all kinds of unique art. The place was filthy but was for sure a great time! I plan on going back and re-experiencing Venice Beach and it's funny antics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecatwhotravels
40,It's an EXPERIENCE to say the least,"I've always loved Venice. It's a great escape for the day....BUTThe beach is filthy so I'd probably go hang in SM instead. The little shops are fun but they mostly carry the same thing. The artists now need permits and such so all the interesting ones have moved on. IF you like WEED, it's everywhere. If you're bringing your kids, be prepared to explain why there's so much WEED everywhere.All and all- the sun is great, the sea air is amazing, there is a lot of interesting history (take a tour), the people are crazy and fun and scary all at the same time...it's Venice! Take it for what it's worth and keep an eye on your wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preciouspinkxxx
30,I go very often,"Although it's not my favorite beach, since there are always too many people... I do like that the boardwalk is full of cute stores and restaurants. It's very lively. But if you like quiet beaches, this is not the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bettiesue_1
40,A 1960a flashback,"This is not Disney not is it for those who believe in the hype of Hollywood.But it is like entering a time warp back to the 1960s. The great hippie Indian-inspired food and street musicians on roller skates are still to be found here but so are the string out druggies and the hucksters. This is the way it was kiddies. Wonderful location for the chaos helped along by a strong local police presence in the storm of a tastefully decorated bunker police station on the foreshore. For mature audiences only but worth avidity however brief. Hint: toilets not recommended, use the ones at Muscle Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeShipley
40,Always a fun beach to hang out,clean white sand with loads of people wathching. Numerous good restaurants to stop at. Get there early because restaurants can be very crowed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/725KarenW725
20,Not for our family,"What a shame, Venice Beach has so much going for it. The sand, palm trees, big rollers coming in from the Pacific. Early In the morning it looks great.However, we could not stay long because my daughter was complete freaked out by the homeless people and drug users. Shouting, arguing with themselves, trying to sell you used hats, asking to finish your juice. She clung on me like her life depended on it. Even my wife was uncomfortable. We thought San Francisco had a lot of homeless people, but Venice beach seems to have a higher concentration of them, also a higher concentration of obvious drug users.So my advice is if you have a family with children, perhaps park the car for a few minutes, take pictures and leave for somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredF834

30,Not for everyone,"Homeless? yes... Junkies? yes lots of them... Dealers? may be...These are somethings you might find within the 10 blocks of tourism in Venice. And something you will not find? Easy parking for sure. We got our first american ticket here.Do not misunderstand me, I stayed there for 2 nights... it was fun, I mean all those colorful and different crazy people around, music in the streets, art, skaters everywhere, its just something you want to see.My only tip is avoid it if you are traveling with your family, and in any case be aware of the whole ¨picture¨",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulalegui
50,Even a Great White sighting couldn't keep us out of the sea...,"If this beach was in Europe it would be rammed with holidaymakers with barely a step between each the next towel, or deck chair. It would also be chokka with people badgering you selling drinks or junk jewellery, or worse those parasol hire people asking for more money. Venice Beach is expansive golden sand, warm Pacific Ocean waves and loads and loads of space. The best beach in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
10,Extremely Disappointed,"Every time we vacation in California, we miss Venice Beach. This year we finally visited and it's definitely not as beautiful as it is in the movies! The ""green"" doctors practice here, many of them, so there is drug paraphernalia everywhere. Every other shop is a drug shop and the smell of marijuana wreaks the area. Above the shops are apartments where people are high and openly passing joints. On the news when there are discussions whether to legalize marijuana, just walk along these sidewalks and imagine your town becoming ""this"". Its dirty and there are police cars in the area but they seem to keep their distance. I can't tell you how many times my son was offered pot. Unless you are into this, don't waste your time and especially do not bring small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoBeachInOK
20,Venice scum!!,"It's disturbing at Venice beach between all the (medical pot outlets) and the crazy homeless howling like crazed dogs or burnouts asking for Nuggy""s. It like the city drops off all the homeless nuts at the beach. And taking a girl, NOT, it freaked her out. I can Wupp most them fools down there it does not freak me out and I live in Hollywood so I'm use to A-holes but stay away; Go to either side of Venice, Marina Del Rey or Santa monica or Malibu for a relaxing stress free day and no one bothering you with a the solicitors and Prison inmates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerrickM576
40,A great beach to visit during the daytime.,"Venice beach is a beautiful area with lots of small shops and street stalls. The ""beach bums"" who live in the area make a living by fishing, making arts and crafts, or panhandling. You will see a large population of homeless by choice people in the area, and if that doesn't sound fun, perhaps you should go somewhere like Malibu. Most of the shops close at sunset, and the population of homeless becomes more dominant.If you go there, you should definitely check out the skate park, where you can watch some decent skateboarders and beginners alike.If you are going for a swim or beach sports, remember that the water is cold! Dive in head first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinhoy
40,Interesting and eclectic,"If you are not interested in crowds, head out here earlier in the morning. The beach is unfettered by people then and you can still catch the skateboarding enthusiasts show their skills. The stall will be in the process of being set up but they are basically selling flip-flops and other beach related stuff. Check out the surfing lessons. Worth looking out for. Look for ""safe"" parking places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahtham
50,Crazy fun!,"Just as my other reviews of this area said, this is worth it..There is just a special magic about Venice Beach, chill on the sand, walk the boardwalk, watch Muscle Beach, worth the trip for sure!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteH951
40,Something for everyone,"What an interesting stretch of coastline to walk along. Stall holders, street performers, cafes, food stalls and grassed area to sit and view the ocean. My only complaint is the continual array of signs advising no photography unless you pay (usually $1 minimum).This is free public space, if people want to take photos they should be hassled for money because of wanting a snapshot of their holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perth26_59

40,Venice Beach,"Great for people watching.....on the grittier side. Lots of ""freaks & geeks"". (Stand up Spiked hair, body piercings, tattoos), but not everyone is like this, & no one is mean spirited, most have the laid back beach vibe kind of attitude. Worth stopping to watch at skate park; muscle beach (were body builders work out); vendors alongside boardwalk (some are selling cheap commercial stuff like sunglasses, but some are genuine hand-craftsmen); skaters who perform tricks/dance. Sandy, broad beach.....water quality questionable....there are better beaches for swimming. Nice bike riding along bike path either north or south of boardwalk, but don't expect to ride through main crowd area.....just walk bike. Or better yet, stop & get an ice cream or lemonade & just watch the people go by! Lots of choices for good food.....great way to spend an easy, breezy afternoon-entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcurly1der
50,What a place!,"the boardwalk was amazing place! So many different people there to observe. Bring lots of singles with you, everybody wants your money. It is really torn up now but lots of shopping, keep valuables close. Beach is nice for relaxing views. Skate path is the place to be taking the length of the beach. Peir is a nice place to go but rides are pricey!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LTtracy
40,Go with an open mind!,"You will see oxygen bars, medical marijuana centers, cheap clothing and hats, jewelry, and art from sidewalk and stall vendors. You will see a skateboard park, muscle men exercising, homeless and tourists. I recommend strolling, then sitting and watching people. Street parking is possible if you don't mind walking a few large blocks. A walk around the canals would be a nice finish to the day, but you will need to drive and repark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnes537

10,Venice beach - ugly and dissapointing,"If you decide on a trip to Venice Beach, get ready for a really ugly piece of California. If you are into body piercings or tattoo's however this is the place for you!. The skateboard park is good and worthwhile looking at the see the amazing local skateboarders in action. As for the walk along the 'shop's at the beach front - don't bother. Keep driving north on 1 to Santa Monica where it is beautiful, clean and classy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barisings
10,Not for families.,We were stuck in traffic for over an hour getting there and paid $25 to park to wait 30 minutes in line for a bathroom. We were dressed up for a party later and WE were the freaks on Venice Beach. We walked less than a 100 feet down the strip and bugged out. There were plenty of uncomfortable comments about my wife and kids and lots of pot pushing people with business cards. It was Sunday afternoon which certainly contributed to the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Limbicsystem
50,Bizzare World,Best place to take out of towners for a day trip. Watching people is fun and and good restaurants for a cheap day at the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerVII
10,Money and time better spent elsewhere.,"I was born and raised in Venice in the 1950's thru the 60's. I spent all my teen years either at Venice or Santa Monica beaches. They were wonderful places to explore and play in. Not today. Venice Beach is a zoo inhabited by junkies, lunatics, gangs, transients and tourists. It's not the cleanest place in the world either. When I was growing up, you never saw a cop. Didn't need one. Today the beach and boardwalk in Venice is heavily patrolled so that the knucklehead tourists who believe all they hype can make it out safely with their lives and property. You like beaches. Try Redondo, Manhattan, Hermosa, Malibu and Santa Monica, north of the pier. Trust me. By the way, wait until you see what they charge you to park at or near Venice Beach. Better visit the ATM first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgard11
30,venice beach,Venice beach has gotten pretty scummy. Go for the canals and people watching. I wouldn't stay after dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyWS
10,Dirty Boardwalk,"On vacation so of course everyone thought they had to see Venice Beach, what a dissappointment. Boardwalk is filthy, beaches are littered, bathrooms are disgusting lots of innapropriate words for young children. Would not recommend this for anyone, unless they had a strong desire just to say you have been there. Also plan on spending $25.00 a day to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KDWDLW55
40,Beach Side,Venice Beach has a lot of room to move. You don't feel like you're sitting right on the next person. Right behind the beach is the boardwalk of shops. Very relaxed atmosphere and good for any audience. Tough to find free parking. The best place to park is off Barnard Way. Only $8 at the time I went; compared with $20 for a lot of the areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjdavids649
10,Not What We Expected,Beach very nice but everything else is run down and dirty the broadwalk is filled with homeless people shouting and swearing at each other it was very off puttingIt's such a shame that such a nice place has become very rough would not go again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weirhammer

30,Beach is nice but that's about it,"The actual walkway is pretty sketchy and dirty. Lots of shops with all the same merchandise- had a ""freak show"" there which pretty much sums up the area. I think I'd just do the Santa Monica Pier, which we loved, and the beach there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857JenniferM

40,Venice Beach - you MUST experience it!,"If you are a people watcher, you MUST not miss a walk on Venice Beach. Weekends are crowded, so if you can go during the week, you will likely enjoy it more. We rented bikes and biked all the way down the beach to Santa Monica, the bike sidewalks are great but watch out for roller bladers. There are amazing gymnists performing for tips, an outdoor gym (muscle beach), shops and eateries all along the boardwalk. Just keep your kids under your watchful eye, as there are ALL sorts of people hanging out here and be sure not to touch anything if you use the public restrooms! Every time we visit the Los Angeles area, we visit Venice Beach - I'm not even kidding. Always something interesting happening to talk about later!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMsCMR
40,Venice Beach is worth it for the people watching,"Tons of stuff to do here! Lots of shops and vendors along the main strip and side streets. If you want to eat, eat at Big Daddy's Pizza! We had the fried pizza and fried oreos!!! Amazing! Tons of shops, but...I would look at all the vendors before buying as there are always a cheaper place to buy that hat or t-shirt, and it's okay to haggle! Fresh fruit cups and chocolate dipped bananas, and fish tacos are here as well! Many places take credit cards but I would also bring cash, as you may want to give a donation to the many street performers! And don't forget to go on the beach!! Smooth sand and an amazing view as you look back onto the boardwalk! Fun for the whole family!! Parking is available at parking garages and can vary from $10 to $20 during the day, after 4pm our parking garage was charging $25, still this is a great place to stop before heading to Santa Monica Beach which is next door!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suntraveler1977
30,What happened,"It's been about 13 yrs. since I last went to VB I loved it back then but it was a bit of a disappointment now. Way to many homeless beggers on the walk now. Marijuna shops dot the store fronts, feels much more seedy and gritty than before. It seem to have lost it's energy. I would not recommed this for anything but a quick walk by in the early afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonnyru49
50,Enjoy Venice Beach by renting a bike,"The best way to enjoy Venice Beach is to rent a bike and get on the bike path that rides up to Santa Monica (and beyond) and down to the far southern edges of Venice Beach (I think the trail markings said it is 17 miles long). I can't recommend a bike shop because we just ended up at one that was close to wear we parked. The bikes weren't great, but it didn't matter. We rode about 3 miles to the Santa Monica pier and rode the roller coaster and then rode back. As you get the bike out to trail, you'll get to enjoy plenty of Venice Crazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carynctraveler98
40,Gotta See Venice,"Well .... Venice has some of the most entertaining, interesting, odd people to watch. Its fun to see the skateboard park, mini tennis courts and street performers. A real mixture of shops, bars and cafes. Keep your eyes open and hand on your wallet. Lots of folks touting the benefits of the ""herb"" and smoking it too. Lots of requests for $$$ from various peoples. Quite wacky and probably not for the very young. It's a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kzecb40
50,Always on my list when visiting LA,"Venice is a fun mixture of trendy, whacky and plain fun. After years of visiting I still very much enjoy each visit. During this trip we discovered Abbot Kinney, a fun street with lots of shops, restaurants, bars and food trucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotalot
30,"Venice Beach, Los Angeles, CA","If you like to people watch, this is the place for you. Lots of interesting folks to watch, and the skateboard park had some great riders. the street performers were worth the stop at this beach. Cons... every 100 feet or so, someone from the ""green doctors"" was trying to get you to come in to their ""clinic"" to get your medical marijuana card. The worst part were the bathrooms.. beyond filthy! After seeing the condition of the public restrooms (feces on the walls), I asked a shop owner where my daughter might find a clean public restroom. She replied quietly ""don't let her use one of the public ones, here she can use ours"". All in all, a fun few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamie3210

50,Loved it!,"I did not find it unsavory in the least. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people. The bathrooms however are horrible. Try to avoid those at all costs. Do expect to tip the people who are giving shows. For many of them this is how they earn a living. There are some great artist here of all kinds. There are ""doctors"" on every corner, but I wasn't offended. To each his own. I never felt uncomfortable or afraid of the people as some of the reviews have suggested. This is a great place to people watch and the shops are great for finding some souvenirs. I enjoyed Venice more than the Santa Monica Pier. The skate park was fun to watch and had a large mix of people skating there, everything from a 7 year old to a 45 year old, and both were just as good as the others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kim_Leland
50,Everything Under the Sun,"One of my favorite places anywhere. To find parking, you must arrive early. Stroll slowly along the many open air shops where you can buy a Bob Marly tshirt, smell incense wafting through the air as you observe street artists and musicians. There are many bars, restaurants, and hotels where you can get a quick bite or a boozy meal to satisfy a warm day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angier287

We had brunch at a restaurant facing the beach which was nice for the seabreeze, but otherwise uneventful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justtojess
40,Very unique!,"Venice Beach is a really unique place. The beach doesn't boast of any exquisite vistas as such but it is a very interesting place to go to. It is a great place to buy knickknacks and souvenirs - hilarious t-shirts, hats, jewelry, flip flops etc. And if gluttony is your thing, there are a few places for dessert (a la fried oreo and ice cream)... definitely recommend the funnel cake. There are also a bunch of nice places to eat around that area. The thing that irritates most people is the bunch of marijuana dispensaries there and how they try to woo you in not the most subtle of ways. Additionally, the beach attracts a slightly hippie crowd which may get a little overwhelming. So you definitely need to be careful. I won't suggest going to the beach at night.All in all, I'd give Venice Beach a 3.5.. it is definitely above average but it is not for everyone. I have taken family and friends visiting us and they have enjoyed the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rumblingstrips
40,Venice,Cool stores and restaurants to check out. Interesting street vendors. It's the beach! What's not to love?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/losinginla
10,Don't take your children here!,"I was so disappointed at the condition of this beach, and boardwalk. The homeless have taken it over and are just camped out everywhere you look, watch where you step at the sand because you might step someone. Its very sad. But also very scary due to the bums being aggressive and angry with each other and stangers. There are marijuana stands with people pretending to be nurses trying to get you to come in for a 40$ marijuana evaluation. We went on a Sunday , can't imagine how bad it is at night. The city of LA needs to do something about this place. As we walked out of the venice beach area to Santa Monica it was like leaving hell and entering the land of white sand, beautiful kites and smiling people. Stay in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaL573
10,Stay away!!!,"After seeing this spot from the East Coast for 40+ years, we thought we would like to see it for ourselves. What a mistake!

It's pretty entertaining watching these STREET BALL TOURNAMENTS...you will see some of the former AND 1 cast...shouts to my boy and schoolmates SIK WIT IT & THE GRINCH.

Shop fronts selling plenty of tat...no idea what possesses people to pay for it and a huge number of medicinal marijuana joints...not sure how these get by but they do.

Some rays of sunshine include surfing and some great looking beaches, but anything more inland than where the seaweed comes to shore is disgusting.Plenty of homeless people living off the tourists and not giving a hoot, smelly, dirty, and somehow that level of hygiene has slowly started to work its way into the common goes.

50,A place with great personality!,"I have read reviews of Venice Beach that said it was a seedy place, and etc., but we loved it. The wonderful murals and the personalities on the beach only added to the feel of the beach. You are never self-conscious in a place that treasures such individuality. It was extrememly dog-friendly also. I love that it still has that 60s vibe to it. The Morrison mural is a treasured memory, too. The beach itself is very pretty, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenH639

50,What a wierd and wonderful place to see,"Venice beach is something else. It's a place that demonstrates all walks of life co-existing. From the Muscle men walking their muscly dogs to the shaved headed punks sporting multiple body piercings , this place is full of life. Get yourself a drink and just go for a stroll down the boardwalk or just sit and watch the world go by.

It was a three to four hours walk of contrasts and proved very enjoyable. We stopped and had brunch at The Venice Ale House - very good value and tasty food. The variety of people out and about made our day very entertaining : many families, locals, tourists, teenagers, skateboarders, the theatrical, the egotistical, the homeless and the musclebound !Plenty of opportunities to pick up souvenirs and watch buskers.

I did not see the muscle-bound guys, though.This still earns a 2 star for some of the interesting art you will see there. They make art out of anything it seems. Cans, bottles, and junk. I like that type of art.The skateboarders are totaly annoying!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrobertlucas
10,"Filthy, full of homeless and dirty hippies! Just repulsive.","I thought this would be a modern artistic area, I'ts not, it's just hundreds of homeless, dirty hippies and potheads. The beach is full of rubbish, there is no way I would ever walk on that sand without shoes!All the food establishments looked dirty. I did not dare leave my hostel after dusk. It's just a very sleazy area.This area could be so nice. It's a shame the council doesn't do anything to fix it up. A lot of tourists come here, I bet most of them are as shocked as I was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbellaRose
30,Always interesting,"It's not the cleanest beach, but there is always something interesting to see- from the dancing seaweed man to the muscle-bound bodies working out at Venice, there is always something to see. I have fun shopping at the stands that are setup too. Then after the beach shopping, you can go yo Main Street and shop at a very unique store. Then you can head over to Abbot-Kinney street for a nice dinner or even have some wine tasting at Primativo. There is always a unique restaurant to find in Venice. La vecchia is my favrite italian restaurant there. The service is fair but the food is great. I have never ordered spaghetti, but here they give you about 7 juicy meatballs. I love the flavor. The brushetta is very good too! Chaya is another good place. World Cafe has comedy nights. I stumble upon unique places too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancin_12
30,Over Rated Beach,"Venice is like any beach there is nothing special about it. However, it has 2 nice things, first is has a wide area for skaters and the second is the Bike Path that connects it with Santa Monica Beach. Its sunny most of the year, but the ocean water is a cold and you defiantly cannot swim during April & May , may be in August in will be suitable for swimming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rihams

30,Famous beach,"At Venice you get to see entire spectrum of Life. Street performers, homeless and surfers just to mention some.The boardwalk is famous and part of Los Angeles scene, therefore worth visiting. You can recognize place also from many movies. I would not choose VB for beach day, but to take a walk on the boardwalk one direction and then loop back through canal streets to watch houses etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mWrite
30,"Interesting, but not interesting enough for another visit","We visited Venice Beach on April 20 (4-20), which as it turns out is a rather auspicious day. Between the man wearing a majiauana inspired, green suit and the hustlers working the boardwalk for the medical clinics, we couldn't tell much about what a ""normal"" day on the boardwalk might be like. Still, the clinics are there all the time, whether it's majiauana appreciation day or not, so Venice Beach probably isn't the place for those who are easily offended. The people watching is not to be beat, but the beach and the boardwalk at Santa Monica are more to my liking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scout1960
20,Not Worth The Trip,The beach water here like most LA beaches is very dirty. The place is littered with filth. The area smells like urine and pot. There's bums and stoners everywhere. There's plenty of crude and crazy people that need to watch their mouths. The food here also tastes crappy. I didn't see many families and I kind see why. This place is not oriented for families. If your ghetto or don't mind ghetto people its okay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinH976
20,I would skip.,A tacky carnival experience. Not for everyone. A nice beach but crummy atmosphere for little kids or families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoffmansbck
40,THE LA beach,"Venice Beach is your standard LA beach, full of surfers, stoners, and hipsters, street-performers, hobos and all around interesting characters. If you're visiting you kind of have to come to the beach just to say you did it. It's not going to make you a better person or teach you anything, but you'll have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596aarong

30,It´s getting worse...,"I´ve been there in the past and like it a lot. Specialy on the weekends.This time, though, a crowd of guys trying to sell things (mostly CDs) made the walk around the streets and stores a rather unconfortable. They can sure be pushy sometimes.There should be policeman in the area.A quick visit would not hurt! 30 min should do it but watch over your things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricik

40,Lots to do here,"We spent the entire day here. Great skatepark, enormous beach, plenty of vendors, and all types of food options. Plentiful bathrooms too. It's about a 2-mile walk to Santa Monica pier up the boardwalk. The vendors were not pushy for the most part, but be prepared to pay $1 to take a picture of people. If you get volunteered for the break-dancing show be prepared to pay a lot more. The medical marijuana exam booths were pretty funny. They must be doing good business because nearly this entire area smells like pot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy500Fans

50,One of My Favorite Places in L.A.,"If you are looking for a nice wide beach with soft sand, lively action along a boardwalk filled with interesting characters, beautiful views of Santa Monica Bay, decent food and drink and all kinds of stuff to buy, this is your spot. There is definitely a semi carnival like atmosphere going on here. The weather is usually gorgeous and people watching does not get better than Venice Beach. Parking can get expensive so park on the street a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmhersh
30,Eclectic and a little bit of the edgier side of L.A.,"It's fun to come and explore the little local retail, the beach and the wild group of characters hanging out to entertain you. However, I would caution you to come during the daytime since the nearby neighborhood is a little more on the rougher side of things and you will see some people around anxious to take advantage of tourists if you don't watch your wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdeenen_canada

40,Great place to peoplewatch!!,"I had never been to Venice Beach before, but I heard it was a ""eclectic"" little place. Boy, they weren't kidding. People of all looks, shapes, sizes, backgrounds, etc. walking around in one small place. The beach was beautiful, but it's not summer so I'm sure it would be crazy had it been warmer. Lots of touristy type shops on the boardwalk. They really keep the area free from trash that you so often see in high traffic areas. Nice, pretty place to sit and watch people for hours! I loved it!!The downfalls...medical marijuana is pushed in your face quite often, whether you are looking or not. The traffic is HORRIBLE in and out of there. Parking rates change as the nicer weather does.I will go back though, for sure. We had a great time. I enjoyed the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaM0310

50,"No question: a must do!""","We went to Venice Beach on a cooler day with kids ranging from 10-16 yrs old! Really fun time for the whole family. We got there late morning, and although many shops were open, things really started picking up after lunch with street entertainment, more vendors being open, and seeing the ""skateboarding dog"". Free entertainment and great, inexpensive food. The skate park is really fun to see amazing athletes do their thing! Definitely a must-do for any CA vacationer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karajake

Although that is not my thing it was fun to see the people and happy go lucky way of life. We must have walked forever and it was a beautiful day. The location is secure and clean even though there are many homeless people. There was even a group of over 300 inner city school kids visiting and cleaning the beach. I think it was a class project and good for them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derwood35

30,All our European visitors want to see Venice Beach...,"Great fun for all the quirkiness that is California. The walk along the beach path is great for people watching, the buskers, muscle men and women and every other oddity that you can only imagine.

50,Eclectic.. Not as prim & proper as Santa Monica,"Artists, homeless, beautiful, not beautiful.. Everyone fits in Venice beach. This is the backdop of all the LA movies but it's real life. Plenty of shops to hunt or barter, everyday drama in the streets involving those on the upside and also those on the bottom side of life. Come as you are at see the real side of california. It's not bad. If you want something more sterile then head north a few miles to Santa Monica beach pier. Both have merit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davecannon

50,One of the coolest beaches in CA,I have been almost 9 different beaches in CA and I can say that this is one of the best...I have been there for around 5 hours and it was very enjoyable experience....There are many shops for clothes and glasses....many sports activities going on during the day time...water is very clean...There is one group which play music and you can also play some instruments there and dance....Sunset was very good and one of the best sunset I have ever seen......This is definitely one of the best beaches in CA..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/premalm2018
50,A Place to go in LA,"If you are in LA or around LA. I would strongly suggest you to pay a visit to Venice Beach. The culture, people is so Artsy and really enjoyed my day here. If you dont have too much time, then, walked around and make a pit stop at one of those restaurants along the beach side for food. Facing the ocean and in the sun, you will enjoy your food better. It's a pleasant walk and you will appreciate once you go there. There are plenty of shop to shop around and definitely recommend you to try the fresh squeezed juice or the lemonade by the beach. It was super tasty. If you have more time, wear your sneakers and rent a bicycle, tour around the entire Venice beach like a local. This is something you must do if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PremK_11
40,Great place for some interesting sights!,"Parking varies around here. There are a few lots, that are priced based on how busy the area is.

A little more grimy than Santa Monica, but I think thats what makes it so great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hzrudegirl
40,Different,"Venice Beach is full of ""interesting"" shops and stands -- mostly artists selling their own handmade work. The culture seems completely different.

30,Not Family Friendly,"Um, well I didn't expect it to be ""family friendly"" but I thought I would throw it out there. And truly, we didn't see many families much at all. The reason I say this is because, now and again you catch a smell of marijuana, and ""things"" are being burnt by vendors...I wouldn't call it incense ..not really sure what the purpose of it is, but it stinks, badly. Odd people roam around (which doesn't bother me or my kids (12, 10, 2)--but may bother other families)...many beggers, etc. Nothing much for kids to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwinklinBrwnEyes79
40,A must for tourists!,"Venice Beach is one of those places you must see to understand its appeal. In the summer many people actually sun bathe but the white sand is not its principal attraction... it is the walkway that is parallel to the beach. There are many gift shops, medical marijuana vendors, little fast food places. One can walk up and down and enjoy people watching ... and there are all kinds of people there! Many freaks, homeless youths and wannabe rappers and street artists. ! You need at least two full hours to walk leisurely the length of the principal and fun part of the promenade. Parking is a challenge though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dasmarek
30,Hippie haven,I don't quite get the fascination myself but my daughter and any visitors we have from out of the country seem to love Venice Beach. The scent of pot is everywhere and the vendors selling the knockoffs are fun to visit. I was a bit nervous when I waited in my car for friends to return. Homeless man seemed to be protecting my car?

30,Remember Muscle Beach,Again this beach which is quite close to Santa Monica is very busy on the weekend. The problem is there are too many things going on at the same time.

30,Seen better days,"Spent a gorgeous, 74F Christmas eve afternoon at the Venice Boardwalk. The stores have, sadly, gone downhill in the last few years. There used to be some interesting shops with wares other than bongs and tee shirts, but most are gone. The vendors on the beach side of the boardwalk sell cheap junk and are putting even more pressure on the ""brick and mortar"" businesses who have to pay rent, so the whole place spirals downward.Other than Harry Carey, the iconic, smiling man dressed in white, on roller skates who plays the electric guitar while he cruises the boardwalk, the entertainers were third rate at best. (By the way, visitors, Harry Carey is not ""the human q-tip"" as I've seen him described on other Trip Advisor reviews. Just because you've never seen a turban before does not give you the right to make up such a bigoted name for him. Jeez!)The tee shirts, which we wanted, were fairly pricey and the vendors nasty. Every time we picked one up to see size and design, a clerk ran over to sigh, cluck, and make all kinds of unhappy noises while she/he refolded the shirt.There were plenty of places where the doctor was in for a medical maryjane consult.There were 3 generations of us - my 18 yo daughter, me, and my mom (86 yo). We stopped in a couple of bong shops for laughs and the clerks were really nice (even changed the rude music for my mother). The guys who try to get you to listen to their CDs were actually low key and funny.Mom had a good hot dog and lemonade (fresh squeezed) from the Jody Maroni stand. In all, an entertaining couple of hours, but I don't think worth going out of your way for the beach, street performers, or shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017

I would recommend leaveing before dark....give yourslf 6 hours atleast to walk ALOT down the miles of shops and views....not many people were actually on teh beach or swimming...mostly shoppers and tourists",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegasphotoman1
50,Great fun,"We walked along the path from the pier to Venice Beach itself. It was a gorgeous day and lots were out for us to look at. We loved it, spent the morning had lunch at a little take away shop, rested, did some people watching and then back for another look around. Lots of little bits in bobs to buy. We purchased fridge magnets. Cheap ""we love USA"" tees. Lots of Botox by the beach shops. If you are into that. Checked out Muscle beach, outside gym, where a couple of heavies were working out. Then walked around to Arnold's Gym, Golds gym. We then caught the bus back to the pier and our hired Mustang Converitable.Glad we took the time to walk the walk. Would do the same again next time we are in the US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyndas458
50,Awesome!,We went to Venice Beach this past July and it was awesome! There are a lot of interesting things to see. Venice Beach was one of my favorite places to visit while in California. There are also a lot of little shops with reasonably priced souvenirs. I'd love to go back in the future!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy1108
50,Great Beach,"There were alot of reviews that left us a little nervous about going here but this place is great. The beach area was great but the stores and performers along the boardwalk are what makes this place. All you need to do is politely refuse to take any of the music CD's that are offered, offer a few dollars for any performers that you watch and all is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gillamite
50,A joy to wake up to,"Staying on Venice Beach at the Cotel Hostel, I woke up every morning to the beach. It is a hive of activity and a pleasure to walk along. We swam, ate, drank, played, cycled, rollerbladed along Venice beach. It made my holiday as amazing as I remember it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DomoniqueJ
30,Stuck in the late 90's,"As an Australian, I've seen plenty of great beaches, and this one looked fairly average with only a very small swell, not enough waves to make a good surfer stay out. But, there were dozens of surfers out there! Maybe just for show?The shops along the beach walk looked like they hadn't moved past the 90's obsession with band t-shirts and services offering braids in hair.Couldnt get the sense that one person there acting genuinely. It's also testosterone city, lots of loud swearing and aggressive behavior. As a single woman traveller, it was a bit scary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah11eleven

40,"Strange, interesting and fun!","We rented bicycles and rode about 3 miles from Santa monica to Venice Beach. You must do this if you can! The bike trail is on the beach. We had so much fun people watching and taking in the scenery. We locked our bikes up at Venice Beach and took some time to walk around the crazy markets. People were selling everything from massages to shrunken heads. I had never seen a stranger, more eclectic group of people in my life. What a great and memorable day!I would not reccomend this for families with young children. It is more appropriate for couples/adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BostonGirl978
40,Interesting!!!,"I wanted to see Venice Beach it see the local ""flavor""! It was very interesting! There were ALL kinds of people there, which was expected. I loved people watching while there. I also walked the actual beach while there & loved it! The water was cold, but that didn't stop the surfers! I enjoyed watching them even though the waves weren't very good. I found a lot of sea shells which I love collecting. Definitely a place I'd like to go back too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgsdks

40,California comes alive,"Venice Beach is very close to Santa Monica (where we were staying). We went with the Big Blue Bus, and it's a very pleasant and short ride. If you're staying in Santa Monica, you'll find Venice Beach to be a more colorful and lively place. We particularly strolled along the boardwalk, where there's a lot of shops, skaters and grafitti to enjoy. The Muscle Beach point is really curious too. I wouldn't stay there at night though, but it is a very beautiful beach to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlineRocha
40,A very special beach,"I've been to many beaches and Venice Beach is definitely the most unique one! We took the bus from Union Station to Venice Beach; after spending 2.5 hours on the bus we finally got there. Venice Beach is clean and has its own colour. You can not only enjoy clear water and soft sand there, also you can do a bit shopping by the street. They have lots of funny t-shirt and mugs; also you can get snacks such as churros and hot dogs. Though it's a bit far from downtown, Venice Beach is a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imtuz
30,Very nice can be a bit busy,We were at the south end of beach in the morning. Was not crowded yet. We enjoyed watching surfers from the fishing peir and had great food at the terrace cafe. The boardwalk part was crowded by noon and ad a lot of homeless. I prefer santa monica beach. But the side roads and town of venice was very nice and everyone we met was friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcwifle
30,Not sure what all the hype is about,"I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Venice Beach. Not an especially beautiful beach. But if you like tourist shops selling t-shirts, jewellry, 'marijuana and other trinkets (as well as the market stalls) and the odd busker then this is for you. We did however enjoy lunch at The SidewalkCafe. Delicious and great service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozzieoioioi
30,Good to see but would recommend a short visit,We went here as part of a tour so only got to spend 20 mins here but I think that was probably enough. Gave us enough time to see muscle beach and the board walk. Go to the wc (dont go if you dont have too the toilets were pretty grim!) and a lot of tramps hanging around.We went to Santa Monica beach after this and spent the rest of the day there - it is a much better area to spend your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasha011
10,Hoboville USA,"Wow, what could be such a nice place an overun homeless beach community in Southern California. My advice stay muscle beach northward. I would never take children south of the Santa Monica pier. It's a shame because it could be such great beach area. They maintain the beach, the sidewalks and restrooms but when you have 1000's of homeless people you can clean the path or beach all you want and it's still not a desirable place to spend your time or money. Won't be back to this area for a long, long time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradlScottReviews
50,Village feel in this sprawling City,"I visited friends in Venice last Friday & I forgot how delightful the place is. I walked YES walked around Venice & that is the beauty of the place, it's like a village in Los Angeles. You can walk to the beach, to shops (independent & not chain) & to bars and cafes.We started off at Abbot Kinney Boulevard, had coffee and toured the art galeries, then headed to the beach to sample all the weird & wonderful delights of Venice beach & boardwalk.This place is a gem in Los Angeles, filled with characters and a unique sight around every corner, including the canals. It's no wonder so many artists reside here, as it feels like an inspirational place to call home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joseph-Glasgow
40,Well that was different...,"Interesting place to visit, wouldn't want to live there. Enjoyed many hours of people-watching and street photography.

40,Weird but wonderful. Strange but stunning. Bizarre but beautiful,"We visited here after Santa Monica and preferred this place the best. You see it all along this beach and broadwalk. There are a few homeless just chilling, some selling strange items. One guy had a sign around his neck saying 'Kick my a** for $1'.There are various eateries, mainly snack food, all trying to undercut one another, so some bargains. Some souvenir shops one one side and locals selling their home made crafts on the other side.You can even visit the marijuana clinic!! We didn't!The beach is big, golden, clean and lovely. At no time did we feel unsafe or threatened. We felt very safe at all times. So glad we came here, it's very weird, but wonderful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PassportUK
50,You must stop by Venice Beach if in the area!,"We stopped by here on a Sunday morning. We had heard varying reviews on the area. There is a very diverse crowd so it is excellent for people watching. Lots of vendors (basically a flea market) selling all sorts of random things. The beach was nice. The skate park was so neat to watch! The skaters there are very talented! Lots of suffers were out, too! I recommend going to Venice Beach when in the LA area. I will make it a point to stop by there if in LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karen9999999

40,Don't Be Fooled By The Negative Reviews,"Any negativity about Venice has to be from people who've never visited South Street in Philly, Reeperbahn in Hamburg Germany, Hells Kitchen, or any other semi seedy place in a major city. This is what gives Venice its character, charm, amusement, flavor, vibe, etc. The homeless aren't that agressive, nor are the people who are trying to give you their CD's for money. A ""No, Thank You"" and keep on walking is no foul. Get some backbone people! Yes, there are Medicinal Dr. Check ups along the way but it just comes across as funny. It's basically a street carnival. Cheap entertainment for the casual stroller down the strip. There are some good buys on clothing and other wears if you know your prices. This place is definitely worth of walk through. And don't forget to check out the skate park. Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrZeek
40,A 'Marmite' place - you either love it or hate it,"We spent 4 days around Venice Beach, staying at the Hotel Erwin. We're easy-going travellers with grown up kids (20 & 18) and we loved the energy and vibe of the Boardwalk. I can imagine it could be a little intimidating for young and inexperienced travellers, but if you're happy and willing to say 'no' when offered CDs or the opportunity to 'contribute' to one of the many hangers-on who frequent the place, then you'll just breathe in the atmosphere (and possibly the odd whiff of pot) and enjoy the unique vibe of the place.We weren't interested in any of the alternative medicines offered by some of the stalls, but the people are interesting, quirky and if you take it all in your stride with a big smile on your face, you'll have a great time.It does feel a little more shady after dark - and it didn't feel like the sort of area to be strolling without a purpose or destination. Having said that, we found a Chinese and a Thai retaurant close to the hotel which were both good (the Chinese - Mao's Kitchen - was excellent) and I had no concerns about walking around the area if you had a destination to head towards.It's unique, quirky, fascinating, in-your face and, if you just want to chill on the beach, then you'll enjoy that too... but my advice is to check out the boardwalk. Your holiday will be less enriched if you don't dive in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricOlthwaite
40,There is nothing you won't see here.,"I have enjoyed Venice Beach a few times now, and I don't understand why anyone would be afraid with so many people around. You will see everything here, you're not in Kansas anymore! Most of the vendors and stores are the same-old but I always buy something - a cheap ring and ice cream today. But the motto of Venice Beach is ""Keep it weird"" and do they ever. I've brought my kids here, but it's not for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharireid65
40,Nice morning walk by the ocean,"Visiting Venice beach was one of the best things we did in LA; 9:30 in the morning, by the beach. Fresh ocean air, people walking, running or biking. The ocean, the sand and surfers are first things that come into my mind. The Fishing Pier gives a perfect view of all the coastline of LA (Santa Monica and even Malibu beaches) and walking in the area of Venice canals is really worth it: there are beautiful beach houses by the beach and the canals that one can admire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaliThessaloniki
20,Not a place for the older generation.,We walked there from the hotel and there were lots of strange people and sights to see. Made me kind od nervous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TICPEN
50,"Nice beach, interesting boardwalk","First of all, if strange people turn you off then this isn't the place for you. Me and my family, including two teenagers and a 5 year-old, have no problem in this type of place as long as it's safe (which we did). We parked in the lot right next to the beach (the sand 5 feet from our car), behind to the paddle-tennis courts. This lot is 9 dollars. We showed up on a Friday at noon. Seemed strange that so many people were parking in the $20 lots out on Venice Blvd. and the other pay lots on the side streets when there were plenty of spots available in the main lot. In fact, even when we left at 4pm there were still quite a few open spots. We spent a few hours on the beach, the water was nice, the sand was clean, the weirdos seemed to be away from the water and more towards the boardwalk, which is what we wanted for our beach time. Perfect! Then we took a stroll down the boardwalk, picked up a few souvenirs in the shops and booths, got something to eat. I was hoping Friday afternoon wouldn't be too much less ""happening"" than a Saturday, and it was just fine. There were pretty good crowds and quite a few of the street performers still out. It was actually a bit better than the Saturday I went because, though fairly crowded, it wasn't so busy that you had to putt along as though being herded down the street. As for the dangers of the area, I think the real crazy homeless people and the young, tough-guy types who think they own the area. It's not a huge amount of these people, but there are some and you just need to avoid them. You see some homeless person talking to himself or acting very weird, don't stare, just keep going, no problems. Some of the street vendors are very pushy, don't even respond to them just keep on walking and looking at other things as if you don't even know they are talking to you. Yeah, this seems really rude and like it might tick them off, but my experience was that their attention would quickly go to the next pedestrian instead. If I tried to be polite and decline, or make some small talk, it would be MUCH harder to get rid of them. If anything just glance at them, shake your head no, keep walking and looking ahead. Some will make a comment like your being rude, whatever. Like they say, ""When in Rome...""Some other tips and observations:- You will see medical pot shops about every 4th shop. If you're a pot head this is the place for you, you can get evaluated and given a prescription before heading back home.- The pizza at the little shops SUCKS! Don't know about any of the places they might make it to order (if their are any), but all of the others taste just like the worst, cheapest, simplest frozen pizzas you buy at the grocery store. The hot dogs are pretty much the same and I don't have much faith in anything else. There is a little side street (I think it's Westminster) that has tiny little fronts for sushi, giro, sandwiches shops and they all seem to be made-to-order. I ordered from the first one, they had hot dogs, turkey burgers, lots of other stuff. They were very slow but that's cuz they were actually making it to order and it was all pretty good.- Check out the Venice Beach Freak Show, if seeing stuff like 2 headed reptiles and someone hammering a nail into their nose or stapling money onto their chest doesn't bother you. It's $5 and well worth it, as long as you watch the show that goes with it.- Pitch in a buck or two if you stop to watch a street performers act. They entertained you, they earned it. At least they're not standing on the corner of a street with a sign.- Bathrooms aren't pleasant. If you are in the water make sure to pee while you're there. If you have to go #2...I feel sorry for you.- If you don't go to the beach 1-2 hours here should be fine. We did the beach too and spent 4 here.- Bring some cash, I wouldn't suggest using the sketchy looking ATM machines around the shops.- Visit early and be gone by nightfall. Yeah, I said I felt perfectly safe here, but I would never take the chance after dark, whole other story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruxpin951

40,"Okay beach, Fun place to hang out","The beach is not the best in CA but it is a fun place to go. Drinking is not allowed but it'snot enforced too strongly, so you can drink a little but... don't go overboard tho.. Water's not bad at all, like I said, its not the best but its definitely worth going in and you can catch some waves as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregStone
40,"Fun place to visit, if you dislike alternative lifestyle people, this is not the place for you!","I really like Venice Beach, I think it it a fun place to visit. It has a really nice pier that is great for sightseeing, a nice stroll and relaxation. The locals like to fish from it. The beaches are clean and well supervised, on a good day it can provide smaller swell for learn to surf groups and a larger swell for more experienced surfers as well as nice paddling and swimming areas. Watch out for rips, which were marked with flags.The boardwalk is a very colourful area, with people from all walks of life. The sidewalk market has all the usual clothing, bag, sunglasses etc as well as 'medical marijuana' stall and smoking implements. These are fairly unobtrusive. If you object then The Venice Boardwalk is not for you. Rent bikes for you and your family and cycle or skate along the great beachfront cycle paths supplied.There are a lot of entertainers/preachers/beggars/stall owners along this area... Some brilliant, some not so brilliant. If you get a chance to check out a young group of around 6 young African/American doing an act based on gymnastic moves you will be well entertained. They have a very slick routine that is in parts amazing, funny, zany and also promotes a good anti drugs message to the kids in the audience. Definitely worth your time and a few dollars dropped in one of their buckets.I have never been hassled, pick pocketed or disgusted by anything in this area. I have always felt safe and enjoy returning again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aly0808
50,GREAT!!,We really enjoyed our trip to venice / Santa Monica. A few pointers- parking is available on srreet if you are willing to walk a bit if not it varies from $8 to $!5. Bike rentals are from $6 to $10 so shop around.Santa monica pier has arcades and other fun things the venice pier is simpler. I feel they are both worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TREK39
10,Very unsafe. Never visiting again.,"Venice Beach is full of shady people. A group will walk up to you and surround you, hoping to flog their merchandise.I had to pay a shady man $20, just so I could get away.Never walk alone.

I dont think the folks that left negative reviwes have ever had dirty fingernails. Venice Beach is CLEAN (except for the public bathroom on the Beach) . Yes there are homeless people, yes there are folks selling medical marijuana (which is LEGAL). We enjoyed the beach & watching the people at the skate park. Lots to see & do.

10,"Very rundown, dirty and unsavoury","We arrived in Santa Monica and the first place we wanted to see was Venice Beach, we strolled from the Santa Monica Pier all the way to Muscle Beach (quite a long walk at least 1 hour) and what a TOTAL waste of our time and energy. This place is very tired, rundown and dirty along the way you are continously harassed by people selling crap, their own music or someone asking you if you can spare some money. Muscle Beach area was the biggest disappointment of all, not at all what you see in brochures or travel sites. You are also continously asked if you would like to purchase a prescription for marijuana and there seems to be a shopfront every 50 metres or so. This was the only place in a 3 and a half week holiday that we found unsavoury and felt unsafe. Do not believe the hype about this place, do not take your children and don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diron5
40,Total fun as long as you don't get offended,"What a blast! It's California preening at its best. But beware that this is not the place for beautiful people; these are rejects, wanna-be hipsters, and the ultra-tattooed. Probably it's mostly suburban California kids who want to be cool. But it's still totally fun. We walked the commercial stretch and laughed at the guys hawking Kush or their self-produced CDs. We checked out the muscle guys at the outdoor gym, and we marveled at the agility and the trash-talking of the guys on the basketball courts (even if they couldn't make a shot!). However, keep in mind that the people are rude, tacky and loud. This is an in-your-face place, not for people who want to relax. Oh, and you'll have to park several blocks away if you arrive after noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allen1000
30,interesting,"I'd been going to venice since I was a kid and always thought it was pretty fun. Funny t shirts, weird street performers and some pretty impressive artists. people watching is great for the most part. Now the downside. If you are looking for a beautiful laid back beach environment DON'T go here. Pretty dirty. The homeless seem a little more belligerent than they do most other places. Also last time I went some ""rapper"" tried selling me a cd which imo sucked. I declined after listening which caused him to seem a little mad. This kind of thing could probably shake up a less street smart tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rayandgabby

20,"Dirty, smelly waste of time","I am kind of late in writing a review, but figured better late than never.Totally agree with posters who commented on urine smell of entire area. Visited while on vacation with my adult daughter, found a parking space on a side street 1/2 block from the beach on a weekday afternoon in September. Nice sunny day. Vomit on sidewalk in two spots while walking. Discarded cups and bottles on sidewalks along the way.Walked a bit on the asphalt ""boardwalk"" area. Pushy hucksters abound. Neither me nor daughter found it to be in any way worth spending more than 15 minutes.I will say, daughter rides bicycle, so she got up and out early each morning and pedaled along the beach path. She liked that. But said she saw ""huddled lumps of blankets"" on the beach - these are vagrants sleeping it off.My thoughts about the whole place is 'What the hell is wrong with the city fathers here?""If you want to see a beach, go on up to Santa Monica or better yet up to Zuma Beach at Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaPittsburgh94
10,DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS,The second we left out truck we heard homeless men calling eachother vulgar names in front of our four daughters. Then we get to the beach to walk the shops your being harassed by come see the Dr. The Dr is in with people holding their huge MARIJUANA SIGNS. Theirs a guy their who loves to sing a song called give me some money so I can buy alchohol hey atleast the guy was honest I heard someone walking buy say. It was very terrible the young girls were mouthy repeatadly repeating things I would say to my children which had nothing to do with anyone else. I will never bring my kids again. Nor would I go for just My husband and I. Also at this one shop where I loved the shirts the guy has signs everywhere NO YOU MAY NOT TRY ON CLOTHES.

10,A site for the stoned homeless and strays of society,"Venice Beach may have been beautiful within 10 years of its creation (some 50 years ago) however the canals have been replaced with roads and the streets are dirty and littered with homeless.A stroll down the blvd will leave you dismayed at how such a place can be promoted as a tourist destination. The stench of urine is overwhelming and the beach itself well ... I thought a beach was covered in white fluffy sand, rolling waves, blue/green water and people undertaking all manner of activities. Well thats what an aussie expects given what happens at home. This place was just down right dirty and littered with the freaks of the world, Jamacian dropouts selling Bob Marley trinkets and dope heads peddling dope in a legalised manner.If what you want a made in china t shirt or trinket its the place for you, however if you want to walk on a nice beach perhaps have a cup of coffee and watch the waves take a very wide berth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sn00k09
30,....Definitely an experience....,"I read reviews on Trip Adivsor prior to going to Venice Beach which made me a little hesitant, however, all the reviews made me what to see it for myself. First off, we parked in a parking lot right off the boardwalk and as we got out of the car we noticed an overwhelming strong scent of urine all around the parking lot that was behind a few buildings. We stared off by going onto the beach, which was clean and nice. There was an outdoor skate park which was kind of neat to watch. We walked along the far end of the boardwalk where the houses are which are all very modern, unique looking homes. As we made our way onto the boardwalk where the shops are we became overwhelmed with the amount of people around. There were large groups of guys trying to get you to ""sound check"" their CD and would follow you and say ""Come on man, just listen!"" Which wasn't the greatest experience since there were multiple groups along the boardwalk. There were a lot of cheap souvenir shops, smoke shops, and street shows along the way. There was a GREAT street show with a group of about 8 guys and it was very entertaining. I think they were located near the skate park on the boardwalk, but I'm not sure if they are always in the same area. There are lots of street vendors that are offering cheap jewelry, paintings, artwork etc. As we walked around the boardwalk, we got sick of it after awhile due to the many people coming up to you and asking for money, the large groups of guys wanting a sound check, the bums that had signs that stated, ""Why lie, I need $ for a beer"", and other shady people. I would recommend for the beach, however, the boardwalk is not anything you would be upset about if you missed seeing!!! If you decide to go on the boardwalk, keep an eye out for shady people....Santa Monica is only 2 miles North of Venice and it is a much nicer area to take your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ_432

20,Disappointing,I was there with my wife and grown up daughter one day in Sept. I am not sure just what we expected but we found it disappointing. It had been flagged up on various tourist sites as a place 'worth a visit' but we found it a place to forget. We were not even attracted into the shops which is highly unusual. Generally tacky and for the UK read a tad Blackpoolish!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDinNI
10,Unusual and definately not what we expected,"Having seen many travel shows doing thier take on Venice Beach it was on our list of to do places in Los Angeles. It probably should not have been. Being an Aussie I have seen many beautiful beaches in my time and have seem many creative and wonderful markets and artists selling their wares by the beach.Venice beach is not one of those places.The beach was great, straight out of Baywatch. The boulevard was dirty, smelly, full of cheap crap that was mass produced in China or just plain junk.I was disappointed and wish that we had not wasted our limited time in LA on going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellbalcomb
20,False Advertising,"Can't you buy junk made in China and step over bums in your city? I thought so. Where was the ""freaky"" and ""weird""?. I was expecting ""joyful"" not ""desperate"". Maybe the recession has hurt Venice Beach the same as everywhere else. And that's the what was so disappointing. The ""everywhere else"" part. The same tacky tourist scams, trash and trinkets, and scary food, and nary a freewheeling, fun loving bohemian freak in sight. For weird, I'll stick with Austin, TX.The shops and beaches are better to the north and south. The only reason to go to Venice Beach is to tick it off your list. Now that I have, I won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeanyMalone

Great skatepark and fun boardwalk. Everyone is accepted here....and seems to just want to enjoy that southern CA sunshine! Things are cheaper, too than at Santa Monica! Bought a silk skirt/dress that can be changed into different outfits for $40..........They were selling for $69-$99 in Santa Monca 3rd street Promenade! The famous outdoor gym is overrated, but you will ocassionally see some very buff guys walking around scantily dressed. Volleyball, etc. are available. Few rules make it more fun....unlike some east coast beaches where it's ""illegal"" to even toss a Frisbee! Worth a visit at least once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aholmes
40,Very interesting,"Venice Beach is not for people who are afraid of the unknown or to adventure into something different. If you like odd and unique things, places, and people, then this is for you. I went with my six year old daughter and never felt unsafe. The atmosphere and people were very intriguing. There are ""bums"" who ""work"" there every day and many are very fun to talk to. There are various street shows, people handing out there own music, and yet lots of advertising for medical marijuana. Many stores with odd and unique items for sale, many touristy clothes and souvenirs for cheap. I loved looking at everyone's different booths and their form of self expression through art. There is even legal graffiti. I would definitely recommend this place for the curious, adventurous person and the type of person who loves to see the unique side of places. On that same note if you are one who wants to stay in ""spa"" atmosphere while on vacation this is not for you. I know I will happily go back, if ever in the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bootsies_Family
10,Like a dog turned inside out,"Remember the movie with Jeff Goldblum called ""The Fly""? Remember when early in the movie he tries to teleport his pet baboon and it lurches out of the machine turned inside out with the white bones lifted out of the dripping red meat? Remember how you felt fascination, revulsion, and pity all at the same time? That's Venice Beach. It's a repository for all the people who desperately try to hold on to the fantasy of a counterculture, oblivious to the pathetic smell of their own decay. It's like Woodstock II the day after. On weekends, hordes of people trek the length of the boardwalk looking for something that isn't there. Shops peddle Venice sweatshirts by the thousands. Obscene artwork and graffiti greet the eye. Bums lie passed out in rags. The noxious smell of burning sage fills the air. Recently paroled convicts do bench presses in the phoney and too modern ""Muscle Beach"" pavilion. Lost teenagers zonked on drugs sit around on blankets selling Cracker Jack-box trinkets for ""donations"". Raggedy hippy-wannabes front disgusting anti-American propaganda booths. The 50-gallon trash drums overflow with pizza crusts and assorted garbage. To be fair, the first time I saw Venice Beach I was fascinated. The last time I saw Venice Beach it made my skin crawl. It's a great place to take your kids if you want them to see first hand where they'll end up if they don't stay in school and away from drugs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbk2000

40,Best on a bike.,"We rode bikes on the boardwalk from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. It was an excellent way to see all the action. Walked out on Venice Beach pier to get close up view of surfers and made some great videos of the surfing action. Parked the bikes to walk around in the craziness. Loved the folks trying to get me to visit the ""doctor"" for my medical marijuana prescription! Another time perhaps! Don't forget to get away from the main drag on the beach and go over to the Abbot Kinney area for good food and shopping. We had a lovely Sunday brunch at Lilly's French Cafe and Bar. If you ride, rent your bikes early. By the time we got back to the Santa Monica Pier, it was packed. Also, rent from Sea Mist instead of Perry's. It was half the cost and the bikes were fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwdColorado
40,Unique Experience,"As I described to my mother, Venice Beach is like the hippies of her generation and the hippies of my generation got together and had a beach flea market. I did not find more interesting and varied people than in the Venice Beach area. Certainly I felt safe throughout the day, however if tattoos, medical marijuana, or friendly people offend you, this may not be the stop for you. It was obvious that everyone there was simply trying to have a good time and make a living. You will find unique art displays and fascinating entertainers. Also, it’s a great place to surf, walk the beach, skateboard, bike, play volleyball, tennis, or basketball.From Venice Beach, the Santa Monica Pier looks deceptively close. It is certainly within walking distance, but give yourself a full day to enjoy the walk and the sites along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaDancingTraveler
50,1960's re-visited!,"We (self, husband, 8yo & 11 yo sons) stayed at Venice Paloma Suites, (great spot!) last October and spent nearly all of our 3-day stay just walking around the Venice Beach area. We LOVED it, and neither myself or my sons felt the least bit unsafe. Loved the unique shops: check out the statues made wholly from recycled nuts, bolts, metal - AWESOME !!! Fabulous hats, great original jewellery... My boys just loved the mix of people, a real eye-opener for them, in a positive way. Sure, we saw some dope & some beggars, but nothing to make us fearful. Really, this is no different to St Kilda Esplanade or Carlton in the early days (for you Aussies reading this!). An experience like no other, just DO IT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozkazz
50,White people stop being so scared and fear based,"I could already tell that most of the ""cowardly"" reviewers were suburban yuppie types. Why would you go to venice beach to experience the same old boring sites you usually see. It is supposed to be unusual. ""I'm scared"", what are most people here 8 year old little girls. Toughen up and live in the real world. I could only imagine if you guys had to visit a poor country, you wouldnt last a day without commiting suicide. Uncertainty and adventure are what make life worth living.Venice beach is great. plenty of performers, especially one called ""animation"". Eccentric hippie types having a good time. There is no danger at all to going to venice beach and the crowd is an eclectic mix of people. The vibe is that of the hippie era and it always puts a smile on my face to be there. The sand, sun, surf and fun energy will give you an experience you wont forget.If you are a person that knows the homeless, druggies, and oddballs exists but prefers to pretend that ""out of sight means out of existence"" then dont come here. There are not as many of them as the reviewers like to act like anyways. The world is filled with things that we might not like but we will do our best to get rid of them.Go to venice for a good time and get out of your comfort zone. Cowards stay home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wormser10
50,Loved it! Not for everyone though.,"I went to the LA area early October 2009 and knew I wanted to see Venice beach while I was there. I had heard so much about it and knew it was going to be full of ""unusual"" people and things... and it was! We spent maybe 3 hours there and just looked at shops (I bought a cute hat and my friend bought some sunglasses), we walked down to the water which was really peaceful, watched a crazy man attempt to walk on glass (he was taking too long to actually perform the stunt that we walked away), saw the famous muscle beach, and saw a troupe of dancers who were really, really great! After watching the dancers my friend went to buy some chicken fingers and I bought a whole coconut which was cracked open so I could drink the water then when I finished it they opened it up for me so I could eat the meat! it was so fun walking around drinking out of the coconut! People were very friendly (sometimes too much, you will get beggars asking for money or people wanting you to buy their cd, just politely decline).... I loved it and could have spent more time there if I had the chance! I tend to like that sort of scene though (tattooed people, weirdos, freaks) so for me it was great fun! I'm even wondering if on my next trip I can actually stay at a hotel on venice beach, but I don't know if there are any ""decent' ones there! Loved it.. definitely a place to check out at least once (unless you are too uptight for that sort of scene!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna99
30,Venice Beach has a unique culture and climate of it's very own.,"We rented bikes from Santa Monica Pier down to Venice Beach, and the beach itself and the bike path and ride were amazing. It's about a mile and half to Venice Beach from Santa Monica, and you'll definitely know once you've entered Venice Beach. The local vendors and eclectic crowd that frequent this beach give this place a unique flavor and personality that the open-minded can surely appreciate. Artists, musicians, and street performers line the walkway of Venice Beach sharing their craft with curious tourists. This place rates high on the list for people-watching. This place can get a little crazy, as I witnessed some illegal activity of the ""organic"" nature happening right on the walkway, so if you're looking for a more family-oriented place to bring small children, try Santa Monica or Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyflower1

50,"Venice Beach - Love it or Hate it, it's unique!","We go to California every year and happen to love Venice Beach. It's one of those places that just has to be seen, it's kind of hard to describe if you haven't been there. It's like stepping back in time to the Woodstock era. If you enjoy something really different, and enjoy people watching, checking out shops that really make you think of the California '60's-'70's feel and seeing things that are unusual or just plain strange, this place is for you. We never miss stopping by Venice and always spend 1- 2 afternoons there on every trip. You never know what you're going to see or what unusual things you're going to get to buy (my wife loves perusing the little shops here to find the ones with the best stuff, she's found some really cool things here). The Venice boardwalk has a feel like nowhere else, love the flamenco guitar and surf guitar music playing whether from live street performers or piped in, seeing people from all over the world milling about, watching the ""locals"" with their unusual antics (especially the famous guy on rollerblades playing Hendrix on the electric guitar). I like it because it's a great place to sit and enjoy a beer with my wife in one of the outdoor cafes and reminisce/relax. A great way to decompress if you have a stressful job - this is about as far away from the ""real"" world as you can get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/always_enjoy_life33
50,Fabulous - let yourself have a day of odd freedom,"Obviously from the reviews this is a place you'll either love or loathe! I loved it! a wild mix of oddballs - beggars offering ""hugs for 25c"" or (my favourite) ""Kick my butt for a dollar""Lots of stalls selling everything from cheap jewellery, Banksy prints, decorated mexican skulls to unique art works and music CDs.Being open and friendly seems to be the secret, we had no hassle, just pleasant conversations with odd people! We were asked for money for a CD but declined - so were given it for free - with many hugs and high fives, and promises to 'be friends on MySpace'We watched the guys working out at Muscle Beach gym, we watched some basketball.We walked on the (hot) sand and paddled and caught sand crabs in the water (odd little creatures!)There are 'legal' marihuana 'clinics' all along the boardwalk - which is odd! and some nice cheap T shirt stores (3 for £12) great for gifts and souvenirs. You can also buy icecream, hot dogs and any other food you fancy! You can hire bikes there too.The freak show seems to have closed down (which is a shame) but to be fair the entire place is a show! with some great art, both for sale and as murals.Certainly worth a trip.

It was filthy, over-run by drugged out weirdos, beggars and people peddling crap.Getting anything decent to eat was another problem, everything looked so unhygenic or if the food had been sitting around in a hot-box for hours. Public toilets are unisex and also revolting if you can find one that doesn't have spew or poo all through it!

Its when you walk along the promenade, passing the apartments/condos, that the other face of Venice Beach hits you. The mixed smell of drains and incense, dirty looking people, graffitti covered, dirty looking shops and the food places dont look edible at all. Saying that, you do need to see it to believe it. Its not that long a walk down this section, near Muscle Beach, i just would not recommend spending a day there, carry on walking to the more relaxed Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiecat80
20,Uncomfortably interesting....,"""We have to go to Venice Beach!"" I said to my wife as we drove into LA. You see it on TV with it's long beautiful paved strip. Palm trees bordering all the way down.When I think of Venice beach it congers up images of beautiful people roller skating in skimpy clothing, basking in the sun.As we walked closer the imagery I had in my head quickly dissolved.Our first taste of LA.....Two homeless guys fighting over a half drunk beer. The beer was going every where as the punches started to fly. We narrowly avoided that confrontation. Next interaction was a rather aggressive budding rapper, Asking us ""do you feel me!"" and ""Check this out"" whilst trying to force head phones on our head.The reply of ""No... I don't feel you"" didn't go down too well with the Snoop Dogg wanna be.Wave and wave of people asking for money as we waded past an art and craft market, that look similar to a rubbish dump. I'm guessing that some of the camper vans must have been there of ages if the flat tires and copious amounts of bird droppings were anything to go by.Would I recommend going the Venice Beach?, hell yeah!! you'll have a good story to tell when you get home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rails81
30,"Beautiful place, very strange crowd","We went to Venice beach for a couple of nights, the Pacific coast is stunning with beautiful beach side homes, white sandy beaches, palm trees, an amazing pier/board walk and cool evening scene.The people however were a very odd mix, I was expecting a cool surfer chic crowd but to me it looked a little more like gang land in parts with big groups of people. The market area comprising of many tourist shops and eateries, along with many people trying to aggressively sell CD’s and other items, we got heckled quite a lot which detracted from the overall atmosphere, all seemed a bit seedy to me.In summary, it’s a beautiful area with a stunning beach, the market area in my opinion is a bit seedy and very crowded at the weekends. There was quite a cool evening scene around Washington Boulevard with some cool bars but avoid ‘The Terrance’ restaurant at all costs, its awful.I would advice staying in the city and driving out to see Venice beach over staying there, there are many places to park for the beach and they cost around $8 per day, put 1697 Pacific Avenue, Venice, CA 90291 into your GPS for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjsluk

20,Different and not what I expected,"We went to Venice beach on a bus tour that combined venice and santa monica beach tours together. At first I didnt get why we would only get about 20 minutes at venice and about 4 hours at santa monica. Then when we got there I saw why. This place had a melting pot of different types. We saw many homeless people. We seen a woman washing in the sink. And it smelled terrible in the area we were not far from the hoop courts and restrooms. Then we also seen people working and playing ball. We were told that the hoop court was the same as the one from the movie ""White Men Can't Jump"" with Woody Harrison and Wesley Snipes. On the other side the scene of the beach and vollyball area looked very nice. We only spend a short time here so we didnt get to walk around to see other sights. I do regret not taking any pictures of this area. Anyhow nobody approached us or was rude or anything. I can say I been there. But it wouldnt be a place I would want to say I would see again.

There were lots of sailboats out on the water the day we were there, making this a great place for sailing. Kind of a quirky, funky area of the coast. Nearby Marina Del Rey was pretty, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syrahgirl

Every step you take is a new artist or musician. We met some really unique people.There are murals and graffiti art all around the Boardwalk and even some on the palm trees on the beach. There is also a gym you can use right on the beach. The food was also AMAZING.Venice Beach is very different from any beach we've ever been to. We personally had a wonderful time.

We didn't do any shopping or dining while we were there. Were kinda scared the entire time, actually. The only good thing about our visit is that 1) we got to say we saw Venice Beach, and 2) we saw some of the canals running through the resident's homes.I don't recommend Venice for anyone who wants to have a relaxing visit to the beach!

We bought a few souvenirs and CD's off the peddlars and one of them is surprsingly great! all in all glad we went and have seen it for ourselves but I wouldn't be looking to go back on my next trip and I wouldn't like to be there after dark, it was as though all the homeless, druggies and drunks you know in your own neighbourhoods all congregated together, pretty sad really, also people sat in bins high as kites with signs saying 'need money for weed, all proceeds will be smoked' honest I suppose, not really a place to take the kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebsnMark1967
50,Jamaican Hippy Land,"I'm quite surprised that so many people don't seem to realize that Venice Beach is extremely bohemian, seedy, has lots of homeless people, and is not for the faint of heart. Frankly, I don't see how it's unique culture could have arisen if it were forced to clean itself and abide by all the typical rules of society. Yes, you will see crazy people and all manner of weirdness, but they tolerate you, just as you tolerate them (as it is truly their home). Look now, judge later. That's the way I approach Venice Beach.I hadn't been there in many, many years but a friend and I drove down half a day ago to check it out. Wow! I LOVE Jamaican culture so imagine my sense of wonder in seeing rastafari everywhere, vans piled high with pakistani and middle eastern rugs adorned over their vehicles (these people clearly live in their old campers). Most riveting of all were the endless amount of black people and mixed-race folks literally living their lives right on the sidewalk, with their wares displayed, and colored sheets under them and make-shift walls erected for the day. I just wanted to take pictures of every one of them but a number had small cardboard signs that politely say, no pictures please. We're not talking homeless bums here, but little family units with intense artistic interests who would rather live in poverty but be artistically free. No hardcore sellers, either. You peer into unusually intimate scenes: a mother holding her baby, sellers napping or quietly painting, people talking to each other in hushed voices. It's as if you are seeing into their houses, but I guess that's exactly what you are doing. If you do buy something, they will be extremely grateful - even if it's just a two dollar purchase. I even saw a few Africans practicing religious rituals (I have no clue what religion) but done so low-key and with such stoic silence that you wonder how it is that no one has ever written about it . . . I was touched by the intimacy of encountering them.Outside of these little enclaves it is anything but quiet - the music is sometimes too loud and your senses will be overwhelmed. Absolutely blasted. I thought it sad that one lady I chatted with from Denver told me that the best thing of all about her trip here was that it was almost over. Hopefully when she is ""safe"" again, she will find something to reflect back on that she enjoyed.There are characters galore, like one big black dude selling cookies, walking along saying, ""You gotta get some Jones Cookies in your mouth!!!"" I bought a pack of three for a dollar fifty. He's trying to make his money like the rest of us. I also bought some Jamaican friendship bracelets.Three bracelets were only $5 American. I figure that these same people could be thumping you over the head for those measly sums, but have more dignity than that. Oh, and the cookies were quite good.Go later in the day and you will be lucky to see multiple latin drummers on the grassy area, with attractive young women dancing hippy style right with the homeless white dudes. Okay, so some of these girls just seem like they are trying to show off, and may not really be that into it, but . . . It was the first time in my life that I felt like I was really seeing the counterculture that I just missed out on experiencing its first time around. It is alive and well in Venice. As another reviewer said, people here thrive on being different. It's overwhelming and it is way too easy to just leave, but I knew it would be many years (if ever, realistically, as Los Angeles is absolutely huge) that I would return, so why not do the opposite and keep looking, keep experiencing? The Jamaican culture I'm comfortable with, but all of the eclectics do overwhelm one's senses. So I stayed longer than I would have, as I'd have so much more to chew on later, literally for years. You really get to wondering about creativity and human nature while there. Your brain will just want to quickly rap it up and say, ""Okay, yeah, I get it, I'm outta here"" but I would've missed out had I exited after an hour or two. I think this is why you see a lot of reviews here where people are saying that every place sells the same stuff, etc. That is not true. They just stopped looking because it got to be overwhelming. Way easier to just mentally box it all up and leave.I'd bypass the three t-shirts for ten dollars shops and focus on the Jamaicans and artists who sell stuff that may not be highest quality but is made with heart and absolute gratitude. I was just so surprised at how grateful people were that I would spend 2 or 3 bucks. It added considerably to my experience and made for a connection across our cultures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forgottensage
20,Have to agree interesting???,"I have always heard about the unique people along the walk at Venice beach, now I can say I have witnessed it with my own eyes. I really wasn't expecting much, I guess that is why i took it with a grain of salt. It is alway interesting to see things that would shock most, all lined up along the side walk for all to see.I saw beautiful art and jewlery, some people who had ""things to say"" in strange ways, and many people who were just trying to survive. Sad, but true. We even saw a man with a sign saying ""Adopt a man"" with his shoe out in front of him to collect money.It was a nice walk from Santa Monica Pier and back. I think I would rent a bike next time, but the walk wan't bad at all.There were lots of beautiful arcitecture to look at on the way there.The beach was wide and not as crowded as I anticipated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalswa
50,Venice Beach - LOVED IT!,"I am a single mom from Minneapolis. I took my 9 year old son to Venice in July. We stayed in Marina Del Rey which was close by. When we arrived in Venice I drove around and tried to find street parking for free. This was difficult but it can be done. I ended up parking blocks away. That was ok though. It was fun looking at the unique designs of the houses on our walk to the beach. We passed the Venice Canals which was pretty cool. It's something you don't see everyday. Good place to take a picture!When we got to the beach we saw a wide variety of people. Vendors lined up for blocks down the sidewalks selling art, pictures, jewelery, etc. A group of street performers who did a bunch of acrobatic stunts and flips. A huge drum circle on the beach with a bunch of different people on drums.The beach was nice for swimming too. The waves weren't too big and I didn't notice any steep drop offs.They have a lot of basketball courts so my son brought a basketball and played for about an hour.I will tell you this. I was never once afraid of anybody hurting me, stealing from me, etc. However, you want to watch your belongings just as you would anywhere else in the world. There are homeless people walking around. Don't leave your shopping bags unattended, obviously.One thing that did bother me was the musicains walking around with headphones asking you to listen to their music (This happens in Hollywood too). I love music with a passion. But, there where too many of these guys asking me to listen to their music and then of course buy their CD. Very annoying.In a nutshell, the atmoshphere is very free-spirited and laid back. The people are different. But that's what made me enjoy it. It is so unconventional. There is always something going on and something to see.And if you do go, you have to see a sunset. It is breath-taking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustLive
30,A very unique place,"The actual beach is very nice. It is interesting to take a stroll and take in this very unique place. I can't say I felt extremely comfortable, but it was enjoyable. I now feel like been there, done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo24
10,An American disgrace,"It was noisy, tawdry and tasteless. Populated by noisy, tawdry & tasteless people. From the primping narcissists on Muscle Beach to the hucksters trying to sell their cheap & tacky rubbish along the side. Even the restrooms were vomit inducingly dirty.I wouldn't even do it the justice of taking any pictures.Perhaps Sunday was a bad day to visit.The one ray of sunshine was a lady busker sitting in a chair singing classics such as 'Fever' in a beautiful voice.However, she was totally overshadowed by a hippy couple with a young child begging next to her holding a sign saying ""Christmas will suck if you don't help"". Thirty feet away were another couple of beggars holding up a sign saying ""[--] Off"". Strange way to ask for money but it probably had it's appeal for the majority of the passers by.We happily took their advice and headed off for lunch to Cliftons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bampah
40,Great Fun For a Sunday Afternoon...,"This was our 2nd visit to Venice Beach since 2005. We were on vacation to Disneyland, San Diego etc. and decided to do a day in Venice. We spent the 1st part of the afternoon wandering thru the shops and letting the kids buy little souveniers here and there and then spent the last couple of hours on the beach enjoying the ocean. I'm not sure why anyone would feel 'scared' walking the boardwalk. Sure there are some odd people, but we've always found them very friendly and accomodating to tourists like us. We met a guy carrying around a bearded dragon and for $5 you can hold it and take pictures. We actually spent a good 20 min. with the guy taking turns holding it and letting the kids ask him a zillion questions about it. Was probably the most fun we had with $5 ever and we all learned quite a bit in the process! We saw street performers who actually had some talent. We saw one girl in particular singing with her guitar who was absolutely a wonderful singer, really didn't belong entertaining a beach crowd. There was lots to see and we liked being able to buy some t-shirt souveniers of our trip without breaking the bank. I never felt threatened or pressured to hand out money from anyone. It was a fun day and I wouldn't hesitate to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirengirl
10,Forget it!!,"As my older daughter put it....it is like Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley at its worst! I insisted going there despite her comments and feedback from friends who went there two years ago. There is NOTHING to recommend it since it is full of tatoo parlours, freak showoffs and stores full of junk and tee-shirts that you can find anywhere. There did seem to be plenty of normal people enjoying the bicycle path on the beach and well appointed beach tennis courts. If you are a tourist, spend your time elsewhere. Better to take a tour of Olvera Street, where L.A. was established by the Spanish, visit Santa Monica or Malibu (or better north of Malibu) for the beach scene or the new Frank Gehry building. (By the way, we lived in Berkeley and have a high tolerance level).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaBernardi
20,Over-rated - under-interesting........,"The actual BEACH part of Venice Beach is nice - very soft, fine sand - lovely surf. The shops are great if you are in the market for a cheap pair of sunglasses or 3 t-shirts for $10.00 - because 99% of the shops sell nothing but that.I was hoping to see some nice shops with hard-to-find and unique items - no such luck. I was hoping to see some eccentric people - but mainly only saw some menacing looking bums.The public toilets are filthy. Waste of a morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohicans
20,Not all that it is portrayed,"You have seen the shots of the: ocean front, the shapely babes roller blading, the tanned and ripped bodybuilders at muscle gym, interesting old hippies, a nice kind of place to go eh?Think on, it took us about five minutes to see through it. Loads of washed out druggies wanting money, pretty poor art for sale, a very volatile atmosphere. Put it this way we were determined to have a good look but hardly dare take pics, as soon as you caught alot of peoples eye they would stop in their tracks and give you a hard, and I mean, hard look. A lot of dangerous looking people, saw a few guys in gang colours, so not scary!Top tip go see for yourself but remember most taxis wont even pick you up from there, we had to go to a hotel to sort that out. The taxi drivers who spoke english, not many of them in LA, tried to put us off from going. Finally muscle beach, this is a grotty and tiny concrete outdoor yard with a few benches and weights and yep no Arnolds. However you do see a totally different side to the city, some daring acts to watch, learn a bit of spanish or else you wont buy much. Must admit that did add to the culture side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FenderUk

50,Venice Beach Experience,"I've frequented Venice Beach on numerous occasions, and I have to say that it's always an adventure. Bottom line: People in VB are weird, eccentric, free-spirited, etc.. It's the type of place where you see various street performers, people singing, dancing, playing instruments, and most of all, not having a care in the world. The atmosphere in VB in one of the most uninhibited I've ever seen. People thrive on being different. And I have to admit, the first time I went there, I was a little scared, but I ended up having a good time. If you're looking for a good place to eat, try Figtree's, which is my personal favorite. I'm a huge fan of the Spinach Nut Burger. And as for the people who are afraid to eat in the restaurants in VB, live a little! Overall, if you are looking for an interesting day in Southern California, try Venice Beach. Afterall, isn't traveling about exploration and expanding your horizons?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinTeacher-7
30,Gotta go,It may not be to everyone's taste but it is well worth the visit. Don't expect the polished ideal from TV this is real life and all the better for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedwar
30,yes it's seedy,"Yes, it's seedy, but isn't that what you're going there to see? There are some unusual people and it's dirty, but it was interesting to walk along the beach and see it. l have to admit l wouldn't be to eager to try any of the restaurants...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chewpei
50,Response to What a Shock,"Please do not mistaken diversity with ""scary"" people (according to Houstonian who wrote ""What a Shock""). Venice Beach is known for its eclectic groups of people; and if experiencing diversity and culture are not your thing, then VB is not the place for you. People are still free-spirited as how VB was founded; it's just that people have evolved to the 21st century version of what used to be the 60-70's hippies. So the likelihood of you being robbed or clubbed over the head is almost zilch.VB offers an array of vendors for you to checking out and/or purchase their merchandise. There are lots of restaurants and hole-in-the-wall eateries (they have the best food!) that make VB all the more enjoyable. The best part (I have to say) is the people. Expect to be surrounded by dog walkers, roller-bladers, bikers, body builders (VB was where Arnold Schwarzenegger was discovered), entertainers, even preachers (!!!) upon your arrival. VB can literally be a fun-filled circus if you open your mind to it. The best time to join in on the fun are Friday nights, any time Saturdays and Sundays. Parking can be a pain during those times, but the hunt for a parking space is well worth the experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBJ626
50,It's still hip!,"You still get a bit of the 70s art/music vibe on the Venice Boardwalk. Took the bus from the Hyatt Sunset & spent the afternoon. Fun to see the shops with souvenirs, clothes, bags, jewelry- all inexpensive. Ate at the Sidewalk Cafe, very good. Make sure to see the Jim Morrison mural -go down 18th St. Artists set up on the sidewalk to sell paintings, tell fortunes, etc. I would like to go back there & spend more time on the beach & exploring the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LedZepChic
50,We Loved It!,"We just returned from a trip to LA and the Cali Coast and stayed in Venice Beach. What a delight!The boardwalk was amazing--vibrant people, great sidewalk acts, food, basketball games, raquetball and wonderful shopping. We rollerbladed one morning. The next day we took a great bikeride from Venice Beach along a path that runs for about 15 miles down south. We also spent plenty of time just relaxing on the beach, a pleasure for us.We found the beach clean and inviting. My family and I loved this place and we'll definitely return some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass4678
10,What a shock!,"I had never been to Venice beach, but my husband had been there about 20 years ago. He said the place had really come down since then. There was an abundance of tattoo parlors and body piercing shops, and graffiti on the buildings. Some of the people walking the street were scary. It only took two minutes to decide to make a quick exit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expedition4561
