We landed at Airport which is at sanganeer about 15 Kms from Jaipur capital city of Rajasthan.People here are fantastic, Helping and very proud to live in city like this. Jaipur is known for it's rich heritage, culture, food, jewelery.We started our tour with visiting some shopping places in Jaipur, The Johari bazar is a fantastic for women in love with dress, Rajasthani Lenagas, Jewelery etc. the showrooms are greatEvening we visited ""Chowki Dhani"" a Resort developed in the traditional way of rajasthan. the place is really great and we would advice to visit once any time who visit Rajasthan. To our luck we had little rains that evening which added a charm to that place we could smell the lovely sand smell. The food served there is completely traditional and great.Next day we visited Hawa mahal the palace for queens to enjoy. and the narghad the old fort near jaipur these all were really fantastic .on our last day at jaipur we visited few temples which included "" Birla Temple completely built of Marble stone and also the new govinddevji temple, we were mesmerized by the statue there and the devotion of people ...Finally one comment I would like to have.... this should be a place that has to be visited before you die....."
30,“most colourful city - the pink city”,"very colourful city indeed... buzzing with people n vendors! so many people gosh... u can never know who means well and who is trying to out smart u.amazing levels of bargaining takes place here.... i was astonished when the shopkeeper gave me the 'salwar kameez'in 550 rupees for which he had originally quoted 1500! this is extortion i felt... why not have just a flat fixed reasonable rate?everyone wants to make quick money here... the city is full of international tourists who are taken for a ride. not fair... a price to pay for visiting this lovely city.on the other side, the forts and palaces are exquisite and so well maintained thats its unbelievable... the history n culture is vast and rich. the rajput spirit of the city is quite over whelming... extremely chivalrous staff at hotels n restaurants n full of pomp n style. the 'kalbeliya' folk dance is something to watch out for!"
50,“THE ETHNIC EXPERIENCE”,"Jaipur is a very beautiful place. Their culture reflects in the color. Their culture also reflects in their warmth hospitality, extended to visitors and guest like us during our stay.Occasion such as weddings are celebrated with a lot of love, affection, dance, music , cuisine which you find and enjoy as an authentic celebration"
20,“amazing tourist potential affected by tourist cheaters”,"Needless to say, Jaipur has tremendous tourist potential mostly related to legacy of the royal family. However, this review is intended to alert fellow tourists visiting Jaipur with an economy budget. And for saving some hard earned money and taking out time from todays busy schedule, the last thing one expects is to get cheated at almost every step. For first-time visitors are likely to get cheated at most places. The cheating formula experienced at Jaipur is 'quote less to earn a booking and then charge more after tourist has booked.' Be it hotels, site-seeing vehicles, guides, auto-rickshaws, etc. Hotels even quote a higher tariff than its rates exhibited in net by popular sites (makemytrip.com). But the worst experience was that at famous City Palace where guides quote lower rates and then force and abuse tourists to pay more at the end. And by all measures, the rate of Rs 250 is too much for a one-hour visit to City Palace. Worse, guides do not exhibit their official identity cards and keep it in pockets. Textile shops in general and that of RTD Corporation charge more for same products available at much cheaper rates in market. Much of the cheating, particularly the one at City Palace, could be checked if the concerned authorities plug the loopholes. At the end the tourist returns with feelings of being cheated at almost every step from a city, a visit to which, should have otherwise gone down as a memorable life-time experience. Our expericne at jaipur was just the opposite to that of Goa, Mysore, Bangalore, Pune, Ooty, Mumbai, Chennai, Manali, Shimla, Puri, New Delhi, etc."
50,“Jaipur - Pink City”,"Jaipur is a city of dreams! Known as The Pink City...Jaipur is hustling and bustling...from elephant ride to ethnic shopping and taste of traditional Rajasthani hospitality. The City Palace is really beautiful & full of wonders. The elephant ride to Amer Palace is worth the experience. The renowned Palace of the Winds is something not to be missed. Use Jaipur as a base to travel to Ajmer & Lake Puskar. Hire a car and plan your trip in advance, most locals are very friendly & helpful, English is widely spoken & understood. Keep mineral water handy and avoid street food. You have wide selection of hotels from budget to luxurious. Dress conservatively & travel in groups. Happy travelling!"
40,“Nice family getaway”,"Jaipur is an absolutely lovely place...the best time to visit is February..a nice weekend getaway from Delhi and can have fun with family..Choki dhani is a must visit place in Jaipur reserve a half day (the second half) for the same...Once you enter you have whole lot of options that the timings from 6 - 11 pm feels short ..Rs 350 is the cost of the ticket for a simple rajsthani dinner however for an elegant one the ticket costs rs. 650..(Options in Choki dhani - pupet show, magic show, camel ride, bullock cart ride, elephant ride, Maze, Dance show, Mehndi free of charges, sketch painting and the best part the Traditional Rajasthani dinner)..We were an extended family of 7..who travelled by car to Jaipur...it took us about 6 hrs..the road is bit bad near Manesar otherwise thanks to the NH8 highway..the place is all about culture and hospitality..there are enough places to while away time - Hawa Mahal, Amber fort (dont miss to have food at the restuarant near the rajsthani small scale Industries), Jantar Mantar (very educative for kids), Jal Mahal (take pics from outside as you go near you can smell the sewage water), shopping at Johri Road, food at LMB restuarant...stay at Devi Niketan...that is how our trip began and ended on a happy note..."
50,“Beautiful city!”,Jaipur is a beautiful city but is very important to find a good guide. I Met one good guide an driver Janu. He is really friendly and a very good guide and driver and he speaks a very good english. He knows every little Beautifull place in Jaipur and Rajastan. You can allways call him on this number: +919929152946. Janu will allways help you to make and have a great vacation in India
30,“Holiday in Jaipur”,"I was in Jaipur with my family of a 3 yr old son and hubby. We stayed at a friends place in 22 Godam industrial area. This location is a little off the main tourist centre. It is better if you take a hotel near the main MI road as there are a lot of eateries and shops on MI road. it will be just great if you are near Raj Mandir Theatre as thats the very prime area, nothing is very far from this Theatre. Also do visit this theatre may be not for the movie playing in it but for seeing the very well done and totally light up lounge during the interval. There were a number of foreigners who came and watched a hindi movie till the interval and left there after.Now for sightseeing we hired a call a cab. The driver islamudin was agreat guy and showed us around for two full days – prices are very reasonable (INR150 perhour) packages start from 4hours for INR 600. We had three full days with us so we saw Jaigarh Fort (Amber fort is a part of Jaigarh), Amer Palace, Kanak Bagh and Jal Mahal on the first day. City palace, Jantar Mantar observatory, Hawa Mahal, Galtaji Temple, Sasodia Rani ka bagh, Ganesh Mandir, Birla Mandir and Central Park on 2nd day, 3rd day was for Zoo, Bapu Bazar and afternoon onwards we just relaxed and packed for our flight back home. Overall Jaipur was a neat experience but dont expect alot from any of the palaces as they are mainly ruins of olden times except few sections which are still well kept. City palace might be the best. Hawa mahal can be totally avoided from inside as there is just nothing in there. It is better to see it from outside. Our driver was good enough to tell us that the guides are not worth it at Jaigarh and Amer fort so we should not hire them and also took us up till the top at Jaigarh and Amer for just INR 150 else we would have had to hire the Jeep or elephant at Amer for anything between INR 500 to 900. I really liked the location of Galtaji and also the route to the temple. Zoo is not very Hugh but good for children as there are tigers, lions, bears, fox, hyena, crocs and a number of different birds like emu, white peacock etc.For Food there are mainly veg restaurants which sell mostly Onion Kachoris (Speciality) and Samosas. Mac donalds is right next to Raj Mandir Theatre. Also there is SDC Pride Hotel's restaurant which serves good food with Excellent service near theatre. There are quite a few restaurants on MI road like Niros, Moti Mahal, Copper Chimney for Indian cuisine, a Chinese restaurant Yo China. We also went to LMB (I think its called Lakshmi Mishtan Bhandar) near Sangneri gate its supposed to be very famous but we just dint like the food there as was extremely spicy especially the thali is totally avoidable and very very expensive comparatively. The Onion and Mawa Kachori at Rawat sweet shop is very famous but nothing very great in taste. Also rawat is very far off from the main tourist areas. Rajasthani speciality sweet is Ghewer which is nice and sweet and available in almost all sweet shops in Jaipur.Hope this long review helps all you visitors of Jaipur in some way or the other. Good Luck and have a nice trip."

50,“Jaipur visited”,"i have been to Jaipur, Rajasthan, on 10.10.10. the city is very nice with it's pink colours. very clean and peaceful place to travel & stay. The Amber fort is a treat to watch. But the City Palace is Excellent. People here are very cooperative with very sweet behavior."
50,“A City of many colours”,"From site seeing to sumptuous food to never ending shopping ( like ""shop till u drop "" ) is what this fabulous city offers. Travelling is so easy that you do not feel tired. No traffic jams and no long distances. Within the walled city ( the old city is surrounded by a wall with many gates. these gates were closed during nights in those days and were guarded. The entrance to the city is thru these gates which are still maintained for historic reasons, though not guarded any more ) you will find the beautiful city palace, the Hawa Mahal and the observatory. A few km outside the city , is the famous Amber palace , the erstwhile capital of Jaipur. An elepahnt ride to the palace uphill will make you feel like a king for once, at least.You have the Nahargarh fort and the Jaigarh fort arounf 5 km uphill while on way to Amber fort that tells of the great history of these places.You can shop in the city and empty your pockets on local handicrafts, clothing, the famous rajasthani quilts and bedsheets, bangles and many more.In all, a great place to visit and unwind."
50,“The Pink City!!”,"Jaipur is called the pink city because all the old king palaces were painted red (pink) from outside.. hawa mahal is one of them which looks fab.amazing heritage places include - nahargard, jaigarh, jal mahal, raj vilas (hotel), chokhi dhani, and many more... one can visit all these places during the day and finish the day by going to various recently opened cafes all over the city. A stay in jaipur is definitely worth it."

We visited the inncer city with pink buildings and markets, and my little ones relaised why this city is called Pink City. The heritage of the city is realy preserved.Aamer fort, city palace, birla temple, and Kanak garden are amazing place to visit. Kids just loved chokhi dhaani, camel ride, magical shows etc. It was a fun filled week.Definitely visiting Jaipur again!"
50,“Jaipur”,"We returned from jaipur last week to chennai.The city is remarkable among pre-modern Indian cities for the width and regularity of its streets. The urban quarters are further divided by networks of gridded streets. Five quarters wrap around the east, south, and west sides of a central palace quarter, with a sixth quarter immediately to the east. The Palace quarter encloses a sprawling palace complex, (Hawa Mahal), formal gardens, and a small lake. Nahargarh Fort, which was the residence of the King Sawai Jai Singh II, crowns the hill in the northwest corner of the old city. Another noteworthy building is the observatory, Jantar Mantar. Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in Rajasthan and India."
50,“My tour of the Golden Triangle”,"I did the Golden Triangle tour in March 2010 and would recommend A-1 tours. First of all, we were 2 ladies and felt very safe ans secure with Rajeev our driver for the whole trip. Then we were very happy with the hotels and the price of the whole tour. I would recommend shopping in Jaipur."

50,“THE MOST AMAZING CITY I'VE BEEN SO FAR.......”,"It was the most memorable experience i've had so far in any Indian city...The city is popularly known as Pink City owing to its predominantly pink coloured city buildings.... though it is now limited to main walled city only.The people are really really nice and very dependable.....and trustworthy....The old palaces and forts are really worth seeing....to name a few are JAIGARH FORT, NAHARGARH FORT, AMER FORT, CITY PALACE, JANTAR MANTAR....along with these are a few famous temples like Birla MAndir, Govind devji temple and Shila devi temple in amer fort ...the city is a must see for all fellow travellers...."
50,“A memorable vacations in India”,"I am writing on behalf of my husband and myself, to express our extreme pleasure with the service provided by NS Tours Delhi , and in particular Ms.Neha Gupta during our recent visit to India.From the moment we arrived in Delhi, to the moment we entered the airport to depart for home, we were treated like royalty. Ms .Neha took tremendous care of us throughout our tour, regularly checking to ensure everything went smoothly. We were very grateful for his assistance in boarding our train, and even more delighted to see him appear by our side on our arrival back in Delhi. Being taken to dinner was a lovely surprise.Our tour did indeed exceed our expectations. The tour itself was well organized and we were very happy with our accommodation, transport and guides. I would also like to express our great satisfaction with our driver throughout Rajasthan, Raju who also took wonderful care of us and drove in such a manner that at no time were we ever even mildly concerned about Indian roads or traffic. (I believe this is most unusual and it seems we were very lucky to have such a driver, given some of the stories we heard from other travellers!).We are both singing the praises of India as a destination, and Ns Tours as a travel agent to all our friends and colleagues. Thank you for providing us with a wonderful experience. You are indeed fortunate to have someone of Ms.Neha calibre representing your company and we look forward to dealing with him again for our next Indian holiday."
40,"“So many palaces, so little ability to remember India names.”","Toured Jaipur while checking out possible sites for our wedding. Very cool place if you're into history (and Indiana Jones movies) because this entire state in India is just overwhelming when it comes to old forts and palaces. The specific places we visited blurred together for me, but only because we were traveling for 3 weeks straight after getting to India. Chasing my now Father-in-law around from palace to palace, fort to fort, proved to be a real challenge. I hope I have that kind of momentum in the years to come.Beautiful place. Definitely worth a visit. I suggest keeping a list of all the ""pur's, gar's, bagh's, etc, so you don't end up with a big DUHHHH look on your face when trying to tell of your trip."
50,“Pinkcity a mistrious city”,"It was a hot midday when I arrived at the railway station in the desert state of Rajhastan. Somehow I am already three weeks behind my scheduled arrival. I guess that my fellow learners have started learning the life in Jaipur. My guide was one of the best guy .He make all the affect to make my trip memorable. I would like to thanks Mr. Rajesh [--].As soon as the train stops at a crowded platform, I instantly realised that this is going to be a very interesting place to be. I felt extremely loneliness, I failed to hide at the time of my arrival. My arrival made no different to Rajputs and I have already become one of them, strolling aimlessly with bundles of belongings. I spent walking along the platform, looking for someone who I haven't met before. It was a pointless search, I went outside to see so many of them are waiting but not for me.I had to wait at the car park for a while. Then there was a slim guy with a short moustache appeared holding my name in a piece of card. It was HIM!I was brought in front of a group of students and teachers, and introduced to others as this is the student we had been missing for three weeks!ISummer FlowersSummer Flowerswas relived and happy to see all my colleagues who welcome me warmly. I had a nice lunch at the institute then had to face an preliminary test in Hindi before starting the course.In the afternoon, I was taken to the host family.A bit of history of the city from me here, I gathered while having my lunch with others in the library room.The city is popularly known as the Pink City, is the capital of Rajasthan state, India. Jaipur is the former capital of the princely state of Jaipur. It was founded on 18 November 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amber, the city today has a population of more than 2 million residents. It is also known as Paris of India.It was the ancient citadel of the ruling Kachhawa clan of Amber, before the capital was shifted to present day Jaipur. Amber Fort is known for its unique artistic style, blending both Hindu and Muslim (Mughal) elements, and its ornate and breathtaking artistic mastery.The Fort is unique in that its outside, an imposing and rugged defensive structure, is markedly different from its inside, an ornate, lavish interior influenced by both Hindu and Muslim (Mughal) styles of ornamentation. The walls of the interior of the fort are covered with murals, frescoes, and paintings depicting various scenes from daily life. Other walls are covered with intricate carvings, mosaic, and minute mirror work.Amber Fort is divided into four sections. Each is accessible via large staircases from a central location, or from a broad pathway leading to each of the sections. The pathways are currently used to transport tourists via an elephant ride."
40,“Jaipur-Agra-Delhi Great Trip”,"We just returned from the Golden triangle trip including Jaipur-Agra and Delhi. It was simply fabulous! We had chosen Rajasthan four Wheel Drive to provide us with a car and driver. Their service was very prompt. They also made some good suggestions about hotels and our itinerary. Overall very helpful and flawless. We flew from Mumbai to Jaipur. Was an early morning flight so spent the whole day touring Jaipur, enjoyed the city palace, hawa mahal, jalmahal, elephant ride and great authentic Rajasthani food at a small time place called Sodhani sweets- mouth watering lassi and pyaaz kachori. Stayed at a place called 'Chirmi palace' - very nice and charming. Next day drove to RaNthambore enjoyed the afternoon safari thro' the wildlife park. Stayed at Tiger Safari Resort. Next day to Bharatpur bird sanctuary. Lovely birds, lots of them. Following day to Fattepur Sikri - unbelievable monuments and onwards to Agra. No words to describe The Taj, simply incredible! Last day in Delhi visited the red fort, India gate, jama masjid and shopping at chandani chowk. We got a good flavor of diff places within 5 days, ofcourse with more time we could have enjoyed each of these places lot more..."
30,“The Royal City of Jaipur”,"Jaipur is usually a definite stop on most travelers itinerary. It is worth a quick visit at the very least. One full day should do it for most. I mostly enjoyed watching people and drive through the streets of old town. My favorite attraction here is the beautiful Amber Fort. Do not miss this and plan to spend a couple of hours there. If you have the time, do the elephant ride from the bottom up to the fort. Also, take as many pictures as you can of the gorgeous painted elephants."
50,“ROYAL RAJASTHAN”,"All we the Jaipur is the pink city but it is heart of ROYAL RAJASTHAN the beauty of historical places touches your heart feelings and one special The Jaipur Palace beautiful,and the king palaces and mansion is really nice. And Jaipur Hub offers a number of tourists from abroad and Hawa Mahal is one of the most common and popular tourist attractions, The City Palace is another beautiful landmark that was built by Kachchwah Rajput rulers of Jaipur. and much more thats touch our heart."
40,“My Jaipur Experience”,"It was a wonderful trip, We enjoyed a lot. Old palace was excellent, but can be maintained much better."
50,“Female travellers in Jaipur”,"Recently, my sister, cousin and myself travelled to Jaipur for 2 nights, organized through the tour company Delhi Magic.We are of East Indian descent, but having lived abroad, we all spoke rudimentary Hindi and could easily pass as foreigners.Although we initially had issues with our driver arranged through this tour company, it was sorted out in a timely manner and the tour guide in Jaipur, Monica was fantastic.She was a local who knew her city extensively and was always happy to help us bargain at bazaars and make valuable suggestions.She kindly agreed to meet us a day early and took us shopping for bags, jewellery & scarves. Jaipur is a shopaholic's dream come true! It is much cheaper than Delhi and when converting from Canadian dollars, it was a steal for us!We took an elephant ride at Amber Fort. Although this was a bumpy experience, it was tons of fun and Monica took us for a detailed and informative tour of the fort.Unfortunately, the elephants are not treated well and Rajasthan is not the best state for them to live in. They are truly water lovers and the lack of rains/monsoon weather in Rajastan has left them suffering. There is a charity, with a small stall at Amber Fort, that is dedicated to their welfare. Check it out: http://www.hsus.org/hsi/local_empowerment/hsi_animal_advocates/hsi_animal_advocates/help_in_suffering.htmlOn the same day, we also visited the Walled City and once again, Monica was keen to give us a walking/talking tour of the Pink City.The best part was eating amazing chaat (Indian snaacks) at TMB , a local Jaipuri restaurant and tasting authentic Rajasthani sweets.Jaipur is a small city with extremely narrow street that hold every form of transportation from camel carts to cycle rickshaws. So be prepared for heavy congestion and chaos!"
50,"“Our amazing day in Jaipur,India”","in november 2009 me,and my family went for India. We wanted to visit Jaipur and Agra to see the Taj Mahal. I found Rampal Rao,a man with a good heart and a calm state of mind that arranged a whole day for us. He suggested hotels for us,hotels that are possible to pay for when going on a long trip and picked us up the next morning. He's company had a comfortable car for us,and that was verry importent for my partens,they are over 60years old. He tok us to the Taj Mahal and conected us with a guide. The Tajh Mahal is truly the one masterpice in the world worth seeing!! After this amazing experience we he took us to a stonefactory where we got a good look on how they make the beautifull carvings in the marble stone. This is Hand made and we learned that this is a work for the one with pasience. They also had a shop where we got to buy suverniers. Next stop was a carpenter factory. Here the workers makes carpenters all day long,and it was truly amazing to see. We did buy a carpent because they were hand mande and they are special for India. Next was a jewelerystore. Here they can make anything in silver you want,it was verry nice. Rampal Rao drove us then back to the city of Jaipur and tok us to a restuant with exelent food and beutiful India dancing. My father did dance,never seen that before,thanks Rampal!Our day in Jaipur/Agra was a blessed day thanks to Rampal Rao and his hospitallity.

50,"“Pink City, Jaipur”","We went to Jaipur (Pink city and capital of Rajasthan, India) in Dec-2009. The climate was pleasant. Min temp 16C. 3 nights stay in the city is enough to enjoy the place. We stayed at one of the palace hotel, Jai Mahal which is managed by Taj.Ideal time for visit - December month ( Also enjoy Jaipur Marriages)Place of Interest (My recommendations)Day 1 - You will arrive by 1.00 PM so head to Jal Mahal, Hawa Mahal, Birla Temple.

40,“My India experience”,"I just returned from Jaipur in Rajasthan India.This was a beautiful city with lots of history. Learn why Jaipur is called th ""Pink City"".The forts, palaces were simply amazing. One must see the City Palace, Hawa Mahal, Observatory and the Monkey Temple. For those who love jewelry this city is your place. Wonderful precious and semi-precious stones at reasonable rates. A visit to the Jaipur Handicrafts store as well as Ganeshem Textile and Handicrafts should not be missed. This store does their own fabric block printing which is fabulous to watch all the steps involved. K(Q)uber Arts has wonderful art with exquisite detail. Get your name written on a grain of rice. None of these sites would have been possible were it not for the service recieved from VCare Tours and Travels owned by Mr. Deepak Dhandh. Mr. Dhandh and his staff were very attentive to the needs of his clients. Very clean vehicles professional courteous service was provided by all. The drivers as well as Mr. Dhandh made great suggestions for touring sites when the client ran out of ideas. I would highly recommend this company. the address is (--)I can't wait to go back!as you will not be disappointed."
50,“Jaipur is a wonderful city”,"One of the cities that we had the privilege to tour during our recent visit to India was Jaipur. Jaipur is a very clean and hospitable city. Known as the pink city because many of its buildings are painted light pink, Jaipur boasts of many interesting and beautiful sights for tourist to see. The Wind Palace is located on one of the main streets of Jaipur and was the home to the ruler's many wives. There is an astrologic observatory that was built 1718. But no trip to Jaipur would be complete without a visit to the Amber Fort. This fort and palace are an excellent example of Mogul architecture. It is beautifully maintained and preserved. The view of the surrounding valley and hills are amazing. Elephant rides from the parking lot into the fort are available for a small fee and well worth the price."
40,“Exprience of Pink City jaipur”,"I travelled in jaipur rajasthan in last month and i found a plenty of culture an heritage from there especial y i got some incredible enjoyment in Chowki dhaani, is a well-recreated Rajasthani village. “chowki dhaani” means a small village in the local language.

30,“Disappointing compared to Delhi and Agra”,"The mirrored room known as the Pavilion of Mirrors was unusual and pretty, but no one is allowed inside, so photos had to be taken through the doorways. If the forts in Agra or Delhi are on your list, you may consider skipping Jaipur in order to have time for more interesting sights. The ""pink city"" was just an ordinary, dirty town in which buildings were painted a salmon color. The museum was okay, with many articles of clothing from past rulers. The art gallery has many artists working and waiting to sell you their beautiful wares, if you are interested. Our guide seemed to be in a hurry to finish and was not helpful. When asked where I could buy dresses for 100 rupees for an orphanage I'd visited, he laughed and said it wasn't possible. I asked to be dropped on the street and soon found several places with dresses as low as 80 rupees ($1.65). It was 120 F in June, so another time of year may be better. I was very thankful for the good AC at the inexpensive hotel (not available online)."
50,“Jaipur Sightseeing”,"Any tourist worth his salt would tell you that if you have not visited the Pink City of Jaipur, then you have not tasted the best of Rajasthan culture. The capital of the state of Rajasthan is so called because of the color of the sand stone used in all the buildings in the old city. Full of forts and palaces, some still occupied, this city is the best of the three town of the Golden Triangle of the North (Delhi, Jaipur, Agra).Jaipur is 267 kilometers from Delhi and easily accessible by road, rail or air. The best way to go around the city is to take the one day tour provided by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. This perfectly guided tour ensures that one is able to see all the major spots including the three main forts and also learn about the rich history behind each. Once the tour is over, we can go check out the shopping spots and other places of interest at leisure.This fort is the most imposing of the trio at the entrance to the pink city. This fort overlooks the town and the best time to visit is when the sun is setting over the city, since we get the magical sight of the streetlights being turned on in the city.The fort is run as a tourist attraction by the RTDC. There is a nice restaurant there but no staying facilities. However that is not much of a problem, since hotels are a plenty in the city, for each kind of budget. Tourists have to beware of touts all over the place, each trying to push a hotel or a restaurant, or trying to get us to buy “real” jewellery. Authentic blue pottery is available and lac bangles are another famous item. The government or co-operative shops are to be preferred for authenticity and to avoid getting cheated."
40,“Jaipur has endless heritage sites”,"We arrived at Jaipur airport from Mumbai around early evening of April 27. We had arranged with the hotel for a pickupfrom the airport at a cost of Indian rupees 350 (approx.C $ 9). We were tired, hungry, screaming for a bath and longing to get to the hotel. However, our pickup was nowhere to be seen. There were a dozen or so drivers with placards waving around looking for their passengers but the driver from Hotel Umaid Bhavan was MIA. We even approached a placard bearing driver who was carrying a placard with a name that could have been mispelt for mine, but no luck. After waiting around for 15 mins or so we went back into the airport area to access the communications centre set up there for passengers. Always keep your boarding card handy, without it we would not have been able to gain entry to the airport area after exiting. Phone call to Umaid Bhavan cost us Rs.20 (approx. C 50 cents). Spoke to Ranvijay who happened to be the guy I was corresponding with re. the booking,etc. Ranvijay is one of the sons of the owners and the entire family is active in the hotel/tourist industry. I told Ranvijay about the MIA driver and he said to stay on the line and he would check. I was holding for a good 10 minutes and out of frustration disconnected the line. Ranvijay rang the communications centre just as we were exiting and said that the driver was actually outside waiting for us and asked us to describe what we were wearing so he could identify us.When we got back to the area with the placard waving guys, the driver from UB approached us and LIED that he was in thecrowd all the while. I hit back aggressively and called him a liar to his face. He then said that our flight must have come EARLY. Lesson to be learnt from this for others: Instead of booking through this hotel, just get a pre-paid taxi from the airport itself. It will either cost you the same or less and you will escape the frustration of waiting for your driver or suffering his lies. This particular driver told us that he was the ""transport manager"" for the hotels owned by the same family and spoke good English. All he had to do was make an apology for his lateness, but if you ever come across a Rajasthani male making an apology and admitting he is wrong, then you are not in the presence of aRajasthani, you are probably speaking to one of the milder, friendlier Indians from the south western coast of India..As Jaipur was in the grips of a heat wave, we had to carry litres of water or soft drinks with us on our treks to the countless heritage sites and monuments in and around the city. We stayed in Jaipur for 4 nights/5 days. The first 2 days we moved about on our own and visited the Hawa Mahal, City Palace, Pink City,Jaipur Albert Museum and walked around the city gates with our cameras and mingled with the locals. We sat at junkfood places for the coolness and had ice-cold drinks sold at 3 to 4 times the cost at supermarkets. We did people watching. People watched us, in fact shop workers (who were probably bored) came out of their shops to watch us.Jaipur is an aggressive city with a strain of the most aggressive Hindu mentality I have ever seen in India. As Christians wearing western garb, we solicited angry looks - more so, because we could be identified as Christian Indians as my daughter proudly insisted on wearing her glittering Swarowski cross necklacethroughout our treks.If you take one of the tours offered by travel agencies and the Rajasthan Tourist Corp, you will never get to see the Hawa Mahal like we did. The street where the Hawa Mahal stands is a no parking zone (although the street is parked with cars but those cars belong to the shops lined on both sides of the street).Your tour bus or car will just pass by and linger only a moment or two for photo ops of the facade and that's that.I would suggest that you plan to do some of the more important sights on your own and then take either a full day or a half day tour with the RTC. We took a half day tour with 2 other people and paid Rs.150 each. Your guide/driver will take you to some stupid dye makingfactory or to some leather store or some other crap store where he will get a commission if you buy something. Just go ahead and lose your temper like I did. Stay in the car and refuse to get out to see the junk. The driver will get the message. If he is thick-skinned or thick-headed, do like I did. I wailed at him in my colorful Hindi and said what he is doing is unforgiveable as he is wasting our time at these money grabbing places instead of showing us what the RTC is supposed to be showing the tourists - heritage sites.Well, he then gave us more time at the Amber fort and other places, took snide looks at my face to check my temperature,but later in the car he took his revenge by telling me that 300 years ago everyone in India were Hindus and not Christians.I told him that our ancestors are from Goa and our Christian backgrounds go well over 400 years and we are not linkedto the British but to the Portuguese. However, he brushed my claims aside by giving me a betrayed look.This incident as well as some remarks from other Rajasthanis have made me come to the conclusion that Rajasthanis donot get on well with their 9 percent Muslim population nor with their almost non-existent Christian population.Remember, Jaipur is the city where in 2007 more than 70 people were killed by muslim militants who placed home made bombs in scooters and bicyles around the city gates. Another obvious fact is the absence of females in the throngs of peoplemilling around the city. Either they all have cars and refuse to walk with mere mortals, or they stay indoors away fromthe prying eyes of these hungry Rajasthani males. The only place we saw females was in the Babu Market. We also heardone lone Christian voice haggling for a pair of earrings and wearing western garb. I could not find even one Englishlanguage newspaper in Rajasthan although India boasts that English is its second language. This desert state of Indiais no friend of the English language and I suspect of anything English.Caution about the Rickshaw drivers in Jaipur: The drivers are crooks of the first order. Our biggest expense was transportationin and around Jaipur. For example, if a native Rajasthani is charged Rs.40 for a certain distance, take it for grantedyou will be quoted 4 times that figure. You can look like a native, talk like one, dress like one - but no escaping theseguys, they can smell the Canadian or UK or USA something on you. I hated the shark like feeding frenzy emitting fromRajasthanis. Compared to these guys, the rickshaw drivers in Mumbai are saints.(more on Jaipur under Hotels : Umaid Bhavan)"
50,“Mystical”,"April 2009 was my third trip to Jaipur for a wedding. I have always found something mystical about Jaipur. The city has so much to offer. We were staying in Trident which is close to major tourist spots like Amber Fort.On our way to hotel from the airport, we crossed pink city and also stopped to have a view of Hawa Mahal. It was my husband’s first time to Jaipur and he was elated to see pink city. He found the hustle bustle, narrow roads, and hand rickshaw at 40 degree heat – all very intimating.One must stop at hawa mahal for bangle shopping, its cheap and pretty designs."
50,“My many favourite places in India”,Tha Pink City. What a beautiful place.
20,“A Dissapointment”,"Of the major attractions in the north of India to visit, Jaipur is the most dissapointing. Although in guide books, it is touted as having many sites and attractions, it is--despite being the capital of Rajasthan--one of the dirtiest cities. Traffic is even more of a nightmare to manouever than other places and going out at night is a harrowing and terrible experience. Of the sites, the only one worth the visit is Amber Fort, which is located outside Jaipur. Jaipur's City Palace is now a museum which has a few items of interest but mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. You can only take pictures from the street of the Palace of the Winds, and the Lake Palace is unvisitable due to ongoing renovation for the past 25 years. Even the observatory, Jantar Mantar, is not that memorable a place to visit.Despite being one of the most well-planned pre-modern cities of its time, today the sheer mass of 5 million people crammed into its six sectors makes for an impossibly unbearable time in this area."
40,“Memories of Jaipur”,"In short, Jaipur is filled with History and memories of a glorious past. So much so that its people have forgotten their present. My impression of the place was that in spite of having such a wonderful cultural and historical heritage, the focus is only on making money. Everything seemed to have a price tag.My favourite eating joint was the Hotel in the Jaigarh fort. Surprisingly, every person that I spoke to informed me that the place was damn expensive and simply not worth going to. Not only was it economical, the food was lip smacking! Don't miss it! Also, Jaipur is famous for its delicious ""Kulfi"" - milk based ice creams on stick & locally made Jucies reffered to as ""Sharbats"". Do give them both a try.Jaipur has plenty to see and do. In addition to the usual Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, City Palace, Amer Fort, Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh Fort - Take a cycle rickshaw ride of the city, walk the shopping areas of Bapu market, Johri Bazar, Nehru market. Eat at least one meal at the Hotel at Jaigarh fort - you'll not regret it. Do not go to LMB resturant - its all hype and no substance and over priced at that.Jaipur is an extremely tourist friendly place. Having said that, if you want to drive a hard bargain, Cash works better than Credit Cards. So remember to carry some Cash for the ""bargains"" that you want to get. For Handicrafts - visit the Rajasthali only on Ajmeri Gate. The other Rajasthali don't have the variety nor the quality. The one on Ajmeri gate has a eye popping collection of handicraft. If you are the bargaining type, go to Johari Bazar or the Market opp Hawa Mahal. Keep in mind that the prices quoted are atleast 2 times more than the actual price, so bargain to your hearts content."
40,“Great place for those with a high tolerance for hassles”,"Jaipur is a fascinating and photogenic city in Rajasthan. Though hassles are high with con-men everywhere and the usual filth and frustrations of Rajasthan, if you can handle air pollution and the usual India issues, it's a great place!"
50,“beauty and brain at its best”,"A magnificant place to be 'Jaipur'. Ones You enter the city you start feeling royal. its palaces and forts make you feel like a kig or queen from past era. Palaces like Amer fort, Jaigarh Fort, hawa mahal etc are excelent examples for beauty, great architecture, and intricrate craftmenship. Handicraft of the city is mind blowing. Colours of natural dies on fabric seems each figure is telling a beautiful story of being a part of teh fabric. My experience for Jaipur pulls me everytime to visit the city again and again."
40,“Jaipur- The Pink City”,"Jaipur, Rajasthan, is located in the western part of India. The city is well known as the Pink City due to its pinkinsh appearance of the local markets and the residential buildings.Jaipur is popular amongst the tourist flocking in to India for its dense cultural and diverse heritage.I got a fine chance to be at this city with my friends for a week. There we found many good hotels to stay in wid very cheap rates. We rented one of such hotels named Hotel Jaipur Inn.The hotel provided us with some sight seeing cabs throught the city and in its vicinity. we were amazed to see the historical buildings like the jantar mantar, the Hawa Mahal, the Amber Fort, Nahargarh Fort, etc. Apart from this we also visited the old city market which was wholly painted pink.The city of Jaipur was having a mixed fragrance of rich cultural heritage and the modern hang outs, and eateries.All together it was a very good experience of us to visit an exceptional place like Jaipur."

50,“Best Place in the Golden Triangle”,"First, strong piece of advice. Get a government driver to take you around--it will save you a lot of time and headaches. We got Naim Khan (have his contact info if anyone is going and needs it) from the office in the railway station and he was excellent--especially as I compare him to our driver in Agra. Honest, agreeable, and knew how to get us to the places we wanted to see while maximizing our time there.A lot of things are worth seeing from the outside but not paying for entry (the Hawa Mahel and the Central Museum/Albert Hall, for example). The exceptions are the City Palace and the Jantar Mantar--definitely pay the admission price rather than admiring them from outside. Don't skip the Royal Gaitor--the tombs are spectacular and it's strangely empty and peaceful.Outside of Jaipur, the Amber Fort is a lot of fun--especially if you're into wandering passageways and ramparts (I am). We spent hours in there after visiting the sites in the center of town earlier. One tip--if you've got a woman in your party, have them stand in the all-women's ticket line. It moves much faster, and the fort is crowded! Also, if you are in a party of all women, be prepared for people to ask you to take pictures with them.We stayed at both Shapura House (gorgeous, but expensive) and Diggi Palace (the manager really knows Jaipur and was very helpful). Would recommend both."
50,“Jaipur”,Hay guysJaipur is my Native place...so obviously I am the right person who can suggest you best about jaipur...its a placa of historic fort...incrideble temples and moreover famous for tasty food...so you must visit it
50,“My Pink City Jaipur”,"Jaipur is pink city and heart of Rajasthan. Jaipur is made from Maharaja Sawati Jai Singh. This is only city will be made in very professional way that time. here some places are world wide famous like Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, Amer Fort, etc.Jaipur persons are very good in behaviour and Jaipur is famous for percious gems and jewellary. also traditional bandhaje work cloth."
40,“Awesome Awesome Awesome”,"One of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. The place gives you a feeling of real royalness of Royal Rajasthan. Lots of places to see which gives you an idea of how Rajputs used to live and rule the state.My favourite was a place called Chokhi Dhani where you can see complete Rajisthani Culture on display at a single place. It has thier Folk dances(Number of them), Puppet shows, Animal rides and what not.Good Travel is never complete with out good food and there is Rajisthan you have a variety of delicious food for taking. A place called Laxmi Misthan Bhandar(a 3-Star hotel) is famous for service Authentic Rajisthani Delicacies. Thier Thali is highly reccomended..All those Palaces, Forts and Museums will add more to the spice of Rajisthani ways of living. More over, the place is great for shopping Rajisthani traditional Dresses, Shoes, Souvenirs etc....So what are you waiting for.. Have a happy trip to Jaipur - The Pink City..Cheersadios"
40,“Jaipur....the pink city”,"Jaipur, also known as the pink city, the capital city of Rajasthan.....got to see it last week during one of my friends marriage.

50,“destination-jaipur”,"Jaipur,the pink city,is a wonder for whoever goes there,because of its fineness.In Jaipur,you get the feelings of the olden times.There are two sections to this city- the wall city and the new city.The wall city is the older part of jaipur.Most of the monuments are located here.The hawa mahal, the Jantar Mantar are some of the common tourist's spot.The jantar mantar is amust visit for all who goes there.Though,there are five of these, the Jaipur Jantar mantar is the only fully operational observatory.Also there are some instruments that is unique to it,like the solar path finder,the north-star locator etc.The city has a huge bazaar near the hawa mahal.It contains all you may need.The city itself is surrounded with seven gates,each with it's unique name,like the ajmeri gate etc.The new city is the extension of the older Jaipur.It mostly contains resturants,hotels etc.Jaipur is indeed a splendid place to visit and is a perfect holiday-making spot."
40,“PINK CITY”,"India’s “pink city” (painted in honour of a visit from British Royalty in 1867), Jaipur is one of the country’s favourite tourist destinations, capital of the Rajasthan region. The original walled section of the city contains a colourful pageant of Indian tribal life with its bustling Johari Bazaar (don’t miss the jewellery markets) and theremore are numerous interesting sights to see on holiday in Jaipur, from the Hawa Mahal (palace) with its harem quarters to a fascinating antique observatory."

40,“The beautiful pink city of India”,"This is a great place to visit if you haven't already done so. I live in Noida, UP India. It's a 5-6 hours bus-ride from Noida. We stayed at a reasonable A/C guest-house near the Jaipur Bus-stand for 500 Rs/night. The next day we took a Jaipur-tourist Bus which takes you around the city for the day and charges around Rs. 150-200 per head. We visited quite a number of places like Raj-Mandir, Jantar-Mantar, Hawa-Mahal, Jal-Mahal, Pink-City and the Jaisingh Palace. It was a great day at Jaipur. Finally in the evening the bus dropped us at ""Choki-Dhani"" which is like a 3-Star resort with traditional Rajasthani setup and divine Rajasthani Cuisine. They had a lot of in-house attractions like elephant, horse and camel rides. Junk Jewelery markets and lot of small village-like shows. It was a wonderful place to Visit.Hope you like my review and visit Jaipur Soon. Also try and see Agra and Fatehpur Sikri if possible."
50,“My best trip”,"I want to share my views with all of you regarding my trip to jaipur, rajasthan. I is a great historical place.

40,“Ethnic Jaipur...Exotic Jaipur”,I have visited so many monuments and historical places in Jaipur and I found them all a great attraction. People were very helpful over there and in addition I got so many handcrafted items those are really reare in the world and jewellry and Bangles are exclusive. I love this place overall..
40,“my favourite place in rajasthan”,"jaipur is a very good place for shopping. One can find lots of variety in sarees, juti, and quilts ... I really enjoyed my stay overe there."
50,“Finally We Made IT !!!!”,"Come on yaar! We are getting late!! As this was our first trip to the pink city, Jaipur, all four of us were full of excitement and energy. Being working in travel agency it was a cakewalk for us to get the hotel booked that too at a very reasonable price. We reached Gurgaon bus stand at about five o clock in the evening as our Volvo was supposed to arrive at 5:30, but we came to know from our fellow travelers that the coach was late by 1 hour due to serious traffic jam. Our minds were clogged up with the thought that whether we would be able to make it today. After a long wait, our luxury coach arrived and we got ready for our exciting trip to the land of maharajas .We reached Jaipur about 12 in night. The city was still awake; you could feel the vivid culture and life in its beautifully painted walls and local shops selling authentic delicacies and souvenirs.Our hotel Hari Mahal Palace, a heritage property was located very near to the bus stand. The hotel had sprawling gardens and was decorated in ethnic Rajasthani style. It was once the Haveli of one of the rich zamindars of Jaipur. The hotels had so tranquil environs that we decided to come down and rest for a while in the serene surroundings of the gardens. Next day we got ready to explore the major tourist destinations of Jaipur. As the taxi stand was very far from the hotel, we requested one of the hotels caretakers to arrange a cab for us. .Crossing the buzzing markets, our first stopover was the famous cenotaph of maharajahs of Jaipur. It is the cremation place of the kings and queens of Jaipur. There was nothing very alluring about the place. One thing that actually caught our attentions was the deep wells dugged in the interiors of the monument.To the back of the Cenotaph was the grand Nahargarh fort. Due to scorching heat, nobody showed an interest to climb the countless stairs that leads to the top of the fort. The next monument on our plan was Amber fort. Dotted with numerous trees, the road to Amber is a visual delight. Amber fort is really grand and majestic. A walk to the entrance of the fort was really tough but interesting. We quenched our thirst with the lip smacking kulfis, which were full of cream and nuts. The fort is very big and it is difficult to see all the courtyards with in one or two hours. We were shocked to see that the place is not that well maintained. People have inscribed their names on the walls, which has actually spoiled the beauty of the fort.After a long and lazy promenade at the Amber fort, it was time to satisfy our grumbling stomachs. Being a popular tourist destination there is no dearth good restaurants in Jaipur. With the help of our driver, we landed up in a pure veg restaurant situated in the main market area. We ordered some authentic Rajasthani delicacies. The restaurant was full of foreign tourists who were eager to try out some spicy dishes. We enjoyed our food with the amazing songs played in the background on Sarangi by a man clad in the typical Rajasthani attire. The food was delicious and reasonably priced.After a filling lunch, we went to City palace. It is the current residence of Rajmata Gayatri Devi. Half of the palace has been converted in to a museum. The museum is divided in to different courtyards displaying armaments, textiles, jewelry, antiques and paintings belonging to royal gharanas of Jaipur. Outside the main palace are the shops selling ethnic Rajasthani souvenirs, textiles and handicrafts. The most interesting of all is the Diwane Aam where we relaxed and enjoyed the puppet show and Rajasthani folk songs. It was so full of life that we did not feel like leaving that place. This was the end to our heritage tour. We decided to go to Birla Mandir rather visiting any other historic monument. The ambiance at the Mandir was truly divine.It was time to reach our final destination Chowki Dhani. We were given a warm welcome at the gate with flowers and tikkas. We actually started behaving like a 5 years old kid as soon as we entered in Chowki Dhani. Oh, my god the place had so many things to do and see. The loud Ram Ram Saa made us feel as if we were in one of the villages of Rajasthan. Nishana baji, bioscope, camel ride, manual roller coasters took us back to our golden childhood days. The hearty meal of Chowki Dhani was a memorable feast. We had our royal dinner in the open courtyards. We were served so many dishes that we got so confused about what to try first. After a scrumptious dinner, we danced with the folk dancers and enjoyed to the fullest. We were so tired that nobody had energy to discuss about the masti and fun we did whole day. Next morning, after a boxing dinner we checked out of the hotel and boarded the bus back to Delhi. It was truly a memorable trip for all of us not only because we finally made it to Jaipur, but because we got so many unforgettable memories, which we would cherish for whole of our life."
20,“Old-worldly Jaipur”,"Jaipur came across as a busy, busy city of India. Quite unexpected. It is of course known to be a Tier II city – a city that is looked to for growth by all marketers and retailers. But nevertheless, I was unprepared for the busy, dusty, noisy roads. The shops that were open well beyond 8 pm – most of the small towns in India shut down by 7.30- to 8 pm. The number of vehicles on the roads. And most of all, the burgeoning population. Jaipur’s hotspots – tourist ones that is – fairly teem with people. The Johri Bazaar area is packed with people and vehicles – our vehicle found a parking space with difficulty. The Birla temple was equally crowded. Not so the City Palace, which had a fair number of tourists but was not overcrowded at that time of the year – September is just but not quite the beginning of the tourist season. However, beware of the commercialism that has gripped Jaipur.There are n number of hotels to cater to all pockets in Jaipur, so you can take your pick.And oh yes, one more thing about Jaipur – its architecture. I found it very interesting. All buildings have lovely arches on the windows. The buildings are all in a reddish pink colour – hence, the moniker of ‘Pink City’ and all the buildings have an old-world feel which is unique to this city. I felt like I had entered the world of maharajahs and maharanis, palaces and dungeons when I entered the city. The city has some seven gates that surround the old city and very beautiful those gates are too. Pink and arched with some beautiful designs painted onto them (or was it carved?). When in the old city, it feels like a king will step out of one of the stately buildings, clad in a royal reddish pink outfit with a sword at his waist and a procession of courtiers behind him. Quite fascinating.The City Palace has a sub-set palace called the Sheesh Mahal. Now, one would think that the city would be delighted to throw open the doors of Sheesh Mahal to visitors – after all, how many cities in India have a palace (Mahal) made of glass (Sheesh)? But alas and alack, I realized I was the naïve one. Sheesh Mahal has an entry fee of Rs.2,500 per person!!!! Yes, you read it right, Rs.2,500 per person. I fairly fainted (and not just because of the heat) when I reached the entry to this exalted palace. And yes, you guessed it right – we turned back. No palace is worth Rs.2,500 per person. I’d rather go to a nearby hill station for a weekend holiday in that much money. So, that was that.There is another attraction that Jaipur boasts of called Hawa Mahal. It is a palace that was made for the royal ladies of Jaipur. In the days of the purdah, when they were forbidden from showing their faces to the outside world of men, they congregated in this Hawa Mahal to watch processions that took place on the streets below them. The palace was under construction and coupled with the scorching heat which made sightseeing a pain, I didn’t quite enjoy the Hawa Mahal. There are other tourist attractions too in the city which any of the rickshaw drivers or tourist cabs, whom you can hire for the day, will take you to. There is also a prepaid city tour that you can take from Hotel Gayatri (I think). Do visit the new part of Jaipur which has lovely bungalows and a peaceful air above it.Jaipur is famous for its gemstones and within Jaipur, Johri Bazaar is the place to go to. Again, in Johri Bazaar, which is vast and can confuse a non-Jaipuri, ‘Govindji ka Rastaa’ was the recommended area. We ourselves were in Jaipur for a short time and therefore could not visit Johri Bazaar, much to our intense regret, but we did go to some wholesalers on M.I.Road for gemstones. Don’t know if we got cheated but still…in case you don’t have time, try some of the smaller shops on M.I.Road near Khasa Kothi for gemstones. There are of course bigger shops on M.I.Road which sell jewelry but as we were not interested in jewelry, I can’t give you any feedback on those. Do remember however, gemstones are pretty expensive even if Jaipur is supposed to be a hub for them. Also, there are some birthstones which supposedly should not be worn by anybody other than those born with that particular birth sign. So, ask the shopkeeper for guidance.And yes, don’t forget to bargain with the rickshaw drivers. The cabs and rickshaws are quite quite expensive and one needs to be sharp while dealing with them. So also the coolies. But one can’t do much as far as coolies go since the exorbitant rates seem to be premeditated."
20,“Heriatage city”,"True heritage city in rajasthan , i have seen lot of things like alberhall, janta mantar, hawa mahan, amer fort, Jal mahal ...All these things are amazing and every one should see if they will come in jaipur.Here rajasthan food special like dal batti curma is also very tasty."
50,“the pink city is excellent for shopping”,Well i find it excellent partly because i have many cousins there but apart from that it's a great place for shopping.whenever we make a trip i splurge all my shopping money there.
50,“Just some tips”,Just thought this mighy be helpful since I didn't know this:Jantar Mantar and The Observatory are the same thing.Nahargarh and Jaigarh Forts are very near each other so good to tour them both together.The Rambagh Palace is a hotel (converted from a palace owned by the royal family) and has an excellent restaurant for some high quality dining.Laxmi Narayan Temple is the same as Birla Temple and is only open in the afternoons.Go to Gem Palace (a jewel shop) for the expereince---even if you can't afford to buy anything!
40,“Excellent place - for a visit or for living”,"Though I spent only three night here, and that too entirey for tourism reasons, I loved the city of Jaipur. Not in many places you see this kind of perfect harmony between the old history of hundrds of year and the modern world of neon signs, McDConalds and 5-star hotels.When one reaches Jaipur, it looks like any other modern city. - approched by 4-lane highways, networked by widr rods, neon signs advertising the latest fashions and commodities, all kinds of automobolies. Only the occasional elephants and sight of the red brick walls give one a hint of the other part of it. As one drives through those walls, the city changes. The huge markets, lined with innumerable (mostly old) old shops selling everything starting from utensils to embroidered skirts to sweets to hardware to whatever comes on your mind, are a treat like nothing else to any person who loves shopping. The beauty of the markets is that every shop has a frontage that looks alike - red bricks, pillars, whitewashed name plates exhibiting the names of the shops in the exact same fonts in Hindi. And nestled in this huge shopping arena are the wonderful structures of Hawa Mahal, the City Palace, Jantar Mantar, Isar Lat etc.Apart from the world-renowned attractions like the Amber Palace, Jaigarh Fort, City Palace and Jal Mahal, the city itself is a treat to be in. Very lively, very colorful, very cheerful, in spite of a large population that is poor. It is an exhilarating experience to just walk the streets and get lost in the crowd and be a part of the drama. It is even better if you can remove the tourist tag written on your head. We tried that one of the days, dressed down, with our car parked at a distance, and it was pretty much a success. This way one is saved from the extra attention from hawkers, guides and the shopkeepers as well, and one also stands a much better chance of striking a good bargain.However, the best part about the city, I feel, is the people. As I mentioned earlier, in spite of a large section of poor people, this city can boast of the cheerfulness index of its residents. Smile at somebody, and you get a smile back. Ask someebody for direction, and you may very well get an impression that the only task this person was born with was to take pains in explaining it in the greatest details to you. Negotiate with a shop keeper for an hour and come out of his shop without buying a single thing, and you will not see a frown. Expect the best customer service, and you won't get disappointed.The only reason I did not rate this review perfect five was the pathetic traffic in the core city and the even more pathetic drivers. Driving in the walled city can be as bad an experience as you can think of. Our professional driver almost got a nervous breakdown negotiating the traffic in the evenings. And the drivers are worse than you could imagine. When we were moving at a snail speed through the traffice, whenever our car was stoppoing after every few feet because of the traffic, the bicycles and the motorcycles kept on hitting the rear bumper - every single time. There is no concept of leaving a gap of a few inches between vehicles - they need to touch each other. And if the person behind you is not a master of maintaining a zero distance, then he is bound to hit you before stopping. However, even this act is performed with a smile. So no complaints.A few tips for tourists:-----------------------------1. Try to act as a local when you are shopping in these areas.2. Take a huge repository of fivers and tennners. Tips are expected at every nook and corner. And you will end up in such situations time and again that you will feel sorry if you can't tip.3. If your route within the city passes through the Walled City, then plan for enough buffer in your schedule, particularly in the evening.4. You can drive all the way up to the gate of Amber Palace. Don't leave your car at the parking below the hill and waste time/money/energy in climbing up or hiring a jeep or elephant.5. Chokhi Dhani resort is a delight and may very well be a respite after a long day of travelling around. Also, it serves authentic Rajasthani food.6. Hawa Mahal faces east and the best time to see/photograph it is in the early morning.7. Jal Mahal faces west and the best time to see/photograph it is in the evening, just before sunset.8. If you have just one day in Jaipur, start very early and make Amber Palace your first stop.9. We visited in Oct-2007. Unfortunately, Jaipur (city as well as the attractions) is undergoing a mega-renovation. Hence some major attractions are closed, like the Albert Museum. Also, many attractions are being renovated and are not in a condition to be photographed."

40,“worth a visit”,"Had a great time.....we hired a personal guide for the day (only 450 rupees about £6) and visited the Amber fort. Take the elephant ride, great fun (450 rupees per elephant). Wonderfully maintained palace at the topWe also saw Jantar Mantar (the observatory) very interesting. and the City Palace has loads to see.The `palace of winds' is a stop off only.

50,“C'è tutto...ma proprio tutto...non si fa mancare niente!!!”,"Chi non e' mai stato in India non riesce a credere a cosa ci sia per le strade.E' inimmaginabile per un occidentale poter concepire una simile assurdita'.Vi descrivo una delle citta' più tranquille che ho visto, Jaipur, inRajasthan.Migliaia di auto, moto, bici, carretti, calessi, camion, tuc tuc (speciali veicoli a tre ruote di una marca italiana riservati al mercato indiano e sudafricano) che suonano il clacson in continuazione, in eterna fibrillazione, senza clemenza, senza il minimo bisogno o di fronte al minimo ostacolo, cosi', per estrema abitudine ed assuefazione, anche a sollecitareil verde dopo il rosso, peraltro stranamente sempre rispettato.A questa moltitudine di mezzi e rumori, intercalati con la moltitudine umana a piedi, fra donne con la brocca in testa in elegante sari, vecchi col turbante e scolari in compunta divisa, fa da cornice un'altra moltitudine di elementi, ancor più numerosa, anche se più silenziosa: gli animali.Vacche magrissime ovunque, insensibili al clacson, spesso sdraiate, incuranti, nelle strade, spartiacque del traffico nella proverbiale tolleranza indiana, che risparmia la loro vita ma non certo il loro udito, elefanti e cammelli attaccati a carri e a volte liberi, centinaia e centinaia di maialini neri e caprette e pecore e cavalli e scimmiette e pavoni e scoiattoli e topi e bufali e ciuchi, rovesciati nelle strade a colorare questo incredibile guazzabuglio, questo frastuono insensibile anchealla morte di qualche cavallo o cammello ancora attaccato, che solo la notte attenua un poco, per ricominciare subito violento alle prime luci dell'alba, quando il sonno disturbato degli avvoltoi si scuote lento come il loro volo dalle guglie dei templi di citta' a ricercare mete più tranquille dei Mahal di città e seguendoli anche tu ritroverai un po' di pace, magari allo splendido Forte Amber, sopra un docile elefante che ti eviterà le fatichedella salita al castello più bello del Rajasthan."
50,“Muss man erlebt haben ...”,"Rosarot, laut, ungestüm, schmutzig, aufdringlich, ... aber so sehens- und erlebenswert präsentiert sich Jaipur.Der Palast der Winde, das Stadttor und überhaupt, die Stadt selbst, die Menschen, die Märkte, die Affen, die Elefanten und nicht zu vergessen die heiligen Kühe ergeben eine einmalige Mischung indischer Kultur. Ein einmaliges Erlebnis!"
50,“wie im film”,"jaipur trägt nicht zu unrecht den titel ""rosarote stadt"", denn fast alle gebäude in der altstadt sind in rosarot gehalten. ros ist die farbe der gastlichkeit und so wurden die häuser 1853 gestrichen als Prinz Albert von England zu besuch kam. jedenfalls sehenswert ist der palast der winde, der den damen des hofes dazu diente aus kleinen fenstern das treiben auf der strasse beobachten zu können, ohne dabei selbst gesehen zu werden. im wesntlichen besteht dieser ""palast"" aber nur aus einer fassade. 11 kilometer von jaipur entfernt liegt amber fort, ein ehemaliger königspalast, den man jedenfalls auch besichtigen sollte. jaipur sollte man auf einer indien reise jedenfalls besichtigen!"
20,“Einfach vermeidenswert”,"Dies ist sehr subjektiv geschrieben und einfach meine Meinung zu dieser Stadt:die Stadt ist dreckig, stinkend und die sogenannte Pink City hat eigentlich keine richtig interessante Sehenswürdigkeiten. Vielleicht habe ich mich aber am sog. Palast der Winde damals nur satt gesehen und finde diesen nun nicht mehr attraktiv. Ausserdem belagern dich irgendwelche Geschäftsmacher bereits beim Betrachten des Objektes.Der Stadtpalast ist sein Eintrittsgeld nicht wert.Wenn überhaupt, dann bleibt lediglich Amber, welches ausserhalb liegt als besichtigungswürdig übrig."
50,“India en coche - Jaipur”,"Acabo de volver de un viaje por la India en coche (con conductor, por supuesto, pues una vez visto como es la conduccion en este pais no creo que hubiera vuelto sano y salvo conduciendo yo mismo). Una de las ciudades que mas me gustó fue Jaipur, la capital del Rajastan y una de las ciudades que forman el famoso Triángulo de Oro.Despues de pasar por ciudades extremadamente caoticas y sucias como Delhi y Varanasi, Jaipur fue como un oasis de orden y limpeza. Su gran atractivo turistico es la llamada Ciudad Roja, un conjunto arquitectónico repleto de palacios construido con piedra de este color. Merece la pena perderse por sus rincones y si quereis ir de compras este es el lugar idoneo tanto por el precio como por la calidad. No dudeis en ir al fuerte de Amber, a tan solo unos 10 min en coche del centro. Se trata de un conjunto amurallado entre preciosas colinas. De camino se puede parar en el lago Man Sagar y contemplar el Water Palace. Merece la pena.El chofer que nos llevo es local de Jaipur y nos consiguió hoteles increibles a precios irrisorios. Habla buen ingles y su gran amabilidad no es facil de encontrar en la India. Se llama Lokesh y tiene una empresa de tours turisticos llamada Royal India Tours.

40,"“Jaipur, die ""Pink City""”","Jaipur, die Hauptstadt Rajasthans, wird aufgrund der terrakottafarbenen Altstadt auch die ""Pink City"" genannt.Man kann hier sehr gut einkaufen (besser als in Agra oder Mumbai), wobei man dies nicht unbedingt in der Altstadt tun sollte, da Silberwaren, Edelsteine, Schuhe, Textilien oder Kunsthandwerkliches hier oft überteuert angeboten werden. Am besten lässt man sich von einem Tuk Tuk Fahrer in den Rajasthani fahren, einen staatlichen Shop für Kunsthandwerk, in dem es alles zu festgesetzten Preisen gibt und man nicht zum Kauf gedrängt wird.Die Altstadt betritt man durch eines der vielen prägnannten Tore und stößt auf bunte Marktstände, an denen es Obst, Blumen und Gewürze gibt. Eines der schönsten und bekanntesten Gebäude ist der Hawa Mahal, der Palast der Winde. Dieser ist eigentlich nur eine Fassade, hinter der die Frauen des Maharajas ungesehen das Geschehen auf der Straße beobachten konnten. Vorsicht, lassen Sie sich nicht von den Ladenbesitzern gegenüber des Hawa Mahal überreden, von ihrem Geschäft aus das Gebäude zu fotographieren. Dies ist nie unsonst, sondern nach unangenehmen Diskussionen muss man überteuerte Souveniers kaufen.Einen sehr guten Überblick über die Pink City mit Blick auf das Amber Fort hat man von der Terrasse eines Tempels in der Nähe des Sanganeri Gates.Ein Geheimtip in Rajasthan ist das Raj Mandir, das größte Kino Indiens, in dem in plüschiger Atmosphäre Bollywoodfilme gezeigt werden.Ein sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel ist das Pearl Palace, das von einem Sikh geführt wird und sehr sauber und liebevoll eingerichtet ist: Der Zimmerpreise für ein Aircon Raum liegt dabei unter 1000 Rp. Auf dem Dach befindet sich das Peacock Restaurant, das ausgezeichnetes Essen uns sehr guten Service bietet.Obwohl Jaipur eine Großstadt ist, ist die Atmosphäre in dieser Stadt trotzdem entspannt und man kann sich hier gut mit hochwertigen Andenken eindecken."
40,“観光は政府観光局のタクシーがおすすめ”,ごちゃごちゃしてますが、北インドでは比較的、きれいな町でした。道路も広く、渋滞も少なかったです。州の政府観光局で、タクシーをチャーターしました。安いし、タクシーは快適だし、おすすめです。ドライバーガイドさんもいい人でした。
40,“ピンクシティ”,「ジャイプル」で検索したらヒットしませんでしたが、発音はジャイプールよりもジャイプルの方が通じると思います。デリー・アグラ・ジャイプールのゴールデントライアングルのひとつで、ピンクシティとよばれるこの街の建造物は本当にピンクでした。珍しいので一軒の価値ありです。
40,“もはやピンクシティーではありません”,ピンクシティーで有名なジャイプールですが、砦から見た街はジョドプールのようなブルーシティーになっておりました。自由に誰でも家をブルーに塗っても良くなったようです。バラモンの色であるブルーに塗りたいのでしょうか？ブルーの街に変わっておりました。
40,"“El Palacio de los vientos en Jaipur, India”","Si bien se nos vende como una de las grandes atracciones de la ciudad de Jaipur, en India, todos los viajeros coinciden en que se trata simplemente de una fachada bonita. Quizás me quedo corto, porque es impresionante y muy elaborada. Lo que realmente sucede es que no es visitable, como palacio. Nos limitamos a sacar fotos desde la calle.Está ubicado en una zona comercial de Jaipur y resulta muy bulliciosa."
