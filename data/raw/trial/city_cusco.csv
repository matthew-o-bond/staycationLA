50,“Cusco the place to be”,Cisco is a very nice and clean town. It's architecture is very nice. Well known for some festivals as well. Cusco is the capital of the Incas
50,“Homecoming.”,"Whenever we arrive back into Cuzco it just feels like coming home. It has such a warm, welcoming feel & nowadays the city is so well policed that you feel totally safe wherever you go. It is also a very clean city. Shopping is amazing with all the little alleyways full of shops & markets all over the city. You will spend a lot of time taking your purchases back to the hotel before starting again. Fantastic place - one of my favourite places in the world."
50,“Definitely Visit and Explore Cusco”,"We travelled right through Cusco initially to go to Ollantaytampu before we went to Machu Pichu because we were a bit concerned about altitude sickness in Cusco. We had thought about just passing thru Cusco on our return trip from MP to Lima but friends and other travellers told us we would be foolish not to explore Cusco. We were really glad we heeded that advise and spent 2 and a half days there. It was fantastic- lots of great places to see and explore( historic and otherwise), many great restaurants, shops, etc. and in the end we had no problem with the altitude"
50,“Magical City”,"The old town part of Cusco is magical with its cobbled streets, many museums which display endless treasures of the Inca as well as many buildings having foundations built by the Inca. The shopping is wonderful for those hunting for baby alpaca and a great place to start getting used to the high altitude before Machu Picchu."
50,“One of the most incredible places I have been to”,We spent a day and would have loved to have spent longer. An amazing civilasation brought to an end by the Spaniards. The buildings etc are still in great condition and the atmosphere is overwhelming and at times eerie. A place that needed to be visited
40,“Cultural”,"In Cuzco the cultural tourism is very interesting, some agencies include the guide and the visit with relevant information to know the history of these great culture."
40,“Cusco”,"Cusco is famous to be used as a base for many backpacker before you go to Machu Picchu. You will find people resting and organizing tracking. On the other hand you find a whole bunch of parties all over town, such as Wild rover and mamma Africa, those are the best parties for sure!"
40,“Peru Trip”,"Cuzco is an exciting and vibrant city. Museums, colonial churches, and shops abound. Add the interest provided by the indigenous people and their crafts and it makes for a wonderful experience. Since my visit to the city was one stop on a multi-city tour, if possible, I would recommend spending at least 2 days exploring Cuzco. While there wasn't time to visit the San Blas district, I would recommend it for a look at fine crafts and artisan's work."
50,“Vibrant city”,"A very buzzy city, full of culture and history with lovely friendly local people. The open top double deck bus tour is good."
50,“Apu Andino Travel Classic Inca Trail”,"I went on the 4 day Classic Inca Trail with Apu Andino Travel in Aug 2012 and would highly recommend this company. I had read a lot about rogue companies prior to booking so i was a little nervous that I might get scammed going with a smaller, less well known company but I am so glad I took the risk! They turned out to be a very honest and reputable company and made the entire experience from booking to arriving at Machu Pichu flawless!!Our guide Antonio was very personable, knowledgable & entertaining. The service was second to none with promt responses to emails on the run up to my trip, good preparation advice, a personal visit from the guide the night before the trek to finalise arrangements.The trek itself was truely amazing! Antonio was very considerate of the differing levels of ability within the group and made sure that everyone got the most out of the experience. His stories were interesting and well timed. The porters were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was amazing throughout the trip!The whole experience was amazing and I would definately recommend doing this amazing trek with Apu Andino... you will not be disappointed!"
50,"“Cusco, Peru...a beautiful place”","We arrived in Callao, Peru, via cruise ship on February 15, 2013, and were whisked to the Lima airport for a flight to Cusco.The reason for the independent excursion was to see Machu Picchu. However, we loved Cusco and the surrounding Sacred Valley. Our visit to the city included four nights stay,Upon arrival at the Cusco airport, we were transferred to the Hotel Picoaga. The hotel was converted from an old mansion and retained much of it's colonial charm. In addition, it was within easy walking distance of Cusco plaza.On our first afternoon in Cusco, we were given a guided tour of the city beginning at the Plaza de Armas. In the plaza is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo, with outside façade in Renaissance style and Baroque interiors. The Convent of Santo Domingo was built above the most important Inca Temple, the Temple of the Sun, or Koricancha.From Cusco, we visited the Inca Fortress Sacsayhuaman, made up of three gigantic terraces, superimposed in a zigzag form. We, also, went to Qenqo, an Incan religious center. It has underground areas and a semicircular amphitheater with a series of stone seats. Nearby is Tambomachay, know as the Baths of the Incas. It is a place dedicated to the value of the water and was formed by aqueducts, channels, and small cascades worked in the rock.The city of Cusco is a lovely place. When we had free time, walked to the San Blas neighborhood. Its a bit up-hill but full of plenty of picturesque streets, squares, art shops, restaurants, and bars. We stopped at the San Blas Church, situated on the square with the same name. It was built in the middle of the 16th century, upon an old Inca temple.One thing I would recommend if visiting Cusco is to take altitude medication. I got a prescription from my doctor and we began taking the pills two days before our arrival in Cusco. Fortunately, we did not experience any of the symptoms of altitude sickness."
50,“Apu Andino trip to Machu Picchu and Puno Region - MArch 2013”,"Apu Andino was very flexible in putting together a trip that was a great mix of day hikes, archeological sites visits around Cusco and Machu Picchu, as well as a 4 day exploration of the Lake Titicaca region.The accommodations were very good and close to the center of towns, and close to good restaurants.The guides were very nice and knowledgeable.We highly recommend them!"
50,“EXCEL Language School in Cusco Peru”,"EXCEL Language School in Cusco is located on 336 Cruz Verde (one street off of a major street called Calle Santa Clara). It is an easy 5 minutes walk from Mercado San Pedro from one side and also about 5 minutes walk from Plaza de Armas on the opposition side. Each of our teens, who have taken 4 years and 3 years of high school Spanish, had one-on-one lessons totalling 12 hours during our days in Cusco at the end of July 2012. We supplemented our kids' classroom time with our own sightseeing time with private local tour guides we hired on our own as well as cooking lessons we arranged on our own. The school offers group classroom sessions in addition to private lessons and also offers homestay and various excursions. Though we didn't utilize these other services as we didn't know if we could be completely comfortable with these other arrangements for our kids at the time we arranged their lessons, we could not be more than happy with this school in the end. We felt somewhat of an easy feeling from the moment we exchanged email messages several months prior to our trip with Sra. Barabara (think she is the director of the school). At the moment we finally walked into the school and met one of the EXCEL teachers named Sra Esther who happended to be at the reception area at that time, we were totally at ease. And, then walked in the two private teachers for our teens, Sra Maria Ines and Sra Delmy, and it was like icing on the cake - we totally felt that we had made the right decision on choosing this school for our kids. Only wish - our kids could have had more classroom time than just the 12 hours. Our teens (and you know teens - normally they complain if they have to do academic stuff during their summer break) did not complain about their lessons but seem to have enjoyed their time (yes, even when they had homework to do for the next lessons). Upon our return home, our native Spanish speaking housekeeper commented that both of the kids seem to have become more comfortable in their conversation skills. We would recommend this language school to those that would like to learn Spanish (also think the school teach Portuguese and English) during their time in Cusco."
50,“Cusco City - Archaelogical capital of S.America”,"Located at an altitude of over 11,000 feet in the heart of the Andes mountains, is the dynamic and historic city of Cusco Peru. Cusco with a population of about 0.4 million is also called the archaeological capital of South America since it is the famed capital of the ancient Inca Empire and it has served as a travelers’ mecca for hundreds of years. Though Cusco was the center of the Inca Empire for a relatively short time, relics and imprints from the great civilization remain to this day. When you visit Cusco, you feel as if you’ve been transported to another dimension of sorts. Perhaps that is partly due to the altitude’s effect on your body and mind. If you are flying here and haven’t yet adjusted to the Andes Mountains, prepare to spend the better part of your first day simply lounging around or lying in bed with altitude sickness. While that seems wholly uncharming, there are natural means by which to ease your symptoms, like chewing coca leaves or drinking coca tea. The baroque main cathedral in the central tourist gathering spot of the Plaza de Armas is one of Cusco’s most impressive architectural structures. But perhaps even more fascinating when it comes to Cusco architecture are the surviving walls from the Inca. These walls were, and are, so strong that the Spanish often chose to simply build on top of them instead of destroying them. As if the stone streets and the city’s “living museum” feel were not enough, seeing these hundreds of years old stone walls as you make your way about town is truly a treat.Cusco Peru is a city that is perfect for travelers since it is a jump-off point for excursions on the Inca Trail and to nearby Machu Picchu. Many people will stop here before heading to Machu Picchu, or to other points of interest located within Peru’s Sacred Valley. Cusco is a busy city, thriving in fact, and traffic can be a hassle to negotiate. Just make sure to politely ask before taking pictures of the local and indigenous people, as well as offer a small and modest monetary gift. The friendly nature and disposition of the indigenous population in Cusco will surely make a mark on your soul that you will carry with you for life. Shopping in Cusco is a joy and you can taste local delicacies like roasted guinea pig.We travelled to Cusco in the midst of the Inti Rayma or Sun God festival, which is the most important Andean festival. The Inca cultures celebrate this festival from June 16th to 24th (shortest day in the Southern hemisphere). The festival travels from the ancient capital of the Inca Empire, Cusco to the massive fortress of Saqsayhuaman. The festival includes fire and lights to wake the sun god on the shortest day and longest night of the winter. The Sun, the main God of the Inca Civilization was considered to be the creator of all that exists. The festival lasts 9 days of colorful dances and processions, as well as animal sacrifices to ensure a good cropping season. The celebrants fasted for days before the event, refrained from physical pleasures and presented gifts to the Inca, who in return put on a lavish banquet of meat, corn bread, Chicha and coca tea as they prepared to sacrifice llamas to ensure good crops and fertile fields. The dance ritual happened all through the day and night and I soaked in the festivity just like 200 thousand other visitors. It was indeed a heavenly experience."
30,"“sorojchi, altitude sicknes can ruin yur trip.”","Took Cial bus in lima for 100 soles pp,21 hrs ride,most of the passengers got sick ,i heard vomiting all over when we reached abancay huge mountains with incredible curves,advice: take coca leaves with you and hot water for coca tea that'll help avoid sickness,once in cuzco there were two lady hustlers who offered lodging for 49 soles double bed,free wi-fi,cable tv at the Arcano bed and breakfast,pretty nice ladies,they rode with us in the taxi to the hotel,they even gave us coca leaf tea,which has the same effects as red bull,or any other energy drink,.great location near the mirador del inca (a terrace where you can have nice views of Cuzco),very nice.then you'll have a bunch of options you can choose from to go to Macchu Picchu starting at the hotel,bargain always on your own through the city."
50,“Fascinating Cusco”,"Great bustling town, beautiful scenery and architecture, lots of shopping and best of all - wonderful Peruvian food"
50,“Great place to prepare and acclimitise for Macchu Picchu”,"Was a beautiful historic city. So much to see and do. We hired a couple of 250cc motorbikes and went for an amazing ride through the sacred valley, the countryside is amazing. A visit to the markets for a spot of shopping, the many catherdrals are spectacular. We were there during a presidential election, so there was no shortage of dancing and festivities. The food is so hearty, but inexpensive. I really didnt take to the altitude terribly well, and was quite ill the first night, but was fine by day 2. Take plenty of time walking up those steep hills. We would have loved to spend a little more time in Cuzco - truly a facinating place."
50,“cusco”,"colourful, friendly people and alot of things to do. A nice place to take things slowly"
50,“Exceptional destination”,"We had heard such great things about visiting Cusco that we were a bit doubtful it could be that great. However, we were really delighted with our time there. There is much to see and do. The food was really great. The local crafts irresistible. The Inca ruins in the vicinity were amazing and a great lead up to Machu Picchu."
50,“Nice City”,I enjoyed walking around cusco and going to the temple of the sun. There many buildings built upon inca foundations and the streets are very nice to walk on. So many great restaurants to choose from and the peruvian people are very welcoming and courteous.
50,“Brill town.”,Loved the town and atmosphere. It is a bit 'touristy' with lots of people trying to sell you stuff. But the town is beautiful with an amazing parade every Monday morning. The market is great and locals are a joy. It is a lovely town to walk around and we felt totally safe there.
50,“Wow”,"Such a vibrant & exciting place to visit. The Locals are such wonderful, happy, friendly & helpful people. The main square is such a 'happening' place. Is always something to celebrate. So many markets, so many bargains. Quality of goods in markets is fantastic."
40,“Cusco November 2011”,"I went to Cusco first to visit the UNESCO site Potato Park outside of Pisac. Machu Pichu was on my list but I had a cold and stomach problems the week I was in Cusco, so no Machu Pichu trip. I liked the idea of the Inca Empire and the diversity of people but way too many tourists for me. You get tired of ladies with baby lammas asking for money to take their picture and young people selling massages and all kinds of stuff on the street."
50,“Beautiful city on a mountain”,"The food was great, the shops were wonderful.It was a little tiring of all the harrasment by the street venders trying to sell their wares, eventhough I know they were just trying to make a living."
50,"“Great city, well preserved. A fantastic experience”","We enjoyed the city very much. We dislike to always be attacked by sellers of every kind of things. Apart of this, a great experience."
50,“Beautiful City”,"We really enjoyed walking around Cusco, taking in the locals and enjoying the sites. The people were friendly and the restaurants cheap. In retrospect we now wish we'd have spent one extra day in Cusco, and one less in Lima"
50,“enjoy Cusco”,"Been to Cusco for 3 days, there are so many things to do, organized tours that take about 9 hours a day, Machu Picchu, Ollantaytambo, Pizac, city tour and more, so the point is to take some time to know Cusco itself. It's a very easy to walk town, with architecture, mixture of people, and a lot of ""life"". Just walk the streets to feel it's pulse, eat the local food, although you might get surprises, a good one was the ""rocoto relleno"" which was very tasty and not that hot as the name indicates, and the bad surprise was the ""Cuy"" which was quite impressive and not as tasty, or tender as we thought. Mornings a quite cold and it's nice to go early to the central square and wait for the sun coming behind the mountains and see the people just pass by. You can buy gloves, scarfs, sweaters at very good prices and each day something different happens, so be alert. There's a lot of movement during the nights but that's for another trip, as we had those 9 hour a day trips that left us full of the Inca feel but exhausted to try Cusco at night."
50,“Cusco is just magic”,"Few places have this magic halo about them like Cusco, Perú.It´s a complete experience: the fantastic sites, the impresionant culture and history, the superposition of the spanish architecture over the stone inca edifications.The landscape is beautiful and breathtaking. I really enjoy visiting Cusco, the people are so friendly. I recommend viajestodoperu and Edith Vega Centeno for making this trip a special one. Her attention and knowledege of the local places and off-the beaten paths make it a different experience."
50,"“Lots of activities, make sure you stay 3 or more days to aclimitize”","Great place to stay and enjoy the historic sites. We took some incredible side trips around the area. I wouldn't do rafting, i would do more horsback and mountain biking next time. I did find it hard to adjust to the toilets as many didnt have seats so be prepared to squat. Practice at home first so that you are more comefortable when you have to go. Bring hand sanitizer and toiletpaper everywhere just in case.Other than that it was awesome and you will love it there."
50,“Cultural Immersion and Eduardo made me look like a genius to our group!”,"I was “volunteered” by our group of 10 to coordinate a trip to Peru and Galapagos Islands in May, 2011. We had an incredible trip thanks largely to the fact that I was fortunate enough to connect up with Cultural Immersion based out of Cusco, Peru. I heard about Cultural Immersion on TripAdvisor and contacted Eduardo to design a custom tour from May 12 – 20.Our flight from Houston to Lima was delayed by 6 hours so we arrived in Lima much later than scheduled at 4:30 am. Cultural Immersion was right at the departure area waiting to welcome us to Peru with big smiles! We caught a few hours of sleep then did a city tour of Lima the next day.After Lima we were efficiently transferred to the airport and flew up to Cusco where we were once again met by the smiling faces of Cultural Immersion. This is where we met our guide Daniel who would be our constant companion for the rest or our visit to Cusco, Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Sacred Valley, Aguas Calientes and Machu Picchu. Daniel was born and raised in Cusco and he was an absolutely awesome guide. Daniel was very enthusiastic, knowledgeable and passionate about his home land and we feel very fortunate to have had him as our guide. Daniel really helped make our Peru tour very special and memorable.Our time in Peru flew by and it was soon time to head back to the Cusco airport to continue our journey on to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands where we also had an incredible time.The bottom line is that I was very fortunate to have heard about Eduardo and Cultural Immersion to plan the Peru portion of our trip. Eduardo made me look like a genius to the group. I would highly recommend Cultural Immersion if you are considering a trip to Peru. Let me know if you have any questions about our trip to Peru (or Galapagos) and I will make an effort to respond."
40,“Breath Taking Views and ruins”,"Cusco is an amazing city with an amazing history, people and culture. My first day welcomed me with dizziness and a slight headache (as any other tourist), but nothing that Tea of Coca couldn't have solved!A had a few challenges with the travel agency, but the tour itself was amazing. From transporation, the tour guide, the actual sites (such as Aguas Calientes, Sacsayguam, Machu Pichu, etc) were just breath taking. I had an amazing time. If you goal is to see the sites and ultimately climb Machu Pichu, then book hotels in each main town you are visiting. The drive from the different ruins all the way back to Cusco can take a lot and will waste your time if you are trying to maximize your time.Cusco is definitely for those who look to learn and interact with different culture, history and not afraid of heights :) If you are looking for adventure and have the physical condition to climb mountains, Cusco is definitely for you. I will definitely go back again........and I will do it for a little longer than 3 days."
50,“Absolute Latin America Agency”,"Hi there,I want to share my experience in Peru with other travellers.we came back from Peru 2 weeks ago, it was an amazing experience.we were not sure about which places to visit so I contacted different agencies, we choose absolute latin america cos of the quick reply and detail information and we are so glad we did.we have experienced strikes in Puno, we were a little concerned about the whole situation, it took our bus 13 hours since we left Cusco until we arrive in Puno but Sandra, our contact in Cusco, was very helpful and made sure that there were people waiting for us in Puno. She was in contact with us all the time and kept us inform of the situation.I highly recommend absolute latin america, they were excellent and manage to organize our trip smoothly even though Puno conflicts.We also visit Machu Pichu and stay at Inkaterra hotel in aguas calientes, amazing place so glad Sandra recommended!Arequipa and Colca were also a highlight of the trip, as well as Pisac Market in the sacred valley of the incas, we bought all the souveniers we needed there and more!Lima was good, big city, we spent a day there, visiting the cathedral and san francisco church and at night we had included dinner at la rosa nautica restaurant! Oh my god! fantastic restaurant on a pier, it is a dont miss.We wanted to share our experience in Peru, it is a magical country!"
50,“Excellent historical place”,"Cusco is very beautiful city, it was capital of ancient Inca Empire. It is very nice to walk around Plaza de Armas in downtown, where you can see a lot of historical buildings from Incas and also from the Spanish colonial period.It is very safe to walk, even at night. There are lots of tourists in everywhere in the city and policing. There are very good restaurants, handcraft stores and museums. There are lots of money exchange places around Plaza de Armas.From Cusco you can visit lots of Incas archaeological sites nearby, also in Sacred Valley by car, taxi, bus or tours and reach Aguas Calietes (Machu Picchu) by train.I recommend it to everyone who like history and historical places."
50,“Lots to see and do”,"Cuzco has to be one of the nicest, if not THE nicest city in Peru. It was definitely the cleanest city of all the cities that we visited and it felt the most safe with a huge police presence. There are many shops to browse and markets to see. A lot of the merchants and stores sell a lot of the same product however so if one vendor is not willing to barder then move on to the next. However if it's a painting you're after then I suggest if you find one you absolutely love then buy it. Art is very cheap in comparisson to North American art prices and they're all quite unique. So if you see something you like, buy it. I suggest spending a few days in Cuzco, espcially if you have not acclimatized to the altitude prior to arriving. Cuzco is at a high elevation and can throw you for a loop if not acclimatized... even with taking altitude sickness medication, you'll still likely feel the effects for at least the first day or two. Getting around Cuzco is simple. Taxis are cheap but even walking isn't a bad choice. The city is fairly large so if you need to get from one end to the other, a taxi for the equivalent of about 1-2 dollars is the best option. There are TONS of tours to local attractions out of Cuzco if you're looking for adventure. I HIGHLY recommend South Adventure Peru Tours (google it). The owner, Ruben, was VERY polite and efficient and will bend over backwards to make sure you're safe and happy. Hopefully your trip to Cuzco is as fun and adventurous as ours was!"
50,“Ideas as to how to make my next trip to Cuzco more enjoyable!”,"Cuzco, and what I would do slightly diff. next time.Date: May 28, 2011While I had a great time in Cuzco, I would do a couple of things differently. First of all, I would worry much less about having to feel I needed to book my train tickets to Agiua Calientes before I left home. It would seem that this is not a big concern, as many others I met did not, and had no issues purchasing them when there.Secondly, one does not have to be concerned about organizing activities etc. prior to their arrival in Cuzco. There are any number of tour companies ready to pull you in by the hook off of the street. In fact, I no sooner had both of my legs out of the taxi at my hostal, than the driver was informing me that he was a tour operator and had a deal for me. There are many deals to be had and lots of competition as to prices etc. In fact, I met two fellows and between the three of us, no one had a return passage secured from Tthe Poroy Train Stn. back to Cuzco. But, ask lots of questions of others and you will be fine. As it turned out, we asked a few bus drivers if they could take us back, and got the fare for S/ 5.00 each. Whereas, I payed a tour company S/ 25.00 to get to the very same station days before. So, get comfortable with using a good phrase book and asking around for the best option/deal available. You will get what you need pretty readily!Thirdly, I realize that anyone can get altitude sickness, but there are a couple of ways that may help one not get sick. I was very sick for three days in Cuzco. I was so sick in fact, that I had to go the Inka Farma to get some medicine. If I was at home, I am sure that I would have rushed to the doctor's office or hospital. Some people seem to more apt to get sick no matter what, But, if a person eases into Cuzco, by going to Arequipa first...this may help acclimate them to Cuzco's altitude. Also, some people swear by Diomox. If a person has any heart or blood pressure health issues, it may be a good idea to visit their doctor prior to setting off on their trip tp Cuzco. I would get some prescription first, as the effectiveness of my meds. for hypertension were somewhat hampered by being sick"
50,“Sun Gate Tours- Inca Trail to Machu Picchu”,"My 4 girlfriends and I hiked the 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu through Sun Gate Tours and had a fantastic time. Sun Gate Tours arranged everything from picking us up from the airport, to storing our bags while we hiked, to providing excellent guides and porters for the actual hike. The tents and food were awesome. The guide was knowlegable and very kind. The support staff were on time and consistent...we never had to worry about our safety or the safety of our belongings. I recommend Sun Gate Tours without hesitation and hope to use it in the future.Cate, USA"
50,“A dream town”,"Cuzco a heaven on earth is at the altitude of 3400m. There were kiosk at the airport for oxygen shots !!We stayed in one of the finer hotels Casa Andina private collection. It was an experience in itself.First day we landed we did feel the altitude sickness. By the time we reached our room from the lobby we felt tired and were panting !!.but coco tea does wonders . Keep having it to avoid the headache due to altitude sickness.The main square in cuzco is beautifully lined up with restaurants,bars and souvenir shops. We picked up some silver jewelery Peruvian style.There are all kind of cuisine available from Macdonald to fine dinning restaurantsWhen you walk n the streets be prepared you will be surrounded by kids asking you to buy woolen caps, gloves,paintings etc etc. You can try your haggling skills"
50,“Cusco has everything”,"If you're planning to go to Peru, make sure you plan some days in Cusco. We went with Do Latin America, and they showed us around not only the ruins and musuems, but also various art gallieries and textile workshops. Its great to mingle with other tourists and indigenoous people all in the same spot. Cusco really is a beautiful town and the ideal place to rest during a tour. We also took advantage of the rafting and bungee jumping, and you could spend your whole tour in just Cusco itself. Having said that the rest of the tour was incredible, and we would definately go back to South America and maybe back to Peru to explore a little more."
50,“Driving conditions around Cusco !”,"We looked for so long and we couldn't find any info about the state of the roads in Valle Sagrado of Inka's, finally I decided to rent a car as I am doing everywhere. To be able to visite all sites independently and especially to stay longtimes in Pisac and Chinchero's Markets (Sunday is the best day) you would better to rent a car and despite negative opinion, the roads are fully asphalted and at very good conditions. Trafic is not heavy and the people in Peru are friendly. Just be carefull while crossing speed bumpers. Try to cross diagonally because they are a bit exagerated especially for small vehicles.Anyhow, they call them ""Rompe Muelles"", sort of spring (better to say shock absorber) breakers !By the way, apart a 30-35 km. portion before Juliaca, even Cusco- Puno road is at perfect condition and they are about to construct an 2200 km. ""Interoceano"" road together with Bresilia between Lima and Atlantic Ocean."
50,“you have to go”,"yeh, you have to know this amazing city, i say city but it's really more of a town. i went to a few places in peru on my trip but Cusco was such a suprise, a very relaxed atmosphere, you get to meet loads of people - the locals are very friendly, and the tours are amazing (i went with Do Latin America who gave me the low down on everything). The night life is great, wee bars, salsa, live music and theres loads of very good restaurants. loved colca canyon too, incredible nature."
40,“Peru Gateway Travel for tours in Peru”,"I recently went to Peru and used Peru Gatway Travel as an agent. They were great! The hotels were first-class. The one in Cusco was very historic. The agency did a great job for me. If they said they would pick me up at a certain time, they were there. They picked me up at the airports and transported me to the hotels and back. Since I speak only a little Spanish, it was sure reassuring to see my name on a placard when I arrived at an airport. My flight to Lima was four hours late, but someone was there to pick me up. I only had one little problem the whole trip. I basically booked two tours to the same areas one day apart. After the first tour, I figured that I'd rather go to the Sacred Valley instead of return to the south valley. I called PGT at 5:00, and they were able to make the changes without a hitch.When I go back to Peru, I'm sticking with these folks!"
50,“Spend time overlooking main square”,"Upon arriving Cuzco, despite the tension on altitude and headache, I went to see the old Inca Walls at once. The walls were just amazing !! Just can't imagine how people move them around and put them up.The city is small but the view and atmosphere around main square is just great. I chose a restaurant and had lunch at the balcony overseeing people walking across the square and hanging around, cars passing by and the cathedral. Wonderful moments and didn't feel time pass by. This is just the moment I expected from my trip !! highly recommended."
40,“Cusco facts update”,"This is a quick facts update for anyone travelling to Cusco in the next little while. In no particular order:Machu Picchu - as at 14/10/10 the entry fee is 126 Soles per day - the 50% discount for the 2nd day has been discontinued. Payable in cash (soles) only. No discount for children (unless you are a Peruvian national).You can buy the tickets in Cusco before you get to MP (or of course in Aguas Calientes). They are available from the Institute Nacional de Cultura. This is located away from the main area on a side street almost directly opposite the big entry gates to the Estadio Universitario on Av De La Cultura. The is no sign out the front, but it is a smallish white building with a computer printed sign which mentions the Institue Nacional de Cultura. It's only about 20m off the main road.The bus fare from Aguas Calientes to MP & return is $14USD, again cash only. This is only available from Consettur which seems to have recently moved. The Information Office gave us the wrong address. It is now in Av Infancia which is at the bottom end of Av Tacna not far from Plaza Tupac Amaru. It is easy to spot - it is a cream coloured front wall with a big gold ""Consettur"" sign (and 2 guards) out the front.If you want to visit a lot of the sights around the Cusco region you need to buy a Tourist Ticket from the Tourism Office (or, we suppose, through your tour company). To be allowed to visit about 12 designated sites including Ollantaytambo, Pisac and Sacsayhauman etc it costs 130 soles as at 14/10/10. You can buy a ticket which allows you to visit any 4 sites for 70 soles.Changing money is dead easy - there are any number of money changers around the Plaza de Armas and down Av Sol. They all have rates which are within a hair's breadth of each other. As at 14/10/10 it was 2.77 soles to the USD for cash with an additional 2% commission for travellers cheques.Cusco itself is an amazingly preserved town, but a real tourist trap! You're constantly offered paintings, massages, food, tours etc. In a 100m stretch around the main plaza (Armas) you would expect to be approached at least 20 times. Eventually you just ignore it. That aside, it is impossible not to be impressed with the preservation of the buildings and the cleanliness of the town. It really is a credit to the authorities that it is so well kept and preserved.The markets at the Mercado Artesanal are pretty good for Peruvian/Andes type stuff - but if you are going on to La Paz we'd suggest doing your shopping for indigenous crafts there - better variety and better prices. However in both places the prices are good and bargaining is not really appropriate - especially in La Paz.Getting around Cusco is easy - take a taxi. It is 3 soles to go anywhere in town. There are taxis everywhere and although a number of them look suspect, we rode them for several days without any concern.In terms of food, there are a number of good restaurants around the Plaza de Armas and the side streets (do check out the side streets). Prices for a main course are about 25-40 soles at a decent restaurant. We had dinner for 2, with 2 beers each and it came to 60 soles. Beer is cheap but wine is relatively expensive - a typical bottle of red or white will be about 70 soles in a restaurant.As a recommendation for accommodation, we stayed at the Hotel Ruinas about a 5 min walk from the Plaza de Armas. Couldn't recommend it highly enough! As we were there in the quiet period we paid $80USD/night inc breakfast and it was a bargain.Hope this helps!"
50,"“cusco, machupicchu”","Just returned from Peru. Visited Lima, Cusco, MachuPicchu. All travel arrangements through Kuoda Travel. Excellent!!! From the moment you arrive, they take you by the hand and never let go. Everything was terrific from transportation, hotels, guides, and of course, the places we visited. We stayed at the Park Miraflores in Lima, Monasterio Hotel in Cusco and The Sanctuary Lodge in Machu Picchu. All beautiful and with wonderful staffs. The owner of the agency, Mery Calderon, took time out to meet with us to make sure that we were satisfied with the tour and to hear our feedback. She is charming, friendly, hard working and passionate about her business, which is the greatest motivator and makes the difference between mediocre and outstanding service. We highly recommend her agency to anyone who wants a first class experience traveling to Peru."
50,“What a beautiful city!”,"Could not believe how pretty Cusco city was! I had an amazing time in Peru thanks to my travel organisers - ""Escaped to Peru"" who did an amazing job of making sure that my partner and I were in the right place at the right time every step of my trip. Cusco at night is beautiful, bustling and brimming with life. Lots of fantastic restaurents and plenty of things to see - this is just the city itself without even touching on the other stuff that is commutable (i.e. the amazing Machu Picchu experience). I would heartily reccommend visiting Peru, and definitely add Cusco onto your itinerary - its an amazing place - and well worth a few days meandering around!Paul Finney - UK"
50,“Amazing experience in Peru”,"Our trip to Cusco was absolutely amazing. We wanted to be emersed in the culture and we definitely were able to do it here. The city itself is beautiful, and we couldn't help but be grateful that we were able to experience it. Just the fact that most of the city is built with ancient stones is enough to keep you wondering and oogling the landscape and architecture as you stroll the Plaza. The Plaza is a wonderful place where you can rest on the steps of the cathedral and people watch, or enjoy a meal at one of the many restaraunts surrounding it. There was a market were we shopped for Peruvian goods several times. We were in Cusco for 4 days adn felt like we could stay for much longer. One of the highlights was a taxi we took out to Pisac, enjoying the beautiful countryside as we went. There was a large market nestled in a valley and it was overwhelming to be surrounded by such beauty. It was an amazing trip and something we will never forget. We want to go back for more!"
50,“Traveling Peru with the help of Escaped to Peru”,"Escaped to Peru planned the entire week for me and two friends. Everything worked like clockwork: the hotel staff were waiting for us, the guides showed up exactly on time, the guides were knowedgeable, etc. And, of course, who could NOT enjoy Machu Picchu or the Sacred Valley or Cuzco itself: amazing remnants of eras gone by. If you have limited travel funds but want the vacation of a lifetime, you can't miss by going to Peru (but you need to be in decent physical shape; those Incas built a lot of steps on a lot of hills). Have fun!"
50,“Our trip organized by PACHA TOURS PERU”,"We have just returned from a trip to Peru, which is an incredibly country. We planned a private tour to the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu organized by PACHA TOURS PERU which we found by internet. Everything since the first time we contacted them was great, and during our journey everything was extremely well organized from hotels booking, transfers and tours. We felt like to be at home with such us treatment that we got from our guide ""Gary"" and driver ""Ernesto"". This will be a wonderful never to be forgotten experience in Peru. Also, i would like to recommend you guys to stay at the Monasterio hotel in Cusco, which was spectacular !!!"
10,“Bad Travel Agency - Golden Peru Travel Service - Cusco”,"We were just walking around Cusco, which is the best city to visit in Peru, when we walked into Golden Peru Travel Service at San Agustín street Nº 283http://www.goldencuscomachupicchu.comE-mail: reservas@goldencuscomachupicchu.comDirector: Iván Florez O.We booked two tours through Ivan. One was to go to Tipon ruins. Ivan promised to bring his camera and put pictures on CD, etc. We (a group of 9) were taken there but Ivan spent most of the time on his cell phone discussing other business. He did not have his camera and he did not produce a CD. The other things he did was to organize a tour guide for MP and get us MP tickets. This was done and we had a wonderful guide. The problem was he charged us the 19% Peruvian tax. I questioned this but Ivan said we would get it back at the airport. Ivan assured me that we would get the money back. At the airport, I asked at three separate places and no one had ever heard of it. Back in the states, I found out that this was totally incorrect and we shouldn't have been charged it at all. As was said in other posts, foreigners don't get charged these taxes."
50,"“Trip to Peru with ""Escaped to Peru"" / ""Escaped to Latin America""”","We just returned from our 12 days trip to Peru. It was wonderful trip. We've enjoyed it very much.It was semi - private tour organized by ""Escaped to Peru"" We visited Lima, Ica, Cusco, Macchu Picchu & Puno.With their help we had unforgettable journey and one of the most wonderful vacation we've ever taken. We got everything what we planned and even beyond. We liked Peru, this is wonderful country with amazing history, great nature and very friendly people. Machu Picchu is the definitely world wonder. Everybody must see it. We are very happy that we took hiking trail there. It was very hard but it worth.Our trip was perfectly organized : all transfers, hotels, local guides, etc.All hotels we've stayed ( La Faraona in Lima, San Augustin in Cusco, Royal Inn in Puno) were very good.All local tour guides were very helpful and friendly.I would definitely recommend go to Peru with ""Escaped to Latin America"" to all my friends and anyone who is interested to get amazing trip!"
50,“travel in peru”,"We have our travel arranged through the travel company Escaped to Peru witch is a part of escaped to Latin America. It was one of the best vacation we'have taken for many years( and we are experienced travelers). Everything was perfectly organised. The guides were excellent and very knowledgeable, the hotels were great and in some places even upgraded to what was previously arranged.5 star company that we would recommend to anybody.Eric"
50,“Lovely city”,"We loved Cuzco with its many colonial churchs, lovely main square and Inca ruins. I felt very safe walking around Cuzco. There are numerous museums and churchs in an easy walking distance from the central plaza. A cab costs only 3 - 4 sols (about $1.50) any place in Cuzco. Try to find out if there will be any religious processions during your visit. We stumbled upon one and took over 300 photos in an hour and a half. Every church has their own date. The food is wonderful in Peru in general but we found many restaurants in Cuzco that were exceptional."
20,“Strike”,"The people of Cuzco are striking against one another. They are fighting for water rights. What this means to the traveler is that if they decide to strike for a day, all transportation is stopped. No buses and no train to Macchu Picchu. Before you go, be sure you find out if they are going to be on strike while you are there."
50,“Escaped to Peru”,"My dad and I had been dreaming about going to Peru, so we searched online for travel agencies and decided to use Escaped to Peru. We booked a 10 day tour of Peru including Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and the Amazon forest. Peru did not disappoint, and is one of the most beautiful countries on earth. We had a great time, and the Peruvians we met were very inviting and friendly. I highly recommend using Escaped to Peru for your travels to Peru. Aron"
50,“Our Peru Trip Review”,"I just came back from a 10 day trip around Peru with my Husband, Father and Brother and it was wonderful. Before the trip I spent hours on here and other sites researching hotels, tour companies, dates, etc. It was so much work and somewhat scary so I thought I would share our trip to help people who are trying to plan their own.Before we left we knew we wanted to do Machu Picchu and Lake Titicaca but that was about it. So I looked at several tour companies and finally decided on Escaped to Peru which is also Escaped to Latin America. They tailored our trip around our requests and dates. We had a problem sending the payment but other than that they were fabulous. Helpful and quick before the trip and during the trip everything was perfect. So, if you are thinking about using a company I would definitely recommend them.On the trip we flew into Lima and immediately flew to Puno and then onto Lake Titicaca. There we stayed at the Casa Andina Private Collection. If you go to L.T. I would recommend this hotel. However, while Lake Titicaca was neat, if you are trying to decide where to go and are limited on time or $ I would skip this. It was cool but not amazing.From there we took the Peru Rail to Cusco. The train ride was great and I highly recommend it over a bus. Before going to Peru I did not know anything about Cusco. It is a hidden gem. Beautiful, clean, quaint, I loved Cusco. We stayed at the Monasterio which another must. If you don't stay there you at least have to go have drink in the amazing bar. We took a tour of Cusco and The Sacred Valley then off to Machu Picchu we went.To get there we took the Hiram Bingham train, again amazing and a must. It was like traveling back in time, simply wonderful.There are no words to describe Machu Picchu, if you are thinking about going, go. If you are not thinking about going, reconsider. M.P. itself is one of the amazing places ever. I can't even being to describe it. I could go on and on but I really am writing this to let people know hotels, trains and other things we really considered before going. At M.P. we stayed at the Inkaterra Pueblo Hotel in Aquas Calientes. Highly recommended, such a cool setting.If you go to M.P. be sure to go for sunrise one morning, it is worth the early morning rise and extra effort.From there we went back to Cusco and then on to Lima. We stayed at the El Pardo Double Tree in Lima which was fine, no complaints but nothing extravagant. I hope this overview helps, I know planning a trip can be hard but Peru is worth the effort."
50,“Escaped to Peru delivers good service”,"Escaped to Peru/Latin America designed a great tour package. They also provided great support to ensure everything went well during our action packed visit to Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley and Lake Titticaca. We were greeted at each location by local representatives who ensured we were safely transported to our hotels, tours and travel stations (bus, airport and train). The people were friendly, courteous, and very informative. Escaped to Peru has an excellent website and our travel agent was always available to answer questions via telephone calls and emails prior to the trip. They made it very easy to travel through Peru, which is a developing country where things could go astray quite easily. It was a little scary sending a bank transfer to a company in a different country, but all worked out well. We felt we were in good hands with Escaped to Peru!"
40,“Peru and Galapagos with Escaped to Latin America - Escaped to Peru”,"Apart from a couple of noisy nights in hotels (par for the course in the developing world as far as I can see) we had a superb tour with ""Escaped"". Machu Picchu and the Galapagos Islands combined in one holiday, it was a blast! Would recommend Escaped to Latin America / Peru to all."
50,“Marvellous city in every way”,"Although it is seen largely as a starting off point for the various tours, Cusco has much to offer in its own right. I found that many of the reviews online and in various travel books misleading, in that things have obviously changed very quickly - Cusco is a safe city, with only minor irritation from the girls trying to sell massages, people selling paintings and shoe shine boys in the main square. There are police officers everywhere. None of our group had any unpleasant experiences - the overall atmosphere was incomparably more pleasant than in English towns at any any time of day.Great restaurants and cafes, some good shopping - but haggle hard!"
50,“Quirky Cusco”,"This was my 3rd visit to Cusco and having visited all the main attractions previously it was great to just chill out and spend some quality time just wandering around the back streets, talking to the locals and sampling the latest cafes.The Plaza de Armes (in particular Trotamundus with balcony view straight on on to the square and directly opposite the cathedral) is still a great place to sit early morning when its not flooded with tourists, but take a walk up to Kukilly on Huaynapata for a cafe with character or Cafe Pacha on Tandapata where you can sit in the tiny patio at the back and sample delicious HUGE fruit smoothies. Equally quirky is Qosqos Wasichinis on Nueva Alta, the cultural centre where you can sit in the courtyard for daytime coffee or evening music and drinks with the local guitar heroIf you fancy scrumptious food (and the best desserts I tasted anywhere), whilst contributing to a fantastically deserving cause try Aldea Yanapay cafe on Calle Ruinas. Proceeds from the cafe go to supporting a children's project, with information on the project well documented in the cafe....an added bonus is you also get to eat beside giant stuffed toys like Zippy and Eyore as the cafe is designed as a children's play house.If you fancy some pamper time after all your sightseeing and walking try Andina Spa at the top of Tullumayo -well trained staff, good massages and beauty treatments and clean! A little away from the main square its a lot more tranquil too.For those of you staying for a longer stretch like I was, there is also a yoga, tai chi and kung fu centre called 'Centro Desarrollo' on Avenida de la Cultura. All of the teachers are excellent and you can either go to adhoc classes or sign up for a month at a time (12 lessons). Highly recommended.For all the main sights to see of course see your guide book, but this is just a few added extras that I found with more time to explore........enjoy!"
50,“Trip to Peru”,"Wow, we had a wonderful time traveling in Peru, everything was amazing, the Amazons, Cusco, and Machu Pichu, our travel company was incredible ""Escape to Peru""If you are planning a trip to Peru, contact them they are experts, and they organized everything for us.Enjoy"
50,“Trips outside of Cusco”,"Last year my husband and I went to visit Machu Pichu. We wanted to visit one of the the ""must see before you die"" places in the world. We were disappointed at first to learn that we would need to spend a few days in Cusco in order to acclimate to the attitude before experiencing Machu Pichu.We were amazed with Machu Pichu, but of greater surprise, we fell in love with Cusco. Cusco is a city like no other. Many of the foundations of the buildings were built by the Incas. How they were able to transport and then lay the massive stone walls is beyond the imagination. I also loved the restaurants and shopping. I bought a beautiful alpaca coat and hand made jewellery. I vowed that I would return the next summer.I decided that I would spend three weeks in Cusco doing volunteer work teaching English. After that, my husband could join me and we could enjoy Cusco together and do some hikes near Cusco. I was hoping that there were interesting hikes nearby.I contacted the same company I used last year, Kuoda Tours. I was extremely happy with the personal service they had given us for Machu Pichu, I was hoping that they would be able to find other hikes and places to visit.I am so happy that I used Kuoda Tours again. They provided the most wonderful guides who took me to the most incredible places. Every trip was perfectly planned out including the most delicious and nutritious box lunches.My first trip was a walk through the Sacred Valley. It's a 45 minute ride outside of Cusco. It was a perfect first outing because I needed to acclimate to the altitude. So, anything too strenuous would not have been a good idea.Next I went to Ollantaytambo. I was amazed to see Inca Ruins which were as old as Machu Pichu.By now I was getting better acclimatized and in better shape. I was taken by my guide to Huchy Cuzco - little Cuzco - a very ancient Incan city. Before getting there, we walked through the most beautiful gorge I had ever seen. There were steep rocky cliffs on both sides, the canyon twisted and turned as we made our way to the ancient ruins. I was surprised to find that we were the only people there. I was told by my guide Marco that this was a great hike for people preparing for Machu Pichu.By now I'd finished my three week volunteer work and was excited by the prospect of new adventures with my husband. Kuoda took me to the airport to pick up my husband. In Cusco my husband and I stayed in a beautiful hotel apartment called Quinoa. it's so new that it's not even on Tripadvisor. Kuoda found it for us.My guide Marco and I took my husband to Huchy Cuzco for his first hike. He was blown away.Kuoda suggested we visit Ausangate. An Andean mountain range about 100 K southeast of Cuzco. The glaciers of the Ausangate feed the Urubamba and Vilcanota rivers, and so these mountains were worshiped by the Incas. For three days we enjoyed the most spectacular views, yet slept in comfortable lodges at night.Well, I'm back home in Toronto now. I have been many places, but I can say without a doubt that this trip to Cusco was the best. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have had such memorable experiences."
40,“escaped to peru”,"My husband and I recently returned from our honeymoon in South America. We got in touch with Escaped to Peru via the internet and worked with a lady by the name of Zara who was absolutely wonderful and so attentive. She listened to our needs and wants and put that into a wonderful two week fun filled holiday in Peru and Ecuador. Once we selected our itinerary we were set, we really had nothing to think about, everything was taken care of from hotels to transfers to the actual excursions. What a trip, we are already thinking about our next trip to South America and exploring a little more!!"
50,“PERU - a must!”,"Wonderful trip to Peru arranged through 'Escaped to Peru'. Was a little dubious initially when arrangeing this trip as had never heard of this company, but after much correspondance with one of their reps, Zara, and the fantastic experience we had, I would throughly recommend them.Everything they promised was delivered - local experts, small group tours (in our case, just the four of us most of the time), lovely hotels, etc.The whole trip was tailor made for us, we told them what we especially wanted to see and they suggested additions that would compliment the trip. Nothing was too much trouble, Loved every second of it, even the altitude sickess was an experience not to be missed! Be sure to visit the floating Islands on Lake Titicaca and the amazing island of Taquille - we can and should learn a lot from these people. Not many places I would really love to visit again but Peru has to be the exception. GO!"
40,“Get a good hotel and be careful what you eat”,"We came to Cusco for 2 weeks, one week to explore and one week for the Inka Trail.This was the perfect amount of time, because you need to aclimatize and there is lots to do in the town and close area.There is a city tour and a country tour, bike tours, horses, and rafting.Also a very nice Church.Make sure you are careful with what you eat and drink, many people get sick.Bring toilet paper and toilet seats if you want to get comfortable outside of your own hotel. We were amazed at how bad the toilets were on the tourist destinations. I like to sit, and there is no seats??Bring some antibiotics like cipiro and some laxitives. If you get food poisining follow instructions. You can google what to do if you get food poisining or diarihha.I would come here again it was awesome, i was thankful to be in a good hotel."
40,“crazy”,"We have just returned from 2 weeks travelling in Peru and stayed 3 nights in this wonderful, if not slightly mad place. this is definately a party fun town, with its fair share of Irish bars and restaurants serving guineapig. there is a large variety or restaurants and bars and has a lovely plaza. the Sunday morning trooping of the colours is a must see. dont be fooled by the Cusco regional flag, Cusco is a very friendly place, but do not confuse their flag with the gay pride flag, although it understandably can be done.Cusco has many excellent hostels and is a fantastic base for exploring Machu Picchu and flying to elsewhere in the country."
50,“Escaped to Peru”,"We just used ""Escaped to Peru"" for our 16-day tour of Peru and could not have been happier with our service. They made the trip painless and efficient. We booked very last second and were amazed with the results. We traveled to Puerto Maldonado/ Amazon, Cusco/ Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu/ Aguas Calientas, Lake Titicaca/ Puno, and Ica/ Nazca Lines. We had on time pick up and departures and English speaking guides everywhere we went and always had nice accommodations. They also gave great advice and answered all of our questions. They were also very accessible by email. We would definitely recommend them and use them again."
50,“Escaped to Peru”,"We just got back from a 10 day trip in Peru organized by Escaped to Peru. It was absolutely fantastic! All of the guides were wonderful- especially in Cusco and Machu Picchu. The hotels were great- we especially liked the Amaru II in Cusco and the Colon Inn in Puno. Everything ran smoothly and we really appreciated all the help from our escorts and guides. I would highly recommend Escaped to Peru- they were extremely helpful in designing a trip that suited our needs and met our budget. We would definitely travel with them again! Peru was an amazing country, we can't wait to go back."
50,“Go on an environmentally conscious trek!”,"Cusco, Peru is an absolutely beautiful city. Be sure to book a tour with Enigma. They have environmentally conscious treks which help to preserve the environment for future visitors.I would recommend that you request Edger for your guide. His knowledge of the area, history, plants, and wildlife are amazing.Enigma has a wonderful cuisine that looks as wonderful as it tastes. Such an added bonus! They even cater to vegetarians.When considering tour companies, be sure to consider what you are really getting! With Enigma the tour was amazing! I would definitely use them again!"
50,“Peru Travel”,"Peru Travel takes you to the most beautiful and most famous places in Peru.I had the best experience in the city of Cusco. This place has so much history! The colonial buildings in the city are beautiful and the ancient Inca Ruins are really special to see. They are very interesting, you should really visit these sites with a guide, that makes it even more interesting.Cusco is really one of the most beautiful cities y ever visited!"
50,“Escaped to Peru/Escaped to Latin America”,I highly recommend the Escaped company. Everyone from drivers to tour guides were friendly and helpful and I did not have one negative experience. Keep it up guys!
50,“Cusco is amazing”,"I went to Cusco for one month, because I really wanted to learn Spanish. Cusco is incredible. So many Inca history and still visible. I booked my accommodation at Amauta Spanish School and lived one street away from the Plaza de Armas. The nightlife and good restaurants were very nearby and that was very nice. I did not know that Cusco had such a great nightlife.I've met many nice friends and learned a lot Spanish at Amauta Spanish School.I went also to the Machu Picchu and booked this tour at Dos Manos. The helped me very friendly. The Machu Picchu is beautifully. You don’t want to miss it.This adventure I recommend it to everyone."
50,“truly a mecca for world travelers”,"Just one quick note on Cusco, Its at 12,000 feet. You can read about all of the attractions which are numerous on other web sights. But, just note- if you are from sea level like me- do nothing your first day drink lots of Gatorade / power-aids (too much water or coca tea will wash out your electrolytes.. not good). Get acclimated and then go out and hikeBe sure to venture up and down the alley ways while in the center of the city. we found a wonderful ,local jeweler (gifts) on the lower level of the American Youth Hostel ( Personally, I wouldn't stay at that hostel.) The Picoaga Hotel was 5 star. Great service, location and good food.Picoaga Hotelwww.picoagahotel.com"
50,"“Viva Expeditions, Inca Trail, Machu Picchu”","Love, love, loved itArrived in Cusco and were collected at the airport and transported to the hotel. The hotel was sweet. We had time to explore Cusco for a couple of days. We had a meeting with our guide Alfredo who briefed us about the trip.Cusco is charming and it is worth spendig a couple of days there to get adjusted to the altitude.We were picked up by Alredo and the team (one guide, one cook and 4 porters for just the two of us, which was awesome) and driven to the start of the Inca Trail.The Trail was well worth us with stunning scenery and lots of history. Alfredo was very knowledgeable, stopping to tell us stories along the way. The porters and the cook were fantastic and we even played rock petanque together in the down time after walking.The team around us was great and we developed a great respect for the porters. They catered well for us with a good breakfast, and three course lunch and dinner which were very tasty. On top they even baked us a cake - in a pan!Machu Picchu is a must see and if you can, make sure you get there early on the last day to climb Waynu Picchu."
40,“Cuzco is a wonderful place...but beware the altitude sickness”,"Visiting Cuzco is a wonderful experience and we'd recommend it to everyone - but ( a big ""but"") the altitude sickness is a real possibility and can affect your enjoyment.We've just ended a four-day stay in Cuzco. We loved the lively atmosphere of the place, the beautiful buildings, the Inca ruins of course, and the very Peruvian feel.. The main square with its huge cathedral is very memorable. The restaurants are good (try Cacciatore - facing the cathedral, look right of the cathedral, go up that hilly street, and it's on the upper floor of the little courtyard at the end of that hill on the left.)OK, Cuzco is quite touristy. There are too many street vendors wanting to sell you silly hats, alpaca scarves (they're not alpaca despite the label) and wanting to polish your shoes. But there are also quite a few women in Peruvian costume towing llamas or alpacas in their wake, which is touristy, ok, but did make the whole place very picturesque.But the altitude sickness !!! We came straight from Lima, sea level, and went straight to Cuzco at 11,000 feet and we were definitely not well. The first full day was wiped out completely as we both found we could hardly move out of our hotel room - we'd even paid a lot for an ""oxygen enriched room"" but we both doubted that it made any difference. The second day was slightly better, but we still found the hilly streets quite an ordeal. Bear in mind that Cuzco is just lots of steep hills, and when you can't get your breath it's hard to enjoy your outing.The worst part was sleeping at night. My husband kept waking up struggling for breath...while I suffered atrocious headaches despite drinking gallons of water, as they advise.Our bad experience may have something to do with age. We're both in our 50's, but not overweight. However, we're clearly not as fit as those in their 20's...and even though there's a school of thought that says fitness has no connection to altitude sickness I just can't believe it. When we went on trips we talked to others and it was the younger, fitter people who had the fewest symptoms and the older or less-fit people who suffered the most.So if you're in the latter camp we would strongly advise you to see Cuzco on one or two day-trips, but to stay in the Sacred Valley. Being able to sleep at a lower altitude really does make a huge difference.We didn't do this because I had read a review on Trip Advisor that said the SV was scruffy and full of rip-off craft markets. To some extent that's true - there are quite a lot of little markets where they're desperate to sell you something that's usually badly made - and Urubamba and Ollyantambo, the villages, are quite scruffy.... BUT the Inca remains and ruins really are worth seeing, and the valley itself is breathtakingly beautiful. It's a flat narrow ribbon of fertile land, dominated by massively steep green mountains on either side. Stunning.There are lovely places to stay in the Valley (see Trip Advisor!) and it's easy to arrange a day trip to Cuzco from there. If I was arranging our trip again, that's how I'd do it."
40,“Great inexpensive 2 weeks in the Andes”,"Two of us travelled in October 2009 after making a very last minute decision to visit Macchu Pichu and, of course, Cusco, the surrounding area and Lake Titicaca. Because it was last minute and I had a costly trip to Ethiopia planned for a couple of months later, my friend and I were looking for both an interesting and reasonably inexpensive possibility. I found Escaped to Peru online, talked with Anna and we went from there. Anna very quickly organized the trip, made adjustments as we wished and we were off for what proved to be a very good expereince. Unexpectedly my friend reacted badly to the altitude: thanks to the flexibility we had since we travelled without a larger group but joined others for the tour of the Sacred Valley and Titicaca, we were able to pace ourselves to meet her needs.Internal flights went without a hitch. Tour guides in every location were well informed and very helpful We adhered to a budget for hotels but found that by and large they were very acceptable. The Midori in Cusco was charming: we had rooms at the top with a sunny balcony to read on and wifi in the courtyard. In Agua Calientes we were booked for Plaza Andina--nice hotel-- but because of the climb to it up a steep hill, we chose to stay in the center of town in El Presidente. Esacped to Peru reimbursed for that expense.Titicaca and Uros Island wa a unique experience. The bus ride to Puno was long but with many interesting stops along the way.Advice: if you have any sensitivity to altitude, take things slowly. Also if you are attractive to biting insects, take serious precautions at Macchu Pichu. Even with a mild DEET on, I had at least 200 bites on each leg. Also, if you are not accustomed to travelling in developng countries, expect basics and charm in hotels but not 5 star US or European facilities. On the other hand, that is the charm of touring in less developed areas."
50,"“Cuzco,Peru”",We went to Cuzco with Peruvian Secrets based in North Wales. It is a beautiful city with cultural shows and lots of lovely buildings and a great place to shop.Pisco Sour was our favourite drink and we often negotiated and had it free with our meal. We also travelled to Maccha Pichu wihich had breathtaking viewsTip: Avoid altitude sickness by drinking coca tea provided free by most hotels. However never drink it after 5pm or you will stay awake at night. Also have light meals. Take plenty of paracetamols.
50,“How to view Cusco and the Sacred Valley”,"I went to Cusco with my wife and we were not expecting anything from this place. When we got there we started to walk downtown Cusco and we fell in love with the city. The narrow streets, cobblestone streets, the colonial balconies, the cathedral and churches, the Plaza de Armas, etc. makes this place extremely pretty. We ended up staying four days and chose Casa Andina Private Collection in Cusco as the hotel to stay. This we chose because of some recommendation that I got in Twitter by a person from Cusco.The second day we walked throughout the city and visited the Cathedral, Seminar Santa Monica, Temple Coricancha and Sacsayhuaman. For Sacsayhuaman we walked all the way to the top instead of taking a cab. It only takes 30 minutes and it is fun to walk it because you see some llamas on the way as well as some locals. What we did wrong was not to buy the ""boleto turistico"" before we went there and not take cash with us. So when we got there we were not able to go in because the ""boleto turistico"" is 130 Soles (their currency) and they only take cash. We ended up going to the Christ that is next door and view all Cusco from above there. Great view of all the city. During the day we started asking around to see who could take us the next day to the Sacred Valley. We wanted a personalized tour with our own transportation because we like the freedom of stopping wherever and whenever. After asking several guides that we found in the Temple of Coricancha, I ended up talking to this woman whose husband has been a guide for more than 20 years and spoke English. We decided to use him as our guide. Also while having lunch we ended up finding a guy who would drive us for 120 Soles the whole day (very inexpensive since it is usually 180 Soles).The third day after arranging everything the night before (guide and transportation), both the guide (Humberto Montesinos) and the taxi driver (Miguel) showed up at the hotel at 9 am. The guide immediately told us that the taxi was not good because it was too small and would not be able to make it to many of the places that we wanted to go. Since I had agreed with the taxi driver that I would hire him, I told the guide that I had given my word and that we were going to take that taxi cab. We were just leaving Cusco when the taxi started to malfunction and we could not move any more. The taxi stalled and would not start again. I know that that guide had told us, but I wanted to keep my word with the taxi driver and that is why I stuck with him. Since the problem was sever with his car, we ended up flagging another larger and much newer cab. I gave our old taxi driver 10 Soles and said bye to him (feeling really sorry for the guy because I could tell that he really needed the job). I was able to arrange a good price with our new taxi driver (Antonio Bravo). He said that he would take us for 130 Soles which I thought was a very good price considering the fact that his car was much better than the other, better engine, new inside and with working seat belts (yes, the previous cab did not have working seat belts). We ended up going to Pisaq, the market, some other places after Pisaq on the way to Ollantaytambo, a place where a guy makes ceramics, Moray and Maras (some salt mines). The guide new a lot about the Incas. He does the Inca trail once a week and went to a 4 year College to become a guide with Inca knowledge. He still studies and researches about the Inca culture. We were very happy with him. With him we had agreed on 50 USD for the whole day (I ended up giving him 60 USD because I thought he did a great job). We went to a restaurant between Pisaq and Ollantaytambo where the driver got a free meal and my wife, the guide and I got a discounted rate that is also given to the big groups. It was a tourist trap restaurant, but the food was really good, the location was awesome and they had live music. They have the option of the buffet or regular menu. We chose the buffet because it had a lot of local dishes and we wanted to try them all as well as the Chicha with alcohol. This was an awesome day and we got to see more than if we had gone with a big tour group of 10-30 people. The next day we were going to Machupichu via the train and bus. In order to get to the train station, we would have to take a taxi for a 20 minute drive. Since we really liked Antonio and his car, we arranged to have him pick us up at the hotel at 7 am to make the 7:43 am backpacker train. We negotiated the fair to 32 soles and this included picking us up from the hotel, take us to the train station in Poroy and then in the evening pick us up from the station and take us to the hotel.The fourth day after breakfast (breakfast is included in the hotel), Antonio was there at 7:02 am to pick us up. He said that he got stuck in traffic (he was only 2 minutes late). We took the train and after 3 hours we were in Aguas Calientes. This town is full of things for the tourists (restaurants, hotels, stores,etc), I don't think anyone lives there. The tickets to get into Machupichu are 126 Soles per person and then we bought the bus tickets which were 24 Soles or something like that for the round trip. The ride to Machupichu in the bus is a bit scary but the view makes up for that. I have to say that Machupichu is by far the most amazing place in the world that I have seen. What they built plus the scenery makes this place amazing. All I could think when looking at the scenery from Machupichu was in the scenery in Avatar the movie. After following a tour group in English (we ended up saving $ on the guide), we took some required pictures of the place and just admired the whole place. Since the train was leaving at 4:43 pm we had to leave Machupichu at 3 pm. When we got back down to Aguas Calientes we ate at ""Los Toritos"" (really good food and the owner is really nice). This restaurant is next to the Urubamba river. Since we were there during their rainy season (November-March) the river was moving like crazy. According to the guide (freebie), the river is a category 7 (for white water rafting) around that area and nobody gets into it during the rainy season. We had lunch there and the whole time we were in awe with the strength of the river. We then went back to get the train to return to Poroy and when we got to Poroy, Antonio was there waiting for us. It was raining and he had been out in the rain for quite a while waiting for us. He took us to the hotel and I ended up giving him 35 Soles instead of the agreed 32 because I believed that he did a great job plus he waited for us for almost 45 minutes (the train was running late on the arrival). The following day was our last day in Cusco and we were leaving to Lima at 4:45 pm, so we arranged with Antonio to pick us up at the hotel at 2:45 pm (it is only a 15 minute ride to the airport from the hotel but we were traveling internationally through Lima). That night we went to a restaurant in Cusco called ""Nuna Raymi"". Turns out that the owner of ""Los Toritos"" in Aguas Calientes is also an owner of ""Nuna Raymi"". We went there because we got free drinks since we had lunch at ""Los Toritos"". Turns out that both restaurants are owned by three brothers. The one brother works in Aguas Calientes and the other one in Cusco. The third one, we heard from the brother in Cusco, was traveling in Lima. Both brothers that we met were really nice and the food was really good. The prices were not bad, you could get a main dish for 35 Soles or less. By the way, when we went to Cusco the exchange rate was of 2.85 Soles per every USD.The last day we arranged with the hotel to get a late check out and we went shopping. We bought hand made carpets, alpaca sweaters, hats, gloves, belts, etc. When you go to Cusco you can see how poor some people are and how desperate they are to sell something to you. We decided from the first day that we would share the wealth and buy things from different people instead of buying everything in one place. We would buy two hats in one place, then two gloves in another, then a sweater somewhere else, etc. After that we headed to the hotel and Antonio was already there waiting for us. We grabbed our things and headed to the airport. One thing that they don't tell you is that you have to pay some airport tax in all the airports in Peru, so make sure you have some cash when you get to the airport in order to pay for this. They also take USD.Ok, I just wanted to share our experience in Cusco. We believe that it is a great place and the people are extremely nice. We did not have a bad experience with anyone over there. They all want to please you. If anyone is interested in getting Antonios email or phone number (taxi driver), just drop me an email. I also have the phone number and email of Humberto, the very knowledgeable guide and can share it with anyone that is interested. I hope this helps you if you are going to Cusco any time soon."
40,"“Tourist Central, but loaded with history”","Cuzco is sort of the expected launch pad for a journey into the Sacred Valley and eventually Machu Picchu. I'm sure you could avoid this burg if you wanted to, but there's really no need. The central area of Cuzco is clean, safe, and loaded with history. Weather you're staying for just a night, or several days, there will be no shortage of museums, treks or craft shopping in this 2-mile high colonial city.Pros: Loaded with historical places, museums, churches and a great launch pad for trips to the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu.Cons: It's a revolving door for tourists, and everyone knows it. You will be solicited at every turn in the city to book travel accommodations, buy things or get shoes shined. Tourism is the mainstay of the economy here - expecting anything less from such a town would be foolish. The altitude can also be a daunting factor - many people suffer from headaches and other symptoms of altitude sickness. Although the main center of the city is clean and safe, Cuzco is located in an area that is generally underfunded, therefore the water is not safe to drink and the surrounding areas my be less hospitable to folks from more progressive parts of the globe.Highlights: The Plaza de Armas, cheap shopping at the markets near the Peru Rail station (same stuff as every other shop, but WAY cheaper), everything is pretty cheap (outside the big tourist haunts) - taxi to/from the airport to the town center is only 5 Soles, Museo Inka, QorikanchaTips: I was there in the rainy season - yeah it rained, but it wasn't crazy rain - save yourself some money and don't bother buying a slicker or rain suit (sold everywhere in town)."
50,“my favorite place in the world :)”,"all i have to say is: cusco is magic!! , is adventure, is history is party is nice people!"
50,“An unforgetable city!”,"We have just returned from Cusco, Peru. It is a very impressive city with wonderful traditions and Inca memories preserved by humble people.Don't miss the Mercado San Piedro , a huge market where you can see and feel a little more the peruvian andean culture than the touristic sites which are also very impressive.When visiting the San Blas district, the artist's district, don't miss the Mirador de los novios, one terrace with the most beautiful view of Cusco and also the ""piedra de las 12 caras"", a 12 angle huge incan stone!I recommend the Del Prado Inn Hotel, located just at the Plaza de Armas, the beatuiful square and if you need a travel agent to make reservations, I do recommend Peruvian Ancient Paths. They are very very eficient.When coming to South America, don't ever think of missing Cusco and obviously Macho Picchu!"
50,“Land of the Incas”,"I just got back from doing the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and it was so wonderful. There was so much hype surrounding the whole affair that I suspected that is was not going to live up to it. Not only did it, but it actually surpassed my expecations (especially Machu Picchu itself). To our benefit though we had a really passionate guide leading us, so that helped alot. We had decided to go with South Adventure Peru Tours mostly because the guy doing the emails spoke really good english, but that turned out to be a good decision because Ruben our guide was super informative. It turns out that he is actually the owner of the agency as well so he really knew what he was doing. I can definitely recommend him.As far as the hotel in Cusco goes, we decided to stay in a place called Hotel (or hostal??) Wasichay and we chose that place because of its good location more than anything else. I had searched around a bunch before deciding on that place and I decided that it had the best value for the money for being a place that close to the Plaza de Armas. It was certainly no luxury hotel, but it more than good enough for the cheap price they charged (our room had a t.v with cable and everything even though we didnt spend too much time in there watching)."
50,“Great Place!”,"Easy to get around on foot, helpful people, a lot to see and explore! We took a bus out to Pisac for the public artists market, explored the main cathedrals and loved the San Blas district! A little altitude effect and shortness of breath if this is your first stop at the higher altitudes, but take it easy and sleep a lot. This is a great city to spend a few days before completing a Machu Picchu hike or adventure. Bagdad Cafe around the Plaza de Armas was delicious, as was Papa Panche in San Blas district - very cool outdoor ambiance, harp serenade and great food! We stayed at Orquidea Hotel near San Blas was a central location, staff was very helpful and set up tours/ buses for us, comfortable budget rooms."
50,“Eye-opening experience in Peru”,"Peru was my second trip to South America (the first being a tour in Costa Rica) but it was my first time traveling alone to South America. I was slightly worried about the language barrier and different culture but people here were very friendly and welcoming to strangers. Walking around there were always plenty of tourists and everyone always helped if you were lost of confused.Around Cusco are many ancient Incan ruins that all tell rich stories. Try to visit as many of them as you can. While on the surface they make look similar they each tell a different part of the Incan story. Every single one of them is absolutely incredible and even more shocking to realize that everything was done by hand.The most well known Incan ruin is Macchu Picchu. Even after visiting many other Incan cities this was was truly breathtaking. Everything we have in modern cities were essentially there. If you are able to do it, the hike up to Huyanu Picchu is absolutely fabulous and inspiring. It is a tough hike but every step of the way brings wonderful new views the area surrounding Macchu Picchu.Visiting Cusco has definitely made me want to travel more in Latin America and I would highly suggest that everyone visit there if possible. Spanish is not necessary, many of the places spoke english and tours were easily available in english."
50,“Ancient Capital meets modern world”,"During our trip to Peru we spent many days in and out of Cusco, as it is a major hub for travel to Machu Picchu and the southern rain forest. From the Plazas and cathedrals, to Inca ruins in and above the city, and museums full of artifacts, the city has a wealth of history to explore. But more than that, Cusco is a city that welcomes tourists without losing its sense of self. The local market and area shops are interesting and the McDonald's on the main square is almost invisible.If you only have a few hours, be sure to visit the Koricancha, the finest example of Inca stonework to be found, and so fine it looks to be machined rather than hand carved."
50,“Best Guide”,"While in Cusco you really need to spend 4-5 days not only adjusting to the altitude but seeing the city, surrounding valley and enjoying the great restaurants. We had the best guide in town. Designed 2 days of sightseeing/driving to our interests. Extremely friendly, safe driver and so willing to explain any and everything about Cusco and it's history/culture. So for as simple as picking you up from the airport or train to excursions into the valley there is no one better.Renato Baca Q(--)"
40,“Inca Trail & Cuzco”,"Fantastic city, felt like you were back in time with all the history in the andes surrounding you....inca trail was once in a lifetime, definitely worth doing the 4 day hike and not just the day trip on the train.Some very nice hostels to be had around the main square"
50,“Lima-Cusco_MAchuPichu- 4 day hike on Inca Trail”,"We organized a 4 day hike on the Inca Trail through Chaska Tours. We landed at Lima and stayed overnight at the Ramada Lima Airport hotel. The walk from the airport was great - we were very close and we wanted to get to our rooms as soon as possible. We had complimentary Pisco Sours which was a nice touch. The next morning we boarded Lan airlines to travel from Lima to Cusco. IT was a short flight but the snacks, customer service and planes were very high quality.Upon landing in Cusco the Chaska tour guide met us with a nice sized mini-bus. Jackie was very friendly. She went through our itinerary and then we ate at Trotomundos in Cusco for our lunch. There we met our guide and he reviewed our hike, our guide's name was Ivan (Iban?). Everyone was very friendly. My suggestion is to withdraw a large amount of soles at this time in order to have enough to pay for all tips for the guide, the hiking chef, and the porters. We were a party of 4 and Iban stated we would have 9 porters and 1 master chef. I would withdraw approximately 800 soles for the entire 4 day hike.While in Cusco we toured key landmarks with Guillermo and Freddy - they were very courteous and knowleable about the area. We ended our first day in Cusco by visiting Ollanytomba ruins which were pretty.We then stayed at the Alberque bed and Breakfast right next to the train station. I would highly suggest buying one of the hats from the hat vendors, it was the best 6 dollars (18 soles) I spent.I bought the one where you can button up the flaps.After spending a fine night at the Alberque the complimentary breakfast was excellent and we purchased one of the Catamuy wines to give to the porters at the end of the trip.In the morning Iban picked us up and we drove on small dirt winding rodes to kilometer marker 82 - the beginning of our hike. Make sure you always have your passport and do not lose your tickets! We hiked 4 days and each day the porters would pass us and set up our tents and provide teatime snack (5pm) and then dinner (7pm). All of the food was excellent. I would not waste money buying water purification devices because along the route there are savy indigenous people selling bottled water, candy and gatorade....so I just refilled what I used at each point. The tents were high quality tents with ample space for 2. I would pay the extra amount to get the better bed mat - it really made a difference.The second day hike was the hardest, but the third and 4th day descent were difficult due to the many stairs. Ensure you bring hiking poles - they were extremely helpful.Through the entire trip Iban gave us excellent historical background about each site and of the local fauna. He was very supportive and helped us keep our spirits positive. It was not an easy hike but it was worth it in the end.At day 3 we arrive at a lodge and that is where you should tip the porters because you will not see them again. Each member of our party of 4 gave each porter a tip, the chef received more than the portes and Iban received the most. Please ensure you tip the portes because those guys work extremely hard.At the end of day 4 we stayed at Aqua Calientes in the InkaTerra hotel - that was an incredible hotel. There were on site day spa services (extra cost) but the rooms and amenities were excellent. The complimentary dinner and breakfast were also impeccable.After our day in Aqua Calientes we returned to Poroy by train and then to Cusco by bus. The train was great. We had complimentary snack and drink services.OVerall our trip was excellent and I highly recommend Chaska Tours. We had some glitches because one person brought his new passport but signed up with his older passport which expired. So please try and bring the passport you use to book the tours.Again excellent service and very friendly."
50,“Cusco as interesting as Machu Picchu”,"This is an awesome city tucked high up into the mountains in Peru. I was there two nights and other than needing the Coca Tea and candy to adjust to altitude, I really loved it. The people were friendly, the pace was brisk and there are wonderful museums, churches, relics, and remains of the powerful Incan dynasty to enjoy. The main square is fascinating and a walk from there to my hotel was charming, through ancient cobbled streets and alleys. I was on a tour and felt very safe. I really enjoyed the Sacsayhuaman area and was as fascinated with it as Machu Picchu. The Palace of Coriancha was awesome. I had read a college level lecture series on the history of the Incas before I arrived and found it thrilling to see the places that were mentioned. The Effects of the Spanish conquerors on this area was so intriguing and seeing the churces and the ruins side-by side gave you a good insight into the town. I loved seeing little girls carrying goats down the streets, mothers selling their wares and nursing little ones simultaneously, and the proud and broad faces and backs of the men. There were a lot of stray dogs which was a bit dismaying, but they were tame."
40,"“great town, good shopping”","had a great guide, all the inca ruins the scenery was great.."
50,“Stellar Customer Service and an Amazing Experience”,"After some careful research on the web, I chose CHASKA TOURS for my Inca Trail Experience. I was EXTRA CAREFUL because I was brining a special guest...I carried my 19 month old daughter in her special baby-backpack for the entire length of the Inca Trail. So I was especially concerned that I choose a company with a good reputation.I called them several times using Skype and spoke to Raymond, a dutch ex-pat who manages the place. HE IS AMAZING! I put me so at ease, answered every one of my questions concerning my daughter, and helped me understand and plan getting from Lima to Cusco. After checking Internet prices on LAN for the Lima-Cusco flight, I was shocked to see how expensive they were. When I mentioned this to Raymon in an email, he told me that he could arrange to purchase the tickets for me at less than HALF the internet price!! I was elated. I am telling you I have never had such great customer service, and all of this before I even showed up.He sent me with emails in the ensuing months, keeping me up to date, making sure everything was OK, letting me know about flight times changes, etc. He gave me advice for what to do in Cusco, and convinced me to change my plans so that I gave myself an extra day to acclimate before going on the trail, all of these recommendations were invaluable. CHASKA TOURS doesn't just take you out on the trail, they give you an entire travel agency-like experience.Finally, THE TRAIL! We were privileged to have Chris assigned to us as our guide. Chris has done the Inca Trial over 300 times as a guide. He is amazing. I felt like I had a brother at my side for the entire trail. He was GREAT with my daughter, a true friend, an intrepid hiker, and his easy-going demeanor and reassuring and encouraging attitude kept us moving during those ultra-tough moments at high elevations. There was never a moment of negativity with him. He is one of those truly great people you meet in life who stay with you forever.I just have to mention two things: carrying my daughter the entire 26 miles was more difficult than I anticipated. I am a professional photographer and I had a 8 pound camera with me that I intended to carry on my neck the entire route. This proved problematic by the 2nd day. Chris graciously carried my camera for me most of the rest of the way. Then, I (stupidly) forgot to bring cash with me on the trial so that I could have money to spend in the town at the end of the trail. Chris lent me money, bought my lunch for me, and then met me in town later in the evening so I could repay him. :-)If I sound too effusive, forgive me...these guys really did a superb job and made my experience fantastic."
50,“This is the place to stay in Peru”,"On my vacations to Peru , I stayed at the Capital of the Incas Cusco. This is the best to stay when visiting the Incas Ruins. Most of the places like Ollantaytambo , Saqsaywaman and many other sites are very close by. The must Magical Cathedral that I have seen in my life is in Cusco, you will be amazed with all the gold , silver and wood work inside. And last but not least , the food is great.Very safe at night , I really loved this place and I will definitely recommend to any one traveling to Peru."
50,“Cool Place”,"I liked Cusco quite a bit. The main city square is surrounded by bars and restaurants, and lots of people are everywhere. Lots to do and see, historical tours are available, and I recommend the sacred Valley tour!"
50,“Peru is wonderful”,"My wife and I flew to Lima with our 10 and 12 yr old kids. After a day playing in Lima we flew to Cusco which is an amazing place. The city is surrounded by mountains on all sides so visually it's beautiful. The altitude didn't really bother us at all. We explored the city and near by ruins the first 2 days then spent a day out in the Sacred Valley. Again we loved the ruins and the countryside views. We ended up on Machu Picchu and were blown away. Better that we imagined. I highly recommend Peru. Great people, great country, great sites."
50,“my favourite place on earth”,"Cusco is the most beautiful place on earth! Amazing people, beautiful landscapes everywhere, gorgeous places to walk around, cheap food everywhere, amaaazing nightlife!, great tours and markets all around. You have to visit San Blas, and the obvious Macchu Picchu, Sacsahuayman, etc... I just can't get over the city, my favourite place ever. Very romantic if travelling with someone and most definetly very romantic if you're travelling alone (believe me.. meeting someone is guaranteed even if you just sit down in the town square.) But please.. dont go to mcdonalds! cant believe it actually made it to the town square.. Hotels are pretty cheap if looking for something nice and clean, plenty of big fancy more expensive hotels there too, though. Most definetly the best place to improve bargaining skills too.. impossible not to love, something to do every day, even just walking around town is fantastic.."
50,“An incredible experience”,"Important to mention a month ago I was lucky enough to know Peru. I went to Lima and Cuzco, there I found all wonders of the Incas Empire.I first had fears but then I experience all the developments in that country. Comfortable Hotels , good people and always predisposed to support the visitor.I made good contacts over there and i really hope to come back soon. I recommend visit that country .For any advice fell free to contact me.Try the Bungy Jumpling, its amazingMark"
50,“heaven on earth”,"Went at end of March for one week. Absolutely gorgeous/majestic sights! Living greenery at all the historic sites visited. Some say, March is the best time of year to visit for the green that you see. Weather was lovely in the 70's. Some light rain and sunny days.We did not suffer from altitude sickness - we drank mate de coca everyday and remembered to take deep breaths frequently and kept hydrated.Accommodations: stayed at a hostel, Piccola Locanda for the week at less than $20/night, had complimentary breakfast and internet. Excellent experience.Tips for your trip (I wish I knew beforehand):1) Keep your immigration stub/paperwork. You need this and passport to get home. (I say this because I almost threw my stub away)2) Dress in layers as there may be light rain and very warm sun at some parts of the day. A light warm jacket will do. Good walking shoes are a must. Travel with a light backpack/bag that will free up your hands. There are plenty of stairs/hiking at these historic sites so this is not a destination trip for those with ambulation problems or for young children. Children, 12 and older should do fine. Bring a bottle of water with you at all times.3) Bring crisp, untorn bills (some exchange shops do not accept the smallest tear on your bills - who knew?). Larger bills are better as the small bills do not get a good exchange rate (found this out the hard way). Exchange rate was up to 3.13 soles for one dollar -US. Betert to exchange at the main square - just get enough at the airport for the taxi.4) Macchu Picchu - bring your passport as they have an official stamp for it. Best to get to Ollantaytambo (an hour away from the main square) for the earliest train out to Macchu Picchu. If you leave from the main square, you won't get to Macchu Picchu until noon. Unless you buy a tourist pkg, you will have to purchase your train ticket at least a day before for Macchu Picchu at the train/bus station - oh and ask for the left side (driver side) of the train for the more scenic view IF you're not going to sleep. Be prepared to spend about $70-100 for this fieldtrip (ie. taxi, train, bus, and food)5) Food - most of the food was salty and starchy. We were craving for spice - pepper is not even offered. BIG disappointment - from the mercados/local vendors to the fine dining restaurants. No recommendations here.6) Transportation - taxis are knowledgeable, fast and convenient and work at all hours of the night; can probably enlist a preferred taxi driver to chaffeur you for the duration of your trip). Locals travel by combis (vw vans) or buses (for longer distances) for cheap (1-3 soles) - if you don't mind the crowded/sometimes only standing room, this is the way to travel.7) Shopping - can negotiate with local vendors, will get the best price if you hold your ground. Can wait to purchase at the end of your trip unless you go to a historic site where some things are not offered at the main square (ex. walking sticks only at Ollantaytambo, I found out too late).8) Safety - felt relatively safe as there are a LOT of tourists, people are very helpful. There were a lot of tourist police (some who assisted in finding my lost camera in Sacsayhuaman!). Oh and don't try to take Coca leaves home - it's illegal.9) Language - many of vendors/shop owners speak Spanish, some difference in intonation (very helpful to travel with a friend who speaks fluent Spanish like I did). Otherwise, there are a few people there that speak limited English.10) I recommend taking a duffel bag of clothes/shoes/school supplies to donate to the poor locals (esp. Chincero). Then you can take that empty bag and fill with souveneirs home. Many locals that we met had not even been to Macchu Picchu, so please be generous. It felt great to be able to give.LOVES: Chincero and our children guides, Macchu Picchu, Mate de coca, the colorful fabrics and local artisans work and the Quechua language/culture, spiritual healing.If I went back to Peru, I would do the Huayna Picchu hike (light rain and paranoia made me avoid) and the Inca trail (didn't think I would make it)."
40,"“Cuzco, Peru, a great destination”","We traveled to Peru in August of 2007, which is springtime in South America. Our primary goal was a 3-night, 4-day guided horse trek into the Andes, culminating in a day at Machu Picchu. However, this review will concentrate only on Cuzco (also spelled, Cusco).Cuzco claims to be the highest city in the world at about 11,000 ft. We arrived there 3 days prior to our horse trek and it was a good thing. Beside the great activities available in Cuzco, having three days to become acclimated to the elevation before going even higher in the Andes was very important.The tourist areas in and around Cuzco are interesting. There is much to explore with great architecture, history, cultural sights and events, restaurants, and shopping. The city was established by the Incas and was their capital until being conquered by the Spanish over 400 years ago. Most of the buildings existing today in the old part of the city are Spanish architecture built upon Inca foundations.Traveler tips:When in Cuzco, take your time getting acclimated to the elevation. Walk casually, take time to rest in one of the many plazas, and drink plenty of water. Your hotel will likely have complimentary coffee service and cacao tea in the lobby. The tea is supposed to help with fatigue and altitude discomfort. Tap water is not potable anywhere. Buy bottled water and if you don’t like it carbonated, always specify, “sin gas” (without gas). At restaurants bottled water is an extra cost. As a somewhat thrifty soul I found that running a pot of tap water through the coffee maker in our hotel room in Cuzco, then cooling in the room’s refrigerator provided us most of a days supply while in town.Street vendors are everywhere. If you don’t want to interact with them when they approach you, just don’t make eye contact and say, “No, gracias, no,” and they’ll leave you alone. If you do want to get some cheap souvenirs then by all means give them your business, as that is probably their only livelihood. When buying more than one item, or any relatively expensive item, it is fine to bargain. Look to pay 75-80% of asking price. We also used one of these vendors to “guide” us to a few places on our tourist map, giving her a few soles (about 3:1 U.S.) each time, and then bought a few of the socks she was selling as well (they came in handy at night in the mountains).You’ll find beautiful jewelry and alpaca wool products to buy, and many of the better shops have demonstration areas and mini-tours. Your hotel should be able to set you up with a professional “arranger” who will provide transportation to selected shops for free (they get a fee, or a commission on whatever you buy from the shop). Bargaining in these upper end shops usually means 10% off your total bill, or 5% if you use a credit card. We used credit cards and negotiated a 7.5% discount. If you are a great shopper, or are spending a lot you can probably get a better deal. Research alpaca products at home before going, so that you know what kind of deal you are getting.When shopping in rural areas you will often find very good deals on quality hand made jewelry and wool products and can negotiate to about 70-80% of the asking price. Since there are fewer middlemen in these areas you can be better assured that your dollars are going directly to the people who made the crafts.Lock all valuables in your room safe or in your lockable luggage. If you store some of your luggage in the hotel while on a side trip, use locking luggage. There is a high probability that you will not have jewelry and other valuables when you return if you don’t.Only take taxis that are identified with a company. In downtown Cuzco the fare was about 3 soles ($1) per ride, 6 soles to/from the airport or other outlying areas.Do try the pisco sours – a very tasty kick. Also try alpaca meat – my very favorite food while there. We did try guinea pig out on the trail, but would not recommend it other than as an experience."
50,“Peru Trip Report and Impressions”,"I realize that I keep getting requests for information from friends -- so why not just share my trip with the tripadvisor community, rather than typing over and over again! Thus this is a long overdue trip report for my post-bar trip to Peru. This was the second half of my trip - I actually started in Equador and went to the Galapagos first. (you can check that forum for my trip report also).This is about my stay in Cusco and hiking the Inca Trail.Adjusting to Cusco: I really liked Cusco - it's very charming! You might need to plan for a few days beforehand though, to adjust to the altitude. I didn't find it necessary to take altitude sickness pills, but one of my friends started taking it before we got there and she thought it helped her. Another one of my friends got sick while there (she was throwing up) but there are plenty of pills you can buy while there (she got the ones called Soroachi).Altitude sickness is like having a hangover, I think - headaches, with some dizziness. Drinking coca tea definitely helped me. I advise dumping a lot of sugar in it though, unless you really like drinking leafy-tasting beverages.Places to Stay in Cusco: We stayed at the Hotel Rumi Punku while there. It is located in a really good area very close to the square. You can find cheaper lodgings, but I'd advise you to be careful about what part of the city it's in. Ours was very safe, and they posted a guard outside at night. Also, the door had a buzzer and lock on it at all times. It was also very clean and there was a very good complimentary breakfast. So we chose that for those reasons.I personally am not that paranoid about my personal safety when I travel (probably dumb) but if you are, Rumi Punku is a good bet. It ran $105/night for 3 people when I stayed there this past September. This would be on the pricey side of things... I think. We'd actually booked at a cheaper hotel for when we returned from the hike, but we fell in love with the Rumi Punku so decided to switch and stay with them!Things to Eat in Cusco: I loved the restaurant inside the Precolombino museum - it's called the MAP Cafe, and it is this tiny restaurant encased in a glass box inside the courtyard of the museum. We went there twice and loved it both times. Their pork belly was really good, the desserts were delicious, and they have very good wines. It's pricey for Peru, but I think it's well worth the price given the value. I think it'll come out to about $20-30 per person...? Not positive. We also went to the very fancy restaurant, Restaurante Illary, (where I tried alpaca for the first time) which was nice, especially for ambience, but I liked the food at MAP better.For more casual fare, you should eat pizza in Cusco because they use really good brick ovens to make a crispy chewy crust. I ate at Chez Maggy (they have multiple locations throughout the city) and I thought it was quite good. Also, if you or your travel mates are adventurous, you should consider trying alpaca, guinea pig (called ""cuy"" - a delicacy there), and chicharron - fried pork.Sightseeing in and around Cusco: You absolutely have to do the Sacred Valley loop. There're some ruins right outside Cusco - of these, I think Sacsayhuaman is a must-see. I loved that site a lot. I think it was my favorite. I think key sites to see in the Sacred Valley are Ollantaytambo and Chinchero, with Pisac, Tipon, Moray and Maras being optional but highly recommended.IMHO, you should get a private driver (we asked our hotel to recommend one), because the buses are extremely commercial and they end up driving you to markets and restaurants instead of the actual sites. The ruins are also quite spread apart, so if you go on your own you avoid crowds and you see a lot more.Other than that, just talk a walk around the city square and some of the small narrow streets. The foundations - the roads - are amazing!! The twelve sided stone is huuuge. It's hard to believe that this stuff has been put together without any mortar or cement. You can also really tell the difference between the original and the later structures. I also went to the Temple of Q'oricancha, but actually didn't find it that impressive.Hiking the Inca Trail: this was really fun, although for some people it seemed more arduous and painful than fun or relaxing! It can be a hard climb, especially the second day (it is called the Dead Woman's pass for a reason...j/k. All the tour guides say that it is called this because of the shape of the mountain - but most hikers will tell you it is because you climb endless, endless steps - only to descend them all again) and especially if you have altitude sickness.Speaking of that - most tour groups will require you to pay the remaining balance on your trip in person at their office at least two days before your trip departure. This is their way of ensuring that you are there long enough to acclimate to the altitude. So figure that into your planning!I really recommend going with a reputable tour agency. They provide better tour guides who speak English (I guess this isn't a concern if you speak Spanish) and they treat their porters well. After arduous research I went with Llama Path, but I also looked into United Mice, Pachamama Explorers, and Andean Adventures. Obviously I can't speak for the others, but I really have nothing but praise and rave reviews for Llama Path. They were clean, orderly, had brand new tents, good food. The porters were amazing, and outfitted and equipped well. (They made us a cake our last night!!) Our tour guide was really great - taught us so much not only about the history and symbolism of the sites, but also about nature. He collected mint leaves on our way, and we had fresh brewed mint tea in our tents after dinner. Delicious!We got to the actual Machu Picchu site pretty late on our hike, so there was no time to hike Huayna Picchu, which was too bad because we'd heard about just how amazing the view is from up there. If you have the chance, you should probably hike up there!Finally, hikes of the Inca are permit only (limited to 500 per day) so I think you're best off booking early, especially if you're going during peak season (which I think is June through Sept. The trail is closed in Feb). But i've heard that other hikes, like the Lares, are really pretty too."
50,"“Machu Picchu, Scared Valley, Cusco, Peru-”","Dec 2008What an amazing place, filled with history and beauty.We had to go thru Lima, Peru to get there. I do not recommend Lima. Very polluted and did not feel welcome, but it is necessary to fly to and from Cusco.Cusco is a wonderful town full of history and beauty.. We stayed 3 nights only. Should have stayed longer, there is so much to see. Peolple were very friendly. We took day trips from Cusco to Machu Picchu, the Scared Valley and the area around Cusco. The dome train to Machu Picchu had excellent service and spectacular views. Our guide, Alvin, was great. Do not miss the Scared Valley tour. It is like heaven. We want to go back!"
30,“Officially organised extortion in Cusco - Peru.”,"Cusco, the Sacred Valley and Machupicchu are some of the best tourist destinations in the world. The beauty of the archaeological sites in a unique natural setting is mind-blowing. How long however will tourists accept the officially organised extortion? How long will young people be able to afford to visit them?It starts with the Boleto Turistico that you have to buy in Cusco and that gives access to archaeological sites in and around Cusco and to museums for a period of 10 days. This Boleto costs 43 USD (September 2008) which is expensive to South American or to Peruvian standards. At the selling points, there is no posted information that you could consult at your ease before buying the ticket. You need to ask very specific questions to the vendor or the Tourist Information Desk but most newcomers are relatively uninformed and the information in the travel guides are already outdated even if you bought the newest edition. You would believe that with this Boleto, you would be able to visit the most important things. This is true for the archaeological sites. The Boleto gives access to 9 sites including the top sites, but some sites are quite far out of the way so that depending on the tour you are making, you would miss 2 or 3 of the less important ones. It is impossible to buy single tickets for the sites you want to see so you have no choice but to buy the complete ticket. Yes there are 2 partial tickets but the validity of 1 or 2 days and the distance range are almost not feasible. The museums included in the ticket appear to be of second or third rank. None of the top museums nor the cathedral or other churches are included. The “Religious Circuit” costs another 17 USD. One thing I found exceptionally grave: The Qoricancha is the former Inca palace of which only some parts are still visible after the conquistadores built the Dominican Cloister on top of it. This Qoricancha is a must for tourists. The Boleto contains access to the “Museo de Sitio del Qoricancha” and the map that goes with the Boleto shows a picture of the real Qoricancha. In reality, what you can visit is a small third rank underground museum at the side (not the site!) of the Qoricancha where you spend less that 15 minutes looking at primarily replicas. In my book this is called plain fraud!The entrance to Machupicchu is not included in this Boleto but this was obvious from the beginning and the cost of 43 USD is probably what you have to pay nowadays for a world class site. The problem is with the train from Cusco or Ollantaytambo and the bus from Aguas Calientes, the village at the foot of the Machupicchu site. Both means of transportation are monopolies. Unless you walk the (also expensive) Inca Trail for 5 days, there is no alternative to get to Machupicchu than by train, unless you want to hike along the track which is very dangerous and of course forbidden because breaching the monopoly, or buying an old inner tire and letting you drift on the treacherous waters of the Rio Urubamba. This Peru Rail train section is given in concession to “Orient Express Luxury Trains” with registered office in the Bermudas but in reality a British company. Again, at the ticket selling point in Ollantaytambo, there is no posted information of the time schedule and the price. Everything has to be asked at the ticket boot. The cheapest train is (yes, how did you guess it?) 43 USD for the one way 1 hour and 40 minutes trip of 43 km. How does this compare to the similarly priced train to the top European tourist site of Jungfraujoch in Switserland? The main part of this latter railway track is cut inside the mountain and goes to the foot of a glacier in the Swiss Alps. The Machupicchu railway was built in 1931 on the then existing road. First lesson in how to ensure your monopoly: get rid of the road where all kinds of busses could bring tourists and put a railway instead. A Swiss train conductor gets a monthly salary of around 3500 USD whereas the Peruvian train conductor makes 740 USD a month. Seventeen passengers pay the months salary of the Peruvian conductor on a track that is relatively easy (and cheap) to maintain, whereas you need 81 passengers to pay for the monthly salary of the Swiss conductor of the Jungfraujoch train on a track that is very expensive to maintain. Both the Machupicchu tourist and the Peruvian workers are being robbed. Oh yes, I almost forgot the bus from Aguas Calientes to Machupicchu which costs 7 USD one way for a 20 minute ride. A luxury night bus in Peru costs only 5 USD per hour and a normal day bus 1,25 USD per hour but they are not golden coloured mercedeses as the ones in Machupicchu. Alternatively, you can climb the hill in around an hour if you are physically fit to do so.According to a travel guide from 2004, prices in Cusco have quadrupled. How much longer are tourists going to accept this? A World Heritage location recognised by UNESCO should be accessible at a reasonable price so that everyone can afford to visit it. We hear that more and more young travellers need to take a long but cheap local bus ride from Cusco or Ollantaytambo to Santa Teresa and then have to walk a difficult 5 hours to reach Aguas Calientes in order to avoid the train racket. More tourists should do so.Patrick DebouckBelgium"
50,“Inti Raymi”,"In 2008 I spent 10 days in Cusco, attended the Acupari language school, had an excellent professor with whom I also did some side trips. The main reason was, however, to attend the winter solstice festival, Inti Raymi, which is the 2. largest festival in Latin America. It was awesome, beyond anything I ever expected. For Spanish lovers I recommend visiting this wonderful event. Cusco, of course, is worth a visit any time. Make sure to take warm clothes as the temperatures fall at night."
40,“My favourite place in Peru”,"Very interesting setting at more than 11,000 ft altitude."
40,“so many good restaurants”,We had 2 days in Cusco and would have liked another. We went to as many museums as possible and ate at great restaurants. Everyone suggested that we try the alpaca and the guinea pig and we were glad we did. Believe it or not guinea pig is delicious. We had lunch at Paititi one day and Incanto the next. They may seem expensive but actually the prices are about the same as the price for pizza but much better. For dinner we went to Inka Grill and MAP Cafe. These were some of the best meals we're ever had and definitely well-priced.
50,“Breathing in South American Air - Peru”,"My furthest trip so far. A total of 23 hours in flight from Singapore-Narita-LA-Panama-Lima,Peru. Flights to Peru via Amsterdam were fully booked for the cheapest tickets, so we took this route instead.We spent the most number of days at Cusco. There were so many things to see, feel, touch,smell.We started our Cusco City tour on a guided sightseeing tour visiting the Main Square, the Cathedral and the Temple of the Sun or Korikancha. Then, we drove out of the City to visit the Inca sites of Kenko, Tambomachay, Puca Pucara and the impressive Fortress of Sacsayhuaman.There are many eating places in Cusco, in the Plaza De Armas area. We tried Bagdad cafe, which was priced rather steep. Service took very long. In the end, what planned to be an hour lunch turned out to be 2 1/2hrs long. Nevertheless, while we waited for our food, we watch the weekly Sunday procession go pass in the Plaza. Nice music, great people, kids with sunshine smiles!Next day, early morning excursion to the Urubamba Valley, the Sacred Valley of the Incas. At the Pisac Market, you can get local crafts. .. and most memorable, I tried the Giant Corn. I had a tough time deciding to buy from which lady as I felt bad if I bought from one, whether the other would feel offended.. in the end, I bought 2. I couldn't finish. It was extremely filling. (My craving for corn followed me until Panama City :)In the afternoon, we passed through the Towns of Calca and Urubamba and visited the Inca Fortress and Citadel of Ollantaytambo, built to guard the entrance to this part of the Valley, and protect it from possible invasion from the tribes in the Lower jungle. You can walk through the quaint streets of the nearby Town, and get a good idea of what this Strategic Military, Religious, and Agricultural Centre was like during the era of the Inca Empire. You need to have pretty good stamina to make it all the way to the top within 30mins. Phew! Awesome view and worth the climb.Dinner was back at Cusco. We decided to try some local food at cheaper prices. So we ventured into the smaller alleys. Maybe it was the off-peak season, so practically, all the restaurants were enticing us with similar menus and prices. 10 Soles for a soup, main dish with free Pisco Sour and Garlic bread.Not bad for a bargain. Subsequently, each night, we went to different restaurant serving similar food, but some restaurants' dishes were not very good.I'll load pictures of the food we ate at my site once I get my card reader working.Of course, a trip to Machu Picchu is a must when you get to Cusco. The day starts with an early morning rise to transfer to Cusco Train Station for a 3 ½ hour train journey to the famous Inca Citadel of Machu Picchu, also known as ""The Lost City of the Incas"", discovered for science in 1911 by the American explorer Hiram Bingham.Upon arrival at Aguas Calientes, we made a25min coach ascent to the ‘Lost City of the Incas’. We toured the ruins for around 3 hours, during which time our guide explains the astounding degree of technology achieved by the builders of this famous site. The tight construction, the water channels, the staircases carved from the living rock of the mountain, and the Intihuatana, (or ""Hitching Post of the Sun""), which served as an astronomical calendar, all show technological advancement far beyond anything this area of the world was thought to have achieved. These, along with the Temple of the Sun, the Royal Tomb, the Priests' House, the Inca Baths and the Temple of the Three Windows, all allow us to glimpse back into the past and, with the help of our guide, revisit the lives of these truly remarkable people.Back at the hotel, I looked at the 'souvenirs' from Machu Picchu i.e. extremely bad sunburn and and some insect bites. I learnt a painful lesson. Even though it was a cooling day, you must apply sunblock.In all, if you want to visit Cusco, you should be prepared to spend at least 4 days. US Dollars are accepted widely. And do visit Machu Picchu during the low peak season, if not, you'll spend most of your time waiting for your turn to get down/up the terraces."
50,“beautiful cusco”,"just after spending 10 days getting to know cusco and doing the inca trail. Unforgettable holiday. did white water rafting with sas travel and had a blast. good food afterwards. Stayed in the hotel rumi punku. Perfect location. 2 minutes walking distance from the plaza and reasonable rates. Also within walking distance from all the good restaurants. Ate like kings in cusco. Got to try jacks cafe for breakfast. Great portions and very reasonable. for dinner we found the fallen angel to be a classy place, the inca fe cafe (across the street from jacks) to have beautiful chicken and the inca grill the best places to eat. Did the inca trail with peru treks who were fantastic. Our guide was very passionate about his job and the food was great.Hope this helps a littlechuck walker"
30,“Just Okay”,"Cusco is a decent place to stay if you're looking for easy access to the Sacred Valley & Machu Picchu. The place is primarily tourists. The streets are clean and we felt safe, however you are constantly hassled by street vendors. It got very annoying after a while. It was impossible to take a leisurely stroll at any time of day or night. Very ""touristy"" area, but a good location for day trips."
50,“High Five”,"My daughter and I recently returned from a three week vacation of the South Pacific. One of the best kept secrets of Peru is in Cusco, nestled 13,000 feet above sea level in the breathtaking Andes. Cusco is a stopping point to Machu Picchu. We stayed at the Libertador Hotel. The hotel used to be the home of the first spanish governor of Peru with some original walls still intact. The employess were very diligent of the guests and the doormen was very helpful on where to go and what areas to avoid. Although the people were very forward selling their wares, they remained polite saying ""Maybe later you buy from me"". The prices were very reasonable and the goods were of good to excellent quality. Next time we visit, we will bring an extra empty suitcase for souvenirs. We invited five children to have pizza with us and had a very interesting conversation about their culture, education and view of the world. I highly recommend this place to visit. The mayor gives you a signed certificate stating you were a visitor to his city. One warning is the high altitude sickness. I got it but my daughter did not. It can definitely ruin your visit, I strongly recommend the medicine, as a precaution. The coca tea does not always work. We loved Cusco and the friendly people."
50,“Awesome”,"""The Imperial City of Cusco"" far exceeded our expectations. Particularly arriving from Lima, a real pit of a place, Cusco is a charming, tidy colonial town blending the Inca and Spanish heritages as well as it blends the locals and many visitors (mostly US and European). Restaurants (such as Witches Brew) were fabulous, and when you're paying in dollars, you can live like a king."
50,“Cusco Milenario”,"Insuperable relación entre historia, paisajes y arquitectura.Se tienen alternativas diversas para turismo cultural, de aventura, gastronómico con todas las comodidades al alcance de la mano."

50,“Místico”,Cisco es una ciudad arqueológica por lo tanto hay mucho que conocer. La amabilidad de la gente cusqueña.
50,“Maravilhoso”,À amabilidade do povo. O que nao gostei foi os vendedores ambulantes que não te deixam admirar a beleza do lugar sem ficar oferecendo os seus produtos.
50,“Cultura milenar”,"Povo cordial e bem humorado. Suas vestes, penteados, modo de falar são um modo de resistência diante das imposições feitas pelos espanhóis durante a época colonial. Fico muito feliz de ter visto a forma que vive grande parte da população peruana."

50,“Lindo lugar”,"Em Cuzco tive somente boas experiências. A culinária é sem dúvida nenhuma um patrimônio do Peru. Há pequenos cafés e bistros muito charmosos para se fazer refeições. Na avenida Del Sol existe um pequeno café pelo qual eu me apaixonei, fica do lado esquerdo da calçada, para quem sobe do hotel Sonesta para a Plaza de las Armas. Coma a empanada e beba um suco natural. Uma delicia! Não deixe de visitar os mercados de artesanato, mas sempre se certifique de a prata que está comprando é mesmo prata!"

Não esqueçam de experimentar o pisco sour, como se fosse a nossa caipirinha, sendo que feito com um destilado da uva. O povo sempre solícito e sorridente."
50,“LA CIUDAD DONDE LA GENTE AMA SU HISTORIA”,"He tenido el inmenso placer de recorrer las calles de Cuzco, una ciudad que guarda con mucho cuidado y amor los tesoros que les legaran sus antepasados. Dejando de lado el accionar de los Incas con sus pueblos vecinos y de los españoles se puede disfrutar de una arquitectura y calidad de construcción que asombra por su diseño y exactitud; si pensamos que según nos explicaron contaban solamente con herramientas rudimentarias, asombra como lograban una inexplicable precisión en el emplazamiento y proporciones de cada una de sus construcciones, podían realizar un admirable tallado en el encastres de las piedras y poseían un inmejorable sentido de la orientación que aún hoy deja sin palabras a más de un ingeniero o arquitecto.Para aquellos que les gusta combinar el turismo con algo de historia es un lugar ciertamente increíble, la plaza central da la gran bienvenida a los turistas, con sus imponentes catedrales y la diversidad de idiomas que se escuchan en ella, la amabilidad y esmero de los cuzqueños ponen un marco increíble a esa ciudad que si uno va a Perú no puede dejar de conocer, una estadía de dos o tres días da tiempo para empaparse de toda esa riqueza cultural y gastronómica que esta ciudad ofrece.Esta no es la visión de un historiador ni la de un experto en turismo sino de una persona que tuvo la suerte de conocer este lugar como algunos otros en América. Eso si, si van recuerden que al llegar lo más importante es descansar unas horas antes de comenzar a caminar, salvo que estén acostumbrados a estar en la altura."
50,“Um lugar pra se Voltar”,"Fantástica a cultura, um povo que esta sempre sorrindo, feliz e alegre. Comidas maravilhosas, adoram brasileiros. É muito comum você estar andando pelas ruas e eles oferecerem artesanatos Na praça a noite eles reúnem para tocar musica, só para todos dançarem. Sempre sorrindo."
50,“Viajar a Perú es una excelente opción”,"He viajado poco, por algunos paises de Latinoamerica. Hasta ahora Cusco es lo mas lindo que conocí, es para quedarse varios días.. yo estuve 12, de los cuales los primeros 3 no la pasé del todo bien porque me afectó la altura.. pero es una ciudad hermosa!!"
50,“Cusco el mejor destino de latinoamerica”,"Todo me gusta. Visité centro artesanales, barrio San Blas, Iglesias."
30,“Visita a la cd”,Falta mucha orientacion para todos los que llegamos acerca de lo que se paga por visitar los museos y las zonas arqueologicasya que la forma en que lo plantean los operadores de turismo no da mucha confianza.Y hacer por ejemplo otro opcion ya que no siempre se puede conocer la mitad por lo menos.
50,“Cusco Maravilloso”,Desde que bajas del avión todo es imponente y espectacular!!
50,“sin guía todo es mejor”,"En Cuzco todo cuesta hasta entrar a las iglesias!!!! Ni a misa se puede ir gratis.... entonces, mejor se camina, se sienta por ahí y goza la ciudad sin más... imperdible: el mercado. Y en domingo comer cuy en los toldoscerca de la iglesis de santodomingo."
50,“À découvrir et redécouvrir”,"Il n'y a rien que je n'ai pas aimé. J'ai aimé les petites rues superétroites du Vieux-Cusco colonial. Ja,i aimé le système de transport en commun. J'ai aimé l'attitude respectueuse des Péruviens envers leurs attraits historiques. J'ai aimé la curiosité des enfants envers nous."

50,“ciudad mágica”,"las noches son maravillosas en la plaza de armas, muy buen ambiente, buenos restaurants"
50,"“Mestiza, cálida, hermosa”","Me gustó la gente amable, la seguridad para caminar hasta tarde, la comida deliciosa, los sitios arqueológicos espectaculares, sus calles estrechas y llenas de historia, el sincretismo de dos mundos, el orgullo de los guías parea relatar el pasado histórico."
50,“emocionante”,"He visitado Perú: Cusco, Valle Sagrado, Machu Pichu, Puno, Taquile, Nasca, Lima, maravilloso!!!! La calidez de su gente, la diversidad de culturas, de paisajes, de comidas y bebidas, la historia se puede hablar de muchos Perú ....pueblos paralizados en el tiempo. otros totalmente actuales, selvas y desiertos, ciudades y poblados, tradiciones y actualidad.pero con algo en común: la amabilidad, hospitalidad, cordialidad que hacen sentir al extranjero como en su propia casa. Ha sido un viaje maravilloso. Un sueño cumplido. Super recomendable"
50,“Oportunidade fantastica”,"Exotica, cheia de surpresas, muito bonita, com boa rede hoteleira e de restaurantes... Passeios para todos os gostos...e todas as idades... Cuidado apenas com a altitude..."
50,"“Cusco, un lugar en Peru”","es un lugar pera visitar, con excelente calidez humana y arquitectónica, muy buena historia del periodo pre hispano e Incaico."
50,"“Cuzco, maravilloso!”","Mi novio y yo estuvimos en Cusco 4 días a fines de Marzo. Fuimos con un tour comprado desde Lima (400 soles por persona, realmente barato!). Les recomiendo esta opción porque te olvidas de todo, ellos se encargan de comprar los tickets (como son varios sitios turísticos hay muchos tickets para comprar en diferentes sitios), te recogen de tu hotel, viajas cómodo y hasta te dan almuerzo algunos días. La ciudad no es tan cara como me imaginé, osea, hay para todos los bolsillos. Nosotros nos hospedamos en un hostal a 4 cdras de la plaza de armas que nos costó 30 soles la noche y cuando nos tocó almorzar en la cuidad, lo hicimos en un restaurancito (no turístico) que tenía menú de 6 y 8 soles. Claro que también encuentras hoteles más lujosos de más de 200 soles la noche y restaurantes turísticos muy cerca a la plaza de armas donde cada plato no baja de los 30 soles.... como les digo, depende de lo que quieran y cuánto dinero quieran gastar.Cusco es una ciudad muy bonita y vale la pena estar allí y sacarle el jugo al viaje recorriendo cada uno de los lugares."
40,“la bellisima ciudad de cuzco”,"Llegue a Cuzco el 29 de Abril de 2011, es una preciosa ciudad, pequeña, entre las montañas, esta un poco alta, a 3.400 metros sobre el nivel del mar.Hace mucho frio, y es mejor llegar y tener un chuyo, que es el gorrito de lana con orejeras, y de una vez un poncho de alpaca para el frio.La comida excelente se puede de todos los precios, y para todos los gustos, al que le gusten las hamburguesas Bembos es fabuloso, y la comida peruana deliciosa, muchos sabores y especias, picante y limon.La atencion de los peruanos es excelente,la mejor actitud de servicio y son calidos, amables y muy respestuosos de su raza.Hoteles de todos los precios, y hostales en cantidad, hay que tener reserva previa porque si se quiere quedar estando alla , no hay cupo, demasiado turismo.El transporte bueno hay buses, y taxis, cuidado al pasar la calle, porque los carros no paran.Es una ciudad llena de historia, colonial, llena de luces en la noche, tranquila y con una mixtura entre la cultura indigena y el colonialismo español, muchos museos, incluyendo uno de chocolate, y el chocolate delicioso.Calles totalmente empedradas, si van a ir, reserven por internet, es gratis y los recogen en el aereopuerto, a mi me dio un poco de fatiga la altura, se consiguen guias para conocer por internet a precios economicos, para mi mejor contratar todo directamente, sale mejor que comprar un paquete, lleva tiempo, y de alli salimos a Machupichu, que es algo que te deja mudo......."
50,“Muita coisa pra se ver”,"Cusco não é só uma parada antes de Machupichu, mas uma cidade bastabte interessante com vários museus, igrejas, restaurantes, ruinas, etc..."
50,“No se puede dejar de ver y disfrutar”,"Cusco fue centro de una gran cultura prehispanica y presenta en su arquitectura rastros de la misma con muchas murallas y distinas ruinas existentes en la ciudad y en las afueras de la misma. Por otra parte mantiene construcciones muy antiguas españolas, practicamente la mayoria de la ciudad. Se encuentra en un valle. Hay que prevenirse de su altura unos 3300 metros, comiendo poco al principio, pan bizcochos, tomando mucha agua y empezando a caminar despacio y usar coca, en te o en la boca.Conocer sus tiendas, artesanias, mercados, museos, espectaculos nocturnos tipicos y de entretenimiento y hacer todos los tour posibles, primero Machu Pichu, luego el Valle Sagrado, el tour de Cusco y hay alguno mas. Probar cuando uno este bien algun plato tipico, existen muchos, ciudado con los picantes. Hay que estar un poco entrenado para las caminatas y las subidas de ciertos sitios arqueologicos y caminatas dentro de Cusco. Realmente el lugar para mi es lo mejor que he conocido de America del Sur."
50,“Alte Inkahauptstadt”,"Das Hotel ""Central"" befindet sich nur wenige Gehminuten von der Plaza de Armas entfernt in einer Nebenstraße (Calle Choquechaca). Die Zimmer sind kompfortabel mit eigenem Bad und für Cusco recht günstig."
50,"“Après Lima, la ville la + intéressante du Pérou”","Découvrir cette ville et ses alentours, dont le célèbre Machu Picchu ont été qqles jours de plaisir et de ""plein les yeux""...Et avec Marco, notre guide, très très sympa, pratiquement de l'amitié.Notre guide nous a offert, à ma camarade de voyage et à moi même, une très belle écharpe en Alpaca, après .... nous avoir invité à dîner chez lui.Très bonne soirée, de plus reçus avec un Pisco Sour génial, fait pas son frère (Hélio), très bon cuisinier, en plus...et des parents et femme, adorables.Ce guide s'appelle Marco Antonio PEREZ SEGOVIA et c'est un jeune homme de 34 ans que je ne peux que recommander.Si un jour, je retourne dans ce superbe pays, je ferai bien un détour de 1000 kms, ne serait-ce que pour lui dire bonjour.Il a un site www.hoteles-cusco.com mais nous n'étions pas à celui-ci.Marco nous a servi comme guide à Cuzco et ses alentours, et c'est vraiment une ville à ne pas ""râter""Vraiment à faire et recommander.Merci encore Marco pour ta gentillesse, celle de ta famille et de ton acceuil.Daniel"
50,“Cusco - Der Nabel der Welt”,"... wohl auch für den modernen Touristen ... denn von hier aus erreicht man gut Machu Pichu.Die Stadt selbst hat viele sehenswerte Bauten aufzuweisen, man sollte reichlich Zeit für die Besichtung einplanen."
50,“マチュピチュより高山”,マチュピチュより高山なので、夜お風呂に入ったら私は高山病なのか頭痛がしました。町並みは石畳でとても美しいです。小さい民芸品のお店やカフェも並んでいるので、散歩するだけでも楽しいです。夜も山の上まで家が建っているので夜景もおすすめです。
40,“物語に出てきそうな街”,空港に降りたとたん空気の薄さを感じました。クスコの街はなんといっても夜がきれいです。アルマス広場からまわりをぐるりと囲む山の家の灯りが絶景でした。細い坂を上る路地の石畳もお店のたたずまいもずっと変わらない景観が保たれているんだろうなと感じました。高山症の恐れはありますが、一見の価値はあります。またペルーの人は総じて親切でいい人たちでした。
30,“Guter Ausgangspunkt für Ausflüge”,"Wir haben uns die Stadt viel kleiner vorgestellt und waren doch erstaunt als wir mit dem Bus erst einmal lange durch Vorstädte gefahren sind. Die Altstadt mit dem Plaza de Armas und der Kathedrale und San Blas mit den verwinkelten Gassen lohnt auf jeden Fall einen Besuch. Viele alte Gebäude sind gut restauriert. Insgesamt merkt man jedoch, dass Cusco ein Touristenzentrum ist, jeder versucht mit den Touristen Geld zu machen. So wird man doch sehr oft angesprochen ob man nicht dies und das kaufen möchte. Von der Jesus-Statur gegenüber von Sacsayhuaman hat man einen guten Blick auf die Stadt und bekommt dadurch auch eine Vorstellung von der Größe. Als Ausgangspunkt für Ausflüge ins heilige Tal und nach Machu Picchu mit Sicherheit ideal. Wir waren jedoch 4 Nächte hier und da wurde uns schon irgendwann langweilig. Beim nächsten Mal würden wir auf jeden Fall mehr Zeit im heiligen Tal verbringen."
30,“高山病にご注意を”,マチュピチュに行く人ならまず間違いなく滞在する街、クスコ。高度約三千メートルに位置するので、たどり着いたその日は、あまり油っぽいものを食べずに、安静にして過ごした方がいいですよ。高山病に効くと言われている飴もありますが、どうしても高山病がひどいときはホテルの係の人、ツアーの案内人などに言えば、酸素ボンベを出してくれます。また、高いところなので寒さ対策は念入りに。
50,“Inkas und Conquistadores”,"Der Flug beginnt in Arequipa: Fast ""schrammt"" das Flugzeug im Steigflug am Kegel des rauchenden Vulkans Misti, dann befinden wir uns im rufigen Flug über das nördliche Peru. Eine Zwischenlandung in Juliaca nahe dem Westufer des Titicaca-See's, dann kreisen wir schon bald über den alten Dächern von Cuzco und landen dort sicher.Cuzco hat eine bewegte Geschichte: Errichtet als eine Siedlung der Inkas mit ihren Gebäuden und Tempeln aus passgenauen Monolithen errichtet, wurde auch sie nicht von der spanischen Eroberung und Zerstörung verschont. Das Gold landete in den Taschen der Vasallen von Francisco Pizarro und in den Schatzkammern der katholischen Könige in Madrid, die Tempel wurden dem Erdboden gleichgemacht und auf ihren Ruinen wurden jene kolonialen Kirchen und Klöster errichtet, deren barocker Glanz und Charme bis heute Menschen aus aller Welt anlockt.Pizarro hat Cuzco erobert - aber Machu Picchu hat er nicht gefunden - das wurde erst etwa 400 Jahre später entdeckt."
40,“Die Kapitale der INka”,"Cusco ist ein absolutes Must, wenn man sich einen Überblick über das Wirken/Wüten der Spanier in Peru/Bolivien verschaffen möchte. Die geschaffenen Bauten sind sehr beeindruckend, insbesondere die Kathedrale und andere sakrale Bauten. Aber wenn man bedenkt, was alles von der alten Haupstadt der Inka zerstört bzw. überbaut wurde, kommt einem das Grausen. Zum Glück sind die festungsartigen Bauten oberhaltb der Stadt, auch Sexy-woman genannt, wegen ihrer Monumentalität noch erhalten und vermitteln einen fantastischen Eindruck über die archtektonischen Fähigkeiten dieser alten Kultur!"
50,“Heimat der Inka - Juwel der Anden”,"Heimat der Inka . Juwel der Anden.Diese Attribute verdient sich Cuzco aus seiner langen Geschichte, die es zu erzählen weiß. Cuzco fasziniert aus der Symbiose zweier Kulturen : Auf Inkamauern erheben sich prachtvolle Kolonialbauten, die zahlreichen Museen sind gefüllt mit kunsthistorischen Schmuckstücken.Zahlreiche kleine Cafes laden zum Verweilen und Betrachten ein."
40,“une capitale de l'histoire sudaméricaine”,"Avons passé 3 jours extraordinaires dans cette ville au passé colonial unique en Amérique du sud pour ses bâtiments, son cadre, son histoire. Il reste encore de nombreux vestiges de l'époque inca tant dans la ville que dans les alentours. C'est un lieu de découverte d'une civilisation et le point de départ idéal pour des randonnées, treks, paysages époustouflants dans les montagnes environnantes. c'est le passage obligé pour visiter le machu picchu et la vallée sacrée des Incas aux multiples villages encore remplis de ce passé prestigieux malheureusement mis à mal par les conquérants espagnols."
50,“ciudad imperial”,la ciudad mas antigua de america vive llena de tesoros escondidos entre sus callecitas misteriosas.la energia de sus montañas es magica.
40,“Eine Stadt die es lohnt zu besuchen”,"Aud unserer Perureise sind wir in Cuzco angekommen, der schoensten Stadt Perus . Die Stadt selbst hat kulturel sehr viel zu bieten (Inkakultur, Lateinamerikanische, Spanisch gepraegte Kultur) . Die vielen interessanten Museen sind sehenswert. Die zentrale Lage in den Anden bietet viele Ausflugsmoeglichkeiten. ( Matchu Pitche, Titikakasee, usw.) . In der Naehe gibt es viele Trekkingmoeglichkeiten, Mountainbiking und Rafting ist ebenfalls moeglich."
50,“古代ロマン”,整然と四角い石積みされた遺跡です。広々とした緑と石の城壁、青い空、別世界です。ここで6月にはお祭りが行われるそうが、古代を想像させる壮観なお祭りになるはずだと思いました。風が強くて寒かったですが、途中、アルパカや毛織物の露店で買い物できました。
30,“マチピチュの起点”,マチピチュに行く際に前泊後泊しました。全く知識なしにクスコに到着しましたが、街が石畳で美しくお土産物やさんやいろいろなレストランもあり楽しめました。世界遺産もありオプショナルツアーに参加しましたが各国の方と交流ができ良かったです！マチピチュに行くなら是非クスコにもお寄り下さい。
40,“Excelente Estadia”,"Bueno realisamos nuestro viaje la la Ciudad Ombligo del Mundo, y Tomamos los Servixcios de Machupicchu Travel Adviser, Agencia en Cusco, previas coordinaciones por su web www.machupicchuadviser.com, desodimos tomar los tours de:City Tours, Valle sagrado y Machupicchu por dos dias y una noche, nada que decir una atencion espectacular, desde la recepcion en el Aerpuerto , hotel, transporte, la calidad d ela gente peruana muy buena, y el trato de la agencia excelente ninguna queja, si desean cualqier coordinacion con la gencia les dejo el hilo www.machupicchuadviser.com"
40,"“Cusco, die Hauptstadt des ehemaligen Inkareiches”","In Cusco vermixen sich die Inkamauern mit den Kolonialgebäuden der Spanier. Die Spanier wollten zeigen, dass sie die Inkas besiegt hatten. So setzten sie etwa dem Sonnentempel ein katholisches Kloster auf.Die Stadt hat eine angenehme Atmosphäre, ich liebte es, durch die Straßen zu marschieren. Aber Vorsicht, muten sie sich nach der Ankunft nicht zu viel zu, die Stadt liegt doch auf 3800 m und sie können durchaus Probleme mit der Höhenkrankheit bekommen. Also, alles sachte angehen.Vorsicht vor den Touristguides. Es scheint so, dass viele von ihnen den Touristen nur das Geld wegnehmen wollen, mir ist das passiert. Also, aufpassen."
50,“Magic Cusco”,"Cusco bietet viel mehr als ""nur"" Machu Picchu. Natuerlich ist die alte Inka Stadt einen Besuch wert. Doch im Sacred Valley (heiliges Tal) gibt es andere kleinere Ruinen (Pisac), die zu besichtigen sind. Das gesamte Tal strahlt eine besondere magische Energie aus und auch in Cusco findet man viele Menschen und Orte, die einen verzaubern. Fuer Hiker gibt es alternativen zum Inka Trail: den Salcantay Trek oder den etwas abgelegenen heiligen Berg Ausangate. Dieser Trek fuehrt einen in Gegenden, die weit weg von der Zivilisation liegen. Die Energie der Berge und der Menschen die dort leben, lassen einen eine magische Welt erleben."
40,“Mein Favorit zum Spanischlernen”,"Cusco hat die optimale Größe, viele Junge Leute die sich dort länger aufhalten um an Sozialprojekten mitzuarbeiten oder einfach nur die Srache zu lernen, eine Lokalszene die für jeden etwas zu bieten hat und die Preise sind günstig. Ich war übrigens bei Acupari und war hochzufrieden, es gibt jedoch noch viele andere Sprachschulen. Es ist auch der ideale Ausgangspunt für Touren zum Titicacasee (Leute fahrt nach Bolivien, Copacabana, Puno ist nicht sehr sehenswert) und Macchu Piccu. Ich hab den Salkantay Trek gewählt. Der ist günstiger, einsamer, auch kurzfristig buchbar und wunderschön!! Nur sieht man weniger Inkaruinen."
40,“Balada surreal”,"Cuzco é um lugar surreal, muita gente bonita se aventurando pelos Andes, grande parte de passagem para Macchu Picchu. Obrigatório tomar um chá de erva local para amenizar o mau estar, não perca a feirinha de artesanato e garanta umas duas baladinhas no Mamma Africa, vale muito a pena."
40,“Toller Städtetrip”,"Wir waren insgesamt 2 Tage in Cusco auf der Weiterreise nach Machu Picchu. Die Stadt ist wunderschön, bessere Luft als in Lima und kulturell hoch interessant. Das Stadtzentrum ist gut zu Fuß zu erkunden. Die vielen Inka-Ruinen außerhalb der Stadt sind sehr gut mit einem Bus/Taxi zu erreichen. Auch im Dunkeln ist Cusco nicht gefährlich. Wir haben uns sicher gefühlt und die Atmosphäre der vielen Stände und Händler genossen. Auf jeden Fall eine Reise wert. Wir waren in einem Hotel etwa 10 Gehminuten außerhalb des Zentrums, das sehr gut zu Fuß zu erreichen ist."
50,“zu recht: SILBERSTADT”,"es erwartet uns eine stadt, die ein kleinod ist schon der anflug in das hoch in den bergen gelegene tal ist ein erlebnis.. malerisch in einem tal gelegen, ursprünglich und voller kolonialer eindrücke.rund um den ZOCALO aber auch in den angrenzenden bezirken: herrlich restaurierte gebäude, straßen und innenhöfe, auf den märkten indios aus den bergen in ihren malerischen trachten, essen in allen variationen für nur wenige euros. in der altstadt, die sich den berg hochzieht, kostet ein menü gerade mal 3 euros : es schmeckt gut und ist ausreichend. in dieser stadt kann man sich längere zeit aufhalten, ohne sich zu langweilen.von cusco gibt es eine vielzahl von tagesausflugsmöglichkeiten, diese sollte man wahrnehmen.aber auch hier eine vielzahl von dreier-patroullien der Tourist-Police - man kann sich sicher fühlen."
40,"“Wunderschön, wenn auch etwas anstrengend”","Das Stadtzentrum ist sehr gut erhalten und echt eine Reise wert. Da die meisten von hier aus Macchu Picchu besuchen, wimmelt es nur so von Touristen - und dementsprechend auch von Händlern und Verkäufern. Dies kann manchmal echt etwas nervig sein, wenn man die ganze Zeit angequatscht wird. Sehr interessant ist das Historische Museum und wunderschön sind die Kirchen sowie auch die kleineren Gässchen hügelaufwärts."
50,“Cusco Travel”,"Cusco es la ciudad mas bonita que he conocido en Peru. Esta ciudad tiene tanta historia y lugares bonitas de visitar. Yo estaba solo 2 semanas, pero para conocer todo mucho mejor, necesitas siempre mas tiempo.Recomiendo a todo de visitar este hermosa ciudad!"
50,“独特の雰囲気漂う街”,街自体が世界遺産となっているクスコ。マチュピチュへ行く途中によることができた。標高が３４００メートルで到着した翌朝少し頭痛がしました。アルマス広場のまわりにはレストランお土産屋が多数ありまた、カテドラルがあり見学ツアーは必見です。石段はほんとにおどろかされます。遠く離れたところから持ってきた大きな石をセメントもないのに隙間なく積み上げる技術は未だに解明されていないとのこと。郊外にはサクサイワマンという戦地跡がありこちらも見事は石段が見られます。また丘の上あるのでクスコのきれいな街並みがみられます。食事は日本食に似た感覚で米を主食に肉や野菜がおかずになります。
50,“魅惑の古都”,２００９年の９月にマチュピチュに行った帰り１泊だけしました。高山病が怖くて必要最低限の滞在しかしませんでしたが、もう少しゆっくりしてもよかったかもとやや後悔しています。私は高山病対策として下記のような旅程にしていました。クスコ→すぐにタクシーでオリャンタイタンボへ→電車でマチュピチュ→マチュピチュにて１泊し、早朝から夕方まで遺跡観光→電車でオリャンタイタンボへ→乗り合いタクシーでクスコに夜到着→クスコ１泊→クスコで半日観光クスコの滞在はもうだいぶからだが高地になれてからでしたので、思ったほど症状がでることもなく、ちょっと早歩きすると息が切れるという程度で快適に観光が楽しめました。クスコはともかくインカの石積みに囲まれた町並みが素敵なのですが、この町でなによりすばらしかったのは夜景！特にアルマス広場から見る夜景は絶景でした。宿泊した山小屋風ホテル（？）「Inkarri Hostal」も、食事をした日本人オーナーのいるレストラン『プカラ』も、リーズナブルな上に満足度が高く、非常にいい思い出の残る街となりました。マチュピチュなどにいらっしゃるかたは、ぜひクスコでの滞在時間をしっかりとることをおすすめします！
40,“acogedora”,"Hola La ciudad del Cuzco es una bella ciudad muy acogedora con todos los servicios al turista, gente muy amable y buen trato"
50,“perù”,"ho avuto dopo tanti anni di sacrifici la possibilità di poter visitare questa merevigliosa città delle ande e la splendida machu pichuho organizzato il tutto tramite una agenzia di viaggi ed il tour Operator Auratours, ottimi servizi ed ottimi hotel. Vi consiglio questa meta.the cat"
50,“Mágico!!”,"El Cusco es mágico, tiene algo que atrae y hechiza.Naturaleza, cultura, tradición, comida deliciosa, gente amable. Ufff! Hay tanto que decir!!Es una ciudad hermosa, y es más que Machu Picchu, muy recomendable!"
50,“Cusco”,"No hay lugar a duda que Cusco es una de las mejores ciudades que he visitado, cada vez que viajo por alla parece que estuviera retrocediendo en el tiempo, sus calles angostas, su arquitectura, su gente es lo maximo, me encate, la recomendaria una y otra vez.Hay tanto por conocer y aprender aun, espero conocerlo todo algun dia esa es mi meta.Si necesitan ayuda en su viaje, no duden en contactame :0)"
50,“Cusco es lo Maximoooo”,"Cusco es lo maximo!!A pesar de haber viajado por varios lugares del mundo, nunca encontrare un lugar en el cual, pueda encontrar la combinacion de muchas sensasiones :Esa magiaMisticismoLocuraRomanticismoHistoria (te aloca saber quienes hicieron toda esas construcciones)Paz y relaxDiversion y fiesta!!!Y obvio mucho mas""ojo"", cusco no es solo machu pichu como piensan algunos, machu pichu es alucinante es cierto!!! Pero cusco es mucho mas grande que eso tiene muchas cosas que ofrecer y para todos los bolsillos, buenos restaurantes, hoteles dentro y en las afueras de la ciudad llenos de aire puro y relax, y hoteles para todos los bolsillos, y un cielo tan lindo tanto de día como de noche, diferentes ruinas e iglesias antiguas dentro y fuera de la ciudad, que nos envuelven en una historia impactante de sus antepasados y ni que decir de la vida nocturna donde todos los dias tienes discotecas y bares llenos de gente y cn muchas ganas de hacer fiesta y quedarse hasta el amanecer. Ahi se puede hacer de todo desde caminatas, trecking, recorriendo caminos inkas, deportes de aventura como rafting en el rio, puenting, parapente, paseos en globo !!! Y mucho mas!! En conclusión , si aun no has ido , tienes q hacerlo y te gustara tanto que como yo sentirás una inmensa necesidad de regresar cada vez que se pueda."
50,"“Cusco, Las Ruinas de Machu Picchu, lo recomiendo”","Nunca pensé que seria un viaje tan increíble, Cusco es una ciudad maravillosa, tenia miedo de comprar por Internet pero al final todo salio muy bien, les recomiendo a la agencia que contacte por Internet ya que me salía mas económico comprar directamente, peruchasquitur.com, fue un viaje inolvidable, si quieren algunas recomendaciones escríbanme, yo estuve 21 días en Perú y se aprende mucho...[--]"
40,“今度はゆっくり滞在したい”,クスコ市内も、その周辺にもたくさんの見所があるので、今回、半日程度しか時間がなかったことが悔やまれます。ゆっくり観光など楽しむには2日ほどあると良いと思います。周辺の遺跡では、乗馬しながらの観光をしましたが、景色も良くとても楽しむことができました。ぜひお勧めします。
50,“Mi ciudad favorita en Perú”,"Ciudad linda, un museo viviente, gente muy amable, muy buena comida. Una experiencia recomendable para todos!!!"
50,“Bonita ciudad”,"Estuve en la ciudad de Cuzco por tres dias y desde mi llegada quede enamorada de lo bello del paisaje, los edificios antiguos, sus calle empedradas y empinadas que nos remontan a otras epocas, las montañas y el clima. No por nada esta ciudad fue declarada por la Unesco Patrimonio de la humanidad, Yo vivo en una ciudad donde la temperatura es caliente y se encuentra al nivel del mar, asi que estuve un poco enferma el primer dia debido al soroche, pero a nuestra llegada al hotel Sonesta del Inca nos brindaron té de coca y tambien en la habitancion contabamos con dulces hechos con la hoja de coca y esto realmente ayuda a sobreponerse rapidamente al mal de altura. El clima en la ciudad es frio sobre todo en las mañanas y las noches, pero esto fue algo que disfrute al maximo, tambien La gente en Cuzco es muy amable y cordial, por lo que me hicieron sentir bienvenida todo el tiempo. Otra cosa que me llamo mucho la atencion es el color rojizo de sus construcciones, la verdad me quede enamorada de esta ciudad y espero volver nuevamente y tener la oportunidad de conocer mas de sus monumentos y reliquias historicas..."
40,“Visita Cusco en Peru”,"Una ciudad maravillosa, que ofrece al turista Hoteles de lujo y economicos; paquetes turisticos para visitar Machu Picchu y los alrededores de Peru."
50,“ラフティング”,街並みがきれい！！マチュピチュに行く玄関口となる街なので、必ず立ち寄る旅行者は多いと思いますが、是非２日は時間をかけて観光して欲しい街です。マチュピチュに限らず、クスコ近辺ではラフティングもできます！！これが結構スリリングでおすすめ！日本人（アジア人）でクスコでラフティングをする人が少ないようなので、結構珍しがられました。是非挑戦してください。よい思い出になります。ぬれてよい服を持参しましょう。
50,“mí mejor viaje y con la mejor compania.....”,"Fernando B. Muntaner 23/07/09El conocer cusco fue la experiencia más inolvidable de mi vida, es un lugar marabilloso, en donde se respira esa mistica de su jente y su arquitectura de cimientos Incas.............."
50,“夜景がきれいなクスコの街”,クスコは遺跡など見所がたくさんあって、もう一度行きたいと思う場所の一つになりました。クスコの街中もいたる所にインカ帝国をなごりがあり、散策していてとて楽しかったです。なんといっても、高台から見るクスコの夜景がきれいで感動しました。
40,“Mein Favorit in Peru ist Cusco”,Eine tolle Stadt mit vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten auch in der Umgebung und vielen netten Menschen. Jederzeit ist diese Stadt in 3500m Höhe eine Reise wert und ich war hoffentlich nicht das letzte mal da. Peru ist ein super Reiseland!
50,“UNA EXPERIENCIA MUY ÉTNICA”,"Además de Machupichu, en Cuzco existen infinidad de pueblos que merecen la pena conocer. La experiencia es alucinante, parece que no ha pasado el tiempo, sus trajes, sus costumbres, su forma de vida es autenticamente genuina"
50,“La plus ville du monde”,"Après des années à chercher l'endroit idéal entre l'Amérique latine, l'Europe, l'Afrique et le Moyen Orient c'est finalement Cusco qui me retient. J'y vais, j'en viens, j'y retourne, ça me manque, me donne la saudade, la nostalgie, le blues quand je n'y suis pas. C'est une ville à l'architecture métisse, vieilles bâtisses coloniales construites sur les fondations des anciens murs incas. Maisons blanches et volets bleus du quartier de San Blas, blocs monumentaux des palais Incas, vie nocturne, restaurants pour tous les goûts, .... Le monde entier s'y croise. Et en quelques heures la solitude des grands espaces des cordillères andines ou la moiteur de l'Amazonie. Le rêve !! Plongée dans la culture locale, ses musiques et ses danses, ses goûts, ses odeurs, ses langues, ... on ne peut que se délecter les sens ... dans tous les sens. Cusco est une orgie de sensations, d'expériences, d'émotions. Une fois accroché c'est fini, Cusco vous digère et ne vous laisse pas indemne. Fini les croisières et les longues journées d'ennui prolongé sur les plages. Cusco, Cusco, Cusco ... me trastornas y me digieres para hacerme tuyo. Que felicidad !!!"
