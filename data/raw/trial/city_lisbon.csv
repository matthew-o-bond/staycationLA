40,“short staying in Lisbon”,I liked very much the cleaness of Lisbon. I will go back again at my next opportinity.Nothing went wrog I am fully satisfied
40,“love the place but not sure if id roam the streets at night”,"Its a while since weve been here actually returned for the 2nd time. Once on an excursion from the Algarve and once exploring portugal by car. The city is buzzing fabulous shops, bars and restaurants and a friendly atmosphere . I would say though that to be wary of drug pedlars even at early afternoon .we were approache by 2 well dressed middle aged men who were , when we declined to buy continuedfollwing us up the main street , until we dodged into a restaurant to get away from them. This wouldnt stop us going again but it tarnished what was a lovely experience."
50,“BEST WAY TO DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT TO VISIT”,"I' d hate to drive in the town , go for a trip on the river , and visit Sintra a must, lots and lots to see in the bohemian area"
30,“It's a big city”,Not particularly visually/esthetically pleasing. Good restaurants and hotels and only a train ride away from charm.
30,“classic lisbon”,"Lisbon has some stunning buildings to see, great food specially sea food its the best although I noticed on plain day light people trying to deal drugs right in the centre of Lisbon even knowing there was police near by.......a bit disappointed"
50,"“Beautiful city, beautiful people!”","Perfect for a city experience with added bonus, namely on the coast and the beaches are only a short trip on the very well run, inexpensive train."
40,“Day trip in lisbon”,Was sailing on the Ventura ship going to Lisbon and Spain stopped at Lisbon for the day to see the city which I enjoyed and would like to go back again when I can.
50,“lisbon 2015”,Lovely 16th century buildings. Busy seafront cafes. A kiosk called Hotdogworks was the best hotdog I ever had. Cute affordable restaurant called Guilty's had a wide choice and was good.Tour to Silva was very nice and interesting. So picturesque
40,“November in Lisbon”,"Lisbon at the end of November can be a cold city but the people are very welcoming. Most of the city attractions are still open and the food and wine still flow. I had three days there and was able to walk around the city and stake a rail trip along the coast in this time. My only complaint is that the city is very expensive considering the state of the Portuguese economy.To me the best bit is the main square by the river - This gives spectacular views towards the statue of Christ and the suspension bridge. The square itself has magnificent architecture which continues into the city and up the hills. Any of the hills give views over the city and it’s surrounds. There were various strikes on while I was there that put off a second rail trip, but overall well worth the visit."
50,“Amazing city”,"Travelling within the city is simple using daily public transport pass (save your card which is rechargeable) for 6€. Alternating between the subway (clean and safe), old fashion tram car (line 28E and 15E are a must to visit Amalfa and Barrio Alto) is convenient and faster than a cab. Train ride to Belenn and Sintra will cost you +-5€ a lot cheaper than Hop on Hop off @ 65€. Departures are at Rossio and Casa Sondre"
40,“tour of Lisbon”,"We recently went on a days tour of Lisbon. It is a fascinating city with so much history. We started on their very efficient train system, went on the city trams and rode in a Tuk Tuk. The Portuguese drive very quickly! Best things to see are the castle, the Elevator (wonderful views), the Jewish quarter (lovely little bars and restaurants), Belem Tower, not forgetting a glass of Ginjinha served in an edible chocolate cup! Only downside is pick pockets are rife and we lost our money on the tram. Wear your backpack on your front and don't let your wallet out of your sight. Its such a shame as the Portuguese are such a friendly nation."
50,“Lisbon city”,"I planned a visit to Lisbon to take my wife there for our 19th wedding anniversary. Worried about the transport system and how we would find our hotel etc. DO NOT WORRY. The airport is great and as you exit look left and you will see the new metro station. Find a ticket machine and press the English button and all is ok. You buy a ticket for one journey or 24hrs or if you are staying longer buy a ZAP ticket . The ticket will cost you €5 and then you just add money as you need it. Walk to the entrance place the ticket on the spot and off you go. The display will tell you how much you have left on the card each time you use it. If you need to top up just place the card against the machine and the display will tell you what to do. This ticket can be used on the metro ,the trains. the trams,the buses and the ferries. Metro rides are €1.40 , trams /buses about €1.70 and trains / ferries €2.50. Right having sorted that we hit the city and Rossi sq . The street restaurants are every where but always look to see that the 23% vat is included in the price you see. We had a bad first meal as the food was shown at €8 with salard included and we had 2 large beers but on paying the bill they added vat AND A SERVICE CHARGE. total €54. Lisbon is not cheap but you will be ripped off if you are not on the ball. Pick pockets everywhere so carry you money in front or well hidden. Watch for men walking about with coats or blankets over their shoulders !!!!. Its a steep walk but the castle on the hill is well worth the climb and if you walk right up the back streets by the castle wall you will find a great little bar where a small cold beer is €1 !!!!. There is a charge to enter the castle which we paid but DONT as all you need to do is walk through the barrier to the open viewing area and afterwards just walk along the front and like everybody else you can just walk into the castle and WC. Jump on the metro to the end of the GREEN line and you will be at the train station for the must do trip to CASCAIS. 45min ride along the coast , trains run till late. Walk into the main sq and the street food is well worth the money. Next trip we did is to travel the length of TRAM 28 . This is a must. its cheap/fast and fun plus you get to see so much. Catching the train from the big station just off Rossi sq will take you to the inland town of SINTRA. You will not be disappointed but dont go if you are not a walker . Sure there are dozens of tours but they are not cheap. If you are up for it we walked the route up to the Moor castle 1400ft up. The views are to die for and you can see almost all of Portugal from there. Take a good camera. We were running out of time but jumped on the ferry and went across the straight and back for the ride and the views were great. Finally I must tell you about one night when we decided to walk the tram 28 route back up the hills. Its not that far and you get to see alot that you would miss on the tram. However just as we rounded the last climb we heard a disco playing and saw all these people entering what looked like an alleyway. We decided to investigate. What we found was a street bbq cook shop based in the alleyway around a school. This is for the locals and money raised is ploughed back in the school. We sat down , got talking to a family . The beer turned up as did the fish/salard and all sorts or other bits that was so cheap. 2hrs later we came out to catch the tram 28 back and made friends with the family as well. MIX WITH THE LOCALS AND EAT OUTSIDE THE CENTRE. I cannot wait to book my return trip . LISBON we love you"
40,“Lisbonne”,"Very reasonably priced ""major"" city of Europe. Getting about is easy and cheap whether on foot, bus, tram. train or taxi -in fact the taxis must be about the cheapest in western Europe ! Although they have modern trams it is more interesting to take one of the ""rustic"" old ones, they take you to many of the best views around including the castles.If you want to listen to ""fada"" music there is no need to book one of the ""tourist"" venues there are plenty around where you can eat at a reasonable price and listen to the music.If you are suffering from ""shopping withdrawal sympton"" take a taxi to the Colombe Shopping Centre, a modern mecca to commerce - the architecture is amazing."
50,“Hospital da Luz - Excellent Hospital for Foreign Visitors to Lisbon”,"My family and I were recently in Lisbon on vacation when my 18 month old daughter came down with a high fever. In my search online for seeking medical treatment in Lisbon, it recommended we visit a private hospital. The hotel concierge next door to our vacation rental was kind enough to call a taxi for us and we went to the British Hospital first. While it seemed nice, we were immediately told that they do not have an emergency pediatric unit and that we would need to go to Hospital da Luz. We took a short cab ride to Hospital da Luz and were immediately at ease. The reception desk personnel were very helpful. We were assigned a number and were checked in within 10 minutes. We were then transferred to the children's waiting room which was clean and had a variety of toys, games etc. A nurse consulted with us within 5 minutes and gave our daughter medication for her high fever. We were then seen by an amazing doctor. She spoke English and was very patient with us, and wonderful with my daughter. She quickly diagnosed her with an ear infection, prescribed medication and wrote down all instructions for us in English, which was very helpful. All in all - were there for an hour total. Being from the United States, where emergency room waits are typically in the 2+ hour range, this was both welcomed and appreciated by us travelers with a sick kiddo. I would highly recommend Hospital da Luz to any visitors to Portugal who need to seek immediate medical care."
40,“Atelier-Museu Júlio Pomar”,"The Atelier-Museu Júlio Pomar is probably Lisbon's most recent museum. Set in a very interesting traditional neighbourhood between Bairro Alto and Sāo Bento the museum at the number 7 of Rua do Vale was the actual workshop of Julio Pomar. Pomar is a Lisbon born painter who studied both in Lisbon and Porto and became active in the neo-realist movement from 1945 to 1957 when he painted what are arguably some of the most memorable images of the current. Later on he started to paint in a sort of neo-expressionist style. The workshop was renovated and adapted to its new function by Siza Vieira, famous architect and friend of the artist. The Atelier-Museu is a beautiful haven in the heart of old Lisbon and you get a unique chance to enjoy some of the best works from Pomar."
50,“Beware of Airport taxi Drivers”,"We arrived at the Airport and jumped in a cab expecting a 15 euro bill . However when we arrived the taxi driver told us that as it was Sunday it was double time , plus a charge for luggage . He was so convincing and we paid him only to be advised by the Hotel that this is a scam. Agree a price before leaving the airport !! The Hotel booked our return taxi and sure enough we were charged 10 euros.Our stay however in Lisbon was not spoilt by this experience as we found the most beautiful city with so much to see and do.We bought a 3 day pass , Viva viagem from the metro station which was 37 euros for the two of us and paid for itself within the first day. This gets you onto all the metro's , trams , buses funiculars and up the Elevador de Santa Justa. Take tram 28 from Martim Moniz on your first day to get a good overall feel for the city which you can hop on and hop off as and when you wish . Just keep a lookout for the pick pockets who also hop on and hop off with other peoples wallets.Any advice you need about the city can easily be found at either the Ask lisboa kiosk in Praca Rossio or from the Hotel staff who were very happy to help. We would definitely return to Lisbon and look forward to another trip to in the future."
10,“Tax Free Shopping Refunds? Good Luck”,"We just returned from ten days in the Lisbon/Cascais area. We bought several items that were eligible for the ""Tax Free"" Tourist Refund. Ha Ha. When we arrived at the airport w forms filled out, receipts in hand and items ready for inspection - there were NO customs people at the first Alfandega (""Customs"") counter . Right - it was empty! So we went through security and waited 20 long minutes at the second Customs counter for a female inspector to finally arrive. She refused to stamp the paperwork (they make you queue up at one counter for a stamp, then wait at ANOTHER counter for a refund - all while trying to make your flight.) The reason? Buried in the fine print - Look Closely - is a rule that says visitors can only get a refund at the City they are leaving the EEC from. In our case we had a connection in Heathrow. Given the realities of modern air travel - there was NO way we could land, clear security, go from Term 1 to Term 2, check in, line up yet again for a refund AND make our flight. We knew it and THEY know it - it's all a time-sucking sham to avoid paying refunds. (And in Heathrow we looked - not one ""Tax free shopping"" refund sign to be seen and the American Airlines rep had no idea where the refund desk was.) Takeaway - if you waste time filling out the forms, CHECK the items and hope an inspector is there BEFORE you go through Security - otherwise the typical ""I can do nothing"" stance kicks in and you are out of luck. At least our dollar amount wasn't huge, the family in front of us got the same raw deal and were popping mad. They were trying to get a senior customs official on the phone. Good luck with that. Traveler Beware!"
10,“Avoid Guerin Rent a car...”,"My experience with Guerin Rent a car was terrible: I queued more than 2 hours to have the keys of my car and then an additional hour to be in the position to have the car. Once I got it I realised that was old and damaged internally. I pointed it out to the staff but there was such a confusion that they wrote just something in portoguese and I signed it. After one week when I returned the car in Porto I got the claim of the damages! I explained what happened in Lisbon and the result is that after 3 months I received at home a payment request. In-cre-di-ble! Be careful because the staff ask if you want to pay an extra assurance to be covered in case of any damage and if you refuse (as I did) you receive a damaged car so they can ask you money. Don't use Guerin, poor and unfair service."
50,“World's most beautiful cities within one”,"I consider Lisbon to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world, or even the most beautiful one. Actually, in itself it comprises several most beautiful cities. One can view it as a synergetic combination of Athens, Istanbul, Rome, San Francisco... Since 2009. I visited Lisbon four times, and each time it was a special experience: Belem, Rossio, Praca de Comercio, Avenida da Liberdade, as well as more modern ones, EXPO Park, Oceanarium and even the Lisbon International Airport all provide specific scent of Portuguesness, not only fado and saudade, but also unfettered joy of life. Any time of the year is perfect for a visit."
40,“Weekend in Lisbon”,"Went to Lisbon last weekend ,my friends were over there and decided at the last minute to go for a few days.Flight from Cork at 18.00hrs on Friday ,so didnt need to take time off work,quick flight with Aer Lingus,only 2 hrs and i was there,couldnt believe it they fly twice a week ,Mon and Fri..The airport is a short Taxi ride to City centre ,Taxis so cheap!!We went straight out for dinner at 10pm ,fab fish restaurants,so reasonably priced.The city is so old and full of interesting buildings ,small streets milling with people,great buzz!!Next day walked to the port area ,got a ferry across the Tejo river to an area called Caiscas,we got a bus to the beach which took us very close to the bridge which looks like the one in San Francisco and the huge stone cross like the one in Rio .the beaches are well serviced with beds umbrellas,cafes and the waters of the Atlantic ocean were very welcome as we had temperatures of 33 deg!!!fantastic.We travelled on bus,trains ,trams taxis and ferry as well as walking the cobbled streets.The seond day we got the train to Estoril beach and again a fab service ,drops you off beside the beach and great facilities.Train back to the city every 20 mins.So its possible to have a beach weekend by day and a bit of culture in the evening and nice food and wine at very good prices.lots of shops but i wasnt into that this time.I definitely will be going back,maybe for a longer visit next time."
30,"“Portugal...beware freeway toll tickets, restaurant nibbles.”","I loved Portugal, we enjoyed exploring the countryside but....The tolled roads in Portugal are fabulous, grear roads and very little traffic but they can be very expensive if you don't pick up the toll ticket. When we entered the main road after a detour near Fatima, I foolishly sailed through the open toll gate, and wondered why other cars were parked to the side. As we exited to go into Porto, we found out why. We had to pay the maximum fee ~60 euros despite having the receipts from the first part of our trip, showing our entry and exit from the tollway further south that day. So suggest one finds that elusive ticket issuing machine over on the side of the road, don't drive through the open access route - tis very expensive.Beware the bread and butter, and any other 'nibbles' offered in Portugal. You know when you sit down to order dinner, you are hungry, the drink always comes before the food and you pick up the bread or nibbles on the table as you wait. In many places these are complimentary, as in their cost is presumably included within the overall costing.... but in Portugal, we were charged for them as extras on the bill. The last gasp was the basic tourist trap in Lisbon. Wearily stopping, we once again picked up the bread and butter (not startlingly fresh or exciting but we were hungry), we did not use the 'pate' but we were charged for the lot. Querying this with the waiter, who had spoken of his 10 years in Canada, he quickly dropped his previous charm and became quite abusive, rather than acknowledging that this was perhaps a unique cultural/fiscal tradition.I had done quite a lot of research prior to this trip and nowhere did I find comment about this habit. And each time it increased the total bill in a unexpected way... a trap if you are on a tight budget."
50,“One of my favourite European cities.”,"Lisbon was the lovliest surprise to me. It is such an underrated city, with all the attention always going to neighbouring Spain and Barcelona. Really , everyone should make the effort and take a trip to Lisbon - it is a beautiful city, full of culture , history, and atmosphere. It is a fun, exciting place, with endless things to do and see, - you cannot be bored in Lisbon. Great food to taste at wonderfully reasonable prices.. and the Fado music will touch your soul ."
50,“Lisbon - City by the sea”,"Lisbon is a wonderful city, although they do have a big problem with graffitti, near the port area. It is very inexpensive to travel on public transport. A tip - load up a travel card with around 10 euros, and you just need to ""zap"" it when boarding trams, buses or the ferry. Ours lasted for 5 days.Eating out is cheap, especially if you use the food courts in the shopping centres, where the food is great, with a good choice of menus - costs around 6 euros.Take a trip to the resort of Cascaeis. A lovely old fishing town about 30 minutes by train from the city - costs around 4 euros return ticket. Well worthwhile.We stayed in a hotel in Almada which is on the other side of the estuary from the city. It was nice to go across on the ferry each day (about 10 minutes, frequent schedule).All in all, a great trip."
50,“Lisbon a beautiful place”,"Me and my boyfriend went to Lisbon foe one week. He took me to see some lovely places, the food was amazing, the hotel Eduardo VII is were we stayed during our holiday the staff was friendly and very helpful, the food was lovely in our hotel. i would advise anyone who is looking to go there go because it is amazing and has lots of arractions to visit."
40,“A friendly warm city”,"This capital is a very friendly and warm one regarding weather and people!People were so ready to help even at times we didnt ask for it. Food is very tasty especially fish the national food and the sweet crema nata.Spring is a very good period to visit. There is a lot of nature in the city and by taking the yellow buses you can see many parts of it full of colour and joy. It cant be generally considered expensive, especially coffee isnt. Its a safe city, you can see police people in many spots around. Generally a very good choice for destination!"
50,“Lisbon - Little big city”,"Lisbon is not very big city but there is a lot of things to see.In city heart there are many historical buildings to admire, narrow streets to stroll through or places to relax for a while.Alfama district is area where you can see how Lisboners live, houses on hilly, narrow streets, people are friendly and very close. I started from the east side towards castle and then to city. I got lost couple of times but everything was close and it was easy to find myself.Avenida da Liberdade and Baixa quarter are mainly shopping areas and you can find here designers shops or restaurants. If you want to try something local do not stay on the main street, turn to side streets and you can find smaller restaurants or shops.Bairro Alto is another historical part in Lisbon.Further to the west is Belem where you can see maritime history of Portugal, it is the place definitely worth to see with Belem tower, Monument to Discoveries and Jeronimos monastery.Of course I tried ride on tram no. 28 as well and really enjoyed it.I spent one day on trip to Cascais which is only 30minutes far by train, it is really the right place to relax and I will definitely go back one day to spend there my summer holiday.Overall it was one of my best trips I have ever been to and Lisbon is city where I would like to come back anytime."
20,“Lost its Shine”,"Lisbon must have once been a great city, the architecture is testament to that fact - but like the façades of so many of the buildings the city has lost its shine and is now showing the cracks of years of neglect and under investment. There are drug pushers at every tourist spot trying to sell 'weed' - this gets somewhat tiresome when all you are trying to do is take some holiday snaps - and something the local police seem to turn a blind eye to (people selling drugs in broad daylight). Unlike many of its European sister cities, Lisbon lacks a true chic area, yes it has its winding streets with little bars and cafes but it is all a bit grubby and neglected. That said the street cars are a great way to see the best of the city #28 being the best route which links all the attractions of the centre of the city. If shopping is your thing and you want to avoid tourist tat then you are best off heading out to the great sprawling shopping malls at Columbus or Oriente - which can be reached by metro easily. The former expo site is well worth a visit if you like striking modern architecture and a ride in the cable cars is a must - strangely the expo site is missing from most guide books and at only 20 mins on the metro is well worth visit. Lisbon is a city that would suit gap year students or hippy types, but not much to offer a more seasoned traveller."
40,“Great place!”,"Great flat, great location and a great view from the roof terrace."
10,“Be care full”,"please be care full pickpockets are a big problem! they were waiting at the cruise terminal.i was lucky i stoped them in my bag. other on the cruise, i was on was not so lucky. they work with the taxies please dont take anything you can aford to lose."
40,"“Lizbon, a classy city”","The city embraces its heroes, writers, poets, and leaders.The food is fantastic. If you love walking, this is a city for you to discover."
30,“Lisbon OK but once is enough”,"Stayed for four nights which was not enough time to see all the sights, you would need more time to visit the 25 museums, churches, convents, expo 98 and so on. The open top hop on hop off tour buses were good value but not sure why we would be shown certain areas. Every city has it's homeless sleeping in bus shelters and begging and Lisbon was no exception. Hotel VIP Eden Aparthotel was in a central location with a great view from the roof. The airport bus stops right outside the hotel but we got a taxi which was 15 euros because there was no queue for the bus, it was a free for all. Only 10 euros to go back to the airport.Half an hour on the train took us to Estoril beach and it was only 4.10 euros return. Thoroughly enjoyed Lisbon but it's no Barcelona or Paris."
40,“Lisbon is allways exciting”,"Every two or three years we visit Lisbon in Portugal and we allways had a wonderful time there. But don't take a hotel in Mouraria. 't Is not a good place. Your hotel have to be in Restauradores, near de Avenida da Liberdade. The best are Residential Alegria, Hotel Botanico and Suico Atlantico. Good prices, good rooms and breakfast.You can walk to the Rossio, the Baixa and other things. You need a bus or train to Monesterio dos Jeronimos and the Torre of Belem. Beautiful. Take also tram 28 to Alfama and walk to Castelo de Sao Jorge. Enjoy your stay in Lisboa!"
50,"“Portugal, a great place to visit”","We recently spent 10 days in Portugal (Oct. 2010). The hotel Marque de Pombal Hotel in Lisbon was great, friendly staff and good food.The best part of the trip was taking tours with For You Go Tours. Our tour guide Joe was the best. He make our trip memorable.He answered all of our questions, he adjusted time schedules toaccommodate our needs, told us everything we needed to knowon every trip we took. We would definitely recommend this tour company. We also used Birds and Nautre tours for a birding tour day. They were also excellent."
50,“One of our favorite locations!”,"Lisbon wasn't our first choice of vacation back in July/August 2009, but I'm so glad we went there because it's now one of our favorite locations!There's history and lots of sights, warm climate and amazing, friendly people. Food was a big disappointment but those local little snacks were very good.Public transportation was well organized and very cheap. Taxi's didn't cost much either, but we preferred the public transportation because we like to see the local life as much as possible. You can buy a 10-trip ticket from every station.Shopping was okay. There was one designer outlet, Freeport, in Alcochete which is easily reachable by bus from Oriente bus-station (the same as subway and train-station). The bus goes straight to Freeport. We managed to spend a whole day there. Another good shopping center was Colombo (blue metro line, get out at Colégio Militar metro station). There were also lots of little boutiques in the city centre/old town. Lots of shoe shops ! Shops were open almost until midnight.Nightlife was very vibrant. Especially Bairro Alto area which was full of little bars. People got drinks from the bars and partied on the streets. Very nice. =)The best beach was at Costa Caparica. We also went to Estoril and Cascais but those beaches were quite small and crowded, also the water was colder than at Costa Caparica.Costa Caparica was about one and a half hours away from Lisbon but totally worth visiting; First you go to the Pragal railway station and walk to the ferry harbour to catch a ferry to Almada, the trip takes about 20 minutes. Then, in Almada you catch a bus to Caparica, the trip takes something from 20 minutes to 45 minutes (depending on the driver..). If you're not sure about the bus, just ask the locals. They are without a doubt one of the friendliest people in Europe (among with the italians and greeks).We spent a day in Cascais, about two hours on the beach and then just walked along the coast. It was very nice! You can reach Cascais by train and it takes about a half an hour."
50,“A favorite stop on our cruise”,"On our cruise, we took the shore excursion to Fatima. The bus ride was scenic and our tour guide was very informative with information along the ride. The Fatima was very moving and inspirational. We also visited Batlha and was able to see a bride arriving for her wedding. The architecture is amazing, statutes with detail like nothing we know in the U.S. We had an amazing day trip in Libson!"
50,“A short trip to Lisbon”,We have just returned from a four night visit to Lisbon in Portugal. We were very pleasantly surprised with everything about the city. There were many old and interesting buildings to visit and the local history was fascinating. I would particularly recommend the walking tour from 'inside Lisbon'There were a wide variety of restaurants to choose from and the public transport system was very good. We felt that Lisbon was a clean and safe city. We had read reviews from trip advisor which suggested otherwise but we did not experience anything like this. We would definitely consider returning as there was so much to see and we did not manage to see everything in such a short time.
50,“perfect short vacation spot”,Lisbon is a beautiful city! Perfect for a 4-day long weekend. The bars and the restaurants are unique and so cozy you will fall in love with them! Just remember to pack your flats because it's built on seven hills!
30,“When in Lisbon”,"I had a three-night break in Lisbon in September 2010 with a friend. My first impression was that Lisbon is not a beautiful city but it grows on you and has some unique points that you will not find elsewhere - such as the patterned paving everywhere and the old street elevators, trams and funiculars. The people were very friendly and eating out was reasonable but a bit hit and miss - it is worth doing some research before you go to get reviews of restaurants.I would recommend starting off with a river trip and a hop-on hop off bus tour (though the buses are not very frequent, especially on Sundays) to get an overview of the city, then go back to places that interesed you.One of our best days was spent in the Parque des Nacoes - it is like being in a futuristic city and the amazing Vasco de Gama bridge is well worth a close-up look. The best way to see the Parque is to hire bicycles and the cable-cars give great views over it.For a special restaurant experience book a meal in the rooftop restaurant in the Hotel Mundial, where you can enjoy panoramic views of Lisbon and it's castle while enjoying lovely food served by staff who make you feel very important - and it 's not very expensive. Very memorable!The Hotel we stayed in - the modern Tivoli Jardim, just off the Avenida da Liberade - was peaceful and central and the staff were very friendly. We were given a superior twin room which was lovely and spacious - I would definitely stay there again.The main down sides of Lisbon for me was the number of people who appeared to be living and sleeping on the streets and were heart-rendingly dirty abd down and out - it makes you feel guilty about spending money on trips and restaurants - and I did not feel safe in the narrower streets after 12 midnight so would recommend getting up early and going to bed early also."
40,“Legwork in Lisbon”,"The city is a great mix of Mediterranean ease tinted with some arrogance and a feel of self sufficiency. The worn out buildings with beautiful tilework have a romance to them and photo opportunities are everywhere. Lisbon is a romantic, relatively safe a city that can be recommended to people that want a nice setting to relax without too many obligatory sights.A long weekend (Thu-Sun) is not long enough a time to see all of Lisbon, but suffient workout for one's legs! For anyone who prefers seeing the city by walking around: wear proper shoes. Lisbon is hilly! The coble stones are not heel friendly, either, but if style is a must, you can always rely on the metro and trams, which are easy enough to use and cover most of the areas of intrest.A good map is advisable, as the ones you can pick up for free from the hotel or the tourist office vary in quality and omit any small alleys, and orienteering with one can be challenging, especially if a detour means having to climb back up on a hill.Public transport is efficient but buying a ticket from a vending machine can be tricky if one speaks no Portugese - not all machines have the choice of English or other languages.You can also access the close by towns very easily by local train, and combine some beach time to your city break, too. With a (eg.) three day tourist card that can be purchased form the tourist office in the centre you avoid language problems, and if keen on museums, the card allows you not only the use of trasport, but also many free admissions. A 24 hour card costs 18 euros, but check out the admission policies in your places of intrest before buying the card - not all attractions are included.Cork, tiles, leather, those seem to be the main things to buy - and local wines, of course. The standard high street shops can be found in Lisbon, too - for me the city didn't offer a spending spree experience, as I rather spent the short time enjoying the streets, views, cafés and atmosphere than sweatting in a fitting room."
50,“I've loved Portugal!!!!!”,"Lisbon it's a beautiful city to visit. Adorable people, superp food, safe, lots & lots to visit & do."
40,“Lisbon - the place for everyone!”,"I spent a long weekend in Lisbon and have fallen in love with the city. The city has an unusual charm that welcomes everyone and it certainly has something for everyone.Things to do:- Take Tram 28 up Alfama and enjoy the views- Go to a local football match- Hire a ""Go Car"" for an unbelievable way to see Lisbon.- Rest in the local bars and cafe- Enjoy the local hospitality over a beer around the alfama area.For the more relaxed vacation, you can take the ferry and do some very gentle walks through the museums. They are all very well signposted and easy to find."
50,“Best Portuguese tarts in the world”,"Hi trippers, I have just returned from 6 weeks in UK and Europe. Many things were fantastic but I absolutely loved Lisbon. From the Al Farma to Belem, we walked and saw fascinating history where ever we looked. But the best was a visit to Belem a short bus ride from Lisbon. The home of the Portuguese tart. This delicacy has been handed down since the 1800s. Originally made by the monks, the secret recipe is known only to 2-3 in each generation. The shop which you enter to buy these magic tarts, initially seems small But! I'll leave you to find that magic out for yourself. NOT to be missed."
50,“Economycarrentals are great!!”,"Economy Car Rentals (ERC) simply delivered as promised: A great car to a very fair price - including insurance. We had a small accident on our way to the airport, and the service from ERC was simply great. I reached them with phone right away and a kind woman (Ms. Ria) helped me through all the procedures. The subsequent email correspondance was fast, detailed and very helpful. Since we did not have time to get a police report (we would not have made the flight) we did not fulfil the conditions at the insurance company and they rejected our case. ERC and Ria Ms. Ria really worked hard to help us. In the end ERC decided to pay us the money directly from their own ""pocket"". Truely amazing service in a world where companies are normally without any kind of compassion.I can only recommend ERC!All the bestNicolaiDenmark"
40,“Lisbon - City of Hills”,"Some great historic sites, friendly people, sunshine, good seafood and wine. A lovely break from wet September England.Be prepared for climbing those cobbled hills - sensible footwear is a must. And wherever possible take a tram, taxi or funicular to the attraction at the top of the hill and sight-see on the way down.It was very warm (26C) at the end of September - mid summer must be stifling.The public transport at €3.70 for a day pass on metro, trams, and buses is great value. Taxis are very reasonable by European standards. The train to SIntra was only €4.50 return, which is also great value."
50,“The best city break we have had”,"What surprised me most was the topograhy of the city... for its seaside location it is extremely hilly.A central valley, dominated by Via Liberade, is flanked by two slightly different old town quarters on the steep hills adjacent. A rigid grid pattern section separates Via Liberade from the sea.Normally we run out of things to see after 4 or 5 days but not here, 7 days in and we still had not ventured into a museum or gallery.Food excellent and cheap, wine (excellent) from 3 euros a litre in a restaurant if you look around.Top tip.. the Institute of Port Wine in the west old town at the top of one of the ferniculars off Via Liberade. Best port ever... starting at 1.20 euros for a glass (you can get samples around town for 1 euro for a taster but this is a proper glass of port)"
50,“Lisbon Walker Tours”,"This company, which I found on the Internet has a selection of morning and afternoon tours with English speaking guides.I went on the ‘Lisbon Revelation Tour’ and it was great. My guide, Rita, was a font of knowledge and I learned so much about the city that I would never have found out wandering around by myself. If I had more time I would take some of their other tours. I can recommend this Lisbon Walker to other TA members."
20,“crossing the April bridge into Lisbon”,A quick note if crossing this bridge and I cannt remember the year associated with it. Maybe 1984 We got in the wrong lane and couldnt pay the toll entering Lisbon. But dont panic as you leave and pay the toll voluntarily its 1.40 euro and no penalities. YOu cannt pay at via verde but must pay at the bridge but no rush. The police and tourist office may tell you to pay at via verde but this is only for the new bridge. A great city but beware of the yellow bus tour if you get off long waits between buses and they dont come every 40 mins as advertised.
30,“I love those narrow streets in Lisbon”,"I visited Belem and Castelo sao jorge.The castle is on the hill.I went there by No.37,a very small car.There are a few peackcks in the castle.When I was standing there,I could see the whole city centre.There are no many places to visit.But you can try delicious food in so many different restaurants.Those streets in Lisbon are very narrow.The No 28 tram is very famous."
40,“Lisbon is a total delight”,"The weekend in Lisbon was planned to fill in time before a conference but proved to be a total delight. It is an elegant but relaxed city. Quaint trams bustle around for a fun journey through narrow streets, but an efficient modern metro system also makes it easy and cheap to get around.The weekend we visited there was a festival of brass bands - with concerts by community bands dotted around the city. At the more serious end of the spectrum there is a very fine modern art museum, a selection of religious monuments, and the hilltop castle to visit. A ride over the river on a commuter ferry gives you another perspective and a new selection of well priced restaurants.Stayed at the Marques do Pombal Hotel - definitely worth a visit."
50,“Private tours of Lisbon and Sintra at a reasonable price”,"Looking to stay in Lisbon for a long weekend and wanting to pack in as much as possible? Want to visit the surrounding area - the palace at Queluz, Sintra Village, Pena Palace, Regaleira Palace and Gardens and Cascais - but only have one day to spare?! Not interested in the usual coach trips that don't include all the places you want to see? Prefer not to be shepherded around for the day at someone else's pace? Afraid that using public transport just isn't going to allow you to cover the ground but that a private tour is going to cost more than your flight? If this sounds like you take a look at 'For You Go Tours'. They offer private day trips for two people for 144 Euros when you book online. If you're wary about booking on the internet don't be! You don't have to pay anything up front (it's cash at the end of the day) and they'll tailor make an itinerary for you. The car was comfortable (Volvo S80) the driver/ guide (Joe) friendly, spoke excellent English and was hugely knowledgeable plus you can set your own pace. All in all they provide a really impressive service - a 9 to 5 trip to all of the sights listed extended to 7pm with no complaint and not even a mention of an extra charge. A great day out and great value. One last thing - do your best to fit in Regaleira - none of the tour buses go there but it was the highlight of the day!"
20,“Disappointed in Lisbon”,"Just returned from family trip which included Lisbon, and have to say we were all very disappointed in the city. The bums and beggers are every where, the city is really run down in so many areas. There are some beautiful sights to see, but is very unappealing to be going down side streets and worry about the bums just around the corner. The Metro is good, and the bus/trams are good, but it would be nice if they somehow consolidated the maps; there are 3 different maps for each system which makes it very frustrating to get around. In general, after having been in Barcelona (pickpocket haven of the world!), and Madrid, we would have been better off going to the coast of Portugal rather than spending time in this city."
10,“Guerin car rental”,"Lovely Lisbon, every single time. But there is a nearly new car rental which try to do everything to get you sad and disappointed.If your flight takes 3 hours to Lisbon, then you have to que MORE than 3 hours to get your already booked and paid car, it is just too much! Be careful when choosing your car rental company.DON'T USE THIS QUERIN CAR RENTAL!!!!"
20,“If you want to see grafitti go to Lisbon”,"We just came back from a four day break in Lisbon, Portugal. We were really looking forward to it considering it is an international city. How wrong we were. We have never been anywhere with more grafitti in our lives, it was everywhere. It was as if the citizens of Lisbon had been issued with spray cans and given licence to spray obsenities on every available space. On our last day, the only sunny day we walked through the Eduardo 7th Park, a beautiful park, spoilt but the fact the someone had sprayed a moustache and various other things on a beautiful stone statue at the top of the park. The other activities we witnessed are not suitable for print on trip advisor. On Saturday night, the 12th June it was the Festival of the Sardine for St Anthony. We were staying at the 5 star (questionable) Avenida Palace, where the rooms are basic, room service finishes at 9.pm. The corridors are reminicent of 'the Shinning' The staff are friendly but not overly helpful. On the night of the festival the walls of the Avenida became a public urinal which was most unpleasant to witness. The buildings are so run down and no money has been put into what should and could be a beautiful city. If we won a free trip back to Lisbon we would pass on it. Also we were approached every few mins by dubious men selling sunglasses, beggars including one who had one leg one day but yet the next day miraculously had both his legs! It was intimidating and uncomfortable and you felt hesitant about walking around at night."
50,“Lisbon delightful”,"In spite of traveling in Europe for many years, we had never considered going to Portugal. Last month our cruise ship ended in Lisbon and we spent several days exploring the city.We enjoyed good food, good sightseeing and good weather. We did not exhaust the possibilities for sightseeing and look forward to another visit."
50,“Our trip to Lisbon”,"this is a wonderful place to visit! The history that this area has was fantastic, with the castles, the palaces it is a place to visit"
30,“Land of Fado”,"Lisboa, being the capital of Portugal, has plenty of well explored turistic sites. The city stands at the Tejo (Tagus river) side and relys under a magnificent light, consequence of its wonderfull set of buildings. Besides listening some Fado (the sorrow fate song of the Portuguese) all over the streets and restaurants, there’s a lot of places to visit and to go – Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, Padrão dos Descobrimentos, Torre de Belém, CCB (Centro Cultural de Belém), Castelo S.Jorge, Sé Catedral, Panteão Nacional, Museu do Fado, Museu Gulbenkien, Mesquita de Lisboa (Mosque), Basilica da Estrela… and walking through the streets of Bairro Alto, Alfama, Mouraria, Rossio, Chiado…The city is good to walk but the metro, bus and specially the ancient electric trams are very efficient and allows to move everywhere. There’s a 24 hrs card available for 3,70€ plus 0,50€ for the Viva Viagem (a rechargeable card).Lisboa offers some cultural shows on its several theatres – Teatro Nacional D.Maria, S.Jorge, Éden, Politeama, Maria Vitória… and the one that must be experienced, dinner at one of the several Casa de Fado (Fado houses) located at Bairro Alto and Alfama. For nightlife, Bairro Alto and Docas are the most lively spots.Further East there’s Parque das Nações where the Expo-98 has been done, and West there’s also Sintra and Cascais, another option for 1 day trip.To eat and drink try the fish meals, the sweet Pasteis de Belém, the Portuguese wine and the speciality Ginginha (cherry liqueur) at the little stores of Portas de Santo Antão street (near Rossio)."
40,"“Look west, Christopher?”","A lovely city to visit in the spring or autumn (fall), weather pleasant, a good walkable city although surrounded by hills there are about six delightful 19th century lifts, trams and railways that allow you t get to there, they are well worth going on just for the fact that they are in daily usage and have lasted so long.Lovely architecture, either domestic or public, and the trams are a joy to travel on while they wind there way up and down the narrow streets.Food good and reasonably priced.Good location for a city/beach break as just a short journey away on a good train or road link are some lovely coastal towns.Lots of museums, gardens, cafes and restaurants to visit and of course the rest of Portugal to explore"
50,“lisboa and rounabouts”,"loved the whole area, the zoo is a must to see....across from the us embassy.....the people were even more friendlier, when we could not speak portaguese, they helped a lot, not a problem. also the seals at the aquarium were outstanding and they came into the stands to kiss you...cant wait to go back, and my meals at the out of way places were wonderful.....made new friends and going back to make more Sandy"
30,“My Lisbon center city Robbery”,"On November 14,2009 I was pick pocketed in Saint JustinTourist Elevator that goes from Libertade Avenue toBarrio Alto overlook. It was clever fast and the robbersmake a great escape on next elevator down. They workin groups of 8 or ten and pretend to be tourists andthey steal from 20 to 100 people a day here and onthe number 28 tram the most. They are fast and almostnever ever caught by the police and the police areready to tell you and let you know that it was your notpaying attention that let it happen. They give you onefree phone call from the tourist police and they prettymuch laugh at your misery and they showed mea list of people who were robbed in the hours beforeme. Sure did not make me feel better and I was leavingLisbon a few hours later with no money no creditcards and a hearty goodbye!! The city is not dangerousjust not safe place for your valuables...beware...carry all valuable under your clothing andhave limited money you are spending in a pocketas needed....never show your wallet or pursein public.....or crowded shops. They are fast and efficientand the police admitted they no longer try and catch them.Little comfort to me by the way. MADG, St Pete, Fl"
50,"“Beautiful city, wonderful culture, missed the coffee immediately”","I'm 31 and went here in June of 2008 with my parents. We were taken around by a friend of a friend in our group who grew up in Lisbon. I really didn't expect such an amazing city. Some of the buildings were so breathtaking. My father grew up in Macao, Hong Kong, an area which had a heavy Portuguese influence so he was taken back in time when we saw some of the older buildings which resembled many of the places he saw in Hong Kong. I loved how families would go out to eat around 10pm and stay up all night hanging out. Didn't matter how old or young you were, every night was a night to stay out and celebrate each other's company. It felt like a mix of South American and older European culture and it was amazing!I love, love, LOVED Portugal. Can't wait to return."
50,“what a jewel”,"I am tardy in writing this as I travelled there in august.I was very lucky to have stayed with my Cape Verdian friend in Belas, which is in the district of Sintra.I do not like high buildings, so Lisbon was perfect. Like visiting the older part of london in miniature. I mean no offense. This for me was perfect. Elegant yet easy to navigate , everything at your fingertips, nearly.Food amazing! Pastries - heaven..... not enough time for the food. have to go back for this alone.Well done to the portuguese, as the French and others who maintain their national pride and don sell out and chase america and all it's and English isms.Custard tarts. You will find them all over, but THE ONES are in the Pasteis de Belen next to the monastery. This is not near the centre. I went by car so cant dorect you. GET A TAXI - it's worth it.Bifana - opposite the station in Lisbon - a beautiful building, is the most amazing buffet bistro. selling everything from the ex collonies , incir kofte, samosas etc. The bifana, beef/veal (cows not kept in cupboards abroad, just young like your roast lamb) is cooked in a wine and butter sauce and slapped into a roll £2. you would then have some soup and a drink... or if i had my way work your way through that buffet. If a few of you go. Everyone orders something different and you sample.I am not an alcohol drinker, but I believe my friend when she says the wine is superb. You will find little bars in the back streets. They each specialise in 1 spirt or beer or wine. play Fado music, which is fab. Portuguese blues.The cafe Brasillia where Hemmingway went.So much to enjoy.Go to the city's beach via a ferry. Or from the same ferry stop, get on a train along the coast to estoril, cascais etc. so simpleWe move onto Sintra. This can be reached by rail from the main Lisbon station ( after another Bifana). This is a world heritage site and a real fairytale town. Back to food.There is a palace - blv it is the Nacionale. there are shops on 2 sides and a square where the bus up to ( and i mean up to) the Pena Palace stops. at the intersection is a row of shops leading upwards. Here on the left is a cafe called Le Piriquita- you stop here for the travesteirias - they look like a mcdonalds apple pie but are filled with a secret which melts in your mouth. If this is full they have another ( though not original) further up on the right. I think there is yet another. It is too popular. Please go up to the Pena palace. Go early in the morning as this alone is all day and you must have a wander and a pastry down below. We went twice.enjoy. review above contains only 5% of the delights"
50,"“Surprising, charming city with wonderful people”","Of the nine capitals in western Europe we have visited, Lisbon may now be our favorite. Heading home, my wife and I both knew we will go back.The transportation options in the city include Metro, bus, trolleys, funiculars (all on one card, the Via Viagem), and economical taxis. The Metro is frequent, efficient, and relatively uncrowded; and the designs of some of the stations are so original and modern it is worth getting off and back on, particularly the new stations on the Oriente line. Buses go everywhere. The trolleys and funiculars are tourist destinations in themselves. Trolley (""tram"") 28E through Alfama is recommended in every guidebook; but we found tram 12E up to Graca and then through Alfama to be just as interesting, traversing narrower and steeper streets, and uncrowded. In fact, we did the 12E loop, including hop-on/hop-off, for three loops! The trolleys and the four funiculars, one of which was in the 19th century the first city funicular in the world, impart the charm, quaintness, and the nitty-gritty of Lisboa life.But remember above all that Lisbon must be walked to truly experience it. Indeed, given the topography, ""walked"" should usually be replaced with ""climbed"" once you leave the small downtown which is pretty much like any other metro downtown. In some parts of the city, especially Alfama and adjacent neighborhoods, stairs seems to be everywhere [near downtown, walking down Calcada do Duque is not be missed]. It is not possible to fathom how hilly it is from guide books, maps, or even from a ferry on the Tagus (""Tay'-zhoo"") River. There are many viewpoints (""miradouros"") of the city and river, our two favorites being quiet Sra. de Monte north of Graca and the ones at a major tourist attraction, Castelo de Sao Jorge.Lisbon is a city of neighborhoods. Don't miss Alfama (the old Moorish quarter), which you'll surely read about in your guidebooks. The accounts are not over-hyped. Wandering the maze of ancient alleys (""calcadas"", ""becos"", or ""traversas"", depending on their extent) with wash hanging in windows, birds singing from their sunny cages, people hanging out of their windows...well, it's a treat. Consider also Graca neighborhood, nearby. And Estrela, with its Jardim and Basilica. And... (well, you get the idea).For river views, take the ferry to Cacilhas and from there bus 101 to Christo Rei and then the lift to the top.For what Byron called ""glorious Eden"", take the train to the World Heritage City of Sintra (sit on the left so you can catch glimpses of the aqueduct), walk to town, take the 434 bus near the TI to the utterly-unforgettable Palacio de Pena, hike to the Moorish castle ruins, and catch 434 back to town,Belem, with its Monastery and Monument to the Discoveries, is worth half a day; but as with Sintra, avoid weekends!Final tips: (i) the air approach to Portela airport from the ocean is unusually low and gives you quite a tour of the city. Book a window seat. (ii) the light is different in this city of light; set your digital camera accordingly. (iii) learn some Portuguese even if it's a few words; don't worry, Portuguese people are very nice, and forgiving. And many speak English.Don't go if you need blockbuster tourist attractions or if you don't crave walking cobblestoned alleys and steps. We went to Lisbon because we hadn't been there before and we read that it was still a bargain (it is). We had no idea the effect Lisboa and its people would have on us."
50,“Places to go in Lisbon”,Just came back from a holiday in Lisbon with friends. Had an amazing time!!!Definite things to see would be:- Christ tower- Sintra (Need a whole day)- Cascais (Estorial is a 10 min walk from here)- BelemGreat pizza/pasta place in Belem by the river.Place to go for youngsters would be the docks. Has a karaoke bar and a few clubs as well as places to eat. 10 Euros to get in to the clubs and this may include vouchers for drinks.The Hard Rock Cafe (located near Rosio Sq) nice to go for dinner but expect at least an hours wait after 9. Well worth it though!!
40,“City of Seven Hills & Billions of Cobblestones”,"Going to Lisbon? It's a great city to visit. Prices are generally reasonable and transportation options are numerous (eg. underground metro, buses, trolleys, trams, taxis and elavadors. These modes of public trasportation are important because of the city's hills and cobblestone streets and sidewalks. Wear comfortable shoes!!! Lisbon as many sites to visit, but it helps to be in relatively good physical condition!Food is generally very good (grilled fish & fish roe, marinated octopus, pasteis de Belem). WInes are excellent and they have two popular pilsner beers (sagres & super bock). You can even get beer on tap at McDonalds!!!! And if you're a beer-lover like me, don't expect large beer pubs with wide assortments of beers; i couldn't find that, but the British Pub or Irish Pub near Metro station Cais de Sodre are decent. I found the people to be conservative but generally friendly and helpful. I made more friends in Portugal than I did in Spain.If you're going to Obidos, Sintra, Tomar etc., there's a tourist office at metro station Santa Appolonia with an English-speakinglady and she'll provide maps and train/bus schedules. I also bought one day pass (at any metro station for about 4 euros) which allows you unlimited transportation on any transport (including the famous Elevador), and TIP: keep your metro card as you can use the same one each day and pay about 3 euros daily. The metro is clean, efficient and easy to navigate, but TIP: trains may be shorter (fewer cars) during off-peak hours so stand near middle of station, and the metro shuts down at 1am. Beach lovers can go to Estoril or Cascais by taking metro to Cais de Sodre station and getting the rail from there. And if you're going to beautiful Sintra, go to Metro station Restauradores and get the rail from there to the last stop (SINTRA is a MUST-SEE)!!!If you like Fado music you can go to the popular Clube de Fado in the Alfama neighborhood, but don't be put off by people telling to not to go to fado clubs in Bairro Alto. It's an old, gritty, graffiti-strewn neighborhood but is very vibrant at night, and also makes for good nite photography if your camera can handle low-light situations. Take a tour on the city on tram #28 which takes you thru some interesting areas and goes to Se Cathedral and near the castle. Beautiful views of Lisbon from the castle. Overall, Lisbon is a good trip choice!"
30,“Lisboa 09”,"Five friends had a weekend away at the begining of june and stayed at the Tivoli Jardim which was a lovely hotel. The rooms had all you would expect from a 4 * hotel but sadlly no view. The bar in the hotel was great, friendly staff who made exeptional cocktails and nothing was too much trouble.With the exchange rate being so poor at the moment we thought we were prepared!, but what we weren't prepared for was the taxis drivers who rip you off big time! Although the price was on the meter they still added on prices for luggage, more than 4 people (even though we were in a people carrier) etc etc and they went the longest way around the city when taking us to the Doucas.The tram up to the castle was 18 euros. For nearly £90 for 5 of us we expected something special unfortunately we were very dissapointed.Although Libon is a picturesque city it had none of the appeal of other places we have had holidays. Palma & Barcelona to name but two."
30,"“nice town,but not the top”","We went to Lisbon, just after we had been to Prague. We both thought Prague was the best.In Lisbon, we missed the many stately buildings, most buildings needed a coat of paint and a new roof. IWhen we are on a city-trip we like to see beautiful old buidings, in Lisbon we couldn't find many. Outside Lisbon-center, in Belem and Sintra we found them. Parque de Nacoes has interesting new buildings.The old trams and elevators certainly are very nice to see."
50,“Beautiful 'Old Town'”,We had just 12 hours to see the sights and chose to go to the old town.The transport is cheap and plentiful into the old part.We wandered from square to square and marvelled at the great old architecture and fountains and colourful trees. The streets were spotlessly clean and all cobbled in white with black patterns.We walked up past old churches to the castle on the hill. It had the best views and great grounds with entertainers popping up all over!Plenty of cafe's and bars everywhere and quite cheap if you avoid the main tourist spots.Even caught a tram up the steepest little street we came across which was an experience.Had time to visit shops which were good for the wife!Beatiful port with bridges and forts.
40,“Lisbon - the city with something for everyone”,"My partner and I decided to go to Lisbon after being awarded some Airmiles and because I had wanted to go for a long time. We went with BA from Heathrow and originally I thought it would be a relaxing trip with not much to see but the more I read about it the more I found there was to do.We arrived at Lisbon airport and a very friendly girl at the tourist office directed us to the right airport shuttle for the hotel. We were staying at the Novotel near Praca Espanha as we had had to book accommodation with Airmiles. The shuttle bus took us there with no difficulty and dropped us virtually outside the hotel. The hotel is rather out of the centre of Lisbon and we had to get the metro each day to get to the real centre, i.e. Baixa-Chaido, Restauradores or anywhere near the Alfama. We were somewhat stuck in a wilderness of commercial hotels with not much near us, apart from the excellent Gulbenkian museum and therefore went out into town every evening as well. The metro was a bit difficult to find but we found the best route (not recommended if you are a woman on your own) was to go left outside the hotel and follow the road round to the left so you are effectively going round the back of the hotel. Carry on following the road behind the hotel and keep going until you reach the bus station. Walk through this past all the stops and then you get to the Metro Praca Espanha. It is not a very nice route to the station whichever way you go but we thought this was the quickest. We got to the hotel and unpacked and washed and then went out to explore.You can buy a day's travel card initially for €4.20 and then you can top it up each day for €3.70. A local kindly told us this but we had amassed 3 cards each by that time! This allows you to travel on trams and underground and we think there is a way to top them up for the boat trip across the Tejo and the train to Cascais but we didn't find a way to do this at the time.Getting off at Baixa-Chiado we had a trip on the tram no. 28 which goes round the Alfama and various interesting districts. The old trams are a lovely if a bit slow and rickety means of transport. We got off at the St Vincent Church and had a beer and snack at the nearby cafe, where the beer was an astonishing €1 for 33ml. Well we thought this was good but after Brussels and Barcelona earlier this year it was a favourable comparison. We then walked around the Alfama and went down some steps past the cafe and down towards the river which we could see from the hill and seemed to walk for ages until we got to Estacio Fluvial and the tube stop at the end of the blue line. We then got the metro back to the hotel.We stopped at the hotel for a shower and rest and then went back out again to Restauradores station where we tried to find a restaurant mentioned in the AA Spiral Guide but no such luck. We had dinner in a little cafe not far from the square which was ok. I had salt cod and king prawn with rice which was fine. It was very busy and was obviously a locals cafe (and about half the price of the hotel restaurant).On the first full day we visited the Oceanaria which is a colossal aquarium where you can see all manner of sea creatures and birds and animals connected with the Ocean. There is a lot to see and it is very well displayed. The sea otters were my favourites. It is best to get there early (it opens at 10) as it can get very busy.We then decided to find the river station and get the boat over to Cacilhas and see the Cristo Rei which is a copy of the one in Rio. We walked for miles in the wrong direction until we realised that the station we wanted was the Cais do Sodre, which apart from being an underground stop and train station for trains to Estoril and Cascais was a boat station. There is the other river station which we had passed the day before but this went to other places over the river, I believe. We were getting hungry by this time and visited the Mercado da Ribeira (opposite the Cais do Sodre) and had a look round then stopped for lunch in a cafe on the outside of the market. This was a plentiful plate of chicken with mushrooms and garlic for me and a steak and egg for my partner. Cheap and very filling. We then went back to the station and got a ticket and got on the boat to Cacilhas. At the other end I consulted my guide book and we looked for bus #101 which took us up the top of the hill to the statue. You can go up to near the top of the statue in a lift for which they charge an extortionate €4 each. However, the expresso coffee in the cafe outside was only 60 cents.We then got back on the bus and boat and went back to Cais do Sodre and got a new tram no. 15 to visit Belem and just had to sample the coffee and Portuguese custard tarts in the Antiga Confeitaria de Belem. Wonderful. We went back to town and debated returning to the hotel but instead went in search of the Elavador de Sta Justa which had eluded us before. On the way we also came upon the Elevador de Gloria (funicular) and had a quick trip up in that and down again. We eventually found the Santa Justa - a giant steel elevator built in 1902. It was just shutting for the night so we didn't have a chance for a trip up to the Baixa in it. Instead we made our weary way back towards the metro but came across a coffee shop called Browns which was in Rua Vittoria and got coffee, soup and a toasted ham and cheese sandwich there for €4.99. Just what we needed after having had a massive lunch.Up early again the next day for a trip to Cascais - train from the Cais do Sodre again. This takes about 40 minutes and goes past Estoril. It is a pretty little town but is quite touristy and expensive. We walked along the promenade stopping for sardines and sangria at a seafront cafe (the sardines were about €8 for a reasonable plateful and the sangria was €7 for a litre), then carried on to Estoril. There are some nice beaches in both Cascais and Estoril but the place is dominated by expensive hotels and restaurants obviously aimed at tourists.We got the train back from Estoril and got off at Alcantara walking from there to the Tower of Belem and the Monument to the Discoveries and briefly visiting the Monastery of Jeronimo before sinking gratefully into a seat at the Antiga Confeitaria again and ordering more coffee and tarts. Returning to the hotel we had a brief rest then decided to visit another cafe we had seen near Restauradores which was opposite a peepshow. My partner was reluctant as he thought the area looked seedy. A Licorista was very welcoming and had lovely plain food - grills, steaks etc in large quantities and reasonable prices and the wine came in carafes and was very drinkable. I think we slept very well that night.On our last day we visited the Gulbenkian Museum which is close to the Novotel Hotel (Praca Espanha metro). The museum of modern art is also there and the Zoological Gardens are not far away but we decided not to overdo things today. We went into town and thought of going to the Alfama again but the traffic had been cut off as it was the 50th anniversary of Cristos Rei and there was going to be a procession in the square which unfortunately we didn't have time to stay for, so we found somewhere for lunch and went back to the hotel to collect our bags and return to the airport.If we went again we would definitely stay closer to the town so you are nearer to everything. It was tiring having to go back and forth from the hotel, although the metro ride was only about 10 minutes it was about 10 minutes walk from the hotel to the metro as well and not a very pleasant one at that.I would definitely stick to the local cafes rather than going to the expensive tourist restaurants. The food is good quality and we found the Portuguese all very friendly and willing to help us with any problems and concerned that everything is alright.I would also advise anyone going that it is a big city and some of the places of interest are quite a long way out, such as the Tower of Belem, so you must be prepared to do a fair amount of walking. There are trams, buses and metros but the roads do get very busy and it can be quite difficult working out where some of the buses and trams go. A good street map and guide is essential."
50,“Lisbon - hidden gems and making the most of a fantastic city”,"We're a young couple who travel cheaply and enjoy city breaks where we always try to uncover hidden gems. This was our first stay in Lisbon and we loved it. Hotel was perfect (Vincci Baixa, see our review). Here, we'll just give a few tips about visiting Lisbon which we picked up during our trip.LOCATION: If you want to get around and see the sights, choose a hotel like the Vincci Baixa. Within 10 minutes of the main train station (Cais do Sodre), metro (Rossio and Cais do Sodre), two streets from the 28 tram, aerobus and cheaper 44 bus from airport stop just on the corner, all tram and bus stops nearby.AIRPORT: although it is not made very clear on the internet, there are actually several buses which run to and from the airport. They are very frequent in both directions, so we would recommend saving about £15 each way by getting the bus not a taxi. We got the number 44 which goes right through the city down towards Cais do Sodre station. Tickets are 1.40 Euros each (each way) and can be bought on the bus. This bus does essentially the same route as the Aerobus, but for half the price, although you may not get on with big suitcases.LANGUAGE: nobody speaks Portuguese other than the Portuguese, so if you simply learn a few basic words or phrases you will become the king or queen in Lisbon! Even if you just learn to say thank you, this makes an enormous difference and you'll get much better service in restaurants, shops etc. We even got some discounts for speaking a tiny bit of Portuguese! Do not annoy the Portguese by simply speaking Spanish - the languages may have some similarities but they are completely distinct.STUDENT DISCOUNT: a lot of places do student discounts but don't explicitly advertise it, so learn how to say ""I'm a student"" and it will pay off!!BEACHES: go to Cais do Sodre station and get the train to Cascais (or Estoril). It's only a half hour journey, costs about £3 each for a return. Lovely train ride by the estuary and you'll find beautiful, sandy little beaches just perfect for sunbathing/swimming. Cascais is a beautiful little place - nice to get out of the city. Trains are frequent and Cais do Sodre and Cascais are the termini, so you don't have to worry about where to get off.CAMERA OBSCURA AT THE CASTLE: when you visit the castle, there's a little kiosk on the upper level where you can book in to see a camera obscura demo every half hour. Basically, a a couple of lenses and a big mirror are used to project real-time views of the city onto a big curved bowl. It's just like seeing a photograph, but you can see boats, planes and tourists moving about! The staff give you a complete guide to every part of the city so this is a brilliant place to visit first where you will get ideas of interesting and little-known places to go, from someone who knows the city very well.BELEM: either get the train or the 15 tram outside the station (buy tram tickets from newspaper kiosk) to Belem. Most people know about the Discoverer's Monument which is well worth a visit, but we'd also recommend going inside the little castle/fort building as you can go right to the top and get good veiws across the estuary (Cristo statue, 25th April Bridge). Belem's hidden gem is the Modern Art Collection called ""Museu Coleccao Berardo"". This is across the main road and sort of behind the castle, towards the monastery. It's a modern building with a gorgeous rooftop garden where you can sit on the grass or benches beside trickling water and among large artworks. Try to spot little lizards basking on the walls. There's a cafe outside and toilets inside. It's free to go inside the building - we saw some brilliant modern art exhibits and some photography by local artists. Don't forget to visit Pasteis de Belem (the equivalent of Betty's Tearooms/Harrods Cafe) and get a couple of freshly baked pasteis de Belem with cute little sachets of cinnamon and icing sugar!NACOES: We had a brilliant cable car ride and visited the oceanarium. Do not miss the exploding volcano-shaped fountains - if you enjoy taking photos, this is a challenge as you never know when one will erupt!SUPERMARKETS: the local shops all sell water, but you can get it for pennies at a supermarket (and keep it cold in the mini-bar!!). There's a tiny supermarket in the Cais do Sodre station, or a huge supermarket at the Vasco da Gama shopping centre at Nacoes.We had a great time and we hope you enjoy your visit too!"
10,“Economy Car Rentals/International Car: BEWARE”,"We have just returned from a horrible experience with too many problems to list: car #1 was unsafe since it had NO tire tread on one tire and was very unaligned; since we received it at night, we didn't realize until it was too late...Never mind that it was a bashed up car body, with a broken tail light also! It took 2 days of NUMEROUS unanswered phone calls to Lisbon (the ""emergency number""!), Faro, and Sao Bras de Alportel to finally get a replacement car, delivered with 1/4 tank of gas; when we returned the car to the airport, they had made a contract mistake and weren't there to receive the car, although we were told by phone that it was OUR fault and that we were on the wrong day. Now, 6 days later and home in Canada, having received an apology today only for the airport portion of the fiasco, we still think the ""savings"" weren't worth it. Never again. It caused a huge amount of stress and lost vacation time.Economy Car Rental looks efficient, even promptly sends a follow-up review, but thus far, they haven't responded to my dismal review. We're not sure where the blame lies, so we blame them both. Economy contracted International, and International is disasterous."
50,“Apartment rua de Emenda”,"If you are thinking of visiting Lisbon, do so! It's a fantastic city and I could have spent a lot longer than the three days we had there.In terms of accommodation, we found an absolutely beautiful private apartment and I thoroughly recommend staying here, in lieu of a hotel.I visited lisbon with my parents and in-laws, and this apartment was quite simply the most beautifully furnished and appointed place we have ever stayed. Three enormous, private separate bedrooms each with its own bathroom and masses of living space and a gorgeous terrace. The price which (for four of us) was a quarter of what we would have paid in a hotel. I can't recommend this place and its location enough. This is the link to the apartment www.emenda10.comThe owners are a delight (and can advise on the best portuguese wines to try and where to listen to fado - being a winemaker and musician respectively) and the location is spot on, right in the heart of Lisbon's fantastic restaurants and nestled amidst its cobbled streets.The number 28 tram, which is a great idea to take if you want to see the city is very nearby, along with the train station Rossio which has trains running to Sintra every fifteen minutes (Sintra is absolutely worth a visit, and I wish we had been able to spend a night there to visit more of the castles and do the walks).The waterfront is approximately four minutes walk, and if you head upwards instead of down, there are beautiful piazzas and squares, an amazing archeological museum, along with boutiques and cafes to be found around every corner.Lisbon is an amazing city and its people are increidbly friendly and patient with tourists. Club de Fado was a spectacular evening and a real highlight of our trip - this is a professional fado club, so the quality of the musicians and singers was outstanding.Anyway, the main reason I wanted to write this is to talk about the apartment, because there is not slot to do a review amongst the hotels, as it's not listed on Trip Advisor."
50,“Using the Metro could not be more simple”,"The Lisbon metro system is simple and easy to use and a good way to get around.There are only 2 zones, I see no real reason why anyone would want to go outside of zone Coroa L, Senhor Roubado (yellow line) Pontinha (blue line) are on the borders between the two zones.The ticket machines only take coins, and there is an English button so all info in English.A single zone trip is 1.20 Euros, and after that, you can re charge the card by selecting the re charge option (last choice bottom right hand corner of screen) put the card into the slot then pay 80 cents to re charge. Each single trip will be 80 cents if using the same card.You need to 'tap' your card as you go through the barriers the same as Oyster, so tap in and tap out. If you are transiting two different lines, do not go through the barriers. for example, at Marquest de Pombal or Baixa-Chiado. Walk along the end of the platforms and take the stairs or lift to another platform. If you exit the barriers then you will need to re pay.Lines are colour coded, Blue, Yellow, Green and red and the final desination is shown on the front of the train. All lines are straight, so no circle line.The station platforms are huge and the trains are wide and the service is quick. If you are staying in a hotel or thinking of staying in a hotel outside of the main city area, then the Metro provides a cheap and quick access to the areas you need to go to. The Metro is an underground system no like Port which is over ground.I also caught the train from Belem to Cais do Sodre, agaain 1.20 Euros with ticket machine on the station. Trains run every 10-15 mins and it takes about 5 mins.The ticket machine on the station facing Cais do Sodre is in the sun and you cannot see a thing on the screen. I had to go over to the other platform by crossing the bridge to use the ticket machine. There are ticket inspectors so don’t board without a valid ticket.If you are going to Belem, I would advise taking the train. I walked there from the city centre and took me several hours and it was not a nice walk. The train station at Belem is about 15 mins walk to Belem tower."
50,"“Lisbon, old world beauty”","My first time visiting Lisbon and I truly adore it.The excitment and beauty of the old world buildings was inspiring. The food was absolutely delicious and contrary to popular believe very affordable. Shopping is amazing whether for clothing, shoes or home accessories, there is something to be found for everyone. The weather is pleasant and transportation easy to get around. The ride up to the Castelo do St. Jorge on the tram is a ride I will never forget, so much fun, but a word of caution a high traffic area for pick pocketers. Up at the top and looking down with a great vista. Lisbon has such flare and charm that it should be seen by everyone at least once in there lives. I found the museums and monestary to be a great way to spend the day, and the pasteries are a must!"
50,“Dreamland!!”,"Hi guys!!!We have been to Lisbon not knowing what to expect!! Portugal is not a rich country , with monthly incoms around 750 Euros.What we discovered was quite shocking .1.Airport was quite common , and they have a desk for turists that is used for arranging taxi drives in the city , for 10 Euros.It's cheap so we did it , but it was unnecessary!!!Taxis in Lisbon are very safe and actually cheaper than this.And all of them are Mercedes.With aircon.In the city it costs the same to go by taxi than by tram or bus.Incredible!!2.Food is very nice if you go for seafood,and the wines are the best in the world!Don't forget Port wine comes from Portugal.If you wanna eat fresh fish , on the grill , than you should go to Docas . Docas means docks , and it's a place near the water , on a warf , where you can find 20 restaurants . Everyone of them will present to you the fresh fish on a platter , so you could choose from the different types.Prices are quite decent , as an evening meal will cost you about 25 Euro/person/drinks included . And the docks are not cheap for portuguese standards.You could do well with 15 Euro as well.3.Culture is within easy reach , access to monuments is incredibly cheap , only a few euro/person . Go to Sao Jorge castle , on top of the hill . Use the tram , as you would certainly enjoy the narrow streets . It will be like an amusement park.It's also the best way to visit the old town , as you could take pictures or film. Visit the churches , they are quite wonderful and you will feel welcome , you don't even have to be a christian!!Also , don't miss Torre di Belem(tower of Belem) , Monasterio Dos Jeronimos (monastery of two Jeronims)4.Accomodation.Go for Avenida da Liberdade . There are plenty of hotels there , but spoil yourself By going to Sofitel . Best location in town , safest area , everything within easy reach , about 95 euro/night/double , without breakfast . Better order room service for breakfast , as a pastry basket , cofee , tea , jam , honey , will cost about 10 euro/2 people and breakfast downstairs 30 euro5.Rent-a-car.Very cheap . At least with Europcar.A Mitsubishi Colt diesel with aircon at about 25 Euro/day6.Shopping.Go to FREEPORT , the biggest outlet store in Europe , over Vasco da Gama bridge , the biggest in the world.Incredible prices , 90% off . All major stores and designers .End of january , begining of february in winter , end of july , begining of august in summer . At entrance , go to information desk and enroll free for a shopper card , which will entitle you to an additional discount of 10% in many stores!!Good luck!!!"
50,“My Fantastic City Camping Trip”,"A beautiful Mediterranean city, which is situated in touching distance from all the small coastal towns with pleasant beaches. Lisbon has all the nice white houses dripping off the hills and into the valley just about everywhere you look. Nice squares in the centre of town, small streets running through the houses and plenty to look at in a busy yet relaxed city. I loved the fresh bread and cheese you get before your meal, really tasty, fantasic food and big portions in the back street restaurants. A taxi ride away is the neighbourhood of Barrio Alto which was great for drinking in bars, peoples houses and in the lively streets meeting all the locals. Also theres one of the best churches i've ever seen, the interior will blow you away. Theres also the Dockers area down at the docks, food and drink which is more expensive, with a row of pubs and restaurants (football on TV as well) set by a huge double decker San Francisco styled bridge and if you walk under bridge and further down theres a great big monument worth looking at. I stayed at the wonderfully equipped Camping Lisboa which is in the centre but also covered in trees and a supermarket on site. Enjoy!"
30,“Lisbon - ideal for a quiet trip”,"We just return from Lisbon, one week agoIt was a few day holliday.For me was an ideal place to relax and rest. On October 5th was the Portugal National Day. Their festivities were quite low profile. No excentric events, nothing fastuos. Just few events at the Presidencial palace from Belem.I advise you to go and see the Belem Tower. The view is very. Also go and see San George Fortress and the Elevator.Be awere that in Lisbon all streets are up and down, like in San Francisco.In Lisbon there is a very nice Ocenarium that has a large tank with different species of fish. There are animals from allmost all continents starting with fish and ending with pinguins.You can see attached pictures taken by me.Average temperature in October is around 20 degrees Celsius. Ocassionally it can light rain showers."
50,“Lisbon is a great vacation destination”,"Lisbon is a great destination if you like impressive museums, a friendly culture and great views. The city reminds me so much of San Francisco. That being said, you will not survive long without comfortable walking shoes.The food is great--especially the seafood. The prices are much better here than any European city I've traveled to on vacation.The museums, palaces and churches are so much eye candy. Don't miss Sintra and Quelez as a day trip. They do not disappoint.We spent a week and still didn't see everything the city and its' surrounding have to offer. I hope to go back one day."
50,“My favorite and the most gorgeous place in Europe”,"This place had a lot of history, the most beautiful scenery and some of the most beautiful architecture I've seen (Dubai being the best)."
40,“Lisbon in Summer”,"We visited Lisboa in the summer of 08.our stay was brief. a starter or perhaps a taster session.Stayed at the Turim Europa hotel Lisbon, a clean friendly **** hotel which serves a good breakfast but fresh fruit or juice is perhaps not cost effective to the hotel.The aeroport bus stop was about a four minutes walk from the hotel so were the buses to Belem or to city centre.The walks through the steep back alleys shows the true nature of this beautiful city.The cantinas/cafes which the locals frequent,the colourful bricks which adorn the front or the back walls of the houses. and the best the friendly people.cuisine,especially if you love sea food which is great .if you happen to be a vegetarian your choices are limited .public transport is a cheap and efficient to go longer distances within the city even to the airport.Sintra, Lisbon coast and Fado are a must."
50,“Sightseeing in Lisbon”,"If you are coming to Lisbon just for a weekend and you want to see all the attractions offered by this extraordinary city, it will be a hard work. But there's an easy way how to discover the most picturesque parts and monuments without destroying your shoes and getting lost. Take one of the yellow Hop on Hop off tours on open-top double decker bus leaving from Praça do Comércio. With the ticket valid for 24h on the tours and also on the public transport network (buses, trams, funiculars), you will have the opportunity to enjoy and admire the best places of the City. You can interrupt the journey and continue anytime you want to.If you want to experience a ride on a historical red tram in a comfortable way rather than in often crowded legendary tram 28, choose between two tours leaving as well from Praça do Comércio. You will pass the steep and narrow streets of Lisbon while listening to the commentary and the melancholic melody of fado.Be sure that during your short stay you will fell in love with this city and sooner or later, you will be back. Believe me, I know what I am talking about :-)"
20,“Not returning...........”,"Just returned from a 5 day trip to Lisbon. Not one of my favourite European capitals as there seems nothing historic to 'latch on to'. We did find the city extremely clean and the Portugese were some of the friendliest we've come across in Europe.We found the city itself not very inspiring, although some of the architecture, even the modern buildings, is quite superb. Visits out to Cascais, Estoril and Sintra were a must to get some variety into our stay.We had been told that Portugese food was superb; perhaps we were unlucky as our meal choices turned out to be less than average.Pickpocketing is rife and tourists are targeted particularly on the metro. We witnessed it and reported it to the police, who did nothing. The locals seem all too willing to accept it, and as long as they act like this their city will always be on the fringes of the top European tourist destinations.In summary, 5 days was enough and we won't be returning."
40,“great location”,"This hotel is in a good central location. Virtually outside the hotel is a Metro if you want to go further afield but its not far to walk into the centre. The staff were efficient and always very pleasant. We stayed here twice and on both occasion the bedroom was huge. It is tastefully decorated, comfortable and clean. The breakfast is very good, lots of choice and all of a high standard. I would definately stay here again and would recommend it to others."
40,“Weekend break”,"After stopping at Lisbon on a Med cruise just had to go back asap. Fantastic for a long weekend flying from Liverpool Thursday, back Monday and costing less than 2 nights in London. On arrival hop on aerobus into Lisbon for 3 euros. Stayed at the Dom Carlos Hotel just off Avenida de Liberdade. Excellent, clean, welcoming hotel 15 minutes walk from Baixa. Open top tour buses and trams (hop on hop off) by weekend or daily ticket from the main square which also gets you back to the airport. So many places to see and such a relaxed atmosphere compared to the likes of Barcelona / Rome."
50,“A Great City”,"LISBOAWe hopped in a taxi and for about 8 Euros were inCasa Castelo on Costa da Castelo no. 54 (email:c-c-castelo.com; 80 Euros per night). Our roomwas on the top floor, the 5th floor, no elevator ofcourse, but it was gorgeous. It looked like ithad recently been completely done over, a rooftopgarret, all wood and tile. If you go to Lisbonget this room. The two large windows looked outover all of Lisbon and the river. A nice breakfastevery morning was included.The Casa Castelo is located in the Alfamadistrict, the oldest section of Lisbon and rightbeneath, and I mean right beneath the Castelo de SaoJorge, a huge castle that sits on the highest pointin Lisbon.Our first afternoon we hiked down the narrowstreets and stairways of the Alfama to the olddowntown of Lisbon. The downtown area is a grid ofstreets with one pedestrian and the next for cars andtrolleys. The streets are lined with shops andrestaurants that sprawl out onto the walkablestreets. At either end of the grid of streets a largeplaza awaits, again with restaurants that sprawlout on the plazas. People crowd the restaurants,having a leisurely lunch or a drink.Late in the afternoon we boarded the #12 trolleyheading back up the narrow streets of the Aflama,with the destination being the Castelo de SaoJorge castle. We paid our 5 Euro entrance fee andin we went. The Castelo provides magnificent viewsof Lisbon, although I have to say no moremagnificent than the view from our room. We walkedalong the top of the castle walls giving you a 360degree view of Lisbon.While we were there a lone guitar player strummedin the courtyard â€“ the sweet sound of hisplaying could be heard throughout the castle. Donâ€™tmiss the castle.The streets of the Alfama wind up and down, leftand right, it is said that the streets andalleyways were laid out this way to make it asdifficult as possible for invaders to reach the castle.The hilly, narrow streets and alleyways areinterspersed with shops, restaurants, bars, smallgrocery stores, apartments, condos an of coursehanging laundry. Everyone in Portugal hangs theirlaundry out their windows.On Tuesday morning we hit the Feira da Ladra fleamarket in the Aflama. This flea market has beenaround, in one form or another, since 1185AD â€“1185AD, think about that, thatâ€™s longer thanmost of us have been alive. This flea market is thereal deal, it had some of everything. There musthave been at least 300 dealers, we bought fourof the little coffee spoons, an espresso cup andsaucer and Holly bought a shirt for 7 Euros whichshe haggled down from 15 Euros. You have tohaggle at the flea market.In the afternoon we took the #28 trolley thatgoes from one end of old Lisbon to the other. It waspretty difficult to figure going out because wehad to get off twice and repay 1,35 Euro but wereable to ride all the way back for just one fare.The #28 trolley is written up in all the tourbooks and it was all right but half the time youcouldnâ€™t see anything because it was so crowdedwith people standing. I suggest going first thingin the morning.We did stop at the CafÃ© Brasilia and oldrestaurant and bar, once the haunt of poets andintellectuals, my wife Holly and I just seemed to bedrawn there without even knowing beforehand about thepoets and intellectuals. We had our first tasteof Ginjinha, a cherry tasting liqueur onlyavailable in Lisbon.On Tuesday night we went to hear Fado, aPortuguese national pastime. All the Fado restaurantsrequire dinner, itâ€™s like a dinner show. Therestaurant we went to featured 3 different singers,all very good, but Fado seems intensely sad eventhough we had no idea what they were singing about.Wednesday we took the da Gloria accession orfunicular to an upper part of Lisbon and walked backdown to the center. We stopped at an old usedbookstore, the oldest beer hall in Lisbon and wentinto a very old convent that had been turned intoa museum after it was about 75 percent destroyedin the 1755 earthquake.Wednesday evening before dinner we stopped at theoutdoor, to go Ginjinha booth. Holly, who lovescherry cough syrup, had two shots. We ate at anItalian restaurant, outdoors, of course.On Thursday we headed home to see our sorelymissed cats and dog."
20,“City of many thieves”,"Be very careful when boarding buses or on the Metro. We arrived in Lisbon morning of 19th April 2008. Checked in to Hotel , asked advice on seeing the city - use the buses - so easy & convenient. Took 36 bus from nearby bus stop into Praca do Comercio. Toured the old city on the Tourist Tram and then ate in a pavement cafe afterwards visitng many shops then 17:15 hours time to return to our hotel to get ready for dinner. Found bus stop in Praca do Comercio for the No 36 bus. Distressingly €400 cash from my handbag was robbed whilst I was paying our fares to the driver as I boarded. I am 71 years of age and use a walking stick - as I climbed aboard I was roughly pushed and almost knocked off balance whilst I was trying to pay our fares. this was by 2 large young white men who in the crush ripped my bag open and took everything I had.As soon as I discovered this loss/theft I went immediately to the SPECIAL Police Station which they have in Lisbon, dealing only with thefts from Tourists and foreigners. The queue there was massive as so many tourists/foreigners had ALL been robbed that Saturday! Money, Passports, Credit Cards stolen nearly all of us whilst boarding a bus or on the Metro – SO I queued 4+ hours & was dealt with by the Police officer around 22:30 hours."
10,“never again”,"I went to lisbon with my boyfriend last november for 2 days,its a scary city, i saw poor people begging foir money, very ill looking people every where.NO nice restarants, (we ended up eating at Hardrock cafe)No nice modern barsthe shops were typical, h&m, zara ect nothing different.found posh shops such as gucci ,prada and expected to find some nice bars around them but there were were non and the posh shops were on a very busy road,My boyfriend kept getting asked to buy weed.SCRUFFYOne night on our way bak to the hotel we got followed by a man, luckly we managed to escape him.GOOD POINTS,SOME NICE BUILDINGSThe COACH BACK TO THE ALGARVE, :)visit rome or paris instead"
20,“Beautiful City with a serious secret”,We stayed in Lisbon for 5 days. Feb 2008. It is a beautiful city. If you like sea food this is the place to be. The weather was in the 60's and sunny. We toured the nearby Sintra which is a must to see. However there is a secret that the Hotels and Tourist Centers do not tell you. Pick Pockets. Be very careful when touring the Centro and other tourist areas of the city. Especially the trains and buses. There are lots of pick pockets everywhere. They operate in numbers of four or more. If the train or bus arrives full wait for the next one. They get you in crowded buses and trains where they can lean against you. Keep your valuables and money hidden. Get a lock for the Hotel safe and leave your valuables there. Separate your cash etc. Be aware who is around you at all times. No exceptions. The Police and the locals do not seem to be concerned with this. One incident can ruin you complete vacation. I hope this is posted as it is very important information for tourist to know.
40,“Good and 'not as good'”,"Just back from a long weekend in Lisbon and summary of 'Good' and 'Not so Goods' are:Good: Pestana Palace Hotel, friendliness of people(hotel staff, restaurant staff...even taxis!!). Quality of food and wine..we even discovered a taste for 'white port' that we didn't know we had!!. Belem is beautiful for a long walk. Some beautiful sights on our 'hop on, hop off' Carris 'blue tour'. Enjoyed dinner in Fado restaurant in Bairro Alto followed by a great time in 'Tasca Cubana' nearby - a really lively Cuban bar serving great cocktails.Not so Good: Partner very disappointed with shopping, especially ladies fashions. Didn't feel particularly safe in Bairro Alto as night went on, some young guys offering hash etc. Some of architecture,e specially some of the bridges, walkways etc. seem to have been built in a very 'in your face' way, which spoils some of the beautiful buildings and sights. Also tons and tons of graffiti, even worse than Rome.....and that's bad!!Nevertheless, a great city for a weekend and after all......nothing's perfect!!"
40,“wonderful weekend”,wanting a change of scene decided upon a weekend in lisbon a place only visited for a day some years ago. chose the sofotel hotel as it is a chain we find really good and central. as always lived up to expectations. Lisbon is a small very very hilly city' the people are helpful and charming.public transport cheap and efficient and a million cafes and restaurents to eat out at. mostly family owned and all the better for it. as a bonus the weather was warm and sunny
30,“Beware of Pickpockets”,Just had a week in Lisbon. Beware of the pickpockets on trams and buses. We nearly got caught but luckily stopped the thief in time. Other passengers on the bus did not seem bothered. Also we were plagued by beggers and street people selling sunglasses etc. Even when sitting outside cafes we were accosted. Cafe owners and waiters did nothing to move these people on. Nor did the police.Even though Lisbon is a nice city with fine buildings and great eating houses. The people did not seem friendly made London look good.I would reccomend it but not a week only a long weekend at best.
50,“A city where time has stopped”,"The Stone streets, those fountains in each square, some hundreds of walkers across the city and those old buildings made me feel like I was in a beautiful postcard. The more I walk the more I realize that time doesn't matter here. Lisbon is a quite city, distant from the traffic jams, the noise and the consumer desires of Barcelona and other European cities.The lisboa citiziens wonder for their civic-mindedness. No one seems to be disgusted or angry. No one shouts aloud on the street. Whereas everyone respond, act and walk calmly. They are really obliging. Lisbon seems a social paradise."
50,“What a great city”,"As an option to the very pricey shore excursions offered by the cruise lines, we chose to explore Lispon on our own. The ships dock far from downtown so the shuttle provided was great.We started our walking (good shoes required) tour from the grand plaza thru the city gates along the pedestrian only streets.We rode the ""Elevator"" built in the 1800's up several levels for a spectacular view of downdown.Every Portugeese or Spanish city seems to have a Plaza de Espania and Lisbon is no exception. From here you can take several different bus tours depending upon what interestes you. All are a good value. We continued our walk to the Furnicular an inclined train that operates as a regular part of the city's transport system. The track runs on an incline of about 30/40 degrees but the cars are built so the wheels are on the incline but the floor is level. Neat ride for only a few euros.After exiting several street levels above where started we proceeded to, as my wife calls it, explore or in reality we were SO lost. That was when we found out just how great the people of Lisbon really were.We asked at a resturant that was not even open yet for directions back and where the nearest public restrooms were. Not only did he let us in to use the facillities, but he painstakingly drew us a map with several options, including walking all the way, taking the bus (he said to be very carefull if we chose that one) or calling us a cab. We chose to walk through the narrow streets where Lisbon really lives. What a great adventure.We made it back and took a bus tour of the city ending at the fort in the harbor that said farewell to Columbus as he sailed for America. The other monument to Lisbon as the great departure spot for exploration was also beautiful.Prior to our return to our ship we had lunch in a local resturant and tried a local fish stew that was excellent. Unlike in the US the rolls, butter and crackers came with a price. They were all on the bill as extras. Live and learn.Taxi back to the ship to set sail again. Lisbon will remain one of our fondest memories of this cruise."
50,“One of the best and most beautiful cities in the world”,"It has always baffled me that reviews of the same hotel can be so different - that scattered amongst the rave reviews about the friendly staff, clean rooms and charming ambience of a highly rated hotel, one always finds one or two reviewers who hated everything about the place, who found the staff abrasive and the rooms dingy, and who complain about the noise, the rudeness, the mould in the bathrooms, and about how this hotel was undoubtedly the worst experience of their lives.I have also been lucky enough to find that when I have selected accomodation on the basis of the 90% good reviews (and ignored the bad reviews), the good reviewers have always been right. It makes me wonder whether some travellers are so rude that the staff who treated me like an honoured guest justifiably retreat into deliberate incompetence, whether some travellers allow one tiny mistake on check-in to colour their entire experience and spend the rest of their stay looking for things to complain about, or whether some people cannot accept that something that does not meet their preconceived notions might in fact be enjoyable. Perhaps it is a combination of all three.Regardless, I have the same reaction when I read some of the reviews of Lisbon below - people who found the whole city dirty, the entire citizenry rude, and who would never go back to such an awful place. Those views are so discordant with my own experiences of Lisbon that I wonder if we visited the same city.In my experience, Lisbon is a breathtakingly beautiful city - it is old and shabby (but perhaps 3000 years of history and half a century of dictatorship will do that) but the shabbiness adds immeasurably to its charm.It has tiny winding streets, magnificent buildings and hundreds of tiny shops (filled with clothes by young designers, tourist tat and the best wine in Europe). In the Bairro Alto, the tiny bars are so pressed up against each other that everyone drinks in the street, and the tiny streets are filled with people chatting and laughing and moving from bar to bar.It has tiny restaurants serving magnificent food (if only you will avoid any restaurant with a British flag on the menu). We had every kind of food experience from chorizo grilled on a tiny fire on the bar of a wine bar the size of a refrigerator to magnificent Michelin starred cuisine.Most of all, the people of Lisbon are truly wonderful - friendly, charming, always willing to talk or to help out a lost traveller. Most speak at least a little English, and seem inordinately pleased when a tourist tries to speak Portuguese.I fell in love with Lisbon on the second day of my first visit... and I am going back for my third visit later this year.Yes, it is true that the restaurants put olives and cheese on the table and have the apparent gall to charge you for them if you eat them, but serving food at the beginning of the meal is part of Portuguese culture and they usually cost all of 1 or two Euros each.Yes, it is true that there are pickpockets and beggars and drug dealers - but last time I checked New York and London and Sydney had those too, and I have never felt unsafe taking the usual precautions that sensible people take anywhere in the world.And anyone who thinks that Portugal is not filled with stunningly beautiful women and handsome men needs their eyes examined.Lisbon is where 3000 years of history meet the cutting edge of modern Europre - it is a city made most wonderful by its beautiful people. It must be experienced with an open mind, and an open heart.It is a city which is for the 90% who want to experience and enjoy things as they are, not the 10% who want to find fault when things are not prepackaged into safe bite sized Marriot McDonald nuggets.Just go."
40,“Mundial Hotel”,"First visit to Lisbon, Mundial Hotel provided excellent central location, sight seeing and shopping, for walking, trams, buses and Metro. Good room size, clean, comprehensive breakfast [self service style], helpful staff. Lisbon restaurants provide a large quality mix from ""don't go again"" to ""excellent"", be savvy and look where the locals eat!Sintra is a charming day out, easy by public transport.Art museums abound.Walking is the ideal way to discover the unexpected. Recommend LISBON WALKER."
30,“Our Trip to Lisbon”,"We have recently retured from a city break in Lisbon. We stayed at the Radisson sas about 10 mins from the city centre. the hotel was very clean, rooms were a good size and cleaned daily. We were happy with hotel and its location - that is if you dont mind taking the metro -The hotel staff were not very friendly. we stayed there for 5 nights and not once did any member of staff greet us or ask us how was our stay? did we need anything? It was very impersonal. The breakfast was really good, lots of fresh fruit, croissants, plenty of choice. there is a metro station about 3-4 mins walk away which was great and easy to use for getting around the city. A 1 day ticket costs €4 and this covers you for use on the metro, bus and tram. The metro is very clean and we never had to wait for more than 10 mins at any of the stations for one to come along. The trams are very quaint! a must - do when you are there!the best way to get a sense of where you are is to do a sight seeing tour in an open top bus, here you get to 'hop on' and 'hop off' at the various sights around the city. There are loads of different squares with lots of monuments, fountains and statues. These are very pretty, and its lovely to just stroll around and look at them all. All the streets are cobbles and very pretty (just dont wear high heels!!) The Castle overlooking the city has great views from it and looks really nice at night time all lit up. Belem is also on the tour, definetley worth a stop off, its very impressive! And there is a castle beside it as well - nice for a look! There are plenty of cafes and places to eat there as well.Over all the city is worth a visit if you like museums and sight seeing, there are loadddssss of museums! The oceanarium is ok - the kids will enjoy it but there is not a lot happening there besides. There is a big shopping mall across the road from it.Eating out is hit and miss - on our first night there we were completley shafted (the waiter was rubbing his hands after we left!) but you live and learn! The restaurant was A ARTE DE COMIDA in Baixa not far from rua augusta, just be careful, we ended up being charged for olives, butter, etc. and when you dont speak the lingo its a bit harder to plea your case! we ended up paying over double what we paid anywhere else for the rest of the week. Bairro alto is supposed to be the place to go for all the restaurants etc. We ate there a couple of nights and it was ok, I'm not fussy about food but compared to the Irish food, well theres no comparison! - But the wine was good! any of the house wines we had were all fine, cheap and cheerful! The streets in Bairo Alto are very dark, almost seedy, I personally felt very unnerved walking around them, there is lots of grafitti everywhere which can be said for a lot of the city. Be careful of guys coming up to you on the street offering you hash and cocaine - I lost count of the amount of times we were approached , something i was not comfortable with at all, you had to just ignore them because even saying no didnt seem to stop them pestering you.Overall Lisbon has a lot to see and do if you are prepared to walk - and walk you will!! It is steps, hills, steps and more hills! It has areas that are very pretty and like all cities areas that are rough and poor. its not somewhere that i would say 'I will go back' because i dont think i will. I didnt feel very safe at times and was always feeling alert to pick pockets etc as we were warned about them by several places we had visited.Also the elevador and the funicular are also a must when in Lisbon - just something the tourists have to do!!"
30,“New Year in Lisbon”,"My wife and I and four friends have just returned from New Year in Lisbon. We booked the flight and hotel - VIP Zurich, with Easyjet. We had not been to Lisbon before so we took 2 taxis from the airport to the hotel. The meter on our taxi showed 6.50 euros and the driver was delighted with the 10 euros I gave him. Our 3 friends in the other taxi did not see the meter and were charged 17.50 euros. Incidentally , both taxis charged us 6.75 euros for the return journey.We went into Lisbon on the Metro and found this to be a very good service but beware when busy. On one crowded journey I had my way off blocked by a man wearing very dark glasses. As I squeezed passed him to get off I felt a hand on my back pocket. I managed to grab my wallet off him. He got off the train and quickly dissappeared in the crowd. We were very careful with our belongings after that near miss.We then went to a restaurant and were made very welcome by the waiters. We were given apperitifs , bread , nibbles and water whilst we decided on our order. We had 6 main courses , 2 desserts and a number of drinks. We were expecting a bill of 150 euros . We were shocked when the bill was in excess of 200 euros. The items that we hadn't asked for were expensive.The next 2 nights we went to a Chinese near to the Hard Rock Cafe and had excellent value for less than 100 euros.The city tour buses are well worth the 14 euros for 24 hours and give you an opportunity to see places you can go back to.The VIP Zurich was clean and comfortable and provided an excellent breakfast. It has easy access to the airport, metro , rail and bus services.The bar closes at 1 a.m. and there are no facilities for residents. This would not normally be a problem but was a disappointment after a nearly tea-total New Year.It is not for you if you are a light sleeper due to its proximity to the railway station.The fireworks in Lisbonat New Year were excellent.The tramps and beggars around Lisbon were a bit intimidating at times.The weather was excellent on the 30th. & 31st. Dec. but we had heavy rain on the 1st. There is not much shelter in Lisbon and the drains are ineffective. Take an umbrella and sensible footwear.In summary, we had a good couple of days , we can now strike Lisbon off our list of places to visit and we will not be rushing back."
20,“comment”,"Crossing from gorgeous Spain, this is a declining nation...Poor service and indifferent."
40,“Back from Lisbon”,"Just back from a 5day stay in Lisbon.Absolutely brilliant.The weather was amazing well in to the 70s each day.If you go ,purchase a LISBOA CARD at the Tourist Info at the airport,for as many days as you wish,we took one for 4 days,around £20 each,great value. You can travel the Metro,the Bus system, the trains,the trams ,the lifts and much more,you get free admission to lots ofattractions ,and discount on many more. Dont sign and date it until you are ready to use for a full day,your time starts when you sign,we had 72 hours.We took the aero bus in to centrel Lisbon on arrival 6 euros, and started the card the next day,with a tube and train trip to Cascais and Estoril. Next day to Sintra,amazing the Park and Palace of Pena is unforgetable and theQuinta da Regaleira is a wonderland (by the way dont forget to take the booklet with you for the vouchers,we forgot ours,the card is not enough to claim the discount admission) no matter it was still worth it.Take care with the Pickpockets, in particular in the queus(sorry I cant spell that) I fell foulf of a couple ,not personaly but the chap in front of me in the Kew (told you I cant spell that) I potted the couple who had pushed in front of me, Lifting the wallet of the oldre guy in front (Im 64) I alerted him and he retained his wallet,much to the disgust of the wo theives, she gave me a mouthfull of portuguese abuse and promptly hit me in the face her male assistant then kicked ,me I told him not to do that ,and asked him to leave the area immediatly , more or less. They scurred away shoutinig profanities at me, no matter.I loved Lisbon ,I loved the location of the MONDIAL HOTEL where we stayed. Have a Cappoccino at the little Snack bar in the Park across the road,lovely owner ,lovely Coffee.Go for it Go for LISBON.TOP CHEFwoodie"
10,"“Hop On, Hop Off buses - Red CityLine”","The red line (ie City Line, operated by Gray Line) is the one which we took - I would give this a negative recommendation.Problems:1) no taped commentary - the female guides announce the commentary briefly in a couple of sentences (in English, Portuguese, and Spanish?) at each stop.2) such commentary is through speakers - not through earphones - therefore the commentary is often not clearly audible3) on Friday through Sunday, it is advertised that the frequency of buses is every 20 minutes (year round) - practically, the frequency by the female guides was advertised as every 30 minutes, but actually the buses came every 40-60 minutes.4) no signs (for this bus lines) at the 18 stops - so if one does not know where the bus stops, one can be in trouble. We often hopped off at given stop, and then walked to the next stop - however, the brochure does not tell the customer where the bus stops and picks up/drops off at each stop.(of note - this bus line does not give discount coupons to attractions/restaurants - I do not know if the yellow hop on, hop off line does so, or not? - in Barcelona, one does get a full coupon booklet as one buys the tickets for that hop on, hop off bus).I would recommend the yellow line (I believe it is operated by the municipal transit company). It is what you would want in a hop on, hop off line - including frequent buses, and taped commentary which one can hear through earphones, in several languages."
30,“Another mediterranean city.”,"Lisbon is a typical Mediterranean city albeit the capital of Portugal. It's a pretty small city and it reminded me of Greece, which is not a good thing. I found it polluted, packed with too many cars per capita, long queues to get in clubs, small underground system that doesn't reach the whole city and filled with the general bonhomie found in the Mediterranean.I thought the best thing about Lisbon was... Sintra! And that's a few kilometers out of town but well worth it.Lisbon was pretty tough on my feet but it was worth it. The tram is a very romantic thing but it can get on your nerves what with it's never arriving, being packed, taking ages to get to where you want to go. Just don't take it if you're in a hurry.I found people generally polite and helpful. And in general speaking English although I tried to use Portuguese where possible."
40,“Lovely City”,"Excellent few days.Gulbenkian Museum a must see.Remember Museums in Portugal are often closed on MondaysThe Aquaduct is also a good visit at various locations, including the pumping station, good visits for those interested in water systemsStayed near Parque underground station, really useful location for acessing all areas."
40,“Must do in Lisbon”,In Lisbon they have this old african music mixed with the new. You can hear it in all over Lisbon in these little restaurants while you have dinner. It is absolutely fabulous. The music is great and their voices are even better!
50,“Lisbon Zoo”,"Had a fab city break staying at the 4* Marriott. Had picked up from other reviewers that the city is hilly - bit of an understatement!! Not only is it hilly - but the hills are extremely steep. It helps to be fit otherwise you will miss lots. There is a very good transport system though from the open topped bus tours, the trams, underground and funiculars. We had a 2 day carristur ticket which cost 30 euros each but covered 48 hours of public transport use (not underground which were cheap anhyow) and the best way to get your bearings in the city. Although we stayed 5 days - we could have stayed much longer as there were lots of places on the ""to do"" list that were missed off."
20,“Not the best place for a traveller”,"I did not realize until I got to Lisbon that they certainly do not like tourists over there. Especially a lone woman traveller. I was told that it is just not done for a woman to travel alone in Portugal. I guess that explains why I was met with rudeness many places. Apparently people think if you're travelling alone, you are either a prostitute or crazy, and either way, they want nothing to do with you, no matter how well you behave. Not a happy people mostly. Next time I'll find some place different - never run into this before."
50,"“Lisbon, The magical city”","If you are thinking twice before going to Lisbon don't! I have lived there for 3 years while studying at university and it is a beautiful town.Not only you have the sea but you have the mountains as well. Some places i recomend is Lisbon are: Castelo de S. Jorge, you have a magnificient view of the city. Belen area, you can find here a couple of monuments from the 15a.c all surrounded by the river and parks.While in Lisbon travel a bit by train to Sintra or Cascais both places really nice, but i have to say that Sintra is more romantic and magical... go there and you will understand me.If you want to have a good time at night go to ""Oriente"" where you can find a big shopping center wih good restaurants and you can walk by the river and end up in a good pub or disco there are very good places to have fun.Also if you want to go the beach is only 20 minutes away from lisbon: Costa da Caparica (20m), Setubal- Troia or figueirinha (1hour).Hope you enjoy my review and that you will go and visit such a nice city ."
20,“Weekend trip to Lisbon - First time visit - Younge partiers”,"I wanted to write this review for potential visitors to Lisbon, Portugal. Specifically, I write this for young, fun, and party-going people seeking a place to travel to in Europe for a weekend.Lisbon is NOT where you want to travel to for the nightlife or social scene. The people in Lisbon are generally unattractive (guys and girls) and unfriendly. Once they find out that you are American (or any tourist for that matter) expect to be ripped off at clubs, restaurants, bars, etc. They will try to charge you a cover-charge which they do not collect from any local party-goers. Once you are tagged as foreign, you will be ripped off and treated very poorly.Having never been to Portugal, we inquired about the best places for partying. We were recommended by he hotel concierge to go to ""DOCAS"". So, the first night we went to Docas and had a very nice seafood meal at a restaurant called Peix Deux. After dinner, we ventured to the local bars/clubs and were truly disappointed.DO NOT PARTY IN DOCAS .. ESPECIALLY AVOID:1. Hawaii (low-class garbage club with meathead bouncers)2. Cosmos (same deal as above)These 2 bars were horrible and treated my whole group like garbage. They charged us cover charge while all the locals walked right past us. The bouncer threatened violence when I asked him why we were preferentially being charged to enter his club.Second night was slightly better. We went to an area called ""BAIRRO ALTO"" which was full of people. Had a miserable dinner at some restaurant with traditional Portugese dancing. The people on the streets were thugs and trash. Every corner there is somebody offering to sell you hash, cocaine, and marijuana. This place (often hailed as being funky and trendy) is just a few steets full of low-class drunks. Not fun at all.At about 4AM we ventured to the 'famous' Lux nightclub. This place was relatively better than the other places we went to in Portugal. However, it is nothing spectacular when compared to any hot nightclub in London or NYC. The club does not offer table or bottle service and the line-ups at the bar for drinks are ridiculous. The doormen are unfriendly (surprise!) and they also try to rip you off with a cover-charge once they discover you are a tourist! We were told that telling them you are a student at the American university in Lisbon helps.. I don't know. My advice is just not to bother going at all! lol It's really not worth the hassle.The only nice thing about my visit to Portugal was my day excursion to ""SINTRAS"", an historic town with beautiful castles and a palace. I think Portugal is worth visiting for it's castles, beaches (only in summer), and coastal towns. Lisbon is NOT a city for young, fun people to go for a weekend. You'll have time to visit castles and tour small coastal towns when you're old and married. If you go to Sintras, make sure you unwind at ""BINHOTECA"", a nice wine bar. My group had some beautiful Portugese wine, cheese, and sausage. Don't forget to try Port wine! This winebar is located on one of the narrow little streets in the town.Lisbon is not very safe from what I could see. On my train ride home from Sintras, a poor man was confronted by 3 youths who then smashed a full wine bottle over his head for no reason. There are drug dealers at almost every corner. There are few police protecting the party areas. As a tourist, I did not feel safe, especially when a bouncer at COSMOS nightclub (in Docas area) threatened my life. He pointed to his badge and gave me the impression that he was allowed to do as he pleased without any worry of police reprimand.Overall, Lisbon was not a good selection for a weekend visit. I will not return to Lisbon until I have exhausted all of my other global location curiosities. The locals are nasty and rude, not to mention unattractive. I think that's why we find most Portugese people have left the country.Take my advice and save yourself the time and money. AVOID LISBON! (at least do not go there for the nightlife! - go for the castles and coastal towns when you're old and grey)"
50,“Christmas Day in Lisbon”,"My husband and I (both in our early 60's) went to Lisbon for 36 hours, arriving the evening of Christmas Eve and leaving early on Boxing Day. It was a wonderful experience should anyone else think of doing this in the future. We stayed at Corinthia hotel just a little way from Placa Espangnol, which was first class.Christmas Eve was quiet in the town until near to midnight when everyone started to go to Church, but the public transport was running until 1 am and there were one or two small restuarants open near the centre.Christmas Day was very pleasant, in the morning we went to the Castle and were able to wander around the grounds with a number of other tourists and to see over the city. This is a good way to get an overview of the places especially if you have only a short visit.Christmas Day evening the city came alive with people on foot and in cars all coming to the centre to see the lights. These are indeed a sight not to be missed, a massive Christmas ""tree"" in the main square near to the ferry terminal, some 75 metres tall with various light patterns. The square is filled with families listening to the carols and Christmas songs. There are chestnut sellers and suchlike too. Leading back into town there are a number of roads, again filled with coloured lights, the main pedestrian shopping street is lined with 3 metres tall ""angels"" supporting starry canopies. Many restaurants were open that evening and several of the hotels were offering a splendid buffet menu for about 40-45 Euro. Again on Christmas Day all the public transport was running and at 70 cents per journey the Metro was astoundingly good value.At the airport the front of the building was covered with an illuminated mural of Santa Claus head and shoulders which must have been 30 or so metres high.We were greatly impressed by the City, it's Christmas decorations, the cleanliness of the streets and the family attitude."
50,“lovely lisbon”,"My husband and two children aged 7 and 16 visited portugal this summer (aug) we stayed for 4 nights and had a wonderful timewe stayed at the raddison hotel in lisbon, the hotel is in a excellent location and room and hotel were luxurious and spacious and clean, we had breakfast at hotel and light snacks which were at all times fresh and full of taste, food and drinks at hotel and reasonably priced.while there we shopped in the restadores which has plenty of shops ranging from designer to value for money. plenty of restaurants and places to have a drink.while there we visited the jardin zoolalogical which was a fun day out we watched dolphins perform a spectacular show and viewed various animals.we also went bull fighting, not for the faint hearted I thought it was a experience i had never had however i found it quite cruel.while there we went to watch a football match at local stadiium.we went to a few clubs which played mainly brazillian , african, music tasteful surroundings.weather was great , all this was only a 2hr flight away, we all enjoyed ourselves very much, food was gorgeous lots of grill meat and fish and seafood and fresh salad and lovely sangre la.Getting around is easy, cabs are cheap and trams and trains all easy to use and quick.great for famillies, couples,anyone really.all in all a fantastic family break, do"
50,“Reflections on Lisboa”,"LISBON STORIESChristmas 2004 - New Year’s 2005[Caveat Lector: These are musings from my scrambled notes of the 20 day vacation in Lisbon… we agree that it is one of the top three holidays we’re experienced. I hope you enjoy some or all of the tales.]‘Twas on December 19th when 3:30 AM came earlier than usual… really, it did. However the alarm still rang, was cursed loudly, but eventually was obeyed. After a quick waking shower and mug of strong coffee, we taxied to Budapest Ferihegy Airport and our flight. We flipped up to wintry Amsterdam, where I experienced a thorough body search… of course, the Dutch are known for being amiable…this particularly friendly customs fellow only missed checking between my toes. We then raced through nearly the entire length of the long concourse, and hopped our flight down to balmy (?) Lisbon (Lisboa in Portuguese). We quickly carried off our carry-on bags, then awaited the one big checked suitcase. After a long wait at the carousel, we inquired at the lost luggage center… alas, it seems our delinquent bag had a mind of its own and wanted to spend more time in Amsterdam (not that we could blame it… great city). Thankfully, it changed its mind and joined us the next day in Lisboa. This was only a minor setback in nearly three weeks of pleasure in Lisboa.Here’s some Tour site background data to tempt you:Legend has it that Lisboa was founded by Ulysses name comes from ""Olissipo"", which has its origins in the Phoenician words ""Allis Ubbo"", meaning ""enchanting port"". But Lisboa has, of course, strong Arabic influences; it was, after all, occupied by the Moors for 450 years. In the 12th century the Christians reconquered the city but it was not until the mid-13th century that Lisboa became the country's capital. During the 15th century, with the beginning of the Portuguese Age of Discoveries, Lisboa developed into a spice and jewellery trade centre. The breakthrough for Portuguese expansion came in 1498 when Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India. This was indeed the beginning of a golden age, characterised by the Manueline architectural style, named after King Manuel I, with its typical decorative use of maritime motifs.On a stroll through the streets of Lisboa, you can discover a city with thousands of years of history. You can admire its old houses, enjoy the freshness of its gardens and the beautiful panoramic views from its belvederes (miradouros). Each and every corner will confront you with the city's contrasts and traditions.The historical quarters of Lisboa are generally in the city centre. Some still retain the old structures of Muslim and medieval origin, with courtyards where people usually get together. The typical features of these quarters are old houses, narrow streets, wrought-iron balconies, tiled façades and a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. The best and most pleasant way to visit these quarters is by ""eléctrico"" tram.All the above and then some were part of our adventure. By midday of our arrival, our taxi dropped us in City Centre where our hosts were waiting. For the first 2 weeks, we rented a cozy flat (about 250 sq ft cozy) from Marisa Pott, a lovely, dark skinned Portuguese woman who is finishing her PhD in Environmental Studies. A Bohemian flat, with a ‘squeeze in’ kitchen and ‘exhale carefully’ bathroom, the living/dining area ‘spacious’ by comparison, with untreated beams and posts, pine floors, light yellow walls, two wooden shuttered windows on the new world just outside. Ah yes, outside! We sat with our morning espressos and gazed out on a mosaic of rooftops, their curved tiles like golden brown baguette crusts, zigging and zagging across the hillside leading up to the 12th C. Castelo St. George high above us. The scene might be a cat burglar’s paradise, except he/she must step carefully to avoid impalement on TV antennae or head injury via satellite dish. Ah well, romanticism is seldom pure.Marisa’s third floor walk up home is brightened by the sunlight streaming in the tall windows, as well as by the artwork of Carla Pott, Marisa’s sister. Carla seems to have a thing about anthropomorphic dogs… several brilliant acrylic splashed ‘portraits’ of whimsically attired canines adorned the walls- Carla reportedly has a gallery showing in New York- her work was very cheering. As was the availability (with Marisa’s permission, naturally) of M’s eclectic CD collection… waking up to her music, whether one of her Bach or Handel Oratorios, or Nina Simone (which I played a dozen times), John Coltrane, Dionne W, or one of the ‘local’ musician got the days off to a lyrical start.After a shower in an unenclosed 2 foot square corner (somewhat typical in Europe), we’d hang the towels out the window- adding to the colorful displays hanging outside most of our neighbor’s homes- and gaze down on the cobbled steps leading down to the central Plaza Rossio two blocks away. Or we could peer up the steps to the winding lanes and more steps that lead to the Castle atop the hill.Lisboa is sometimes called “The White City”, partially because many of the white buildings that ramble over the ‘Seven Hills of Lisboa’ (some say there are actually about 20), but it may be due to the pure, blazing white sunlight that pervades the city most of the days. It so happened that a sudden cloudburst pushed us back under the awning of our first of many sidewalk coffee pauses. After an hour, the white sun returned and was faithfully present the rest of our days.After a great Cappuccino and the obligatory Pastais de Nata (a warm child’s fist size custard pie), off we went on our orientation walk about the center of Lisboa. As we crossed the large Plaza Rossio, my eye was caught by the Banco Espirito Santo, whose bank slogan might well be “If you can’t trust the Holy Spirit, who???” We wandered down the broad walking street to Plaza Commercio, built in the Middle ages to receive the ships docking at the Tagus River estuary… while on the way, I was politely, and quietly, offered a purchase of hashish (or something related) TWICE… by the same guy! Hmmmm. As we retraced our steps, it was getting dark and the amazing array of Holiday lights came on. The kilometer long pedestrian street was then blazing with bright blue lights hung on 15 foot tall tent-like frames which you stroll beneath… a dozen or more of these lined the way back to Rossio, where an even larger frame of light blue lights soared around the 30 foot statue of King Joao II in the center of the plaza. The plaza is book ended by the National Theatre and City Hall, with shops between… all of them were strung with strobe lights that flashed up and down the buildings. If one is prone to seizures, I wouldn’t recommend this scene. The streets spoking into the Plaza each had different Christmas lighting themes hanging brightly across them… stars, angels, bells, baubles, everything from snowmen to Santas... they were like jeweled necklaces fading to the horizon points down the avenues. We found these bright sights even in the suburbs. And all the time we were there, Christmas Carols (in ENGLISH) wafted from speakers on ledges. Truly pleasant Holiday sights and sounds each day.Another day, we walked up and down the few blocks to the Cathedral, which is at the foot of the medieval Alfama district, the only part of central Lisboa to survive the great 1755 Earthquake and tsunami. Up to 30,000 may have perished. The remains of the Moorish built Castle of St. George (renamed, of course, after the Moors were evicted) sit at the peak of the Alfama. The Cathedral is a solid, Romanesque structure with understated elegance. A favorite sighting there was the side altar of St. Anthony of Lisboa (where he was born) who later was claimed by the Italians as St. Anthony of Padua. According to the legend depicted on the national seal, two ravens led the ship carrying St. Anthony’s body back to Lisboa for his final resting place, his real home! Despite the possible ‘ownership’ contention, he is the patron of Lisboa. In his small alcove is a charming tile mosaic in which he is preaching to very attentive fish… really, dozens of wide eyed, open mouthed fish are straining half out of the water to ‘hear’ some Good News from Tony.In front of the Cathedral, we were able to grab the famous Electrico (Tram) 28, which wound us up and around to the Castle, frequently stopping and clanging it’s harsh bell at an offending parked vehicle blocking the narrow street. One needs to wait patiently, as the locals seem to do… the pace of life seems to support this attitude. It’s common to see people sunning at length in the parks, or lingering over a coffee or beer at a sidewalk café. Ah, the life. Signs on the little tram, which reminded me of the Little Engine Who Could (barely climb the Alfama), warned of pickpockets, but we saw no signs of suspicious characters at any time. Nevertheless, I felt more protected when two nuns climbed aboard. Be honest now, don’t you feel safer when you see Sister get on the airplane with you?We enjoyed the Castle ruins and the temporary exposition of a well known artist Antonio Carmo’s colorful renditions of Fado scenes… Fado is the nostalgic, sad traditional music of Lisboa (similar to our blues)… I framed three reproductions that now hang in our small guest room. We then jumped back on Tram 28 and rode to the other end of the line, the Cemetery of Pleasure. Now, that’s a concept! It is actually a City of the Dead, not unlike Evita’s resting place in Buenos Aires. Narrow streets of elegant mausoleums, usually built like miniature chapels, with small altars within, situated on a high holy place overlooking the Tagus River harbor, the April 25th Bridge (longest expansion bridge in Europe), and the monumental Christ the King statue (reminiscent of Rio’s statue of Christ) on the opposite bank. Quite spectacular to see and wander about. We respectfully observed the coming of a ‘new resident’ as we left… a large limousine was loaded with flowers, and a large retinue of black clothed mourners was led by a priest in full attire. After this sobering experience, it was back on Tram 28 to find a new coffee and pastry shop before returning home to prepare for the next day’s surprises.More LISBON Tales #2Christmas 2004 : New Year’s 2005First a flashback: How could I have forgotten the defining moment we experienced at the beginning of our winter holiday adventure? As we were waiting at the Budapest Airport, a positive omen, a vision of sorts appeared in the departure lounge. In strolled jolly Ol’ Saint Nick himself! I mean it, really… at least from the neck up, a dead ringer. From his fur fringed red cap, down his bushy eyebrows and rosy cheeks to his snowy beard! The real McCoy… but then I was a bit jarred by his leisure travel attire… over his bright red long johns he’d stuffed his jelly bowl belly body into a roomy pair of bib overalls, complete with a brightly embroidered Rudolph on the panel front. His sartorial splendor was completed with a pair of red and white checkerboard tennies, which are of course more comfortable that those heavy boots. He was not in a particularly jolly mood, but managed a smile as he handed out foil wrapped szaloncukors (Hungarian Christmas chocolates) after take-off. In any case, flying with Santa is almost as comforting as with the flying Nuns, don’t you suppose.Now let’s fast forward back to the future in Lisboa. To put me in the mood, I’ve put on a CD of Amalia Rodrigues, the legendary Portuguese Fado singer… Fado is sometimes translated as ‘Nostalgia’, and is a mix of sweet and sad and somehow comforting folk music of Lisboa. This music was often heard over street speakers, alternating with Holiday tunes. Amalia’s voice reminds me of Piaf. They’re now together in the Beyond, so Edie and Ama may now be a headline duo in Club Paradise. Speaking of music, I read about a modern band Madredeus- four music men and one amazing lead woman singer- and was able to purchase the DVD film Lisbon Story (director Wim Wenders shot it in 1994). Madredeus is featured, and the film centers on experiencing Lisboa as a living, breathing being. The sights and sounds and sighs of people, places and music. I recommend a search for it at your favorite video shop.OK, it’s time to try to share a sense of what it’s like ambulating around the big, but accessible L Town. Tain’t easy to keep your footing, let me tell you. The city is a true seaport, and even today you need ‘sea legs’ to be a well-balanced visitor. This is partly due to the fact that much of Lisboa is vertical, so the hamstrings get a work out. But a more prevalent sensation involved learning to keep my balance on the rolling waves of cream-colored limestone and coffee-colored basalt cobbles that cover the ground everywhere in the city… these cobbles are shaped like ‘dinosaur’ teeth, about 2 by 2 inches, which have been pounded into the sandy soil, arranged in many elaborate designs- royal insignia, many floral patterns such as fleur de lys, but mainly in serpentine wave-like curves on nearly all the sidewalks and plazas. We learned that an early 19thC Mayor ordered indentured serfs and prisoners to complete most of this enormous enterprise. Naturally, the cobbles became more and more uneven over time. For the first few days, I often was viewing more of the ‘floor’ of Lisboa than the tiled houses, churches and vistas of the flowing hills that pulled my vision upward. I felt like the drunken sailors after their first evening in port so it just added an authentic nautical feel for the city.And now for a bit of the inside places of Lisboa- museums and churches, castles and casas. There is much to enjoy in this relatively small city. Here are some of our highlights:The Castle of St. George- I mentioned this earlier as a landmark spectacle perched above our digs. Very early on, it was an important ancient settlement of the Phoenicians, Visigoths and Celts, then a Roman outpost (they brought their grapes and olives with them, thanks be), and eventually conquered by the Moors of North Africa, who built the first fortification. In the 12th C. the Crusaders “liberated” the city and changed the site into the monarch Alfonso’s palace, which did not survive to the present. However, he ordered the building of the Cathedral of Our Lady which faces the sea from a plateau just below. Only the great walls remain from the Moorish era. One can walk the walls and enjoy the spectacle of the city and the Tagus estuary. Marvelous panorama indeed.Gulbenkian Museum- a fine arts gem, housing the eclectic collection of Gulbenkian, who was Albanian. The setting is a small park with lagoon and public statuary. There is quite a large collection of Egyptian, Arabic and Chinese pieces, but very charming small salons of paintings, mostly Impressionist (for example, Monet’s Melon and Blue Plate and Renoir’s painting of the lounging Mrs. Monet, who seems to be scowling at Mr. Monet who apparently spends too much time staring at fruit and dishes and splashing colors around, and too little time lounging with her… so pictures may be worth a dozen or more words). The highlight was the large collection of Rene Lalique’s elaborate jewelry- the most exotic I’ve ever seen. Splendid intricate lacework of silver or gold filigree with jewels aplenty… formed into Dragonfly, Centaur, Peacock brooches and hair ‘thingies’, y’know- Ryan has some fine photos of some of these in his on- line album.Museu do Azulejo (Tile Museum) - King Joao II’s widow Leonor built the Madre de Deus (Mother of God) convent for the Poor Clare Order in 1509. It is located in the Alfama, the only district to survive the 1755 Earthquake/Tsunami. The original Queen’s private chapel and the larger convent chapel are simply exquisite… religious scenes in the usual blue and white tiles cover not only the walls, but the ceilings as well. In the cloister garden, there is a 100 foot long panorama of Lisboa, created by tile masters in 1738. It’s an important resource for historical accuracy of the cityscape pre-earthquake destruction. Tiles are one of the most significant characteristics of Lisboa to this day. The museum has more than 12,000 tiles in the convent itself, but also includes an array of smaller mosaics, altar screens, and a good number of modern artistic works as well. Curiously, we had some difficulty finding the restrooms at first, but finally noticed impressionist male and female tile figures pointing the way. Now that is class!The visitor is well advised to hunt down another ‘tile treasure’, the Casa do Alentejo, originally built as a men’s club around 1900. Nestled on a side street near Rossio Plaza, its unassuming entrance leads you into a spectacular Moorish courtyard- red granite floor, imbedded with tiny cartoonish animal tiles, a small tiered fountain, and ruby marble columns supporting intricately scalloped arches that frame the tiled walls. Up the stairs, past the bronze statue of two embracing angels beneath a stained glass rose window, you’ll find a mirrored ballroom on the left. Turn right through the long hall covered by exquisite tiled scenes from a Camoes epic poem about Portugal- on the left is a roomy restaurant, tiled nature mosaics from floor to ceiling- across the hall you’ll find the billiard/smoking/reading room, complete with hunting mosaics and trophies on the wall. The two elders I saw there looked right at home; they may have been there since it opened.National Museum of Ancient Arts- Part of the fun this day was a morning visit to the now famous Post Office coffee shop for the numero uno latte of the burg… then a final visit to Santos Domingos, the notorious Church where the Inquisition pronounced sentences- it’s a cavern of Romanesque solidity. In 1959, the interior was gutted by fire (some say it’s delayed poetic justice), but the roof and main altar were remodeled later- however, the walls are still charred with the soot from the fire, which gives it an eerie feeling, and perhaps an object lesson about extremism. After that, we retired to the corner Ginjinho shop for a shot of the traditional cherry brandy before setting out for the museum. Think of it as energy fruit juice. The proficient bartenders at the open air counter splash the drinks with great flair, always managing to plop 3 plump cherries in each little glass. So I observed the locals (many of them there much of the day) sip the sweet nectar, and followed suit, nonchalantly taking in the sights- shoe shiners, lottery vendors and general street crowd. Finally it’s bottoms up and the three cherry bombs hit bottom. And powerful they are. For awhile, my legs quit complaining, and a floating sensation helped me on our way as we searched for the right bus or tram to the museum, our final stop of the day. This museum is a somewhat hidden down river. I really wanted to see the Hieronymus Bosch triptych (a large three panel oil painting) of The Temptation of Saint Anthony. Coincidentally, this painting has a featured place in a book I was currently reading, Headlong by Michael Frayn. Bosch was ‘way out’ for his time, and his works reportedly sent hidden “warnings” to the tyrants of his time and messages of hope to the masses. His fantastic figures (flying fish people, etc.) and intense light/dark contrasts are mesmerizing. Dali may seem a bit tame by comparison.The Monastery of St. Jeronimos- This large monastery dates to the 15th/16th Centuries, the age of Prince Henry the Navigator and Vasco da Gama, the Golden Age of Exploration and Colonization for Portugal. It is a prime example of Manueline Architecture (named after King Manuel I), a very busy style that incorporates natural and nautical- vines, flowers, ropes, anchors shells, fish, flora, and fauna are embedded and entwined in and around most of the visible columns, openings and corners of the long exterior. Inside, the cloister is more subdued, softened by the array of blue/white tiled historical scenes that wrap around the garden and arches of the monks’ portico. The Chapel follows this style, but has high arched ceilings which open the space. Vasco’s and Prince Hank’s burial vaults are prominent in the Chapel entry.[One of the Monastery’s original purposes was to house homecoming sailors before their return to the sea. Later the monks were given the care of homeless boys. After the Golden Age, the monks had no patrons, so eventually they had to sell wares to exist. In the early 18th C they began selling the famous custard tarts Pasteis de Belem. These became so popular that the recipe has been protected until now… the locals say that there are only 3 bakers who are the keepers of this tasty treat. The current large bakery/cafe is only one block from the Monastery and its maze of tiled dining areas is nearly always filled to capacity. It is the custom to eat them warm from the oven; however, for those on the run, you can get ‘take-out’ in a fancy foil lined cardboard containers. Modern times… something for the busy soccer Mom or mobile MBA.]A FEW MORE LISBON TALES #3On two consecutive days, we commuted 45 minutes in a very comfortable train to the royal town of Sintra. It was so delightful we needed that second day. This well preserved old town is situated 1400 feet above sea level, with the Atlantic in view from the Pena Palace and the Moorish Castle ruins from their neighboring peaks on the highest ridge. Although the rugged sort can hike up to Pena, we chose the hop on/off bus. The palace, although elegant for such an eclectic complex, and visually striking in its majestic setting, draws very different responses. A little history: the monarchs had lived in the National Palace in the center of Sintra from the 15th C until 1910, when the Queen decided she wanted more ‘privacy’. Several different architects were needed to complete the Pena. Thus differing styles and materials- from dark gray stone to white marble to book ended parapets of flamingo pink and buttercup yellow- somehow all melt together in its mountain-top forest setting. Even so, some say it looks like the honeymoon house of Frankenstein and Barbie. While in Sintra, we toured both palaces, each filled with authentic furnishings and more elaborate tiles- the Magpie ceiling in one parlor, the Rose walls in another, and the sunny cupola’s rounded walls of Royal Crests- all hand painted tiles- were highlights of the National Palace. Sintra has a wonderful Toy Museum, packed with over 25,000 items from 1900 to the present. The collection of miniature tin soldiers is truly striking- hundreds of them arranged in battle scenes or royal celebrations. Of course there were lots of less aggressive toys and games. Remember Tiddly Winks? It was also fun to see the many language versions of games like Monopoly, Authors, and other card games..On New Year’s Eve, we tracked down a small café away from the crowds and enjoyed a traditional Portuguese meal. It was time to bite the bullet, so I ordered the Bacalhau. It was a telling moment… when food shopping earlier, I spotted these large leather-like white sheets spilling out of containers in the fish section. Turns out it is dry cod, a staple in the cuisine. Although it was tolerably tasty, I think the bottle of Mateus Rose saved the meal. After a pastry and espresso, it was time to wander back through the Christmas lighted streets, complete with festive music, down to Plaza Commercio for the midnight concert and fireworks. The pyrotechnics were fabulous… great skyworks, with unique displays of rockets ricocheting around the eaves of the port enclosure, and a great 30 meter high curtain of showering sparks as a finale. The plaza was packed with thousands, sharing champagne and greetings, and no aggressive behaviors. The leave-taking was very orderly and polite, even though there was a huge traffic jam. The ‘Chief Merrymaker’ (self-appointed) was a happily high young man who ran up the center of the street, cheering and encouraging celebratory honking and shouting wishes of a Bom Ano Novo! He might well have quelled any possible road rage with his good humor.We said goodbye to Marisa’s flat the next day, moving down river a few kilometers to Belem (Bethlehem) for the final days. It was a fascinating transition from the bustling city center to the ‘burbs. Except this suburb is located high above the river, overlooking the Christ the King statue on the other side of the longest bridge in Europe. Raquel picked us up and graciously toured us around Belem, and settled us in her sunny and spacious flat. Although Raquel’s flat was much larger and mod stylish (picture Mao posters, whimsical fish and animal sculptures, and brilliantly colored textiles and light fixtures), it was, shall we say, less convenient to the ‘action’… however, we increased our stamina from the daily mile walks up and down the hill. The walks were well worth it, since the Geronimos Monastery, Discoverers Monument, Belem Tower and beautifly riverfront parks at the bottom as our rewards. At sundown on several days, we watched the largest Christimas Tree in Europe come alive, the blue, gold and white lights building in stages from toe to top on the spectacular tree. Nearby colors shifted from green to yellow to pink in the plaza fountain. With the crisp ocean breeze flowing in with the tide, we adjusted our coat collars and were warmed by the excitement of sharing the moments with celebrating local families.Our Bom Ora (Good Hour) neighborhood in Belem was quiet, but a bustling daily street market stretched for blocks just around the corner. While we were here, we learned to enjoy some of the local treats… like tomato jam, green wine, quince marmalade, tiny mandarins, fresh salmon and mackerel, the usual array of pastry and bread, and of course olives. The ground coffee is also very rich… it was on sale at Pingo Doce market, so we packed some back home.We spent several visits at the Europe ’98 World Expo area, traveling by the newest Metro, which has brilliant ‘tapestry-like’ tiled station walls . Since ’98, this district has become a cultural Mecca with a dazzling transport station, a huge Mall (unique with water streaming down its curved glass roof) , high-rise twin apartment buildings (shaped like prows of ocean liners), a sport/entertainment arena, aquarium and large concourse of shops/cafes along the broad waterfront. The contrast with the old center is fascinating. A bit of background: Since Portugal entered the European Union a couple of decades ago, she has been the darling of the EU, garnering large subsidies to improve the country, which suffered from poverty, corruption, and revolutions at home and in former colonies. The Expo became their showplace. I highly recommend the Oceanarium… designed by an American, its four corner aquariums are miniature Atlantic, Pacific, Antarctic and Indian oceans, with indigenous residents… these ‘oceans’ feed into the “Global Ocean”, the central two story aquarium (5 million liters full) where the larger sea creatures live and play. Smaller aquaria have splendid collections of coral, anemones, tropical and exotic fish. It’s not to be missed.One last out of town trip by train to Cascais… we enjoyed sun, sand, and sea in this resort town on the Atlantic. It’s an historical fishing village grown modern in many ways, but still retaining the nautical feel. We wandered along the waterfront, watching the emptying and cleaning of the lobster/crab traps, as the early catch was arriving on the colorful fishing boats. Men were busily offloading their goods and securing and supplying their boats for the next day. On the beach, we found treasure troves of scallop, clam and oyster shells, as well as hundreds of delicate periwinkles for our collection. An Aussie Shepherd entertained us with his frolicking and ball chasing- he was very patient with his people, trying to give them the ball over and over without success. They kept throwing it away; humans can be so dense. We ended the day in a cliff top park populated by peacocks, cocks, a black cat, and a 3-deep pile of turtles sunning in the lagoon.During our last days, I thought about how intriguing it is to be immersed again in another language setting. Although we seldom had trouble communicating in English, it was interesting to observe the communication behaviors of the Portuguese. At our first flat, the walls and ceilings were ‘thin’ so we heard more interchange than we wished… especially after midnight. It was hard to tell whether the couple was cussing or discussing issues… in either case, the volume was up. However, loudness may be subjective since the Rossio Square day timers seem to be just as hearty in their discussions… that may be partly due to the influence of the 2nd or 3rd Ginjinha brandy they’ve just downed. Portuguese in print is quite similar to Spanish, with a pinch of French for flavor. But hearing it is a different matter… our ‘Spanish’ ears recognized very little. Along with the usual gesturing, local folk sound like they are half whistling, half coughing. They seem to be speaking with one cheek full of pebbles (a la Vito Corleone/Brando) and the other stuffed with sponges. Sharp/soft mingling. An equal mix of mellow drunkard and jungle cat. Unlike Hungarian which uses lots of hard tone consonants, Portuguese is both melodic and dramatic. English seems so tame by comparison. Don’t get me wrong… I was often captivated when overhearing their chats… I mean this as a compliment… listening to them was a enjoyable street concert. For the full impact, one has to observe non-verbals as well… even in the sharper exchanges, the final effect is softened by the hand on the arm, the twinkling eyes and the grin gradually curving beneath crinkling brown eyes.Portugal is now a truly multi-cultural nation. Since 1975, nearly a million refugees from former colonies in Africa and Asia have been integrated, a remarkable feat since those non-native groups now represent more than 7% of the population. Now you’ll find Brazilian, Angolan, Goan, and Mozambican arts, food and other influences. They seem to have settled in and are contributing to the human quest for lives of value in their ‘new’ country. There’s that word “value” again… it shows up a lot on the political stage these days. Would that we truly value our diverse and splendid traditions and qualities across the globe… those differences make our common human need for lives of dignity, peace, health and spiritual growth more exciting and inviting, after all. So, vive la difference! Portugal provided us with many of those moments of communion.Travel can become pilgrimage to new holy places. As Miriam Beard puts it so well, “Certainly, travel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living.“ I wish you many happy and meaningful journeys and lessons of living in the days ahead."
40,“Lisbon and Sintra in February”,"My husband and I just returned from a week in Portugal. It was an enriching experience filled with chance encounters and scenery that dreams are made of. It was chilly with just a bit of rain, much like we have in the South right now. We spent 3 days in Lisbon, 2 and a half in Sintra, and 1/2 day driving around the beaches. Our package included 6 nights at the VIP Lisbon Hotel. The only redeeming features there were it was clean, had hot water, and was near bus routes and a very nice shopping mall with a food court and piano player called the Saldanha Atrium. The hotel had no charm and the breakfast was just short of terrible. We enjoy walking and explored by foot. We went to the Alfama first. It is a colorful area with very narrow, hilly streets. The views from the Castelo de Sao Jorge are worth the walk up. The newer Pantheon is wonderful and on Saturday mornings there is a large flea market just behind it that is interesting. The arch in Praca do Comercio is particularly lovely lit up at night. Belem was our favorite city district and there is much to see and do there. The monastery is not to be missed. The architectural elements are very beautiful. The coches museum is remarkable. We had a good lunch on the main street and delicious pastries at the famous blue shop. Two large pastries and coffees were 2 euros. A deal! I would spend two days in Belem to see everything. The Lalique collection made the Gulbenkian worthwhile, otherwise you see so many fabulous antiques in the castles that it pales in comparison. A chance, fun find was the Pavilhao Chines Bar on Rua D. Pedro V, 89-91. They have amazing collections of things, lots of art deco, and a fine menu book that we bought for a reminder of our visit. Driving a rental car was not as bad as we expected, but I think we were smart to pick it up at the airport instead of in the city. I requested an automatic drive which was not quite the same as one finds in the US. We stopped off to see the Palace of Queluz on the way to Sintra. It was one of our favorites. We strongly recommend the Cozinha Velha Restaurant found next to it in the original cook house. Impeccable service and a buffet with an assortment of main dishes and desserts made the price worth it. Sintra will steal your heart and make you plan a future return trip. We stayed at the Residencial Sintra and really liked it there. The house was quaint and the staff extremely accommodating plus they were easy to deal with by email and answered lots of quetions about the area for us. Breakfast was adequate plus they have beer, wine, and sandwiches available for purchase other times of the day. Cheese is delicious in this town! We had our favorite meal of the trip at the Topico Restaurant. We had their special for lunch which was a sort of stew made of what looked like a type of green butter bean and pork with a broth that smelled like olives. Go there! The Pena Palace is magnificent in all respects. I was glad we were not there during the high tourist season so that I could stand for a bit and take it all in. The gardens at Monserrate are lovely. Wish we could have seen inside the house. The Regaleira Palace and gardens are exceptional, too. The drive out to Cabo da Roca and around the beaches was dramatic."
50,“Go to this city!”,"I had always heard mixed reviews of Lisbon....GO TO THIS CITY. Adorable, cheap, different. Very friendly people. Give it a try for a few days, you won't be sad that you did."
50,“short break in lisbon”,"lisbon is a wonderful place for a short city break. the city is full of interest and character combining places of historical interest, good shopping, museums and excellent and cheap public transport.if you enjoy walking the city is a delight with surprises around most corners. however please note that is the most hilly city we have visited, more so then rome paris or barcelona which i think it most resembles. it benefits from an attractive waterfront location and the new expo built location is well worth a visit. a great bonus is that within 45 minutes by very good train service from the seaside resort of cascais which is charming and next door to its more prententious neighbour estoril. equally close from lisbon is sintra with its royal palaces and also well worth the visit. restaurants are not all gourmet standard but are good value for money and hotels are in very good supply. the people are very friendly and helpful the weather was very good for mid october and to sum up we would be very happy to return soon."
10,“Beware the Lisbon travel pass!!”,"For a day out, we thought we would by the Carris transport day ticket (bilhete diario), which for just under 3 euros gives free travel on the buses, trams, elevators and metros. Finding a place that sells them isn't that easy. Went round various likely outlets (tobacco shops, tourist office), but no, they all sent us packing. Finally got to the Carris office just off Rossio, by the elevator. Bought the tickets.Then the fun started. They don't have a magnetic strip, so you can't actually use them on the metro, although they are valid for the metro.You are meant to exchange them for a metro ticket at the booking office. But these tend to be closed for most of the day. Eventually found someone who helped us through the barrier. At the other end, same problem. We alerted the staff, who were totally unhepful. Crazy system."
30,“Two Days is Enough”,"Two days in Lisbon are enough to see the major sights: Castelo Sao Jorge, Belem Tower, Jeronimos Monastery, Parque de Nacaos. You need a taxi to get up and down the very steep hills. Hotel Mondial is conveniently located mid-town for shopping, but there is construction at the hotel. If you are not a party person, stay away from the Alto Barrios area. Lots of drunken young people everywhere! Take the Fado nightclub tour or go on your own to Timpanico. Great food, music, and Portugese dancers. Then rent a car and visit Obidos, Sintra, and Fatima."
30,“20 years later”,Had things changed since 1984? No all the postive things were the same. So many free things to do lovely relaxed feel even though a capital. Friendly people where they dont mind your language skills are minimal. Food is still fresh and moderately priced. I was disappointed that the steps to the rvier by the Commercio Square were now fenced off so you could not sit by the river. More down and outs around. I never felt threatened and still love wondering around the back streets off the main areas without fear. Museum admissions many free otherwise very reasonable. Hated the shopping malls this is europe not the USA and the quirky small shops are disappearing because of these malls as to the Portuguese these are a novelty. Lisbon is wonderful but there is never enough time to wqonder. The tourist pass can never be used to the full extent so unless you have a very strict schedule dont bother with it.
50,“Loved Os Bardos”,"If you are going to Lisbon I would strongly suggest that you plan to see that band ""Os Bardos."" Out of our seven day stay in the charming country of Portugal the highlight of our stay was the evening we spent with ""Os Bardos."" These two gentlmen played a delightful combination of Portuguese music as well as American classics and truly fostered an environment that made the crowd feel welcome, involved, and entertained. They play on Thursdays at an Irish bar on the ""Docks."" (Talk about multi-cultural) They also play most Fridays at the ""Insolito"" bar that is located in Sobreiro-Mafra, 5 Miles away from the beautiful beach Ericeira, 30 Miles North of Lisbon. They can be contacted at osbardos@hotmail.com if you are interested in finding out more about their schedule.Portugal was fantastic!"
50,“Lisbon Solo”,"November 4 I left Lisbon International after a twenty-year interval. I used to love Lisbon of the eighties: the dust of the revolution had settled, Portugal prided itself on being a new EU member and Lisbon was Lisbon with green English routemaster buses.Twenty years later, after Expo 98, after the fire that partially destroyed the Chiado, the heart of Lisbon, after Amalia died, I was more than fearful. But I went back, afraid that the whole city had been uprooted and macdonalised.Lisbon Airport was a surprise shock. Gone was the old arrival hall, no bigger than a school playground. It definitely had been transformed into a 21st century place of arrival and departure.Another pleasant shock: there was an airport shuttle which took me to where I had to be: at the Avenida da Liberdade, barely half an hour after getting out.Third shock: the temperature was great: wearing the coat that I badly needed in the UK was definitely an unneeded luxury; 24°C and everyone was in shirt sleeves.I checked in at the Casa Dom Pedro which I expected to be one of these old Pensions (Pensao), but it had been recently modernized: it was great!I took a bath and started doing what I would be doing for the next six days: plie the cobbled streets and alleways of the city that I had always loved.Waling around at night time is fine, but daytime shows you what is on for real. And Lisbon was the same old place: the same old charm, the same old houses and quarters (Alfama, Bairro Alto, Mouraria), though slowly but surely getting very upmarket, and what was more: the whole place had been adapted to present day life without destroying anything of the days gone by.As I said, I plied every single street, some more than once. Which is exactly what you do in Lisbon: since the city is built on the seven hills (as it is claimed), you can never get lost: the central Avenida runs right through the city and on any of the hills you can see the river Tagus. This means that with a minimum of a pigeon's homing instinct you always know how to return to your hotel. And when you are tired of walking, just drop into any of the local cafes and have a coffee (a bica, if you want it small and strong, or a galao if you want it with plenty of milk in a glass). Hungry? You can have bites everywhere just to still that 4 o' clock pang of hunger. And at night, you can sit anywhere outside and enjoy Portuguese cuisine and a cheap (but good) bottle of wine.When the stomach is full, you can go for culture: the city is full of museums and places of historic interest.And if you are a melancholic person like me, then on a Friday or Saturday night, you must (must!) go to Mouraria or Alfama (rather than Bairro Alto) for an evening of fado.Amalia, Portugal's number one diva of fado, may have died, but her spirit is stronger than ever. Every yellow cobble in Lisbon breathes fado. It is there in every pair of dark eyes, in every tile decoration (however small), in every flower. It is there to enter your heart where it will nestle itself and remain there long after the plane has left Lisbon International in the wake of its take off turbulence. And with some, like me, it will root itself in the heart to stay there forever. For such people, a visit to the Museum of Fado is a true pilgrimage."
50,“Комфортный хостел в хорошем месте”,"Хостел находится не в самом центре, но у станции метро, что очень удобно. 6 станций вниз- и вы на центральной площади, где покупаете lisboa card и сутки-двое пользуетесь транспортом и музеями бесплатно. Сам хостел чистый и уютный. Персонал очень доброжелательный. Стоянка перед домом, но придется платить, если не в выходные и не вечером. Советую."
50,“UNA CITTA' LUMINOSA”,"Lisbona, una città viva e luminosa, una città da scoprire di giorno camminando nelle vie strette dell'Alfama, soffermandosi a guardare le case, gli azulejos che le tappezzano, i balconi con i panni stesi ,oppure bighellonare tra i negozi della Baxia, eppoi passeggiare lungo il Tago .Alla sera entrate in un locale dove il suono del fado vi lascerà magari un po' di nostalgia da cancellare con un buon bicchiere di Porto.Questo ed altro vi riserverà questa splendida città!"

40,“Una città da scoprire”,"Una città veramente particolare,in 3 giorni (4 notti) son riuscita a visitarla quasi tutta; riuscendo a fare 2 gite fuori porta Fatima e Sintra (ovviamente correndo).Questo è stato il mio itinerario:Il primo giorno sono andata a Fatima molto emozionante,se ve la sentite,ve lo consiglio è solo a 90min di strada col pullman.Al rientro mi son fermata a visitare Parque das Nacoes bel centro costruito per l'Expo del 1998.Il secondo giorno sveglia presto per poter visitare il più possibile,partendo da piazza Praca de Figuera col tram direzione Belem dove visiterete la Torre,il Monumento alle scoperte ed il Monastero diJeronomos.Spostandomi verso il centro mi son fermata a Piazza del Commercio per passeggiare in Rua Augusta che vi collega a Piazza Rossio.Da lì andate a Praca Martim Moniz per salire sul tram 28 direzione Castello di Sao Jorge e Cattedrale Sè zona bella da gustare passeggiando tra i vicoli.Il pomeriggio ho preso il treno che parte da Piazza Rossio direzione Sintra,ci vuole un'ora.Una volta arrivata alla stazione son salita sul pullman rosso scoperto, in modo da poter visitare tutto il comune di Sintra, fatelo perchè così scoprirete molti paesaggi spettacolari compreso Cabo da Roca il punto più occidentale del continente Europeo e altre cose molto affascinanti. Il terzo ed ultimo giorno giorno sono andata al Santuario del Cristo Rei,col traghetto preso a Cais do Sondre direzione Cacilhas, attraverserete il fiume Tago e avrete la fortuna di vedere tutta Lisbona una vista davvero spettacolare,avendo ancora un pò di tempo ho fatto una breve tappa al Parco Edoardo Vll.Son stati 3 giorni davvero intensi,ma merita la stanchezza ci si riposa a casa. Aggiungo che i trasporti pubblici sono una meraviglia metro,tram,treni son perfettamente collegati;la Città è pulita e ordinata,ma state attenti se vi muovete la sera,come in tutte le grandi città è pieno di delinquenti.Che aggiungere?Nulla,vi consiglio questo viaggio!!!!"

Als je uitstapt bij halte St Jorge (kasteel) dan kunt je via kleine straatjes weer naar beneden lopen. Veel lokale winkels, fado restaurants, etc. Wel goede schoenen dragen (geen slippers). Doen!"
50,“Ótimo.”,Lisboa é uma cidade interessante e tem muito o que se ver e curtir. Além de descobrir mais sobre nossas raízes.O que não gostei foi realmente a arrogância de um funcionário na alfândega do aeroporto. Passei uma situação psicológica forte.
50,“Great”,Magnifique ville pleine de charme et de curiosité a visiter tant en architecture quand gastronomie. La vie nocturne est unique les ballades au bord du fleuve ou dans la ville animée par ces nombreux restaurant. N'oubliez pas de dîner dans une maison ou l'on écoute le fado c'est inoubliable.

50,“Fantastico”,Sembra di essere in un film.. non ho mai visto un posto cosi.. solo castelli antichi e sentieri in mezzo alla natura.. inimmaginabile

40,“inaspettatamente bella”,"Nel mese di maggio abbiamo avuto l' opportunità di fare una crociera di 10 giorni tra Spagna, Portogallo, Irlanda e Olanda. Ovviamente la prima cosa che si sceglie quando si vuole fare una crociera è l' itinerario, e ovviamente non tutti gli scali possono risultare così interessanti. Se non fosse stato nell' itinerario, non avremmo mai pensato di andare a Lisbona, ma dopo averla visitata ci siamo dovuti ricredere! è una città incantevole, molto caratteristica, e con un bellissimo clima! il suo continuo susseguirsi di salite e discese, i classici tram che le percorrono avanti e indietro, e il ponte 25 Aprile (praticamente identico al Golden Gate Bridge) ricordano vagamente Sanfrancisco. Consigliamo vivamente di visitare Lisbona per un fine settimana, o all' interno di un' itinerario da crociera come abbiamo fatto noi."
40,“Lisboa a pié”,"Lisboa es una ciudad encantadora en la que se puede comer con una excelente relación calidad-precio. Recomiendo especialmente concurrir a lugares fuera del circuito gastronómico, esos que tienen mantel de papel (en los que exhiben su menú escrito a pulso) y concurridos por habitantes de la ciudad. Es realmente una linda experiencia caminar por la gran avenida que va desde la rotonda Marqués de Pombal hasta el río y ver como va cambiando el tipo de edificación y el paisaje. Una vez llegado al río Tejo recomiendo pasa por el ""Arco del Triunfo"" y en cualquier callecita doblar a la derecha para buscar la catedral y desde allí llegar al increíble en todo sentido Castillo de San Jorge. Hay que entrar a verlo sí o sí: es como transportarse en el tiempo llegando incluso a ver ruinas medievales.En la misma zona se encuentra el barrio Alfama (antiguamente de pescadores) y es un hermoso lugar para conocer caminando y comer una sardina grillada al paso con una cervecita mezclada con gaseosa lima-limón.Lo ideal, como siempre, es parar en un hotel mas o menos bien ubicado para hacer todo a pié.Para conocer Belen no es necesario hacerlo en un tour, se puede tomar el transporte público sin problemas y a un costo muy económico. Una vez allé sugiero visitar la torre por dentro y el monasterio.Un capítulo aparte merece Sintra, a la que hay que llegar en un micro. Es una ciudad medieval repleta de castillos que vale la pena visitar uno por uno (lo que llevaría como mínimo 2 días).En síntesis, un destino en general con poco glamour pero super interesante para quienes aprecian conocer culturas tan diferentes como importantes."
50,“Bella meta”,"è una delle capitali più affascinanti d'Europa, luminosa, calda, signorile e popolare allo stesso tempo. Lisbona si staglia nel cielo azzurro, con i suoi colori cangianti, che passano dall’ocra ai colori pastello delle antiche case, delle chiese, delle torri e dei campanili. E' una metropoli caratterizzata da un'intensa vita culturale, ma anche da una vivace vita notturna."
40,“Opere d'arte in metropolitana...fantasia di azulejos o museo itinerante?”,"Lisbona è una città magica ed attraente per mille aspetti..per le mille cose da fare e da vedere...Ma cè un luogo un pò inconsueto di solito, che invece a Lisbona merita di essere vissuto ""non solo come ""passaggio""La metropolitana...fermatevi alle varie stazioni..girate lo sguargo intorno e capirete!Lisbona ha quella che i più, definiscono una delle Metropolitane più colorate del mondo, un vero e proprio museo itinerante!!Azulejos antiche e moderne, sculture, pannelli colorati dalle fogge più strane !!!Un esempio???la stazione Cais do Sodré, dove attraverso mille azulejos coloratissime, un pittore surrealista , ha inteso raccontarci a modo suo ""Alice nel Paese delle Meravigle""..ogno stazione..una fantastica e colorata scoperta e quindi, seguendo i colori dlle varie linee della metro verde, giallo, rosso o blu , scoprirete tante cose si lisbona..una città che non è triste..anzi...ma illumina anche il suo sottosuolo in un moso unico!!"
40,“Lisbona antica e moderna”,"Lisbona è una capitale unica che sa unire l'atmosfera tradizionale della zona della Baixa all'anima moderna della zona dell'Expo.La città è costruita su un continuo saliscendi e per conoscerla bisogna salire su ogni belvedere, magari con i caratteristici tram e le funicolari per gustarla da ogni angolazione.Sfugge a questa regola Belem, che si raggiunge percorrendo la strada che fiancheggia il fiume Tago, così largo che quasi verrebbe da scambiarlo con il mare.A Belem, da non perdere è il Museo delle Carrozze dove è impossibile capire se siano più affascinanti i capolavori in mostra o l'edificio che li ospita."
50,“Lisbona che meraviglia!!!”,"Ciao a tutti i viaggiatori di tripadvisor!se dovessi dare un consiglio sulle capitali europee che ho visistato e che forse e' un po' meno pubblicizzata decisamente consiglio LISBONA!!!E' una citta' che offre di tutto..monumenti..mare..parchi..allegria e saudade!!si perche' dopo che l' avete visitata vi lascia nel cuore la sua atmosfera nostalgica come un viaggio nel tempo..si respira nell' aria..forse per le sue stradine antiche in parte caratterizzata dai colori della sua storia..Da non perdere il quartire di Belen con la sua meravigliosa torre sul Tago..il monastero di jeronimo..oppure il quartiere dell' Alfama caratterizzato dalle viuzze strette dove si possono ammirare un po ovunque gli azulejos che colorano le facciate e lo rendono cosi caratteristico ..da non perdere entrambi oltre il classimo primo giro nel quartire del CHIADO con i suoi negozi e l' elevador panoramico.IL castello domina la citta' e da lassu' con l' elettrico 28 si puo ammirare un bellissimo panorama della citta'..Poi la sera per i giovani e non il Bairro alto con i suoi innumerevoli ristorantini e i locali dove si puo mangiare davvero a basso costo ,stare in compagnia dei tantissimi brasiliani che vivono in citta' o entrare a sentire qualche esibizione del canto tipico tradizionale portoghese, il fado.Oppure si va alle DOCAS..il lungofiume ricco anche qui di ristoranti e discopub..di sicuro a lisbona non ci si annoia mai e si spende davvero poco..Anche i taxi non sono cari come in Italia e si possono prendere anche ogni sera eventualmente..io e le mie amiche la notte ci spostavamo cosi..ma Lisbona e' ben servita sia dalla metropolitana sia dai bus che dai caratteristici eletrico,piccoli tram colorati monumento anch 'essi della citta'.Piatto tipico il bacala' cucinato si dice in piu' di 200 ricette diverse..viene sempre accompagnato dalle patatine fritte,che a dir il vero trovi come contorno abbinato in quasi tutti i piatti..otttimo il tonno e il pescespada..e diciamo che una cena sostanziosa puoi pagarla intorno ai 15 euro..vino compreso!!Descrivere tutto cio' che c e' da visitare e' impossibile in due righe..Anche la parte moderna della citta' e' da visitare..bellissimo l' Oceanario che ricostruisce tutte le zone naturali della Terra e dove in una sola passegggiata si possono ammirare animali di tutto il mondo divisi per clima ( le lontre acquatiche meravigliose o i pinguini per es)..oltre che tantissime specie acquatiche dagli squali ai tenerissimi cavallucci marini!!!Se poi vi avanza tempo non scordatevi di andare a Sintra!!A pochissima distanza dalla citta' e' immersa nel verde questa ex residenza estiva dei nobili portoghesi..sembra un paese delle fate credetemi !!noi ci siamo pentite di non essere rimaste li' almeno una notte..poi c'e ' Oporto..dove non si puo' non fare un giretto per le cantine del tipico vino da dessert..gli assaggi sono assicurati ;)..ma portatevi scarpe chiuse, un ombrello e una giacchina perche' qui rispetto a LISBONA fa freschino anche a ferragosto,specie se piove!!Noi siamo andate in estate piena e a Lisbona la temperatura il giorno era di 35/40 gradi .Parlerei per ore di questa citta'..ci tornerei davvero volentieri percio' fidatevi:nessuno rimarra' insoddisfatto!!Buone vacanze a tutti!!"
40,“L'incanto del fado!”,"Già visitata al tempo della ex-po del 1998, decido di tornare a Lisbona un po' accompagnata dai costi accettabili sia nei voli low-cost sia della vita in genere.Scegliamo un hotel nel centro della città, tra il Barrio Alto e Chiado, quartiere famoso per la vita notturna!Armati di scarpe da tennis e spensieerati inizia un'esperienza magica per questa incantevole città divisa fra il fascino delle stradine a ridosso del mare e il moderno super lusso del quartiere commerciale della ex-po.Il meglio a mio gusto è stata l'esperienza per le strade del Alfama, piccole vie intricate come in un labirinto, scalini calpestai e consumati da migliaia di piedi, luci soffuse e musica in sottiofondo: il mitico fado, improvvisato ihn molti locali del quartiere e condiviso in rispettoso silenzio dalle persone del posto.Turisti fortunati, come lo siamo stati noi, capitano in una spartana taverna dove si alternano e improvvisano la signora del palazzo di fronte, il ragazzo che abita sopra e il vecchio pensionato...assolutamente fantastico!!!L'autobus 28 aiuta a dar sollievo ai piedi e offre una panoramica della città fino a un fantastico bel vedere che lascia completamente senza fiato!!La gente è simpatica, gentile e generosa...esperienza da ripetere ancora!!!"
40,“VISITA LISBONA”,"Lisbona è una città che merita veramente di essere visitata. Una città dove antico e moderno si alternano senza sosta. I portoghesi, gente gentile e disponibile, pronta a compensare le deficienze delle indicazioni spessissimo solo in portoghese. Abbiamo trovato molta gente che parla inglese, specialmente nella fascia giovanile, sempre disposta a darci spiegazioni ed indicazioni. Mezzi pubblici eccellenti (indicazioni sempre in portoghese). Cucina ottima. Vino Porto non ha bisogno di altre recensioni. L'albergo da noi scelto in una fascia molto economica, non ha mancato in nulla: pulizia, gentilezza, prima colazione, disponibilità, Tutto oltre le aspettative.Una lode particolare ai portoghesi che onorano con grande devozione i navigatori che hanno dato lustro alla loro terra. Una per tutte: Nel monastero de Jeronimos abbiamo visto una anziana donna pregare sul sarcofago di Vasco de Gama."
50,“Lissabon-tolle Stadt für zwischendurch”,"tolle Shoppingstadt, nette Leute, Vorsaison empfehlenswert, Mietauto unbedingt nehmen, da die Sehenswürdigkeiten ziemlich weit auseinander sind.Hotel günstig und sehr sauber,etwas außerhalb."
40,“assolutamente da vedere”,anima latina e spirito sudamericano. La citta' offre scorci incredibili e panorami inconsueti. Consigliati i gialli tram e le pasticcerie. Nei ristoranti dovete provare le diverse modalita' di preparazione del baccala'. Attenzione agli hotel che costano poco: danno un servizio economico con stanze al limite della dignita'. Merita una visita al promontorio con la statua de cristo: permette di avere un'altra visuale sulla citta'. Interessante il quartiere dell'expo. da provare anche lo storico ascensore. In inverno clima caldo umido: consiglio di lasciare a casa i piumini e di portare molte cose di cotone.
30,“Non sembra una capitale europea”,"Ho trascorso qualche giorno a Lisbona, città che conoscevo solo dai libri di Oessoa.Mi è dispiaciuto dover constartare che sia molto povera, credo al di sotto di tutte le altre capitali europee. In pochi giorni ho assistito a uno scippo in pieno centro e numerose persono ci hanno chiesto se volevamo acuistare droghe.Città bella ma non sicura"
50,“preciosa y repetible”,"Es una ciudad diferente, cualquier calle es digna de ver, es cierto que tiene muchos edificios pidiendo reforma, pero aun así su encanto es extraordinario. Es ideal para cualquier tipo de grupo, incluso con niños, el barrio alto tiene un ambiente genial para todas las edades. Zapatos cómodos y a patear la ciudad, no interesa coger autobuses ni metro, pues los taxis son súper baratos, eso si bastante peligrosos por la velocidad y manera de conducir."
30,“Lissabon”,"Lissabon, hatte mir irgendwie mehr erwartet: an Hügeln gelegene alte Stadt direkt am Wasser. Die Straßenbahnen kämpfen sich die Hügel rauf; tolles Panorama, kleine Häuschen, enge Gassen. Lecker Essen. Aber sonst?"
50,“Lissabon– Ein Farbenspiel der Kunst&Kultur und dazu immer so bunt wie eine Blume”,"Immer, wenn wir nach Lissabon kamen, staunten wir welche kulturellen und kunsthistorischen Denkmäler die Stadt zu bieten hat. In diesem Jahr war es für uns nur ein Tag des Zwischenstopps, aber ein erfrischender Auftakt für eine Reise, die für uns bevorstand. So genossen wir die Stadtrundfahrt, für die gerade noch Zeit blieb.Der Dichter Fernando Pessoa hat einmal gesagt: „Es gibt für mich keine Blume, die dem unerhört abwechslungsreichen Farbenspiel von Lissabon gleichkäme“. Und Anfang Mai 2011 war die Stadt nicht nur bunt auf Grund seiner farbenfrohen Häuserfronten, oftmals geschmückt mit den blauen Kacheln, den Azulejos, Strassen mit schwarz-weissen Pflaster-Mosaiken, den gelben Trambahnen, den elfenbein-farbigen Fronten der Bauten der Manuelinischen Architektur, sondern auch durch die Natur, die noch in frischem Grün leuchtete mit den hinein gesprenkelten Farben der Blumen.Es macht Spass, Lissabon kennen zulernen mit der Strassenbahn. Zum Glück haben die Lissabonner erkannt, welchen Wert die alten Bahnen für eine touristische Rundfahrt haben. So sollte man nicht vergessen, diese „Veteranen-Strassenbahnen“ zu nutzen, um damit die Altstadt im Vorbeifahren kennen zu lernen –die Linien 12 und 28 führen sogar hinauf auf einen der sieben Hügel Lissabons, der Alfama.Kunstinteressierte sollten nicht vergessen, dem Museum Caluste Gulbenkian einen Besuch abzustatten; eine erlesene Sammlung des armenischen Geschäftsmannes. Das Museum wurde 1969 eröffnet (heute dem Staat gehörend) und stellt für uns eine der schönsten Sammlungen der Welt dar (Von Ägyptischen Objekten, Orientalisch-islamischer Kunst, Fernöstliche Kunst, einer wunderschönen Lalique-Sammlung bis hin zu Europäischer Malerei des 14. Jh. bis ins 19. Jh. und dekorativen Objekten, Möbeln etc.).Natürlich gehören zu Lissabon in ganz besonderer Weise die Wandkacheln – für Innen – und Aussenschmuck der Häuser. Hier sollte man ebenso nicht vergessen, dem Museu Nacional do Azolejo einen Besuch abzustatten, das unten am Tejo in einem Konvent (Convento da Madre de Deus) liegt.Als Tourist kommt man nicht umhin, den Stadtteil Belem zu besuchen – auch hierhin kann man die Strassenbahn nutzen (eine „normale“ oder wenn man Glück hat, einen der alten Wagen zu erwischen). Das Monasteiro dos Jerònimos und ein Spaziergang am Tejo zum Torre de Belém (prachtvolle Bauten aus dem 16.Jh., in dem nach Manuel I benannten typisch portugiesischem Stil) sowie dem ‚Seefahrer-Denkmal’ (Padrão dos Descobrimentos) stehen hier auf jedem geführten Programm oder einem Programm, das man sich selber zusammen gestellt hat. Versuchen Sie doch einmal unter den dargestellten Seefahrern, königlichen Gönnern und auf der Westseite des Denkmals von 1960 den Helden und Dichtern die einzige Darstellung einer Frau ausfindig zu machen!Für uns blieb auf unserer Rundfahrt dann aber nur noch Zeit, um auf die Anhöhe nördlich der Rotunda Praca Marques de Pombal und des sich anschliessenden Parks Eduardo VII hinauf zu fahren, um von dort den Blick auf Teile der Stadt zu geniessen. Von hier aus sah die Stadt nun wirklich aus wie eine Blume, so wie Pessoa es ausdrückte."
30,“Tra povertà e bellezza”,"Sono stato a Lisbona nel Maggio 2010 per la seconda volta. E' una città molto bella da visitare, il costo della vita è molto basso e nel mese di Maggio c'è già la temperatura ideale per andare in giro con maglietta e pantaloncini corti. La città non è grandissima e visitarla è abbastanza semplice. Consiglio di visitare il Monumento aos Descobrimentos situato proprio alla fine del porto turistico, oltre a questo monumento è d'obbligo vedere la Torre dè Belèm. Questa torre si trova proprio nel mare ed è davvero stupendo vederla da dentro. Oltre a questo proprio li in zona c'è il Monastero dos Jerònimos, forse il monastero più famoso di Lisbona. Proprio accanto potete assaggiare la famosa pastella di belem alla Pastéis de Belém, la pasticcieria più famosa dell'intero Portogallo!Invece tornando al centro di Lisbona i punti fondamentali da vedere sono la grossa piazza dove è presente il Patriarcato di Lisbona, il Castello di San Jorge (andateci verso il tramonto perchè vederlo da li è davvero unico!) e anche l'ascensore situato proprio nel centro città. Le serate vi consiglio di passarle o nel quartiere di Alfama o nel quartiere di Bairro Alto, dove sono presenti innumerevoli locali e ristoranti davvero belli!Le cose che non mi sono piaciute di questa città sono state la scarsa pulizia nelle strade e metropolitane, l'alto tasso di barboni, l'alto tasso di spacciatori (anche a pochi passi dalla polizia in qualsiasi parte della città) e se volete un consiglio non provate a passare a piedi, durante la sera, nel quartiere di Intendente (alto tasso di nord africani che rubano, spacciano, prostituzione ecc ecc...)."
30,“Lisbona decadente”,"Il Portogallo è in crisi nera e Lisbona ne è lo specchio! Certo, la città è originale con i suoi quartieri caratteristici, L' Alfama, il Barrio Alto, con i suoi monumenti testimonial, torre di Belem, Jerolamus,con i suoi elevadores e i suoi tram storici, il mitico 28, però sopra a tutto questo aleggia un ' aria di decadenza, sporcizia, miseria, che effettivamente sminuisce quella che potrebbe essere una città migliore.Tanto di cappello alla metropolitana, efficiente e pulitissima, ma. x il resto, sembra di essere a Tangeri.Sporcizia, barboni dappertutto, le case lasciate andare in rovina, ma non x salvaguardare il patrimonio storico ma xchè probabilmente mancano i fondi per rimodernare il tutto, insomma un 'esperienza che merita di essere fatta ma senz'altro non ripetuta"
50,“atmosfera unica”,"Lisbona è una delle città in Europa in cui si respira la migliore atmosfera. La luce è unica, fa risaltare le pietre bianche di molte strade centrali e le piastrelle di azulejos delle case. é una città semplice da girare e accattivante da scoprire. i mezzi pubblici funzionano bene e portano ovunque, anche se il modo migliore per gustarsi l'ambiente cittadino è girare a piedi, magari concentrando la propria attenzione su un quartiere alla volta. Può capitare qua e là di imbattersi in soggetti curiosi, ma del tutto innocui. da non perdere l'assaggio dei pasteis de Belem, nel rispettivo quartiere!"
40,“Bellissima città Lisbona”,"Consiglio a tutti di visitare Lisbona, capitale del Portogallo e attraversata dal fiume Tago. Molto caratteristico il centro storico della città caratterizzato dal piccole vie che di sera si animano di gente.Da non perdere una visita al Castello di Sao Jorge che domina la città e collocato nel quartiere dell'Alfama il più antico di Lisbona. Un'altra attrazione che consiglio di visitare sono la Torre di Belem, costruita sulle rive del fiume Tago per celebrare la scoperta della rotta per l'India del navigatore portoghese Vasco de Gama.Meritano inoltre una visita l'Oceanario (l'acquario con la vasca più grande del mondo) e il Cristo Rei una riproduzione del Cristo Redentore di Rio de Janeiro."
