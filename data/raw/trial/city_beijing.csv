50,“Beijing - good place to learn”,"What happens when you have to travel on Sunday and the visa arrives on Friday evening, well chaos and lot more chaos. I was not at all sure if the visa would come in time, so had not prepared for other stuff too. Moreover, there were work commitments, so wanted to finish that on time, else you know your bosses. So, finally had some hours on Saturday to prepare myself. Thought that nowadays, when you have Google, there should not be a problem. Within a few clicks, came to knew that Google and associated services are banned in China (one more shock, how would I search a hotel, train and what about Gmail, world would stop without it). And to my horror, all this was true when I connected to the net there. I thought of having a translator app that would help, what else can a helpless guy do. Booked a room on Airbnb, quite a pro, I would say. Helped clinch a good place with lot of travellers around, so helped me check the tourist itinerary, this was the intention. Just then, got to knew that there is a sort of survival helpline on wechat (mind you, Chinese prefer their own stuff except Apple, which they have almost accepted as their own, and why not, when you are manufacturing for the world, there seems no second thoughts on Apple too). This service, GRAB-TALK was a big relief, chatting with the staff, I was told one can book tickets for trains, buses, monuments and almost everything that comes to your mind. Come this in India, do we have something similar on whatsapp or any platform, for that matter (someone told me ASKME is quite close, honestly speaking, I found them general service provider, not a travel friendly one). So, here goes an Indian, with a comparison in mind of where do we stand against China (in general). As I landed, the first comparison came alive. There was a thick smog all around, I sighted a relief, we are equal. Development cost you at least that much. Beyond this, nothing I could say I found was comparable. Think of office, mall or any building, for a Delhiwala, these all were huge, huge, huge I would say. Metros is the lifeline of Beijing and they are expanding it at the rate of 10-50 kms every year. By this I mean, a new line or stretch is opened for public, every now and then, Hats off their E. Sridharan. GRAB-TALK booked me tickets for Beijing Sightseeing, entrance to Forbidden city, train tickets for Tianjin and many other places. They also helped me translate via pictures. I sent them image of a place and ask what this stands for, petcam the reply in just a few seconds that this is a eatery, barber shop, milk booth or whatever (as they had closed doors otherwise). Had a good time hopping around China, went to suburban towns as well. Chinese too have adopted Starbucks, KFC, Subway and others with open arms and you can choose from the available menu (in English yes, available.. ha ha ha). By the way, women are totally safe, they were in shorts, enjoying in open, travelling by metro in wee hours but it all seemed normal. We need to learn a lot at least in this area. Can't say if this can be your first country of visit but at-least try to be there once. You get to know where do we compare. A strong collaboration between India - China can rock the world for sure, which somehow is not happening in the present scenario."
50,“Hutongs- A Must See and Do Before you Leave Beijing.”,This is a treat- See Old Beijing. Take a bicycle ride in and through the narrow Hutongs. A must see before you leave Beijing.
40,“Traditional homes still exist”,"An amazing example of early Chinese life in Beijing, the home we visited still lived in but rooms available to rent. A resident artist with some beautiful work available to purchase. A ride in a traditional Pedicab a must to complete the tour."
40,“Have a look at old Beijing”,"This area of Beijing harks back several decades to a time of more simple life in the capital city. The roads are built for bikes and rickshaws, not cars. Families live together in simple houses and the local shops and facilities are family run."
50,“Hutong Tour”,"We took a ride on a ricks haw through the Hutongs These are old and very poor neighborhoods in Beijing. We visited the home of a family, one of which was an artist who pained inside of small bottles. She had been featured at the Olympics giving demonstrations and in the commemorative booklet."
30,“Rikshaw ride and visiting local family at Hutong”,"It's a great experience as Hutong is the only well preserved neighborhood in Beijing from hundreds of years ago. Unfortunately the way they have restored the homes is building whole new grey brick walls on top of the already existing structure, so even though the existing walls are behind the new walls, you don't really see them, thus making it seem as a brand new village. If you expect the experience of walking through ancient Italian town, you will be disappointed. It's important historical part of Beijing, that in my personal opinion you can miss and not be terribly upset. I think visiting the forbidden city or some of the other temples around town is a better experience. Hutong to me almost seems like a weak effort to preserve history with more of a communist approach, if you know what I mean. It's worth the experience perhaps, but don't spend too much time or money on it."
30,“Beware of Rickshaw riders ploy”,"This area is filled with licensed rickshaw drivers for tourists. Its a trap. Cost RMB150 for 45minutes - do bargain. Each home is priced at RMB20 a pax to visit. Maybe one will do. At the end of the ride, the rider will pester you for another RMB50. DO NOT BUDGE. Just walk away. The area is filled with a modern twist so there's no nice ancient feel to anything here. Everything is spruced up - lots of pubs & restaurants here for the younger generation."
50,“Experience the cultural Hutong before it is gone”,"We recently toured the Hutong via Tour Beijing (see my separate post about them) and just loved it! The Hutong is a cultural treasure of Beijing that is rapidly disappearing due to development and is a must-see while it still exists. We opted for the rickshaw tour (plenty of drivers are available all day long) and when it is chilly they provide an appreciated blanket for the ride. This is a pleasant way to see how people really live in the Hutong. Our trip included a family visit and it was great to see an actual home and courtyard. After the rickshaw we walked around the picturesque Houhai lake and down the fantastic Nanluoguxiang street for trendy, local shops and food stalls. If you are exploring on your own, there is a subway stop by the same name right by this street. There are tons of beer bars and this place would be awesome in the evenings and especially on nice warm days!Whether on a tour or on your own, allow a couple hours to explore this unique area and part of the Beijing culture."
40,“Beijing-a great city”,"We were in Beijng for three days and every part of the city that we visitted.On the first day, we went toTian'amenen Square. That was a very big Square- supposed to be the biggest one in the world.Then we went to the Forbidden City from which, the emperors of Ming and Qing dynasties governed for over 500 years.The long corridor was the highlight of the Summer Palace. There were lots of bars on the banks.The 'Hou Hai', a lake in the middle of Beijing and a cruise ride on it was a pleasure time. The 'Pearl shop' and the 'Jade shop' were interesting.There is no need to write much about 'The Grat Wall of China', a world UNESCO World Heritage Site. As said, it is a great view. But, being senior citizens, we found it difficult climbing all the steps. The rise of the steps is too high. So, we had stop half way..The Acrobatic Show that we went to in the evening was too good and was worth it."
40,"“Select access denied in Beijing, China”","As I have just returned from a trip to Beijing , China I thought I would share my experience. I normally,when visiting a country, like to explore the Country on my own as it provides a greater flexibility to spend time at sites you would like to enjoy more. Most countries have wonderful transport systems which facilitate this endeavour. In Beijing however given the fact that very few people speak English and that their language is totally foreign to us making public transport difficult I did not want to venture going out on my own. I discussed this with my friends who were travelling with me at the time and we decided to engage the services of various tour guides. We visited the most famous sites namely Tiananman Square, Forbidden City, the Great wall of China ,Ming Tomb, Summer Palace and Temple of Heaven. Whilst the outbuildings where very interesting it was very disappointing to learn that we were not allowed access into any of them except the Tomb which was empty. Your site seeing is all done exclusively from the outside. One has to wonder why access is denied when the European countries all allow tourist into their wonderful buildings (which housing great works of art) including Cathedrals, Palaces, chapels, tombs etc. Whatever their reason it did detracted from the enjoyment of the trip. What was even more disappointing was their constant drive to make tourists spend money at their various shops. Certainly access here was most welcome. There is no subtlety in their attempt to force you to spend. They have a captive audience and exploit this to the maximum. You are continually taken to outlets with the sole purpose of making you buy their product. We were taken to the silk factory, pearl factory, jade factory, tea ceremony and medical center. When one goes out to shop this could be useful and enjoyable but when one goes out with the sole purpose of enjoying the famous landmarks and are forced into shopping it becomes a nuisance. In retrospect it would have been better to have arranged to visit the sites by taxi ."

The maps are well set out and make travelling here very enjoyable. After being in Berlin and Amsterdam, which have confusing, vague information, I really appreciate the excellent service provided by the Beijing Metro! Great job China!"
50,“Beijing”,"I have been to Beijing a couple of years ago for a personal vacation but I decided not to use conventional tourist guides since I had bad experience with them taking me to tourist traps that I could have gone to myself. Recently, since I was going with a friend and he insisted that we take travel services from Terry and turns out, it was quite eye opening the numerous things I have not seen before from my last trip. We visited some areas that I have not seen before in Beijing and some restaurants and dining venues that are definitely magical. One thing I have to say about the service is that it was truly customized and he really accommodated our desire to explore the “off-beaten” path of Beijing. Turns out, having a tour guide is not a bad thing at all. It was like I was Anthony Bourdain and I am unraveling Beijing beyond its cosmopolitan appeal."

We very much enjoyed their company.The highlight of our trip was the ‘hotpot’ restaurant that they took us to for lunch. We enjoyed stepping away from the tourist scene to experience local Beijing."

Prior to leaving Australia we contacted Susan and asked her advice about tours to places of interest in Beijing during our stay there.She immediately got back to us with an itinerary involving 3 full days of tours. Susan arranged for the four of us to be picked up when we arrived in Beijing by a very efficient courteous driver who took us to our hotel. She also organised for a driver to take us to The Great Wall of China. The drivers were very obliging, their driving skills were excellent and they always arrived on time.Susan organised and accompanied us on all the tours we did daily and she was always very careful of our safety, comfort, health and endurance. Susan tailored our tours to suit our needs of sightseeing and shopping and kept our days at a very easy comfortable pace which we greatly appreciated.Susan is extremely knowledgeable, she has a good sense of humour, is a very caring person, her English is excellent and we would never have been able to get to places of interest or arrange transport without her expertise as there is not a lot of English spoken in Beijing.The four of us highly recommend you engage Susan Liu as your tour guide whilst visiting Beijing as she is a very organised and amazing person.

50,“A great tour guide”,"We were in Beijing in October 2011, after taking a cruise from Anchorage to Tianjin Port. By a wonderful stroke of luck, we booked with Chinatours.com to pick up our party of 8 in Tianjin and take us to the Great Wall and then to our Beijing hotel.We found ourselves in the most capable hands of Xin for our day of touring.Xin had lived in the US for 7 years and has been back in Beijing for 6 years. His English is wonderful!! He understands the American traveler. And he understands the slightly senior set, which our group was. Not too senior! He prepared us fully for what we were going to see and do for the day. Everything was just as he told us. He was so informative about how to bargain with the merchants, a skill with which we Americans have limited experience. He explained history, politics, agriculture, social norms, food, customs. You name it! He answered a slew of questions for us.We were so comfortable and happy with Xin's guidance, that four of us asked if Chinatours.com could take us to the Forbidden City and Summer Palace the next day. He arranged it all for a very reasonable price. Said he did not know who our guide would be the next day, but it might be he. We were delighted to see him waiting for us at the hotel door the next morning. We four had a full, exhausting, delightful day with Xin. Part of the package was lunch. He suggested we have lunch or our own and dinner at a local restaurant with the package. We quickly agreed. For dinner he took us to a neighborhood restaurant near his home where Westerners never go. Since the menu had zero English on it, he ordered five courses for us, including Peking Duck. What a feast! He explained each dish as it came. A great culinary experience for us, thanks to Xin.We had a great experience with Xin as our Chinatours.com guide and so heartily recommend asking for him if you book with Chinatours.com. He works some in the office and is not full-time on the guide end of things. But he is there to ask for.The morning after our second day with him, he was going to meet an Australian tour group and have them for five days. Lucky Aussies! The tour days are anywhere from 10-12 hours, so the tourists are exhausted, but satisfied and educated after their wonderful time with Xin. Chinatours.com is lucky to have Xin and you will be too."
30,“Lukewarm experience”,Today I joined the Badaling + Ming Tombs tour. I was disappointed to be rushed at the Ming Tombs: we saw pictures of statues of animals so we asked if we could see them. Peter said that we had to pay for another ticket and that they were just animals. I was even more disappointed when I realized we had been rushed to go to a jade factory where the group was bored after 10 min but had to stay there and wait for lunch at 11am. The stop at the factory was not advertised in the tour description. After lunch Peter suggested going to another part of the wall because of bad traffic in order not to waste any time- the actual waste of time was the jade factory AND the silk factory we had to go to on the way back to Beijing..not advertised either. I have to say that the walk was great but wanted to see the Badaling part...

The itinerary and guides set up by Kensington was fabulous. As part of our tour we stayed in Beijing. We enjoyed the Forbidden City and the Great wall was spectacular, esp. the location which Kensington took us which is apparently less crowded. Other highlights of our trip included going to the Terra Cotta Warriors, Yangshou, Longji Rice Terraces and Shanghai. Kensington arranged everything and there was never a dull moment."

40,“Beijing Y2011 - More Expensive”,"After Harbin, we visited Beijing after our last visit in Y2006. Stayed at Sanyuan IBIS near subway but far from everything else. That was our choice.Lots of changes. The city is more beautiful with lots of new buildings and attractions. Most were completed just before 2008 Olympic. New attraction we visit as follows:a. Olympic Stadium - a must go - Morning or Evening. Lots of walking and very scenic. We took lots of photos.b. Take the subway - This is an experience for us being from Singapore. Lots of people and if it rains, top side traffic jam, at subway, human traffic jam. Interesting.c. XianMenDajia - a new pedestrian walking street with lots to see. Visit the back lane for interesting experience. Lots of eateries and old Beijing type shopping.d. Visit TainJin - another city next to Beijing. Only 30 minutes via bullet train. Pleasant journey without hassle.We took the subway express to our hotel on arrival but decided to take a cab on our return trip. If you are travelling alone, subway is more worthwhile (RMB 25 per trip). Otherwise take a cab.Cheers,"

30,“Beijing trip”,"June 22, 2011 we arrived in Beijing for the first time. we were picked up form the airport by John , our hired driver. he was very patient and accomodating even it was already past midnigt. he answered all our questions about Beijing and his english is very good. He was also our hired driver going to the great wall in Mutianyu. his email address is konglingzhif@163.comfor our first day, we went by ourselves to the forbidden city, Jiangshan park and across to Beihai park. for the second day, we went to Mutianyu and the summer palace. if your going to the summer palace , take the boat ride going to the corridors, instead of climbing the hill which would take most of your time.for the thrd day, we went to The Temple of heaven, pearl market, hutongs and Drum and bell tower. and for the fourth day, we went to the Lama temple.For the third and fourth day, we hired a guide, Lily Xy at lily_fuwa@yahoo.com, she speaks good english, she explains all the history and importance of each tourist site, and makes sure we are all comforatable. she takes us to restaurants which serves good and affordable food.Our first trip to beijing would be time consuming if we didnt hire a driver and a guide, since its so hard to communicate in this city with so limited english speaking people, unless of course , you have the patience to communicate via hand gestures or you have a dictionary with you."
50,“Kensington Tours - Beijing”,"My daughter and I recently visited Beijing on a guided trip with Kensington Tours. Our tour guide, Liu (Henry) JianHeng was incredible.

He even took the time to teach us some phrases in Mandarin that proved helpful wherever we went. My daughter and I thouroughly enjoyed his company. If you are considering visiting Beijing on vacation, I highly recommend Kensington Tours, but make sure you ask for Henry!"
40,“Honesty in Beijing”,"Upon landing on the Beijing Airport, I left my hand bag in one of the wash-rooms and it took me 20minutes to realized that.

I told her I left my handbag inside and she returned it to me with all my belongings including my passport, untouched.Subsequently, I met helpful taxi drivers all over Beijing and I must say, honesty does exist in China and I have experienced it in Beijing!"

Every aspect of the tour was perfect from the airport pickup on arrival to our return to the airport for departure.Our guide and driver were always on time and did their jobs well and made the most efficient use of the time.There is no other way to see so many Beijing sights in a five day trip as with a guided tour package and this company does it first class.

50,“I want to go back....”,"We spent 5 days in Beijing as part of a longer trip in China during April 2011 this is slightly edited version of emails I sent home.Taking the train from Xian to Beijing we wake about 6.30 in the morning, after a relatively decent night's sleep, we make a coffee , perform ablutions and sit very happily watching out the window (don't mention that I accidentally pulled the curtain off the window...) for the next 2 hours till we arrive in Beijing. Can highly recommend the train on this route.Arrive at Beijing West station, everyone emerges, we follow, Westerners are so slow... And wait and wait and wait no guide. We took photos of the train for a while happily content in the knowledge that we had the phone number and name of the Beijing Guide (prepared this time and insisted on getting it before leaving Xian). By this stage platform virtually empty so down the ramp to the main exit where we emerge preparing to make the phone call. A tall man called, Li is anxiously waiting for us. Long story involving queuing for platform ticket, last minute change as to where these are sold .. etc etc. hence not on platform. What the hell it all works out again.Anyway he seems very nice, we find the car and head into downtown Beijing not far from Tiananmen Square. Very nice Novotel and all mod cons.Breakfast at 10 and we feast on waffles, delicious and a wonderful change from eggs for breakfast, Shower, change and a sense of feeling human again emerges.Meet Li and off to Summer Palace, about an hour away.

Buildings scattered around the grounds, cool breezes and can easily imagine the Emperor's court and 3000 concubines heading there to escape the 45 degree Beijing heat. Nothing like a summer holiday with all the family, beats camping.Never enough time and back towards the city with a brief stop at an overbridge to view the Olympic Site; Birds Nest, Water Cube and buildings in the overall shape of a dragon which was administrative and residential.Arrive at Hutongs for tour (took 5 mins) but end up in home of a hutong family. Since I was last here Hutongs are virtually unrecognisable, they've been cleaned up, widened, and generally made acceptable for foreigners, Family however are wonderful, met Mum, and son about 12. We are served tea and somehow or other chat. Mum does tapestries and the work is incredibly fine. A highlight.Leave there to be 'invited' to learn about tea ceremony. Off we go, spend 15 minutes learning about tea and 30 mins being sold too... will we ever learn?Drive back to hotel along one side of Forbidden City and dinner in one of the several hotel restaurants.We've decided we like Beijing, I'm finding it quite different to 2005, more open feeling certainly more touristy, but a good feeling. So far it's winning over Xian.We decide to lay down a few rules in the morning re shopping visits, trouble is that you're in the middle of them before you realise they're happening.Anyway, another day another fight in the crowds and another day learning about this ancient culture.Day 20 BeijingWell the delightful weather we've experienced came to an abrupt end today, I'm convinced that the wind and dust I experienced in Kashgar is following me across the country. Back into the jeans, warm tops and jacket. Not the best day to experience some of the outdoor highlights but we cope, mostly with numerous coffee/tea stops and/or shop visits.I meant to tell you that i am rapidly aging, from being older than my companion - yesterday the delightful child we met in the Hutong told me very kindly that I reminded him of his grandmother. I expressed my thanks through Li and then asked how old his grandmother is ... 70. Great.Today Li made a joke early on at the Temple of Heaven that with the wind, given he was so thin, he might blow away. He compounded the joke by hiding behind me every time there was a strong wind gust, establishing that the word he was looking for was 'anchor'. So very nicely, I am both old and fat though Li kindly told me later that at times I look quite young, mostly when I laugh, like girl he said. Now very confused...Assuming all this is positive feedback and certainly no doubt meant kindly.Anyway day started at 9 with a drive to the Temple of Heaven, a brilliant park complex with every family in Beijing out for a good time in the park. We walked around a little to observe the older people (perhaps this is my short term destiny) playing cards, knitting, playing chess and backgammon. We're told that as they are all retired this is what they do all day. Some do Tai Chi and gentle exercise, or dance. There was a loud group singing and playing instruments. The music had a familiar martial air about it and when I asked, yes, these were the songs the older people remembered from their youth, mostly from the Chairman Mao years. There were song books for sale and many people were joining in, fabulous and atmospheric. I believe that Marg and i should start an Australian chapter in Hyde Park singing the 'Red Flag' and the 'Internationale'.We then moved onto the actual Temple of Heaven which is a large complex that the Emperor came to once a year to pray for good harvests. There are several walkways and for once the Emperor didn't take the middle one, that was for God - Marg and I did though, very godlike. It is a beautiful place and would be very peaceful if not for the tourists. What is striking here is that the tourists are 90% Chinese, most local, some overseas Chinese, they are visiting we are told, often in workgroups, to enjoy their heritage. Perhaps this is something we could encourage in our workgroups.There is also an Echo type temple - not sure of the name - where you can stand on one spot and speak in a normal level which can be heard at two points each at 45 degrees to that point and about 15 metres away where the voice can be heard. The emperor would come once a year and various ceremonies including a little animal sacrifice would take place.From there onto a Pearl Factory (least said the better, will discuss no further) and then to Tiananmen Square. A lot has changed since I was last here, not least of which is a security entry point with bag check and soldiers everywhere. Two huge screens have been erected in the middle to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the New China - today they were showing a video on colourful ethnic minorities - ""Xinjiang is a nice place"" . .. what can I say. Lots of singing and dancing by colourful ethnic minorities. Also last time I remember families flying kites etc etc, apparently these days it is forbidden. It is a wonderful public space which allows for 1 million people, a remarkable space to experience, despite the soldiers marching everywhere. I'd really like to visit the Peoples Congress Building on our free day, we'll see what that brings.Down the stairs through the road underpass to the main entrance of the Forbidden City, now the Palace Museum. We walk through 2 massive gates, both at least 10 metres thick which shows unexpected visitors didn't often get in, especially with a moat... Eventually end up in a courtyard which is the main entrance. Li purchases our tickets and gives us our last minute instructions. We are to be left alone!!! [We knew we wanted to spend more than the scheduled 2 hours here, so had arranged for no guide] We cope.Onwards and upwards mostly into the gale force wind, cold and gusty. We go through the first three buildings to find a cafe for lunch and coffee. By this stage 2pm and with wind battering, we need sustenance. Found in a cafe that was formerly the headquarters for imperial officials as well as a 4 Star toilet, truly, we have the photos of the official sign. We also spend time in the Museum Shop and for once Marg is not the only purchaser, wonderful quality at good prices. Essentially with map in hand we wander up the middle of the City, the other two sides are full of palaces and temples and spaces that we don't have time to see this visit but promise to invest a few days here next visit! The place is a bit 'samey' but unique and massive. Having seen the ""Last Emperor"" we feel quite at home. The thousands of other visitors, mostly Chinese, enjoy the spectacle as well. While we are overawed by the vast size, given many people entered and never left the place, it may well have become a little cramped. The reality is that one can understand why a revolution occurred.We end up in the Imperial Garden which is wonderful, even in the horrendous wind. A last glance around and we arrive at the North Gate to exit the building dead on closing at 5pm.Walk along the road to find a taxi which stops eventually, don't know if we are overcharged but don't care, warm taxi, quick drive home and a scotch awaits...We are really enjoying Beijing ...it is a wonderful city and so much to see and do, five days will not be enough prompting discussion of a return visit...Another fine day, we are getting to like Beijing a lot. I'm finding it much more enjoyable as a city than on my previous visit. There is no doubt that the Olympics have made a huge difference. People seem more open and willing to try and communicate, street signage is in English and generally the place feels more accessible.Tonight we drove back through the city along one of the main roads lined with office buildings, the modern architecture is outstanding. The lights were on, special lights obviously for nights and the atmosphere was wonderful. Would like to spend more time here just checking out the old as well as the new. really much more taken with Beijing overall as a city than Xian, despite it's size.We started today by driving about one and half hours out of the city towards the Great Wall at Mutianyu, different to Simitai which I did before, This section is more accessible though very steep. The whole section has been restored and the views are magic with the Wall winding back into the distance over the mountain ridges. We copped out and took the cable car up, given my fear of heights, suffice it to say my eyes were closed most of the way. Once up there we walked along for a while taking photos and just generally admiring ourselves for being there. Naturally I stuck to the centre of the walkway which is about 4-5 metres wide (just in case after 2000 years, the Great Wall decided to collapse). While chewing on a Snickers bar, Marg lost a filling on the ... so have just now found out she can head over to the Hospital first thing in the morning where people speak English . She's found the Concierge extremely helpful.We descended, again by Cable car 90 minutes later to be met by Li waiting patiently. We (I) recover and buy the mandatory T Shirts ""I climbed the Great Wall"" which have increased 3 fold in cost since my last visit. We eat locally at a small restaurant partaking of pork and cabbage dumplings and local beer, both of which were lovely. The sellers are much more organised these days, compared to my memories of Simitai, little stalls winding back up the street for about half a kilometre. Mutianyu is in the middle of an orchard and farming area. The fruit trees are just starting to blossom, I must say I really am enjoying this part of China as far as landscape goes. I loved Xinjiang and Gansu but was there too early in the spring for any colour other than brown and a bit of grey, this green is fabulous.We agree to yet another exhibition/retail experience and hit a porcelain showroom. The quality of the merchandise is outstanding. Stunning. Not cheap and we are now a bit more clever, and don't take credit cards or large amounts of currency. So a small purchase each.Headed back to town, Li suggests we could have the mandatory meal of Peking Duck. We had intended to have it one night, so why not. An upmarket restaurant near the Olympic Centre so we get some time there viewing the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube - with millions of others. There are also good views of the 5 buildings which seem to create a dragon along the rooftop - fabulous.The meal is okay but probably not the best we've ever eaten and fairly pricey but what the hell we've had it now.Back at hotel, Marg finds information about a dentist and chases her lost underwear from the laundry, both quests are successful.Tomorrow we're on our own and I think probably looking forward to it. Marg will go to try and sort her tooth out and I'll find China Post to send stuff home in the hope that we might be able to be underweight on the flight to Giulin and eventually on the flight home.Last full day in Beijing and sorry we are leaving but an excellent day...Despite the misgivings of various child guides, we seem to cope quite well when left to our own devices.A relatively late start at about 10am, we found our way via the Concierge's Chinese characters used for a taxi driver to the 'Union Hospital' (Peking Union Medical College Hospital where it cost less for Marg to have treatment than for a Singapore Sling later in the day) which has an international section with some English speaking medicos. A bit confusing on the ground floor but Marg now also has a card entitling her to treatment there. (I'd acquired one in Lanzhou) We headed up to the third floor to the various rooms dedicated to each medical speciality. We both had the same thought about the nursing staff, of whom there seem to be hundreds, together with as many doctors ... the uniform is white white white with the little caps worn by nurses in the TV soapies about 1965 - Ben Casey and Dr Kildare (for those under 50, don't worry about it.) Margaret was literally inside waiting and being treated for only about 45 minutes while I pretended to read a book and actually watched the people. The Doctor/Dentist came to Beijing for university 18 years ago and has never left. We want to find out whether there are dentist's surgeries as we understand them as both our guide and the concierge both immediately said international hospital rather than a surgery. Marg was given a temporary filling which should last her a few weeks.From there, another taxi also courtesy of the concierge's Chinese characters, to the China Post International Business office to send a parcel back to Sydney. They knew exactly what to do, spoke a little English, helped pack it all up and it is now, hopefully on its way home [It did arrive safely about 2 weeks later]. Very kind and helpful people who made what could have been difficult very easy.Another taxi was a little hard to come by as they didn't want to go to Tiananmen Square - probably the traffic but one eventually stopped and dropped us nearby. By this stage it was 1.30pm and we were hungry and found a nice restaurant on the Square with a light BBQ beef, onion pancakes, rice and beer, Very nice.Emerged from there and spent several hours wandering around TS, including the North Gate which has been opened to foreigners, we think, courtesy of a young man who said, no I am not a guide but a volunteer in TS. It is an incredible place, we hoped to see the People's Congress building but it was closed still had a marvellous time just enjoying the good weather and walking around.Strangely we passed several up market hotels including the Beijing Raffles. I've never been to Raffles and Marg thought she should compare with Singapore. A Singapore Sling later and we both wanted to move in. Superb hotel and we very much enjoyed it.We wanted to check out Wanfujing Street which is the main shopping street with rather a good book shop which we enjoyed.Finally decided to brave the Subway - can't be in a city this size and not check it out. Rush hour. But only two stops with a change of line in between and managed with relative ease. Even the crowds seem to behave but the Chinese crowds are unbelievable overall and frankly I am pleased we are heading to a relatively quiet part of China. On the other hand both Marg and I love Beijing and will be sorry to leave.I'm not sure what it is, it's not a really warm city but people cooperate and there is so much to see just walking around. It's not just the old, but the new, the history, the pride in that history and culture and the overwhelming size of the place. Having mastered the Subway we are confident of getting around. It will be shame to leave and the reality is that a return visit would be highly recommended.Another early start tomorrow as it's a fair way to the airport and we fly to Guilin arriving mid afternoon. Now the weight of the luggage is dramatically decreased I should be allowed to fly.Final day in Beijing and we are out of the hotel about 9am to go to the airport, drive is about an hour but we have the opportunity to see some more of this incredible city. Quite happy as we sit and gaze out the window. Again we pass through streets of office blocks which are amazing, nothing samey about them. Li told us that they often house a huge number of businesses. For instance he told us that one of things he does is translations. There is a business with an address on a floor of one of these buildings but it is a tiny office with 3 desks and computers. There are 3 people, Managing Director and 2 Operations managers (of which he is one) who actually work there, but they have a network of translators of over 100 people who they contact to do the translations as necessary into over 15 languages.Airport is massive as you'd expect it to be, we head for Terminal 3 which is domestic although there are international flights to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.We farewell Li who has moved back into businessman mode and was ready to move onto the next item on the agenda. We'd been dropped a little early (good idea in Beijing to allow for traffic problems) so had a cuppa, went through security to the gate and waited for the 12.30 flight to Guilin. After about an hour it was apparent there was a delay, so we waited some more. Eventually took off an hour late to arrive in Guilin."
30,"“The pollution is terrible, but the history is interesting”","The pollution is actually stinging to the eyes and makes breathing difficult by the end of the day. Most of the sights are similar, once you've seen one building, you've seen them all. This is a very dirty and smelly city.Avoid the Badaling section of the wall and head out of town to the Jinshanling section, it was fantastic.The subway is cheap and very efficient. It even goes to the airport since the 2008 Olympics.Glad to have seen Beijing, but also glad I only spent four days here."
10,“So called Donghuamen long distance bus station.”,"Was trying to get to Chengde for a couple of days while in Beijing.Was recommended by some reviews/website to go to Donghuamen long Distance bus station to catch the bus. Although it was printed on the map of Beijing city, the station did not actually exist. Wasted an hour and half looking for it!!There is a bus station there but no buses go to Chengde. Eventually found out that one has to catch the bus from San Yuan Jiao stationRather a disappointed trip!!"
50,"“great city, sights and people. shame about the smog !”","One of the historic cities of the world, Forbidden city and the great wall are real treasurers. we hired a guide for these two days ( including Audi A6 and driver) for 100 pounds. it was an excellent choice as we got to the attractions as they opened and had a brief time to enjoy them in peace and quite before the hordes decended... the great wll is best done as early as possible to avoid crowds, heat and insects.... we used the subway to get around when we wanted to go any distance ( 20p) per trip... What value since the roads are in a permanant gridlock.A trip to the pearl market or Silk street for all those travel gifts and divide what your asked by 3 always !!!!!The smog is by far the worst part of the city...."
40,“3 in China for 3 weeks”,"So we all made it to Beijing, some of us better then others. While some of us were sipping wonderful champagne others were crammed with our knees into our throats. Needless to say some of us had a better flight then others!So we arrived a little early into Beijing and entered a very new terminal that is huge. The customs and immigration process is very modern, they have facial recognition software and body temp stuff so when you approach the immigration officials they scan your face, passport and visa photo to determine it is you.Daughter's suitcase came off long before ours did. Absolutely no on around at customs so we just walked out and let the fun begin. I was now about 12:30 am April 29. We got in a line to get a cab and boy was that something. The line was long and instead of calling the cabs up in groups and loading people they call the cabs forward, open up the line and everyone just runs to try and secure a cab. It took us a few cycles to secure a spot as it was a very aggressive process.We got a cab and I had the hotel info printed in Mandarin so we were okay,......The ride to the hotel is estimated at 100 CNY, our bill was 250 CNY. But that was the meter reading. So not a lot we could do. Rob then asks for a receipt, which is what you are advised to do as it has the cab license plate on it and if you forgot anything you could track it down. The cabbie would not give us one, and DH became suspicious and became insistent and then the cabbie drove away but the hotel staff had him stopped.It is now around 1:15 am and we are very bleary. As we are checking in to the Marriott City Wall the cabbie is brought back. A long conversation ensues, the 3 of us, 3 Marriott employees and the cabbie, who is very nasty and accusatory, and this was all done in Mandarin but was clear from the seething looks and body language. To make a long story short, we got back 100 CNY so he still made out ahead and DH gave the Marriott guys a large tip.Check in went more then smoothly. They gave us a room with 2 king beds on the concierge level. It is huge room and has a dvd player. It is now about 2:00 am and we asked for wake up call for 6:00 am as Victor is coming to take us to the Great Wall at 7:30 am.Surprise even though we hoped for 4 hours of a nap we are all up by 5:00 am so we head up for breakfast on the concierge level. Quite a wonderful spread, everything from smoked salmon to salads to fresh baked goods to made to order omelets. Rob had his cappuccino so all was well.Victor was on time and we set out for Mutinayu section of the great wall. This trip took about 90 minutes and it was an interesting drive. Victor's english is excellent and gave us all kinds of info.The weather was all over the boards, It was ""foggy"" more like pollution haze, it got a little sunny, it was windy and it rained mud, yes I said and mean it rained mud. Victor took us to buy our tickets and sent us in the correct direction to head up.We took a cable car up to the wall and words really can not describe how you feel when you set foot on this ancient structure. It is crowded around the points where you arrive. There are 2 ways up to the wall here, 3 if you count hiking up the hill/mountain side to get to the wall. You can go up on a chair lift or the cable car. You can come down those 2 ways or take a toboggan/water slide without the water down. These arrive on the wall in 2 different areas.We arrived on the wall at tower number 16 and hiked up to number 20, then we headed down to tower number 6 to come down. The toboggan wasn't running, it was very windy so we took the chair lift down, this whole walk was about 3 km, which sounds short but it is hiking and climbing sometimes on stairs, sometimes just the incline, not a stroll by any means. All in all it took about 2.5-3 hours.We met Victor at the bottom and headed off to the summer palace with a stop for lunch. We went to a place near the summer palace and were the only occidentals. Victor joined us and we had 4 fabulous dishes. The restaurant is known for oat noodles. They were fabulous. We had 2 veg dishes and 2 meat dishes and 2 beer. Everyone left happy for under $25.The summer palace was ridiculously crowded. Once again Victor took us by the hand, bought our tickets and directed us through. We planned to walk around and meet at a different gate where he would meet us. He gave us his cell phone so we could call him when we arrived at the North Rui Gate. Worked like a charm.From here we asked Victor to take us to see the Olympic Village area for a photo op, he did. We saw the water cube and bird's nest, both of which are much larger then they appeared on TV.We arrived back here at 5:45 pm, running on 3 hours of sleep and decided to just have some food in the concierge lounge. Good decision, the food was varied, excellent and ready to go. Daughter drank some champagne, I had white wine and Db had a g & T. Asleep by 8 and up at 4 am. Now we will head up breakfast and plan the day.Victor:chinapeace88@sina.com0086-1314-132-9911TBC~to be contiuned"
30,“A nice place to visit but buyer beware!”,"Date: March 2011Beijing was an interesting city to visit. The Forbidden Palace, Tianemen Square, Summer Palace, Great Wall, etc. The city was modern and clean. With the Olympics, many of the buildings were new and beautifully designed. The hotels were first class and the food excellent! Although there were millions of people in the city, the people I encountered were friendly and helpful.My only huge disappointment was the Jade Factory (Run-Jen). WARNING: DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU AREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST AND THE QUALITY.The prices were exhorbitantly high. The sales people and the manager do not tell the truth about the jewelry they are selling so buyer beware. i.e. the metal they claim it to be set in; gold vs gold plated; Platinum vs white gold, etc. If you get 70% off their sticker price, you'll be paying close to what you'd pay in the U.S.!"
40,“The capital of China”,"Beijing is such a big city.Great wall,Summer palace,forbidden city,a lot of temples and Beijing roast duck(quan ju de).We spent 3 whole days on visiting the city.Due to 2008 Olympic games,there are many new stadiums.You can ride a bike and fly a kite.I like those narrow alleys,many of them disappeared due to the city re-construction."
50,“The Best Four Day Tour of Beijing”,"Date: April 2011--We have wanted to see Beijing for at least fifteen years and finally found a deal too good to pass up. Beijing is probably the most facinating city we have ever visited in our twenty years of travelling abroad.China Highlights Travel arranged for our hotel, sightseeing, and transportation for the four days we were there. We saw all of the usual sights and many more off the usual tour bus routes. We worked with our travel representative for several weeks to plan our trip and select the important locations we wanted to visit the most.Our hotel was the SunWorld Hotel located in the central business district. It was a great hotel and location with a wonderful breakfast buffet and two nice resturants.The ancient city of Beijing has so many treasures to see that you will need to choose a few and leave many more for the future. However, the time constraints can be lessened by having your own guide and car at your disposal. We were picked up each day at our hotel and driven to our various destinations in airconditioned luxury. Our guide purchased our admission tickets and gave us an in-depth discussion of the historical and cultural importance of each stop.Our favorite cultural and historical sites were the Forbidden City, the Mutianyu Great Wall, located about 45 miles northwest of the city, and the Wofo Temple and Fragrant Hills botanical gardens. The Beijing Capital Museum and the Beijing Zoo were our favorite modern venues, We loved the rickshaw tour of the hutong and the lunches at several different resturaunts. The Nine Meter Noodle lunch at the edge of the Xicheng District was a noisy event but the food was great. Our favorite shopping was at the Lizexiang Pearl Shop, the state-operated Cloisonne Factory, and the flea market at Panjiayuan Market.The pre-planning made a world of difference since our guide and driver knew where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see during our short stay. Our one unplanned evening was a trip to see the Chinese Acrobatics Show at a small Beijing theater.If you have limited time and limited resources, I can recommend this approach to visiting one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world."
40,"“Family Trip - City of Beijing, China”","My family and I just returned from a week long family trip to Beijing, China. There were 5 of us. 2 Adults and 3 teenagers. It was a wonderful experience. We were a little apprehensive about going into a country where we couldn't speak or read the language. We booked our own reservations at the Lee Garden extended stay hotel. Our accomodations were a very spacious 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment with a kitchen - dining room table and living room. It was very centrally located - this is very important as the traffice in Beijing can be harrowing. We got a roll away for an additional cost. All of our hesitations were swept away after a friend recommended a Chinese friend - personal guide to show us Beijing. This is the only way to go~ It was was very convenient. Her name was ""Cici"" sisitf@yahoo.com.cn. She spoke pretty good english and very knowledgeable about Chinese history. She planned each of our days excursions and then included any night activities that we wanted. She had a driver that picked us up in a van each day. She gave us one very reasonable price and that included all the charges. We never paid for anything after that. We hit all of the major attractions of Beijing - Most of them you will find in any tourist book. She would also take us to lunch each day and order authentic Chinese dishes for us to try. Some we liked and some we didn't - but it was a great experience. Meals were included in her very reasonable price. The nice thing about having a guide was that she stayed with us everywhere we went and took care of everything so we never had to struggle with the language barrier. She even accompanied us on the 2 mile hike to the Great Wall and then after a wonderful lunch we were treated to a Chinese foot massage. At night we enjoyed the Chaoyang Theater Acrobatic Show. It was 1.25 hours and very entertaining. Prepare yourself for the Smog of Beijing. We had 2 windy days and got a reprieve from the smog – but within a day or 2 it returned and was bad. I can’t even imagine what it is like in the hot summer. Sometips: Tipping is not allowed. The price you are quoted is the price that it is. This is a communist country. We did use the tap water to brush our teeth and nothing happened to us. We even at some raw vegetable food and we were okay. Shopping. Please – you would not believe the overstated price vendors first give you. Example – I was purchasing a Snickers bar to eat on our hike of the Great Wall. I asked how much. He told me 30 RMB’s which comes out to $5. Holy Cow – After I figured that out, I said no way and walked away – then he came back and said okay 5 RMB’s. Wow. Don’t be taken. When you are quoted an price don’t be afraid to offer one quarter of what they are asking. Be prepared to walk away – they will chase you down and be more reasonable. This goes for all of the markets. Even the nice pearl markets. Everything is negotiable! Feel free to contact me if you want more information or have questions."

Catherine is also very nice. to the great wall she arranged a new van to take us, so with her you feel safe and pleased because she is clever, very kind and respectful..."
40,“When in China visit Beijing”,"How can you not visit Beijing when in China, it's a must! The Great Wall, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, Lama Temple, the list is endless...The transportation is magnificent, just like NYC, subways, cabs, bus you name it. I used the cabs and subways the most and I was satisfied with that, however I was a bit taken back at rush hour time, it was bad, I mean really really bad and it would last from 4 - 8pm and the cabs raised there rates 4x at time of rush hour. I was looking forward on renting a bike for the day but did not see anyone offering that nor did I see a large amount of people riding bikes, I really thought I was going to be in bike land. Amsterdam had more bikes than Beijing!I visited Beijing with my boyfriend and to my surprise he wanted to shop, not just one day but pretty much every day we were there, it was like another person, I loved it ofcourse. In between our trips to the main attactions (Great Wall, Forbidden City, etc) we squeezed in shopping time in Sanlitun and Silk Market. We visited each one once and regret not going back. Our trip to Asia was amazing, I will state this, and included the cities of Beijing, Chengdu and Hong Kong - Macau. With that said I or we figured since we didnt have a chance to revisit the Silk Market we would find more thing in Chengdu or Hong Kong, wrong!! We were looking for replica luxury goods aka knock-offs, let me tell you this the price and quality we found in Beijing was far better and cheaper there than in Hong Kong. If there was a fight between PEK and HKG, Beijing would be the Tyson and HKG would be Fat Jesus (The Hangover).We also enjoy going at night, we tried the Sanlitun Bar Street which consisted of about 10 bars, by the looks of them they look really fun but once inside we were bored. We wanted dancing and music and all we got was music. We tried KTV, I had fun but was frustrated b/c no one spoke english and we got charged 2x for our drinks. The most enjoyable night we had was at Patty O Shea's which to our luck was close to our hotel. I know we were not in central Beijing but in a city with a population that big I was a bit dissapointed.The moral of my review, buy buy buy shop shop shop while in Beijing."
50,"“Excellent all around private guide, with a special arts background”","Booked Lesley Jian for two days of sightseeing with a special emphasis on art. Lesley was extremely knowedgeable about Beijing, its sights and other aspects. Speaks fluent english and is very personable. In addition to the special museums, she toured extensively with us to the 798 Art Zone and the even better Chaoyang Art District. Contact me for her email and telephone information. She is exceptional and worth every penny. She does and can travel with you to other cities if needed."
20,"“Beijing, all the way from Belfast”","It has been a trip to the other side of the moon to me. China is a world of its own, Beiijing China that is. Its sooo central, people live piled high ontop of each other, so many people.. Foreign travellers unregistered country people, low class high class workers, and old and young living together in this dense overwhelmingly big city.The flight to Beijing, as you have all heard was way tooo long! I admit to shedding a few tears with my 11 month old during the first part of the last flight. Little Dtlan decided to stay awake the entire journey.First thing that surprised me about Beijing was the humongous airport, it was lit up with christamas colored lights at night, me and dillys jaw dropped when we saw that. Second was the smell of Beijing, ohhh whats that??- it wasnt pleasant is all I can say. Fei tells me its the smell he loves the smell of Beijing, and what was that in the sky, fog of course a thick layer surrounding the city heehee mmmmmmmmm...soo many Chinese people everywhere, suddenly I stood out, especially with my son. At first the attention scared me a little, I woried if I offended anyone, or worried what they thought, or worried they talked about me, but soon my self conscious side died down, and I enjoyed the attnetion. All the attention brought a new side out in Dylan, he flashed smiles, shouted, clucked his tongue, clapped his hands, pointed his little finger all to grab more and more crowds. It was then realized that Dylan took afte a movie star not me! He got asked to be in a commercial, and he was on tv al in one short trip, I brag! They Love children in China, and I believe children there are smothered in attention. I didnt like strangers constantly touching and giving me advice to my son. I didnt like it when I felt overwhelmed by strangers, but I did think Chinese people treated mothers with a lot of care, and I got a lot of rest in China. My son got loads of attention he just doesn't get int he states or any other country we've been to.The food I enjoyed for the first couple of weeks, but after a while if your american you might crave plainer food. it was popular at the time I was in China, 2010- to have spicy hot pot food, and it was hard to enjoy if you weren't used to spicy food. I also enjoyed things like dim-sum but then after a while got sick of the sweetness. It was nice to get back to boring american sandwiches and stuff like that.My husband being Chinese I really got a very real experience of China, and I loved his family for they treated me like royalty. The home cooked food in China is the best I had while we stayed there. You would be best to make friends with locals there and ditch the tourism deal altogether.I walked around the forbidden city instead of going in, I went to the mountain behind it, the views were amazing, I got to hike lingshan mountain with my baby tied to me, and I felt like a Chinese warrior after that. I visited the beautiful budhist temples, a must see, and the summer palace. I enjoyed quite a bit of shopping but, you gotta be quick with you eye, and play quite a few mind games to get what your looking for.We did quite a bit of walking just for the experience of the alleyways and tasty food stands. But the public transportation is fantastic theres buses, the subway, and bikes everywhere, we ended up used an electric bike, i found it terrifying to be on the road with the baby strapped to me at first but in the end it was the quickest way out of traffic, and the best way to view the city. I got to see an old Chinese house, Feis grandparents lived in that it was full of their memories, while i was there they wre in the middle of restoring it, I could feel the history in that place, it was so old. I think I was still very overcome by how dirty China was, and how much the majority of the older population didn't care like we Americans do about keeping clean in the sense of cleaning products. They seem to care much more about personal achievements, and family traditions.I grew up in a smallish sized irish town, so Beijing is kind of its polar opposite in many ways, I would say I think its a bit to far from home for me, but outside of the city I appreciated its beauty, and inside the city I had a very deep respect for Chinese values, and think of how lucky I was to experience the other side of the world, and become more open minded about who the Chinese really are, and what in life truly matters.This is a bit of a rushed review, I find it hard to sum up these experiences, but if you have questions please email me."
40,"“A great time, but poor air quailty”","I really love the History in Beijing, it truly is an amazing city, but the Air Quailty is VERY poor, had a hard time to breath and I am sure I took many years off my life in the 3 days that I was their."
50,“my favorite place in beijim is the great wall”,"Beijing-Great WallDate: August 27 2010Reviewer: a trip advisor member,Curitiba,BRASILIt is A WONDERFUL PLACE. 4nigths (three days) to visi the mai sites in Beijing is enough. But when I was on the GREAT WALL(Badalin ) my husband have his walet stollen by a .pick pocketI stayed at Crown Plaza Hotel. Great location, near pedestrian street and has an excelent breakfast"
50,“Here we were mostly Tourists”,"One caution. The air quality in Beijing is questionable at best. People with breathing problems should avoid it.But, if you can handle the air, it is a very historic place. We visited all the traditional places. One place we did visit that most tourists will not was a Chinese Scholar Stone exhibit and sales. The stones here were spectacular and expensive, up to $1 million USD. The dinner they sponsored also included some great entertainment."
40,“Shopping in China”,"We went with a tour group that went from Beijing to Shanghai. I was amazed at all of the people on our tour who paid the asking price for everything. My suggestion is if you are planning to purchase pearls, rugs, jade or anything else to comparison shop in the US or if you don't have time, at least check out the prices on ebay. We had people who paid $7000 for a $3000 full retail in the US rug and then had to get it home and pay duty on the $7000. There was one place that asked $10,000 for a $600 fresh water pearl necklace. They tried to tell me it takes a long time to match fresh water pearls. That is not true. Fresh water pearls take a much shorter time to grow than the saltwater pearls and are more prolific. I have purchased pearls from a reputable seller on ebay and know that you can get fresh water necklaces for $30. With the pearls ask for only AAA or better. As many people get ripped off with fake pearls, have the seller write in English on the receipt what you purchased and with the black South Sea pearls that it is not dyed and pay with a credit card. That way if you buy one of the many fakes they pass off, you can get your money back from the credit card. Even the little booths have access to doing credit cards. You may pay a 3% fee, but it is worth it for the peace of mind. If you pay way too much then that the credit card company cannot help you with. We bought my sister a 12-13.7 mm black Tahitian double strand AAA pearl necklace for $2500 so do not pay the crazy prices they ask for one strand. Someone else might have gotten a better deal than we did if they have better negotiating skills. Even the nicest places will negotiate with you. There are lots of people running around selling little items for ""one dollar"". You can negotiate with them too. We got post cards at the imperial palace ltwo for the $1 instead of one pack for the $1. We probably could have done better, too. One cute thing to bring back is these little kimono things that fit over wine bottles. they ask one dollar, we gave them 5 rmb each. They still make a profit and we bought a dozen. The fake watches go for $2.50 each not the $10 some on our tour paid. If you see something in a store, do not immediately buy it, check the other stores around there and you will probably get it cheaper. Watch out for fake silk scarves. They aren't real silk. If you do find some real silk ones, don't pay more than a dollar.Do not bring in lighters to China, you will not be able to take them out of the country in your checked suitcase. They passed a new law that does not allow lighters in the suitcases even when they are checked through. My husband brought a good lighter from home and a cheap 1 rmb lighter. They triggered the alarm on the suitcase being checked through and I had to meet with a police officer and take them out. We didn't care about the cheap 1 rmb lighter, but his good lighter had to be given away. By the way, there are vendors asking $1 for the 1 rmb (15 cents) lighters."
50,“a lot of place to visit”,a great city. There are many places to go. great wall.
30,“Beijing”,"Beijing was a large, but interesting city. Places not to be missed: Great Wall of China, Bei Hai park, marketplaces, The Forbidden City and Tianamen Square. Few people speak English and the city has a lot of smog."
50,"“Beijing: Modern City, Ancient History”","Although this was my 4th trip to China, it was my first to visit Beijing. I had heard of all the smog and smoke that blanketed the city, but was pleasantly surprised to find blue skies, bright sunshine and clear air when I arrived. Unfortunately this only lasted for 2 days. On my 3rd day I awoke to find fog and gray conditions. However, the sun did peak out in the afternoon through the gray haze.The first full day I started out at the Forbidden City. What a magnificent site and the history is simply incredible. The Forbidden City was the Chinese Imperial Palace during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is one of the five most important palaces in the world. It covers 182 acres. There are 90 palaces located within the city's gates; 980 buildings and 9,999 rooms. The City is surrounded by a moat that is over 19 feet deep and a 33 foot high wall. The buildings are all red signifying good luck, energy and fire (to ward out evil). There is an abundance of gold on the rooves and trim which was the symbol of the royal family and represents both earth and wealth. Throughout there are paintings of Chinese characters and animals in blue, green and white. These colors are representative of health, prosperity, renewal, immortality and fulfillment. I spent over two hours wandering through the Forbidden City and emerged at the Meridian Gate that exits to Tian'anmen Square.Tian'anmen Square is the largest city square in the world at nearly 109 acres. It was the site of the 1989 student protests where many were killed. Today it is an area of celebration and relaxation for the Chinese as well as foreign visitors. Included in the square are Mao's Mausoleum, the Great Hall of the People and the Monument to the People's Heroes.Next stop was the Temple of Heaven. The Chinese never did anything on a small scale. While the temple itself is not too large, the grounds cover over 674 acres. The temple was visited by the emperors to pray for a good harvest.The final stop of the day was to the Summer Palace on the shores of Lake Kunming. It is a beautiful retreat. Included is the Long Corridor that was built for the Emperor's Mother so that she could enjoy the outdoors and be protected from the elements. There is a great deal of artwork here.The next day I journeyed outside central Beijing to the Ming Tombs and the Underground Palace. While it was an interesting site, it is one I would skip in favor of more time elsewhere.Finally I continued on to the Great Wall at Badaling. What a spectacular site and what a thrill to walk on the wall. Spanning more than 5,500 miles, it was built to protect the Chinese from invaders. The wall has flat, sloping surfaces as well as steep and narrow steps. While it is a strenuous climb in places, it is well worth the effort to climb and look back across the valley and marvel at the skill of the Chinese who built this beginning in 220 BC.Another day I visted the Olympic Park where the 2008 Olympics were held. The park is being maintained and there are lots of visitors. For a small fee one can go inside both the Bird's Nest (the main arena where Opening and Closing Ceremonies and Track and Field Events were held) and the Cube (Swimming, Diving and Syncrhonized Swimming). It is easy to imagine the competitions; to see ""the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.""Another interesting site was a visit to Beihai Park, adjacent to the Forbidden City. It is a beautiful Imperial Park with lakes, and temples. One can take rides on the lake, walk through the park and enjoy entertainment as locals dance and provide music for onlookers.If you are going to visit Beijing, you will need a good pair of walking shoes as you must walk to see the city. Taxis are relatively inexpensive. Carry a card with the name of your hotel in Chinese characters and the places you want to go. Show this to the driver and he will get you safely to your destination. Traffic is horrendous, so be prepared and plan extra time to arrive at various locations. However, while traffic is bad, the drivers are very patient and polite allowing for an orderly flow of traffic. I did not see dented or damaged cars nor did I see any accidents while there. The roads are in excellent repair; there are freeways throughout the city; and their is an excellent subway that costs little to use.Beijing is not a place to take children unless they are old enough to understand the history involved in the city and they can walk under their own steam. The entire time I was there I did not see a single stroller. All of the Chinese children, as well as children from other countries, walked and behaved themselves, absorbing the lessons of history.The Chinese food is excellent. There are, of course, many restaurants offering the kind of Chinese food that people from the Western world enjoy. There are also many other options for Italian, French, Mexican and plain Americanized foods. One should be adventurous and try eating with chopsticks when ordering Chinese food. It is an easy art to master if you try. Also, try Chinese Dumplings. They are fabulous! They are small and come with different fillings such as pumpkin, carrot, various kinds of fish, pork, beef and so forth.If you want to complete your understanding of Chinese culture, attend the Legend of Kung Fu show at the Red Theatre. It is a show filled with skilled performers, beautiful costumes and music and gives one an insight into the Chinese.Dress is farily casual for the tourist. Shorts or pants and T-shirts or polo shirts are good. But a jacket is a must for the evenings. The summers can be quite hot and humid. However, the spring and fall are more mild. The winters are quite cool, with a chance of snow at times.If you love history, Beijing is your destination! The history is unbelievable. Standing side-by-side are modern, Westernized hotels with all the amenities. There is something for everyone here. The Chinese people are eager to show off their capital."
50,“Great place to visit”,"This was my second trip to Beijing. My first trip I tried to see five cities, which was nice to see them but only having two or three days in each was not enough, this last trip I only stayed in Beijing and found so much that city had to offer. I guess what I liked most was being able to just walk around or take public transportation and experience the everyday life's of people, eat at sidewalk cafes without always being the the mainstream tourist places. The city is safe and easy to get around.There is so much history to take in and so many places to see I wasn't able to get everything in I wanted to do in the two weeks I was there. I had a great trip. But be prepared to do a lot of walking."
50,“Just relax in JingShan Park”,"My wife & I spent a few hours in Jing Shan park, across the street, north of the exit gate from the Forbidden City. Overall, we give thumbs up to the management for keeping the facilities there clean and very very pleasant indeed to spend time there.It was really an experience to see several varied interest groups enjoying themselves with dances, playing local musical instruments, and singing, or like us - enjoying them doing what they love to do!Should you need a place to just sit down and relax, Jing Shan Park will fill in that need for you and family - if they are on the trip with you. Bring some snacks and drinks too. Yes, you can get ice cream and tid-bits from vendors in the park itself too."
10,“Tour scams in Beijing China”,"October 10,2010Trip advisor member, PhilippinesBeijing is a must visit, must see city in asia for its historical sites and its progress . However, the tours get to be tiresome with inclusions of many tourists traps like a tea ceremony, chinese herbal medicine, jade factory, pearl shop, jewelry shop etc with such exorbitant prices that it seems that tourists are in beijing for a rip off.. So much time is spent and wasted on those tourist traps than on the beautiful sites to see in beijing. I believe there were more tourist traps that our group went to than the number of sites that we saw in beijing. And these tourist traps are compulsory for all joiners although joiners are not compelled to buy. I would have enjoyed my trip to Beijing only if the tours were mainly focused on the sites and not on the tourist traps or scams as has been written on the internet."
50,“Subway is the best way to get around”,"The subways in both Beijing and Shanghai are so extensive, so modern, so efficient, so safe, so cheap and so easy to use (assuming you can read English) that you will waste time and money doing anything else. The traffic is so bad, even out of peak hours let alone in peak hours, that using taxis or buses, while not expensive in money terms, will be expensive in terms of precious time - you will take two to four times as long to get anywhere.The subways in each city are very similar, so the comments below apply to both Beijing and Shanghai.All station names on platforms and network diagrams appear in English. Announcements are made within carriage on some lines in English of the next stop. There are diagrams in each carriage of the line you are travelling on with station names in English. Some lines have little lights which change as you travel to indicate where you are on the line. It is difficult to get lost!Ticket machines work on the basis of touch screens. You are initially presented with a diagram of the network with station names in Chinese. There is always a tab in the corner of the screen saying ""English"". Upon touching this, the network is re-presented in English. You touch a tab at the bottom the screen for the line of the destination station you want to travel to. You can work this out from the network diagram on the screen in front of you, but it is better to know it beforehand from a printed network diagram you have studied before.you set out from your hotel. You touch the relevant line, and another diagram comes up showing (in English still) all the stations on that line. You touch the station you want to go to and then the screen presents in text the price of the ticket. You the insert coins or notes to cover the value of the ticket and it drops out into the tray at the bottom of the machine with any change. Once you have done this 3 or 4 times, it becomes second nature and takes less than a minute.Maximum fare in Beijing is 2 or 3 yuan and in Shanghai about 9 yuan. It is easiest to have a ready supply of 1 yuan coins as this is the quickest and most reliable way to pay. Machines which take notes often go out of servcie for notes. Maximum note accepted is Y20.All tickets are singles (ie, one way). There is a stored value card you can buy but we didn't worry about it as it was so easy to just buy a single all the time.At the entry turnstiles, you tap the ticket on the round sensor on TOP of the gate. When you exit the system at your destination, you place your ticket in the slot on the FRONT of the ticket gate, which then swallows the plastic ticket for re-use.After you have gone hrought the entry gate, there are always English signs directing you to the platform. If you are at a station with multiple lines, you have to be conscious of the line you need to initially take. If you need to change lines to get where you are going (rarely more than one change is needed as the network is very inter-connected), you need to be conscious of the station at which you need to get off at to change lines, and then the second line you need to ride to your destination. English signs are always present to direct you at the interchanging station to the second line. At every platform, there is a diagram of the line on each side of the platform showing the direction the train on that side of the platform will be heading, so if you look at these for the station you need (either your interchange station or your final destination), you are not going to get on the wrong train to go in the wrong direction. Out of about 50 rides, we only made 1 mistake in this regard, so it is easy to determine.Be aware that the subway does not cater for late night revellers. Some lines stop as early as 11pm. Taxis can be very hard to get once this happens until the early hours of the morning when the rush is over, so plan your trip home carefully with this in mind.The subway is clean and safe. We rode the subways at all hours off and on for about 2 weeks in both Beiing and Shanghai and never felt threatened.Obviously, as in any city, the subway gets VERY crowded at peak hour and it is best to depart your hotel after 9am and avoid the 4.30pm to 6pm window for your return trip. Having said that, if you don't mind standing cheek by jowel with Chinese (a better experience if you are tall!), it is quite OK to travel in peak hour. Trains all through the day arrive every 3 mins, so if one train is too crowded to get on, the next one is along soon. For a race which to our observation seems to not queue for anything else, the local Chinese are pretty disciplined at queueing to get into a carriage. There are marks on the platform indicating where embarking pasengers should queue for each set of carriage doors and for the most part, the local populace obey, queuing to each side of the carraige doors and leaving the centre area free for disembarking passengers. Where order does regularly break down is if you are disembarking - the chinese will readily try to enter the carriage before you have got off. If you assert your presence by blocking them, they back off though (they are just eager to get a seat).We have experienced the subway in many international cities (London, Paris, Moscow, Montreal, Toronto, New York to name a few) and we can categorically say that Beijing's and Shanghai's subways are the best we have seen. Learn to use them (after 2 trips you will be proficient) - you will not regret it!"
50,“2010 holiday”,"Beijing is a wonderful city full of history, parks, sight seeing and shopping. Wafunjing Street is a real experience for everyone especially at night with the food vendors and shopping. Behai park is a relaxing day floating around the lake on a rental boat and the summer palace is a day of walking dont forget to check out the marble boat way round the corner. The Zoo home of the giant panda is another day of walking. Check out the markets fresh fruit and clothes ,pearls. The silk market and yashow market great for getting those gifts for everyone at home. And a manicure and pedicure for yourself. The subway is eay to get around with and will take you almost everywhere you want to go. Make sure you head out to the Great wall that is something that has to be seen. And one last word of advise ake sure you have good wakling shoes with you."
50,“Beijing China”,"4 Adults stayed at Lv Song Hotel(4 star) 22 Banchang Lane Kuanjie, Dongcheng District Beijing China fantastic renovation older style place beds are very hard but the Hotel it self and the surrounding area is also great. Handy to shops, bars and massage that only cost $50AUD. Would love to go back to Beijing high light of our trip."
40,“Interesting and save city”,"I was in Beijing for business travel so my chance to see to much from the city was limited. The traffic is really heavy and I recommend to use a taxi or a driver. To get a taxi is quite easy, standing on a street brings you a lot of chances to get one. I always feeled very save and English was spoken by the most people."
50,"“Impressive culture, a vibrating city, mix of past and present.”","I like to visit cities with energy. Energy in Beijing is enormous. You are very close to the Great Wall, you have Tianiamen square and the Forbidden City!If you like art there is a gallery area that is really übercool!Antique market is really impressive. From cheap -real and false Mao stuff- to Ming dinasty China.City is super safe and has impressive high rise hotels The New Shangri-La that is the tallest building on the city with an impressive bar in the 88th floor.Inconvienients...Nobody really speaks English except for the staff in the hotels so you have to be adventurous, they don´t accept credit cards in a lot of places and the traffic and air pollution are really serious...Once you are there you forget the inconvenients and enjoy one of the most impressive places on the world!Inconvenients...Air pollution,"
40,“Beijing was a wonderful adventure!”,"Beijing proved to be a pleasure and all my pre-flight jitters were unfounded. There is nothing to worry about except good preparation and planning and then let the unknown become known. Here are the tips I offer for any first time Beijing visitor:1. We contacted our bank and credit card before the trip to let them know where charges from Beijing would be coming from. Didn't have a single problem with any transaction thanks to my bank and credit card company.2. We pre ordered around 500 hundred dollars worth of yuan from my bank with no charge or fee. This allowed us not to worry about money right away.3. We brought very little dollars with us. Just enough for airports and emergency if there was an ATM problem and we had to exchange American dollars.4. 100 yuan bills seemed to work better for us than lower yuan bills so they made up the bulk of yuan we took with us.5. The atm machines pay you in yuan so don't put in the dollar figure. If you want $200 dollars worth of yuan then figure out how much yuan that is. Bring a calculator with you everywhere.6. Taxi drivers are great and cheap. They don't take tips. Don't fear stopping any taxi driver who refuses to use the meter and just leaving the cab. That is what you do. A good driver starts to drive and hits the button that starts the meter and zeroes out any past customer. They will start you at 10 yuan and after a certain time it clicks up. 10 yuan is very generous. As soon as you sit down, if it looks like he is not going to go on the meter, you'll know. When you point to it, and say meter he will either argue he wants off the meter or he will hit the meter.7. Bargaining for products is funny. Most said you can bargain vendors down 50% but we found in most purchases we were able to get to 1/3rd the price. You'll know as they will only let you walk away if you go too low. We may have just picked a good time to go there but they certainly let you know when the bargaining is over.8. Like a calculator, bring toilet paper everywhere you go. Backpacks work well for these day outings. Plus sometimes they charge you for plastic bags so just toss your purchases in the backpack.9. A simple neck purse/wallet for hiding your passport, credit cards, atm card, and extra money works perfect.10. Once you are on your way leave your fear behind. Beijing proved to be a fun city with plenty of English speaking Chinese people who will help you when you need help. Language proved not to be a problem for us as most signs had English and Chinese.11. Most tours require a lot of walking and climbing so if you are not in shape it may be a good idea to get those in further into your Beijing days rather than right away. We booked one on the 3rd day and it was easier as we were walking fools by then. That tour was the Mutianyu Great Wall where a trolley or lift chairs will get you to the top with a stunning ride. If you want more pain, do the other walls. ;-)12. The biggest ""little"" thing related to health is the hazards on the sidewalks and in businesses. There are millions of places to fall so watch your step wherever you go. Traffic laws were described to me as ""Might is Right"". That, in fact, is the truest thing I heard. There are no rules of the road except get out of the way. Cars worry about buses, bikes worry about buses and cars, you worry about all of them and anything else bigger than you as you walk."
50,“Recommended english speaking guide”,"My partner and I spent a few days in Beijing in July and used a local guide called Grace (maoruhua_grace1103@yahoo.com.cn). Grace was great, she proposed a schedule for us that maximised the 2 days we had for sightseeing. Grace providing insights and history at all the sights we visited and was able to keep us on track for our busy trip, she was also happy to answer our general questions about life in China. Grace was very reliable and patient throughout and met us at the agreed time each morning at our hotel, she had also been happy to run thru the schedule with us the evening we arrived to check we were Ok with it and that it covered everything we wanted to see. At each sight Grace would arrange purchase of the required tickets, which in the main she did not require as a registered guide ,we also used a variety of transport options around and outside the city which was so much easier and quicker with her help. Grace arranged transport to the Great Wall at Mutyianyu and was able to suggest a route that took us up by cable car and down by toboggan. In addition to the sightseeing she also helped us with local restuarants, laundry and show tickets, nothing was too much trouble for her. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a guide in Beijing."
10,“beijing - to hard”,"I am a first time visitor to china. Have been in beijing for 5 days and overall it has not been a very good experience. You can expect to be totally ripped off by everyone you buy anything from no matter how ""nice"" they seem to be. They are ruthless, and totally dishonest. I have been to singapore, KL amongst other places but have never experienced anything like this. You can be as determined and careful as you can possibly be, but they will still get you. Taxi drivers, rickshaw (got us bad!) all shops, and markets exist only to get as much money as they can possibly take from you without any conscience or sense of fairplay.This has overshadowed even the excilerating feeling of visiting The Great Wall of China. And one more thing... don't bother with the Beijing Zoo, it is a disgrace and the animals are pitiful."
50,“BEST TRANSPORATION IN BEIJING = MR. ROBINSON LI”,"TRANSPORTATION IN BEIJINGAUG 1, 2010My family and me returned to New Jersey after a fabulous tour of Beijing.We got badly burned using a Gypsy cab from the airport. However we learned from our mistake and hired a gentleman by the name of Mr. Robinson Li who I discovered on the internet recommended by others.From then on, one of the highlights of our trip was our private taxi driver and tour guide Mr. Robinson Li.He is a decent man, always on time, honest and extremely hard working. He drove us long hours, took us to where we wanted to go, even though sometimes these were against his recommendations. I ALWAYS DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN AND HE WAS ABLE TO BEAT EVERYONE ELSE'S PRICE.His car was always clean with a working Air-con. The icing on the cake is that he is almost a stand up comedian . Speaks good English and kept us laughing throughout our rides with his dry humor.In a selfish way, I just hope these recommendations don’t make him too big, simply because I can use him the next time we are in Beijing.Having said that, you would be a fool not to use him on your next trip to Beijing. Honest, and great Value for Money. Where do you get that these days.If you need to email me for any clarification, pls feel free to contact me at: thejaps@yahoo.comJerome PereiraNew Jersey, USA"
10,“Beijing Tourist Information Center”,"We booked a Great Wall tour through the Beijing Tourist Information Center on Wanfujing Dajie and wanted to warn others of our experience. The information stated, ""Badaling tour, Ming tombs, jade factory, Chinese medicine, Olympic park, and lunch included.""The tour was during the second week in July and were extremely disappointed with what we got. We went to the Ming tombs, then the jade factory/shopping (not too bad) then lunch. Our group was finished lunch 45 minutes ahead of schedule, and even though the guide and driver were also finished, we couldn't go to the next stop. We were left to wait in a shopping area. This was our first frustration. Then we went to the Great Wall - Badaling, right? Nope. Standing in front of a sign that clearly said Juyongguan, we asked our guide where we were and he said, ""Badaling"". We knew that Badaling had cable cars and there were no cable cars. We have since compared our pictures to those taken at Badaling and Badaling is far more picturesque. Our guide wanted to give us 80 minutes on the wall but the whole group negotiated 2 hours. He didn't tell us about the wall, or let us know our options for climbing. We spent all of our 2 hours on one section (we needed 1 to climb and 1 to descend) but there was another section that I think would have been easier. Then we went on to a Chinese medicine place where you can buy/tip for a foot massage or get a ""diagnosis"" which leads to a list of products you can buy. Then we went to a tea ceremony (enjoyable) but were then left to shop. This was clearly their main intention, and even though we knew this going in, it took up way too much of our day. We didn't stop at or even drive by Olympic park and the icing on the cake is that this is the ONLY guide in our 3+ weeks in China that asked for a tip. He didn't get one.Our guide gave us his business card at the beginning of the day. It said his name was Mr. Smith. While I doubt this is his real name, beware of this tour, this office, and this guide."
50,“Best travel guide company in Beijing”,"We used Beijing-Travel.com for our private tour in Beijing and to the Great Wall in Mutianyu. The guide met us at our hotel and she was so knowledgeable and personally charming we felt like we had found an old friend. The tour company provided a car which was new, the driver and our guide. Beijing, the Ming Tombs and the Great Wall were thoroughly enjoyable, and we were treated to local flavor in the Hutong area with another trusted guide. We lunched both days on typical Chinese fare, which was simply delicious. The graciousness of the people we met was marvelous. Kudos to this tour company. I would highly recommend them. They are definitely reasonable for what they provided and I would not hesitate to recommend or use them in the future."
50,“Travelling with Chinese tourists”,"With a Nanning Travel Agency, Cits, we travelled for 5 days to Beijing.From experience I know that means daily salespromotion; jade shops,supermarkets and attractions like Imperial Palaces and Tombs.You learn to live with that. First day after our flight from Nanning to Beijing, and experience the terrible 1* hotel ( most of the group skipped breakfast after the first day,small beds, no clean bedsheets for a week.), we went to the Mao Mausoleum.We arrived at 8.30 am, and already a few thousand people were waiting for the opening.We skipped Mao, since we had our 3yr old son with us, and waiting more than an hour, to see the conserved Mao,and keep Lance quiet, was a good reason to stay at TianAnmin Square.The first one of our group came out after an hour and a half.Than we went to the Imperial Palace, at the same Square, a place you in fact can spend the whole day!Forbidden City as it is called.We had a great Tourguide, but English is still a problem for most Chinese.So my wife had to tell me the explanations.And I walked around by myself.That week we saw most of the Imperial palaces around Beijing, and Tombs.The Hutongs, with a Silence Parc.And also a Memorial parc, from WWII, townships destroyed by Japanese army. Very impressive.And of course a shopping Tour.Despite the language Barrier, I had a great contact with the group, using hands and feet and bodylanguage."
10,“The down side to Beijing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”,"I have recently returned from Beijing where I spent two weeks at the lovely hotel Novotel Peace. The location and staff were perfect. However the city itself was a nightmare. What the guide books fail to tell the visitor is the awful habit the chinese have of clearing their throats with gusto and spitting everywhere...so disgusting!!! Then there is the added stink of cigarettes in restaurants which again is so off putting .Added to this mixture of phlegm heat and dust understandably the pollution is horrendous.... I did not see the sky once during my stay. We then have the constant battle of trying to cross the roads which was an ordeal of gargantuan propotions. Even though the lights go to green for pedestrians no one takes the sightest bit of notice . Its dog eat dog!. Oh yes and the shopping experience at the markets was unforgettable. So aggresive and exhausting. A person needs nerves of steel to go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! On a lighter note the one decent meal was at a place called ""Annies"" ...........it was Italian!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
30,“Silk Factory”,"June 29th, 2010.The silk Factory was interesting. They show you how silk is made and then moments later take you to silk comforters and duvet covers. They tell you it is the price listed and can't negotiate. I did buy one and a medium priced silk duvet cover for US$327.00 for a King set. I have not bought anything at the markets so I went for it. If you like it that is what matters."
40,“Changing Beijing”,"I just cam back from a business trip in Beijing, China. I stayed close to the 2008 Olympic Venue at Hotel Crowne Plaza. The hotel is a standard 5 star property.Beijing is a comparable to any modern city on the globe except that still very few people speak English. Do not forget to see the historical monuments - Tienanmen square, Great wall , Temples of Heaven, Summer Place. I missed to see Forbidden city and Tombs of ming dynasty but everyone says its worth to go.Please learn a few Chinese words that will help you a lot to start conversation.Always carry hotel name and destination name in Chinese as none of the taxi drivers understand even a word of English. My digital cameras pictures of in & around hotel helped me a lot. Silk market ia good place to get some souvenirs but bargain hard.lastly if you are looking for some Indian food - go to Ganges , they have 4 branches and serve real good Indian food."
50,“Beijing Xinhua International Tours”,"We were really happy with the service offered by this company and our driver, Mr. Wang and our guide, Sunny. We booked an Oceania cruise from Beijing to Hong Kong and decided to spend 5 days in Beijing before boarding the ship. We had been to Beijing once before, long ago, and thought that hiring a driver and guide would be the best way to see all that we wanted to see in the limited time we had. We researched several tour companies and settled on Beijing Xinhua International Tours at tour-Beijing.comOur guide and driver met us at the airport and dropped us off at the cruise terminal at the end of our stay. In between we were treated to a very professional and fun tour of Beijing. Sunny was very flexible with us and tried to accommodate all of our wishes, including little things like making a quick stop at the Hard Rock Cafe to pick up a guitar pin. Sunny was actually a highlight of our trip. Her English was excellent and her historical and cultural knowledge of China was unmatched. She was clearly proud of her country and gave us a good picture of life in China these days. We highly recommend asking for her when booking with this tour company. Booking the trip was also quite easy. Linda He was very responsive to our requests for information and in arranging for our itinerary even though we didn't decide to book with them until a week before leaving. One last thing, getting around in Beijing by car can be ""challenging"". Cars merge in and out of your lane with no warning and your driver must be both alert to these changes and at the same time assertive or you will get nowhere. We opted for a mini-van to accommodate our extra cruise luggage and Mr. Wang was a wizard at maneuvering this larger car through traffic and at finding alternate, faster routes along back roads through the city. It was an amazing display of driving expertise."
50,“An amazing Tour Guide”,"My friends & I have just returned from 6 days in Beijing China. I was fortunate to find a tour guide thru Trip Advisor. I just want all members to know about her as she was just amazing. Her English is perfect, she not only shows you all the touristy places but where the locals shop, eat and live.I spent a lot of time researching exactly what we wanted to do and see along with looking for the perfect guide and I found her in Lily. She also has her certificate for Tourism Guide in Beijing.I would only be too happy to give references and share my experiences with members.Lily can be contacted at lilyfuwa@gmail.com or visit her website which is lily_toursbeijing.spaces.live.com/Member from West Vancouver, BC Canada"
50,“First time trip to china”,"Excellent. holiday a must for all . Positives.Far too many to mention. so much to see and do. the local people are so welcoming.. Downsides booze very expensive. approx £5.00 for a larger and £8.50 a G & T. a bottle of white wine approx £20.00. air quality. poor as the traffic builds.Shopping. i started haggling at a fifth of the price and never paid over quater at the markets. Some of the stores not as easy but always got a min 30 % discount from price. If your in to fake stuff. ( i'm not ~) its everywhere. Prada bags to jeans and all inbetween. lots of people on our trip bought loads. I bought a beautiful evening silk jacket, chinese style from a up market shop aprrox £40.00 would be three times that price here. Cheaper ones available a the market but not the same quality. Tea Cermony amazing a must do for all... Jade is sold every where, be careful regarding fakes. Hotel have cards with address written in english and chinese. Makes getting a taxi or tut tut back to hotel so easy"
40,“Beijing Tour Guide”,"My husband and I like to get acquainted with a city the first day we arrive, so we either ride a tour bus (the hop on, hop off kind with a recording) or we hire a local person to be our guide.On this trip to Beijing, we decided to hire John after reading a review on TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed. Our flight from the States arrived early, 5 AM instead of 6 AM , and he was right there at the airport waiting for us.John was a taxi driver in Beijing for 15 years. He speaks good English and can really navigate the city! Traffic is a real issue that can affect how much you see and do. Having a capable driver that knows the best way to get you around is worthwhile.John has planned tours, but we had our own list of things we wanted to see and he took us to all of them. I highly recommend John as being someone who understands the city, is friendly, dependable and accomodating. I hope you consider contacting him (Beijing-driver.com)."
50,“Wild Great Wall Trip”,"Okay- this review is WAY late, but I was reminiscing about trips of old and totally owe it to Derek to write the review of our trip and his service to us. The trip could be summed up in two words- blown away. My wife and I had never been to China, and were anxiously awaiting the experience. All was well until we got to Beijing, which I would sum up as deplorable- greeted by choking smog at the airport, unfriendly taxis, hotel at the [--] end of the city, etc...but that is not the intent of this report.Dereck arrived as planned and picked us up at the hotel, taking us out into the Chinese countryside and chit chatting about any and all things as we headed for the Great Wall. We felt very comfortable, and enjoyed the otherwise crowded commute out of Beijing. A bit later, we arrived at the sparse accomadations we'd be staying for the night, met the farmer and his wife, dropped our gear and heaed for the wall. The trek took us through the village, over hill and dale, through fields and woods. While it wasn't too far, it was far from just a stroll- there was a little work involved. It was drizzling, but I think I was more wet from sweat than the rain. And then, there it was. I took a moment to savor my very first look at the Great Wall- a sight I'd been living to see since I can remember. Aside from my wife, Dereck and myself, there wasn't another sole in sight- the Wall felt like it was for us, and us alone.We climbed a bit higher and actually got onto the wall a little bit further down the trail. The ubelievable beauty of what we could see (remember, it was heavily drizzling) from on top made being tired and wet a non-issue. Within 2 hours of arriving, I was sure this was the best trip I'd ever been on. We hiked our butts off, up and down, up and down across a wall that had clearly been neglected over time. This is nothing like the picture perfect postcard image of the Great Wall...this is raw, natural and breathtaking. You will stand atop guard houses with sheer drop offs on either side, stand gazing over sides of the wall that drop off for hundreds of feet down, see parts of the wall that only have one side due to the steepness of the mountains (!), watch parts of the wall vanish, only to have other parts appear further away- almost ethereal and spooky (only if it's misty, otherwise you'll get a great look at the wall in its entirety- something we didn't get), and if you're lucky, thousands of ladybugs!.You'll get back to your accomodations tired, happy and most likely, very hungry. The farmer's wife brought us into the backyard where the chickens were kept and had us choose which one we wanted for dinner- definitely a first for us on any of our trips. My choice was delicious! We ate like kings, and when she found out my wife was pregnant, she couldn't feed her enough. It may sound silly, but the somewhat simple fare we had for dinner was by far the best Chinese food I have ever had. Dereck and I had a few beers afterward and spoke of all manners of subjects.The next morning, we rose early and set out for the other section we'd planned to hike. It was raining much more steadily that the day before, so after about 2 hours, we called it off. We were soaked, but still in very good spirits. At the foot of the mountains, we stopped at another place (much like a rustic hotel), where we changed into dry clothes. As we sat around the fire in the courtyard, we sipped on jasmine tea, spoke with the proprietor and waited for our socks and shoes to dry. Almost two years later, whenever I have jasmine tea, it takes me right back to the time I shared smokes and stories with an old chinese man I'd never met and will never see again. I felt like a traveler. I was happy. And I owe that to Dereck. Check him out- you will not be disappointed."
30,“beijing”,"Beijing is a nice place to visit,pleasent weather all around.best to visit just before winter around october and november. But just like other cities be aware of trouts they come in pairs posing themselves as tourists they take you to all expensive places to visit i guess they work on commission with the outlets. Do not go for tea tasting near the fobbiden city cost Rmb 600 per person. If interested in tea there are many tea shop selling tea with free tasting.Buy your dailiy requirement at supermarkets which has actual prices marked on them cause the shop around the hotels charge tourists 4 times the nomal price. Be careful of taxi drivers they do not speak english and charge you double the normal fare bargain berfore you sit in or insist before taking taxi that payment will be done by meter instead of entering auguments at drop off. When going to visit the great wall go Badaling not so crowded ,Do your tour booking at hotel more relaible than done outside ."
40,“First time in China”,"My expectations of Beijing were low. I did not know what to expect, I only knew basics about the economy, history and culture.. and so it has been a fascinating journey.Originally from London, I am a keen globe trotter, having visited nearly 30 countries and living in more than 3.I am in Beijing for a month but may very well extend my stay. I love it here. The people, the culture, the food, the clubs, the bars, the restaurants, the entertainment. It is very easy to budget here.Only downside is the pollution but I wear a mask daily and it really helps.Things to see are endless. Beijing is a perfect base for those wanting to venture out and see other states such as Tibet and other cities like Xi'an and Shanghai.Be sure to get a multiple entry visa should you want to also visit Hong Kong.It is a place that is slightly strange at first but one that you fall deeply in love with and one that makes you feel close to home.Sanlitun is a good area for those stayin for long periods. It is a very expat area with all sorts of shops, restaurants and bars. Many people also speak English in this area.Websites like the Beijinger are very helpful. There are some very good local travel agencies who can make your trip that much smoother by organising fun and cheap day trips and tours."
30,“A different Beijing”,"My trip notes: I spent my last weekend in BJ and it was very good. The weather is just right. In fact the best time to visit BJ is end of Sep to end of Nov (16C to 26C). I visited the Forbidden City on Sat. The cloud broke off around 11:00 am so the backdrop of the Palaces was a crystal clear blue sky (plus lots of people). The FC is a popular attarction, therefore, it was very crowded, especially the 3 main buildings. People were pushing to get a glimpse of inisde (general speaking entering to the buildings is not allowed but sometime there maybe some exhibitions in some buildings). The building are grand and the architect is excellent. Imagine no nails are used for all the buildings. YOu can easily spend 3 to 4 hours to cover 30% to 40% of FC. Tried to have a look of the infamous Bird Next and Water Cube in the evening, however, the stadiums are not longer lit up, a big let down.The new San Li Tun is a good place to shop brand name (the real stuff) goods. The in place (night life) is Lily Market of Hou Hai. The biggest curiosity type shopping is Pan Jia Yuan (is a must) but you really need to bargain hard. It is better to start off with a counter offer of 15% to 20%. I stayed at the Regent Hotel and it was good (well Regent is Regent). Da Dong is a good place to dine, they offer ""Chinese fine Dining"" and Peking Duck. It is not cheap though. I also went to Sadler at 23 Qian Mun, an Italian Restaurant. We had a Garden seat and the ambience was great and food I would say slightly above average."
50,“Great Holiday in Beijing in dec.”,"Just returned from a great trip to Beijing,Was there for 5 days with my wife and 3 young daughters. we had a great time. Really is lots to see.We used a private tour guiide for 2 days to take us around, really made things easy and meant we got to see alot more. I would highly recommend it. I used Catherine Lu. She spoke very good english and was great with the kids. Her father drove us in a very nice and new van. (started at 8 and usually dropped us back around 8 in the evening) She arranged the tickets for acrobat show and took us to some nice resteraunts, even helping with the menu.Tel +[--]Would recommend her highly.We stayed at the Lee gardens serviced appartment. very big & clean perfect for families.December was cold - but did mean we had the wall pretty much to ourselves.."
50,“Emperor's house in the center of the world”,"1st Stop: BeijingThis was and is an emperor' house of China, used to be lived by 24 emperors in the history and latter occupied by god-like Mao, and dominated by the communist party today. without a doubt, I saw royalty, bureaucrat and privilege everywhere in this capital of China. The Forbidden City right in middle of the city is the best symbol. Golden roof color and rose red wall color always remind of political games, Golden - being powerful and rich when one in a favored position, while Red meaning something else, painful bleeding when he got lost.I spent 1 whole week searching the city, and my tour guide Gary from Free In China Tour Service became my best friend there. During those days, Gary was never tired of my stupid questions and glad to share his knowledge and passion with me. Without him my week-long sightseeing would be worthless."
30,“Great Value. Be Careful at the Sights.”,"My only minor complaint is that the water smelled a bit, but compared to other places I've been that's nothing. It's safe, in a great location, and the staff was helpful. The business center wasn't working properly so they let me try to check email without charging me (the rate is super cheap). We were happy with the price paid. Be on the look out for the common scams, particularly around Tian'amen Square- people wanting to practice English and take you for a drink, then claim over $100 is normal for tea (it's frickin' hot water!). Just ignore random people who try to strike up a conversation with you. We went to Badaling to see the Great Wall on a bus for 24 yuan total (one-way) vs. a quoted price of 650 yuan for a hired car (all day) and had no problems, just take a taxi to the bus stop. The hotel staff was helpful as long as you ask for specific destinations to be written in Chinese (most taxi drivers don't know English) even regarding train stations (there are 5 or so in the city) and destinations. During the day taxis are metered but after sundown it's a negotiated rate (very overpriced. Even though it was freezing cold we usually walked out of spite). Be careful of some restaurant food too. We ate at the mall once and one plate was small portions of chicken gristle while the other was bullfrog bits, complete with veins and bones. Not very appetizing. Oh, and beware hotel massages, apparently it's common in Chinese hotels for them to be ""sexy massage"" with a variety of options. At the markets we figured the shopkeep's opening bid to be about 3 times inflated. Almost without exception they came down to what we had named as our maximum price right in the beginning (we bought a load of stuff for cheap)."
50,“Beijing through Beijiner's eyes”,"We travelled from Shanghai to Beijing with nothing previously booked or planned and with s very thight budget. Every day we decided where to go an do, and it was great. But when we got to Beijing, we just dind't know what to do. The city is overwhelmingly huge and every ""normal"" place you go is crowded with tourist, and we didn't like that.I wanted to buy cool clothes so bad. Not the cheesy Chinese clothes all tourist come back with, but the very contemporary chinese weird designer things. We tried to look for them but every place we went all was tourist oriented... Until we found Shan!! Trust me, this was a great experience!!! Shan is kind of a personal shopper, but she is also a very interesting chinese girl to meet. I am an anthropologist, and I enjoyed Shan's views and comments on society more than anything.We contacted her by email and met to have a cooffe the next day (well, not actually a coffee, you don't get much of those around there). I told her I wanted to go to a very chinese and modern ""designer's mall"". I told her we did not want to see a tourist all day long!! And she made it! I will not bore you with details but at the end of the day, my shopping ""needs"" were more that fulfilled!! I had so many bags that I didn't even remember what was in half of them!! And everything was sooooooo cheap and authentic!! Shan's guidance had a price, and in the beggining I thought it was too much, but I saved so much money that day, that you wouldn't believe it.The best part was at the end of the day. We were having something to eat and she told us about a ""glasses mall"". We both wear glasses and contacts, and she told us that in this place, gasses are very cheap... She would not tell us exact prices, so we decided to meet her next morning just for a few hours so se would take us there.I'm used to pay around $100 for a pair of glasses/contacts back home... That was a 6-stories shopping mall where all you could buy were glasses!!! And they made them in something like 10 minutes!! Ok, we bough a total of 5 normal glasses, 2 sunglasses, and 4 pairs of hard contacts, ALL for about $95!!!!! And they were beautiful and contacts were Bausch & Lomb!!Really, I LOVE SHAN!!! We are actually friends now!!!Her blog is pekingconnection.blog.com, and I truly recommend it!!"
50,“Trip report in China”,"Recently I visited Beijing in China and as this was my first visit I engaged the services of a local personal guide, Catherine Lu. Catherine is an accredited guide with the city tourist association and came reccommended to me from another traveller.My visit to Beijing included trips to the Great Wall and Ming tombs and other interesting sights in the region as well as the city. I must say that my visit was very enjoyable and made much more so by the assistance and kindness of Catherine. She listened carefully to what I wanted to do and the pace that would be comfortable for me. She adapted very well and showed me all kinds of interesting places and nice restaurants. She met me at the airport and also arranged train tickets for my next destination.I found Beijing to be a fascinating city and a very nice and safe place to visit. People were friendly and the city facilities in very good condition. I stayed at the Regent Hotel and this hotel was very good value and an excellent place to stay. Hotel staff went out of their way to be of assistance and their English was very good. I left by 'D' train to Shanghai and found the railway system to be first class and the trains very comfortable. It is a very nice way to see the countryside.As an older traveller, I very much appreciated the assistance of my guide. Catherine arranged a car and driver when required and on other days we went around by walking or taxi. I found her English to be excellent and her knowledge of the city to be thorough. If you are the kind of traveller who cares about the places you visit and the people you meet I can highly recommend Catherine. A local guide can make a big difference especially in a region where English is not all that common."
50,“A stroll along the most beautiful area in Central Beijing”,"You may take the route when you are Beijing. The following route lead to the most beautiful hutong area in Beijing.Let's assume you enter the Forbidden City from Tian'anmen Square. Now you left the palace from the north gate (Shenwumen). Right in front of you is Prospect Hill (Jingshan Park). Entrance fees are 2 yuan. Follow the staircase to reach the highest peak, the Pavilion of Ten Thousand Spring Times, to get the best bird's view of the Forbidden City and its surrounding.At the gate of the park, you have two options. To the left leads to the National Art Museum; Gongwangfu and Beihai Park are on the right.The hutong area surrounds the National Art Museum leads visitors to the past glory of education, arts and culture. Many remarkable architecture are located along the main road.Going to the right from Prospect Hill, you will come to a bridge with excellent sculptures. This is the most well-preserved ancient bridge. You can choose if you want to visit Beihai Park. The Nine-dragon screen in the park is one of the three left in the world. Value for money.Enter the hutong to the largest Siheyuan in the world, Gongwafu. Here you will learn how He Kun becomes the richest man in the world and richer than Emperor Qianlong.Shisha'hai hutong is the most exciting and entertaining hutong in Beijing. Pubs, bars, tea houses and family operated opera houses are all located here.I hope you will enjoy Beijing like I did. Make sure you bargain if you are taking a ride on tri-cycle."
50,“Beijing Oct 09”,"Took a tour with Sharp Travel, first time with a tour group. It was great. 14 people on a large clean bus. From start of trip in Seoul Korea to the arrrival in Beijing we had constatn access to our guide, Bibo. Chinese who spoke fluent English. We saw the Tianimine Sq, Forbidden City, Great Wall, Temple of Heavan, pearl and silk factories plus ate a different type of food every meal, just wonderful. The only downside was the hawkers at every venue, just learn to say no in Chinese and they will leave you alone. Stayed in the New Otani Hotel, definitely 4 star plus, very clean friendly staff with a super breakfast buffet. Would do this again!"
50,“Oddly new..”,"If you are looking for old China, you won't find it here. Beijing is steadily rebuilding itself into a major modern city and trying to find the old city beneath the gleaming new one can be difficult.I arrived off the train in Beijing expecting a chaotic messy city. I was pleasantly surprised - and a bit disappointed. China's capital appears to have renewed itself immensely leading up to the Olympics - you won't find it disorganized franticness here.Beijing is incredibly uncomplicated and organized It's also quite friendly - we were stopped one the street by a local asking if we needed directions because he saw us looking at a map. This was during my first 10 minutes in the city, and that helpful theme lasted for the duration of our visit.There is plenty of history to see in Beijing - Tianamen Square, the Forbidden City, the Great Wall.. but it is absolutely the newest Asian city I have ever been to - which says a lot considering its age.I would even go out on a limb to say this city would be a perfect 'first spot' for someone who has never been to Asia. You can quickly grasp the feel of Asia within Beijing - the crowds, the traffic, the pollution - all common things in most Asian cities. Yet Beijing has now emerged as a well planned, well signed city.Do not underestimate the amount of time is takes to cover distance in this city - it is large, but public transit is easty. The subway is ridiculously simple to use (though if you buy more than one ticket at a station for use at a later time, bear in mind those pre-purchased tickets MUST be used at that station). Taxi cabs are very cheap and convinient once the subway has stopped running (around midnight, if not earlier).English is abundant in the city - it is on all the signs, in all the stores and even spoken relatively well by many of the citizens.For those looking for sights, this city does not disappoint. We found the Great Wall to be spectacular and a definite must see. The Forbidden City was as beautiful as it was immense, though I have a feeling that particular attraction means more to the Chinese citizens then it does to the tourist. Tianamen Square is massive, almost unbelieveably so and we found the 2008 Olympic buildings to be very impressive, especially lit up at night.This city is also a shoppers paradise. It is everything you'd expect from Asia - markets, knock-offs, tailors. The Silk Market is pprobably the most famous though be prepared to be overwhelmed by it when you first walk in. Don't stop too long at the cramped booths and if you want to purchase, bargain hard. They may look like you are hurting them with your cheap offers, but they are work hard to get sympathy from you.By the time we left Beijing we were exhausted. Tired from all the walking, shopping, eating and sightseeing. It has so much to offer and has made its way into my top 10 favorite cities. Allow yourself to be captured by it's modern intimacy and have fun. I think Beijing will be a totally different place in 10 years..."
30,“The New Beijing”,"16 lanes of traffic is the average width of a major road in Beijing. No it is not a freeway. It is a road. They can bring in tank and fighter jet in the event of war. If you have weak legs, you are in big trouble. 20 minutes walk is the norm but not for this North American traveller. You think Vegas is bad. This is far more walking than Vegas.Taxi are installed with a mic/camera monitoring your conversation so be careful what you say.Beware of some taxi drivers refuse to turn on the meter just to rob you blind. They can kick you out if the distance is not worth the trip.Foreigners (Non-Mandarin speaking) be prepared to pay a much higher price . A little Mandarin is better than no Mandarin at all.There are more designer shops in Beijing than in New York City or Rome. Lots of Audi, Benz and BMW. German cars are their favorite.If you eat in hotel, price is higher than the US.Restaurants are still reasonable.Best Pecking Duck in town is Da Tong (大董). It is a chain restaurant. Very fancy and modern with reasonable price. Great food presentation. Just ask your hotel , they will direct you to the nearest one in town. The one we went to is a 5 minutes taxi ride from the Grand Hyatt. $10Chinese money ($1.40US) for the ride.We hired a taxi to the Great Wall for $450 (approx $65US) for 6 hour . Other taxi wanted $800. Hotel tour is triple that price per person. Do not trust them when they say there is English guide. They speak very little English.Walk to the end of the Forbidden City and start backward to avoid heavy local tour jam. Pretty much the same tactic as Disney World.Garbage every where at the Great Wall. A vertical climb. Better have a pair of strong legs and a walking stick even if you are under 60. Wall to wall of people. We are told by our driver not to eat in the resturants at the foot of the Great Wall. They look clean and inviting but many tourists got sick. We ate at the Jade factory (yes they have a big sit down restaurant). 50 pieces of dumplings cost $4US and they take half order."
50,“Beijing Tips”,"BeijingStayed at the Peninsula Hotel which was brilliant. Friendly people, but do watch out for occassional spitting on the street and lots of people braging in queues. Taxis are very cheap although driving standards can be scary, and traffic can be heavy. Recommended restaraunts are:-Da DongMaison BuloudHuang TingCrystal JadeMy Humble HouseMade in ChinaBut avoid Whampo House in the Financial District.See Forbidden City, Great Wall, Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, Legation Quarter, hutongs, CCTV building and Olympic village. Recommended guide is Michael, who teached History in an university in Beijing and speaks excellent English. He can be contacted by email on [--] or telephone [--]"
50,“Beijing in 7 Days”,"Temple of Heaven, Cricket Market, Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the Hutongs, the Lama Temple, fabulous food and warm friendly people....there isn't anything to 'not' like about Beijing."
30,“A city with rich history and modern development”,"I was very impressed with the historical buildings and the stories behind it. Admiring those grand structures and imagining in my head what had happened to those who lived there was simply facinating. The people there are very proud of their history and the past glory.On the flip side, there are the left-overs after the Olympics. Empty sports venues, pulleted air and lots of homeless on the street following us for a mile begging for money.It is certainly a mixed feeling when we were there visiting. Overwhelmed by both the rich history and what the people there succeeded hundreds of years ago and modern development and what it caused to the people living there now. Worth the trip!"
50,“Get around places”,"I love Beijing! Okay, now on about getting around from someone who was never there before.If you ever arrive from Tianjin, remember that the Beijing-Tianjin train is world-class. It's only RMB 58 one way for a 30 minute super smooth super on-time ride super comfy ride. You even get to gawk at very well dressed attendants who don't do anything much? ;-) Get a cab at Tianjin Binhai Airport for a mere RMB 50-100 to Tianjin Railway Station.Unless you want to see the village and roadside views, the taxi from Tianjin-Beijing costs RMB 500.There is no Tianjin Airport Hotel, despite what Google Maps tells you.In Beijing, the Line 4 Subway just opened on Sep 28 at 1500 hours. That line is superb. It covers 颐和园 Yiheyuan, 圆明园 Yuanmingyuan, 动物园 Beijing Zoo, 陶然亭 Taoranting, among others.Beijing Subway's fare is RMB 2 to *any station*. As far as I can tell it's been that way for a long while now. Quite a service from the Government, I guess...In Beijing, virtually all cabs run on meters now, so previous advice on asking the drivers to 打表 (run meter) is mostly obsolete. Taxi starts from RMB 10.Our cab run from the hotel to 居庸关 Juyongguan Great Wall and 十三陵神道 Ming Tombs Spirit Way costs RMB 800. Takes about an hour to get to Juyongguan and about half hour back from Spirit Way. Juyongguan takes about 3-4 hours on a very relaxing climb."

50,"“Beijing -- China, the beautiful and exotic”","we knew Beijing offered a lot of attractions but the reality exceeded our expectations. It's an incredible city. The people are nice but, remember, you need to negotiate the cost of almost everything you want to buy. To everyone who is contemplating whether to come here, just do it. You will not regret it and have memories to last a lifetime. We just wished we could stay here longer. It's an incredible adventure."
50,"“Beijing, China”","A huge city with seemingly endless rows of high-rise apartment buildings. Beijing is a wonderful mixture of the ancient and the modern. Tienanmen Square is huge and impressive. Across the street is the Forbidden City, which is also huge. It seems it was built for people on horseback - again, very impressive. I took a guided tour on a tour bus. I recommend seeing Beijing this way, as the traffic seems insane. I wouldn't attempt driving there."
50,“Beijing after the Olympics”,"I visited not long after the Olymics and was amazed at how beautiful this city it. I found it a very enlightening exprience. The people were simply wonderful.. Be sure to take a ride on a pedicab .. and visit the Temple of the Sun , as well as the Forbidden Ciity ..."
40,“a city of many people”,"Bejing was more than we expected. We arrived during the National holiday. It was told to me Tiennamen Square can hold a million people. The day of our visit the square was packed with people. It was a challenge to get around but the shere volume of people was as impressive as the city. The people of China put much strength is things being big. It is a sign of power.The where a people willing to help my wife and I navigate the city.At the Forbiden City,the locals call the Palace Museum,many came forward to help push my wife up and down steep ramps. The are a very respective of people with challenges. At a local resturant the literally carried my wife in wheel chair up flights of stairs to get in. Handicapped restrooms though far and few could be found. This being the results of hosting Olympics.We found that the most interesting part of our trip was not the sites but the people. They where warm caring in spite of a language barrier"
50,“G for Great Hotel (Hotel G)”,The Hotel G was the most enjoyable Hotel we have stayed in anywhere in the world. The staff were excellent and faultless in their desire to help (Lisa and Bella on the front desk in particular). The restaurant and food was brilliant from breakfast through to late night snacks. The room was brilliant and you could not help but sleep peacefully in the mood and ambience of the world entered. The bed was perfect the pillows even better.To the two Alex's in charge - what a pair - if in Beijing give this hotel more than consideration as you will not find better. Made our bucket list even better
50,“Four scenic packed days in Beijing”,"Not knowing anything about Beijing, We surfed the net and booked a 4 day tour with travelchinaguide.com. We thought the tour provided by the company was truly exceptional, With pick up and delivery to the airport, we really felt like VIPs. The Hotel actually was 5 star quality and conveniently located for shopping or just people watching. All the restaurants selected by the company were excellent and the Peking Duck Dinner was especially memorable. As a previous tour guide myself, I was very impressed with our guide ""Tina."" Her English was excellent and subject matter knowledge was outstanding. Both she and the drivers were very helpful and professional. The transportation provided was clean & very comfortable considering the high temperatures. Normally I don't like ""shopping"" stops, however, the Jade and Silk factories were an educational experience and highly recommended.Frank & Blanca Mitchell - Republic of Panama"
50,“Beijing in 4 days”,"Now I know 4 days is not enough.It was a quick trip but I think we covered a lot.We only had 1 bad incident trying to get to the hotel after arriving in train. We didn't have complete directions and the taxi drivers did not know how to get to the Days Inn. So all would turn us down.After we managed to get to the hotel we went to Forbiden City..not far from the Hotel. This place is so beautiful and big. If you are into history you need much more time than the time we spent walking and taking pictures. They have automatic guides for 40 RMB. We rented one but this place is so big that after a while just taking pictures was in my mind.After Forbiden city we met our tour guide from this site Lilly, and she took us to the Lama Temple and also we went to the houtongs nearby.Second day we went to Great Wall. Lilly took us to the Mantiyou section. It was raining but we were able to see and climb the wall. After the Wall we went to the Summer Palace and then to a place where locals eat duck food at a very reasonable prices.Me and my wife ate for 95 CNY inlcuding a dish of duck, beverages ( 2 chinese beers , tea and water) and a spicy chicken dish, cabagge soup and rice. I don't remember the name of the restaurant but if anyone is interested I will contact Lilly and she;ll glady tell you how to get there.Let me tell you how she did an excellent job and if anyone wants more details I will be glad to tell you how efficiently she showed us the places. More than a guide I describe her as our guardian Angel. After she left us in the restaurant we were eating and half way our meals she came back to tell us about a mandatory corfew that would happen the next day due to reharsal in Tianamen Square. She wanted us to know.Third day we went by ourselves to Temple of Heaven. Very interesting place. Local people dancing, singing, exercising. We could spend half day just observing how local people interact in this fantastic place. Then we walked around the Temples. After that we went to the Dirt Market nearby. Is open only on weekends and since it was saturday we went souvernir shopping. Never pay what they asked. I learned quick to bargain and usually worked. Whataver asking price they told me I started 1/4 of that and went up a little. In some cases I was not interested and as soon I started walking away, they would call me and accepted my offer of 1/4 of the original price.or the fair price.After that we went to the Acrobatic Show.. It was awesome seeing young acrobats do their show. I'm amazed of the strenght and discipline these young people.After that we went walking to Tianamen Square and then the area where they sell exotic animals for snacks. I learned that most people who eat scorpions are turists and not locals.Intersting place and no I did not eat a scoropion. I only took pictures. Maybe with 4 beers I would have tried it.Last day we could not do much due to the corfew. We had to leave hotel before 4:00. We only went to Oriental Plaza Mall and after that to airport. In fact I'm writing this review at the second floor in the airports internet access cafe. Interesting should be noted that In the US I would never bargain the fee on an established business at the airport. When I asked the price for this places the guy told me 80 RMB per person unlimited time.I just happend to try and I said 50...he said ok..then I said 80 for 2 people? then he said yes.. After we sat in our computers I asked a chinese person who spoke english how much he paid.. and he said 40... so I paid the fair price."
50,“Beijing is worth many more visits.”,"So many people visited the famous tourist spots in Beijing, but overlooked the Lugou Bridge or Lugou Qiao, not far from city centre by car. We arrived there in the early morning. The air was fresh and the Bridge was still devoid of pedestrians and bicycles ( no cars allowed ). Sadly, we didn't visit Prince Gong's Mansion or the Lama Temple, i.e.Yong He Gong, 'cause we ran out of steam and had to chill out in our hotel--the rest of the tourist spots we have visited!Our trip to Mutianyu and the Summer Palace was with our driver John( Mr. Zhang Yong Xing,) who's one of the best China can offer to strangers in town. He's warm, helpful, accomodating, caring, good-tempered, speaks good English and knows the place inside out. His car's clean and odourless. He even accompanied one of our girls to ride in the cable car up the Great Wall, because one car takes two and there were five in our group. Pity he was busy for the following days, so we couldn't book him for further outings. Next time!"
50,“A nice place in Beijing near Silkmarket and Swimmingpool etc included”,"I do not see this hotel listed in Tripadvisor but would add it for reason of good value for money for stay in Beijing.It is theBeijing Jianguao Hotel5 Jianguaomenwai Street.tel: +86 10 65002233Fax: +86 10 65002871We booked this hotel for 5 nights per advise of our local Guide contact, for reason of good location (next to silkmarket) and the many Hotel facilities like indoor Swimmingpool, Sauna and good breakfast/diner facilities. All in all good vallue for money.We arrived 3 times in morning at breakfast and were upgraded to ""french breakfast restaurant"" for reason of occupation in the normal restaurant (wich was already very compleet). Further more we enjoyed very much the indoor swimming pool faciity, after having walked a lot on day-time doing the cultural sceneries"
40,“Exceeded my expectations”,We went to China in June 09 - Beijing was first point. What I thought it may have been was totally different. Not jam packed with people - very clean - very helpful and wonderful trip. Also went to Shanghi - which is the commerical main city - it was fine but no comparison to Beijing - am looking to go back in the near future again.
30,"“Beijing, Asian wonderland”","Spending a week in Beijing in July is a hot experience for a traveller from Northern Europe. We - a thirtysomething couple, the other or a business trip, the other on holiday, booked oourselves in to Celebrity International Grand Hotel at the business district of Beijing, also relatively close to the fabulous olympic stadium. The hotel was a five star one, but the room rates seem to vary: the tariff leaflet in the hotel book had ridiculous amouts of money listed on it, but our room was quite inexpensive for the quality. Despite of the notes asking guests to save the environment by usig their towels more often than once, the cleaning staff seemed to always sneak into our room to change them, even twice a day, no matter how we hung them to dry. It was somehow sad, knowing that Beijing suffers from dry seasons and lack of water, that environmental issues are greenwash decoration, not action. (And yes - flying 6000 km to witness that is ironical, I know)The hotel's location is great fr business people, but for holidaymakers a bit far too from the centre. To get to the main sights - The Forbidden City etc. - one has to either take a taxi or the metro. Neither dents your budget too much, as te cost for taxi is about 30 yuan (appr, 3 euros), and the metro ticket costs a mere 2 yuan (20 cents). Taking a taxi is easier, but the traffic jams can get quite bad on rush hours, so the metro, though never too empty, can be faster and cooler way to get to town.The Chinese don't speak much English, and if you are planning a trip to Beijing, it's better to get used to the idea of having to show things, draw things, ask the hotel staff for help in writing addresses etc. in Chinese, and have an open mind and a cool head. The city is big, and for an European eye many street signs, even when written in English, seem very alike, and they might not be found on the tourist map. It can be easy to get lost, but there can be fun in that. We were trying to fing a shopping district my partner had been to few years ago, but unable to remember the exact locatio, we took a chance and found ourselves in a funny part of town in the west central city. No harm done in that, as it was nice to stroll along the streets and be curious about anything and everything.It is not possible to grasp everything there is to be seen in Beijing in one week, and should you try, you'll end up scheduling yourself too much. Some main sights were enough for us, and the rest of the time the hanging out, finding a place to have a drink, getting excited by the different items at the supermarket and other small scale experiences was very satisfying. We were lucky to have some nice restaurants in the neighborhood of our hotel, as they had more local flavor to them than the ones right in the touristical hotel area in the very centre of town (East from the Forbidden City). A large, five course dinner and drinks for two persons cost us 98 yuan (10 €), and there was food eough for even three or four people on the table. For a vegetarian as myself it is smart to ask somebody who knows Chinese to write a note saying ""I'm a vegetarian, no meatt, no fish"" or something alike in Chinese to make eating more enjoyable - the local cuisine has a hint of meat in most dishes, even though the main ingredients are vegetables. I was lucky to have a omnivorous partner to test my dishes for me, if something looked suspicous despite my vegetarian note - and of all the food I ordered during the week, only one dish turned out to be non-vegetarian. (my own fault, I didn't show the waiter my veggie slip).Restaurant behaviour is only the one of many things where the cultures differ - the most amount of waiters to help us browse the pictured menu at a time was four; they would wait by your side until you are done with your order. At first it felt strange not to have the space and time to look through the menu by oneself, but once you got used to it, it was fun trying to decide which dishes - and how many of them - would be good, getting pointed recommendations.The traffic needed some time to adjust to as well - cars, bikes, mopeds and any other imaginable vehicles come from all directions, and not all of them obey the traffic lights. Cars turning to right don't have to stop at the light, so you have to be super careful crossing the street. The vehicles don't stop, it's the pedestrian that gives way. The wors thing to do is to be hesitant, as the locals do keep a good eye on the flow of all kids of traffic around them, and there's a rhytm to it all. We made a joke about the pedestrian traffic lights that show the seconds left to cross the street - we called the the Pegingese life expectancy meter...The restaurants and traffic are just little examples on how the city works - there are millions of people living there, so the simplest way to avoid stress is to accept the fact that it is they that know what they are doing, not you - observing, getting a good guide book in advance and a map from the hotel make Beijing a great experience. Many hotels also arrange day trips to the Great Wall, and it is a good way to spend a day outside the city. The section I went to see - Badaling - is very touristical, but if you ignore the obvious overpriced souvenirs and accept that also you are one of the thousands of people visiting the place, it is enjoyable to try to catch your breath after a steep set of uneven steps to find out that the wall just keeps on going on and on and on.All written above is more to do with feelings and vibes of the journey - inspired by a fellow tourist at the breakfast room of our hotel waving a waiter and complaining ""Can you turn the music down? It is annoying!"" because of a soft Chinese flute music. Overaring that comment I thought to myself to advise other traveller that if you can't keep from getting stressed out because of half an hour over a continental, nice breakfast surrounded by staff that fill you cup and take your empty plates away for you, you are better off staying somewhere that doesn't challege your limits or imagination - or tolerance for difference.In a nutshell, below some useful quick tips for Beijing goers while they are still fresh on my mind. I hope they are useful! :- tissue is good to have handy when out and about; public toilets don't often have any kind of paper in them- hand desinfectant goes without saying; even though the recent flu pandemics have increased the sanitation everywhere, it's stupid to get any bugs abroad if they can be easily avoided- drink water if it gets hot (our top temperature experience was 40 centigrades). The humidity fools you not to feel thirsty.- Beijing is smoggy, take that into account if you have respitorial problems- don't tip - the waiter might run after you to give you the change you thought to leave him...it did happen to us: lesson well learned.- haggle; touristical areas have touristical prices with air in them. Malls and supermarkets are a different story, the shopping centres with local and international brands have fixed prices, and they can be even more expensive than in Europe.- buy an umbrella: protects you from the sun and rain, as you will get both- slurp! Chinese dining etiquette is very relaxed - you can make oise if you feel like it! If you don't, remember not to mind if the guy next to you is eating with volume- Beijing is a clean city - there are trash bins everywhere. Even as the Chinese are heavy smokers, the cigarette butts are put out and into the trash can. Don't litter.- most of all: go with the flow, both mentally and physically, and have fun!"
20,“My experience travelling in China”,"Just came back from China. It is my first time to this country. Beautiful country with lots to offer for foreigners. However we joined a tour group and noticed everyday they took us to all these places not indicated on our itineary. And the worst thing is they want us to buy things from these places, eg. silk carpet, chinese medicine, tea, etc. It came to a point that the whole group was upset because they will skip attractions that we were supposed to go. One day we went to 3 places that they were trying to sell us stuff. The tour guide just blamed their own government, saying that it is compulsory for them to do that. If that was true, I thing China is hurting their own tourism. I hope that really look into this issue. I heard it happens quite often to these Chinese tour groups. Did anybody have the same experience?"
50,"“Chine tour - Beijing, Xian, Chongqing, Yangtze River, Guilin, etc...”","We took TravelChinaGuide's 16-day Small Group tourof Beijing - Xian - Chongqing - Yangtze River - Yichang - Shanghai- Guilin - Yangshuo - Hong Kong. The company is super andmy wife and I have already recommended them to our friends.Our guides were all great; they all knew their cities very well. Wereally liked Jacky@Guilin and think Jacky is the best guide in China! We also especially liked Ying Ying (Candy) in Shanghai and Ray in Beijing. The time at each site was well distributed. The only thing that didn't work out too well was 7 Star Park in Guilin, turns out we visited on a holiday, Childrens' Day, too crowded with kids - go figure.We enjoyed our meals in China; the food was exceptional and plentiful. The best was probably our last dinner in Guilin when our guide arranged for us to dine at a local wedding reception! We had a blast that night! Loved the food, the atmosphere, and the friendly people. They treated us like family! It was the highlight of the trip. We really liked the authentic Chinese food. I didn't enjoy the western-style food while touring in China - we can get that here. Fortunately, we only had that a couple of times.We'll always remember our bike ride in the countryside to visit a farm. Very nice meeting locals and seeing firsthand how they live.Another high point of the trip was the Yangtze river cruise - very nice. The ship and crew were super. Just like a regular ocean-going cruise ship - just smaller. Very nice, very smooth.Anyhow, we enjoyed our whole China trip. Excellent tour company, excellent. You can book through them with confidence."

50,“Great Beijing Tour Guide!”,"I just returned from Beijing with an MBA group - we had an amazing experience across the board. Most of the highlights are covered in other posts, but I would also highly recommend a tour guide. Our tour guide, June, was fantastic. She is smart, energetic, curious, responsible, speaks great English and went above and beyond to make each experience memorable and to accomodate everyone in the group. She also worked with smaller groups within the larger group for specific outings. Whether you want to go to a single destination or multiple locations around Beijing, June can make the arrangements and improve the experience. Her email (I got her permission to post it) is: angeljune520@hotmail.com"
40,“WARNING - Pedicabs in Beijing: beware!”,"Great City - loved it!Just a WARNING!Do NOT take a pedicab (guy with bicycle that pedals you somewhere).Me and my wife took one of these guys to a nearby subway station. I negotiated a price of RMB30 before we left.Halfway through the journey he phoned a mate which then joined us with his pedicab and I was transfered to this new guy.They eventually drove into a quiet alley, stopped and told us that we must get off and the station was nearby. They then took out a little printed conversion table and demanded USD30!! (RMB240).I felt unsafe as there was no other people around and the two guys got quite aggressive. I told my wife to get out the alley ASAP and just kept offering them RMB30 and pretending I have no idea what they are saying.Eventually they stopped with the US Dollar thing, but then wanted RMB60 as there was two drivers. I just kept offering the RMB30 and they eventually took it amid some angry gestures and obvious swearing.I literally ran out the alley and we were about 300m from the station.It was clear that these guys do this often and therefore I assume it will be all over the city.Rather flag down a cab (Its only RMB2 per kilometre)."
50,“Great China Tour Guide”,"Subject: ChinaLocation: AsiaTitle: China Tour Guide Who Far Exceeded Our ExpectationsID#: 31803363My family and I visited China for the first time in May of 2009. I am writing about an excellent national tour guide, Li Yue (from China Spree Tours), who was with us all 10 days as we visited 5 different cities. She met the group of 18 at the Beijing airport and was available 24/7 to assist us with anything we needed. Right from the start she said that she didn't want this to be a good trip - she wanted this to be an excellent trip -- far exceeding our expectations. I thought this might be a great marketing ploy; little did I know that I was in for a big surprise -- a trip of a lifetime!Some of the things she did to make this happen were:*She was knowledgeable; she has a degree in tourism.*She had solid background experience; she has brought a Chinese delegation to the USA and translated for them as well as conducted many tours of China.*She wanted us to learn as much as possible: While on the bus between attractions, she taught us some Chinese language and about Chinese culture (one-child family planning, bound feet , Chinese architecture, reform and open door policy, religion, Mao and Deng Xiao, tai chi, Chinese herbs, the cultural revolution, and accupressure massage, education, and more).*Three people celebrated birthdays on the trip; she arranged a cake for them all.*Our 4 children are 14 - 24; adults and children alike enjoyed her warm and helpful energy.*She arranged hotel upgrades where ever possible even though all hotels had 5-star ratings.*She was very knowledgeable about the many attractions we visited on the trip.*She shared personal stories and experiences of her own life as a Chinese citizen.*She created an energy of warmth and family amongst the tour group participants.I would give her the highest rating possible and definitely recommend requesting her as your guide if traveling to China.Colleen F."
40,“Vibrant Chinese Culture Everywhere!”,"My first trip to Beijing was sort of rocky. I found it hard to breath probably because of the pollution. The famous Ghost Road in Beijing has a lot of restaurants with food from all over China but there were mostly restaurants serving Peking duck. The traffic is absolutely crazy, so stick with the locals when crossing the streets.A must see destination in Beijing is the Tiananmen Square. While it is a popular attraction for people from other parts of China, there are many people preying and persuading you to buy their things. You should say loudly and firmly ''Bu Yao!'' which means no.There are also many people trying to cheat you at the stores so the best thing to do is ignore them.All the food in beijing is excellent and so is the culture. It is a modern city blending skyscrapers and traditional art together. The only thing I really didn't like about China was the people. A lot of men are smoking and they spit on the ground and they only care about themselves. I saw a man beating a dog for taking some of his food.While the people aren't always friendly, keep an open mind and look on the bright side of Beijing. The culture and modernness is what draws people to this exceptional city."
40,“This won't be our last trip to China”,"To say we've always wanted to go to China is an understatement. My husband and I have been talking about it for years, but it has always been a ""someday"" thing. Now that we've been, we can't wait to go back.We flew into Beijing from Boston, via Detroit and Tokyo. It is a VERY long flight to say the least. After about a day and a half we finally arrived at about 10 o'clock at night. Needless to say it was too late to see anything, and we were exhausted. We met the rest of our friends in the morning and our party consisted of my husband and I and four women I work with.We stayed at the Grand Mercure Hotel Xidan in Beijing. It is a beautiful hotel. It's very modern and clean. It's located a few blocks from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City.Our whole vacation was arranged in advance through a Chinese travel agency called Shanghai Shihua International Travel Service and our consultant was John Hu. Everything was in order before we even got off the plane. John met us at the airport and brought us to the hotel the first night and gave us a detailed itinerary for the rest of our trip.The next day after breakfast we were picked up at the hotel, the six of us had our own driver and guide so we had more freedom than if we went with a larger tour. Then off to the Temple of Heaven to start the day. The grounds are spacious and used by groups of dancers and people doing all sorts of exercises. The Temple itself was incredible you just can't describe all the detail in the buildings. After the Temple we went to the Hutong district which is the old part of Beijing. The roads are very narrow and we toured the area in bike driven carts, like a rickshaw. Then off to lunch which was included with dinner each day in the tour. Then we went to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. You really need at least half a day to go through them both and truly grasp the awe of it all. We felt very small walking through the wide open spaces. They are both great examples of the grandeur of man's building skills on a very large scale. After dinner back to the hotel (a very full day).The next day was what we'd been talking about for years. We went to the Great Wall of China! We went to the Badaling section of the wall. It's about an hour and a half drive from the city, and we went in the tour van we'd been using. Jason (our tour guide and translator) was very knowledgeable about the construction of the Wall and the surrounding area. It really is an amazing sight to see. To walk on stones that have been tread on by millions of people for thousands or years is really beyond words. Now don't get me wrong, it's very steep and down right exhausting to climb. When we were done (or given up) we went to the hotel at the entrance of the Wall for a much deserved cup of tea. After a sleepy ride back to Beijing, we had another great dinner and then took a night ride by the Olympic park. What a difference in one day, to go from a sight that was constructed in the 7th century BC to something that is only a little over a year old. Such diversity!The third day we went to the Summer Palace and the Olympic park during the day. The Summer Palace was another beautiful work of art. It is surrounded by a lake and well planned gardens. Only a few plum trees were in full bloom, but the place was great to roam around and we took a short boat ride across the lake. On the lake is a boat made of marble. It was originally built in 1755, but was lost in a fire. It was rebuilt again in 1893 in western style. It is a sight to see. After another great meal we went to the Olympic park and walked around the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube. Both are spectacular buildings, but sadly are not in use. We also went shopping in the Pearl Market. Think of the biggest and loudest flea market you've ever been to and either double or even triple it! It seemed to go on for ever and you could buy pretty much anything. Bargaining is an art form and the merchants are very pushy. Don't touch unless you really want to buy, or you may be talked into buying it anyway! Late night was spent without our tour in the ""night market"" on Wangfujing Street. Here you could eat anything you wanted, and most of it was on a stick. Not for the faint of stomaches. My husband said the scorpions tasted like crab...We crammed a lot of attractions into our three days in the area, but we felt like we saw most of the popular sights. We would like to go back and spend more time in the area and maybe see a different part of the Wall. If you've been toying with the idea of going to China, stop putting it off. Life is too short and there is a whole world to see."
50,“Golden Dragon Tour”,"We have just returned from a 21 day tour of China. We travelled with CTS travel on their Golden China Tour. We visited Beijing, Chengde, Xian, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuzhen, Suzhou, Guilin and Yangshuo with an extension or 2 nights in Honkong. We had a wonderful time, the arrangements were faultless. However as other people have reported the travelling is very tiring, some complete days were spent either in a coach or flying. We could often arrive at our destination in the late afternoon, check in and then be taken to a restaurant for dinner followed by an 8.30am start the next day. All lunches and dinners were Chinese stir fry, usually served with rice but I must admit I enjoyed most meals. Most of these were in local restaurants not in the hotel.The best part of the trip for me was the cruise down the Li river from Guilin to Yangshou and our stay in the Paradise resort. One thing travellers need to be aware of which shocked us was the demand for tips. We are accustomed to paying tips but we stayed in Bijing for 3 nights and on our last night our national guide asked us for a tip of £4 per person per night. This was so that she could take over tipping of drivers bell boys and local guides saving us the trouble!! Most people in our group would have preferred to tip individually but our guide was persistent in her demand even reading us a fax she purported was from head office setting the situation out. After much discussion back in our hotel we decided that we would reluctantly give £50 each for our time in China. It was embarassing especially when bell boys hung around waitng for their tip and we had to tell them tosee the tour manager. As we travelled around China we discussed this way of tipping with other group members and they all reported the same thing. One group had decided to keep the tipping private and they found that as a result their national guide became very unhelpful. Obviously many holidaymakers will be reporting back to their tour companies. However China is a beautiful country and we would go again to see more."
50,“Beijing Snacks – Culinary tours in Beijing”,"Tasting local food and snacks is great experience when traveling to a destination; so when take a Beijing tour, never miss the unique Beijing flavors as well. Beijing is home to several hundreds of snacks; with about 100 types survive today. Tourists can taste not only the local Beijing snacks today but those of other regions as well.Below are some Beijing snacks one can taste when travel to Beijingpea flour cake (wandouhuang 豌豆黄)Pea-flour cake, once listed among royal cuisine during Qing dynasty, is made of white pea and available through spring and popular on the annual temple fair in Beijing. It is sweet with smooth texture.Fried Bread Circle （jiaoquan 焦圈）The most popular snack in Beijing, with flour made into a paste with added salt, alkali and alum; then the paste strips are fried in the hot cooking old. It is yellow in appearance, with irresistible crisp flavor. The old Beijinger told me that it could keep for ten days without going bad in taste! I was interested in it and took some back, but the great taste always reminded me and left them not over 1 day!Rolling DonkeyNever think that it is type of something related to donkey; just pastry made of soy bean flour! I got frightened when heard this name, but explanations went like this, a type of Islamic snack, made from steamed glutinous millet or sticky rice, scattered with fried bean-flour and filled with red pea. After being cut into blocks, it is rolled in soya bean-flour, which is why this snack gets the name, rolling duck. It is sweet by still tasteful.Dried fruit dishThe main ingredient is dried persimmon, added with dried apricot ten soak in warm boiled water; slices of fresh lotus and covered with ice. That’s cool, very crisp but sweet and sour!I also tried Douzhi, Stir-fried Tofu, Sweetened Fried Flour Gruel…but other types I just got its name and not brave enough to eat, like Boiled sheep innards, Fried Liver, Quick-Fried Tripe… which are more popular among local people but none of my friends dear to try. Some restaurants also offer Beijing snacks, but I would suggest some “local” places to try the authentic and traditional taste.One is Longfusi Snack Street, offers 100m long snack stall selling kinds of authentic Beijing style other Chinese snacks. See and listen the hawk of stall keepers is interesting, some will try to promote in English in this way “beef, sheep? Want?” It is blossoming at night time and taking a stroll around would be much reward able experience.Wangfujing Snack Street comes with a dazzling array of snacks from all over the world to cater foreign visitors and the cost is more expensive than Longfusi styles. However, for a comfortable and relaxing meal, Xin Dong An Restaurant comes highly recommended.Shichahai Snack Street is the most popular snack street in Beijing, with people flowing in day and night and sits in traditional local snack shops for Beijing food there.Qianmen Snack Street offers a number of time-honored restaurants including famous Quanjude Roast Duck.Donghuamen Snack Night Market - Located at the northern entrance of Wangfujing Street, Donghuamen Night Market is the most famous snack street in Beijing, popular with both locals and tourists as well. After its pedestrianization, Donghuamen Snack Night Market became the No. 1 snack street in Beijing. When the night falls, the assortment of tasty treats from both northern and southern China, plus the bustling crowds and the rhythmical huckstering is another attraction in Beijing you shouldn't miss."
40,“Beijing in March”,"We visited Beijing in March of 2009 and had a great time. The weather was cool to cold, just coming out of Winter, but it meant that there were not hoards of tourists, both local and from over seas.Prices have gone up from 2006 when we were there last but there are still plenty of bargains to be had. Watch out for taxi drivers who do not want to use the 'meter', they will try and rip you off. The subway is a great way to travel, only 2rmb to any destination and the ticketing system is pretty easy to follow, even for westerners.We took the over night train to Xian to see the terracotta warriors, really amazing and well worth the trip. [the train station at Beijing West and Xian are also some thing to behold - busy is a poor adjective ]We worth the trip at this time of year, a must try are the toffee strawberries on sticks in the markets."
50,“Trip report Fantastic Beijing April”,"First let me start by saying we have used the information supplied by all you kind people on Trip Advisor for the past 6 years & never written a report, now is our time to give back so thanks to you all.Arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai, it was a 10hr trip in a 4 berth sleeper it was great the kids loved it [ 11 & 14 ]. I would recommend it to anyone.Before leaving home I had searched Trip advisor for a guide to use whilst in Beijing & contacted him to meet us at the train station on our arrival. His name was Jack & as we walked out to the front of the station there he was holding a sign with our names on it. After a quick introduction we were off to catch a taxi to our hotel, the line for a taxi was huge, but jack said follow me & off we went he found us a taxi within 2 mins. He told our taxi driver the name of our hotel & we were there in about 15 mins.As there were 4 of us we had to book 2 rooms & again took some advice from fellow Trip Advisor travelers & stayed at the Tianrui Hotel Beijing, we had requested connecting rooms & when we arrived we were given 1 room on the 2nd floor & 1 room on the 3rd floor I tried to explain to the receptionist about or booking but her english was a little poor, I then explained to Jack what we had booked & he took over. She then changed our rooms & put us in rooms next door to each other as they do not have connecting rooms. The hotel itself is great & the location is even better a very quiet street in a hutong area of Wangfujing, the rooms cost us $100.00 Australian dollars per room per night.The next day was our 1st sight seeing day we had arrange to meet Jack down stairs at 9.00am & there he was with his great big smile waiting for us. We headed off to Tianamen Square & the Forbidden City which were within walking distance from our hotel, Jack took us thru a beautiful park that had blossom trees at this time of year. Tianamen Square is huge & is located directly opposite the Forbidden City. The FC was amazing so big & so much history [ allow yourself at least 3 hrs to walk thru]. After that we went to Jingshan Park located behind the FC, we climbed lots of steps & went to the top & the view was amazing. From there you can see how big the FC really is. We then caught a taxi to the Temple of Heaven this is another huge area with lots to see, Jack explains & educates us all during the tours. That night we went to the Beijing Acrobatic Show it cost $36 Aus each, some advice dont pay for the expensive seats as our seats were just as good, the show is well worth seeing.The next day smiling Jack was there to meet us again at 8.00am he had arranged a driver for us for the day as we were off to see the wall, the driver cost $100 Aus for the day. 1st we went to the Birds nest & Water Cube well worth a visit, then we went to the Cloisonne factory & watched some vases being made, they are beautiful but very expensive. We then went to the Ming Tombs I must say that this area to us was a little boring, you don't get to see any tombs at all. We then stopped at a little restaurant on the side of the road & had a lovely lunch with our driver & Jack the food was great & for 6 people it only cost $25 Aus. Back in the car & heading towards the wall we saw some beautiful scereny, after a comfortable but long drive we arrived at the wall Jack had chosen Mutianyu Great Wall as it had a chair lift up which was a great way to view & a toboggan down the kids thought it was great & I must say we had a great time to it cost about $20 Aus per person for the wall ticket chair lift & toboggan. The wall what can you say, it was amazing the views were fantastic we spent nearly 3 hrs on the wall taking as many photos as we could trying to capture the beauty. The kids had a ball & will never forget there Great Wall visit.Day 3 & at 9.00am Smiley was waiting for us again & we went to another Hutong area & did a tour on a rickshaw & spent some time with a lady who owned a home there, although she did not speak any english our guide for the hutong tour translated for us & we had a great time over a cup of tea. The cost was about $20 Aus each. We then caught a taxi to the Summer Palace WOW this place was huge & so beautiful we wondered around for hours I would recommend you visit it when in Beijing it cost $6 Aus per person. We then caught another taxi to Beijing Zoo home of the Panda the kids were really excited about seeing them, but were soon let down the enclosure & the zoo for that matter were very disappointing the enclosures for some of the animals were very cruel.We then caught the subway back to our hotel were we had 1 or 2 or more beers with Jack as it was our last day with him. I feel if you have not been to Beijing before you really need a guide to experience the best of the city & without going on & on Jack was fantastic & a really genuine & friendly person. I would highly recommend him. His services cost $60 Aus per day & was worth every cent.Day 4 now alone it was time for shopping we spent the day at Ya show markets, it was a great place for shopping but you do have to barter hard & be prepared to walk away if you dont get the price you want, most times they will call you back & agree to your price. Some items & prices we paid,Polo/tee shirts $6-$10 AusDress shirts $15-$18Mens Giorgio Armani sude jacket $40Converse shoes $10-$15Ties $1-$3Tag watch $40-$50I could go on & on but if anyone wants any more prices on info please email me.Day 5 was spent at the Silk Markets & again more & more shopping it was a great place to shop but we did enjoy Ya Show a little better as it was not as busy & the prices were a bit better.Day 6 we did a little shopping around the Wangfujing area & killed some time as we were catching the train to Hong Kong at lunch time, now that was a fantastic 24 hr journey, the changing scenery was amazing the cost was $100 Aus each.I hope our trip report was not to long but i just wanted to share our China/Beijing experience with you all. If we can be of any help to anyone planning a trip to Shanghai Beijing or Hong Kong please just send me an email & I will do my best."
40,“private guide in beijing”,"We just came back after a week in Beijing. We stayed at Holiday inn Express Temple of Heaven, and visited Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing Shopping Street, Great Wall at Muthanyu, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Birdsnet Olympic Stadium, Pearl market for some bargain shopping and ate at lots of authentic chinese restaurants. We also saw Chinese Opera and Chinese Acrobats shows. Both of them were very nice, especially the Acrobats show.We had a local young guide Daven ,take us to Mutianyu Great Wall, Summer Palace and Birdsnest Stadium. He also helped us buy discounted tickets for the acrobats and opera shows, with very good seats. He is knowledgable, very polite and speaks good English. If you need an honest, knowledgable and polite young guide, we highly recommend this young man. He has own business for beijing tour.His email is [---]Mary"
40,“Exciting capital of China”,"Recently I returned from my exciting Beijing trip. I tried to visit as many popular sightseeing areas as possible, that are recommended by Trip Advisor's subscribers, and it appeared that I should have reserved at least ten days to perform 'enough' research of Beijing's history and culture. Anyway, I managed to visit almost all 'must-see' places.The first day, which was Sunday, I started with the Temple of Heaven. To approach that location, I used the taxi provided by my Beijing hotel, which was Holiday Inn Central Plaza. Although now I cannot find my hotel's taxi card for that particular ride (I suppose that I have returned the card to the hotel's staff to provide them with taxi 'cost'n'quality' report), I reached the Temple in the short time and spent a few hours there. What amazed me at the very beginning of visiting the Temple were some people who looked as a chorus, and who gathered around the Temple's gate and park entrance, in order to practice-singing songs that I suppose were Chinese folklore songs or something like that. Some of the people had their notebooks to read the song texts and one man played an interesting musical instrument (a kind of a pipe – see the picture). After listening them for a while, I continued to walk around and throughout many buildings inside the complex; it was interesting to compare those ancient or medieval buildings to the modern architecture surrounding the area. After leaving Temple of Heaven (30 RMB ticket), I tried to find a regular cab to take me to Tiananmen Square. At first, I approached a group of cab drivers who tried to cheat me by negotiating a fixed fee, without taximeter on. I refused to accept their offer and spent some more 3-5 minutes around until spotted another yellow-brown taxi car waiting for customers. Its driver immediately accepted to drive me with his taximeter switched on and after a while, he dispatched me at the Square. The ride was 30 RMB and if you eventually approach this car's plate, B-L6961, do not hesitate to hire him!By the way, I was lucky enough to have sunny days without any rain in Beijing (although it was pretty cold), so it was ideal for moving around, mingling with western tourists and many elderly Chinese rural people who obviously were coming to see their Chairman Mao for the one last time in their life. At the first look, I missed to recognize Mao's Memorial Hall, because it was closed for visitors. (In fact, its visiting time was from 8 am – 12 pm (noon) and I entered the Square somewhere at 1 pm. Luckily, I revisited the Square on Friday morning, so I got my chance to see the Chairman's Mao grave.)You bet, much more crowd were gathered at the Forbidden City entrance because it worked until the early evening hours (40 RMB entrance ticket). That was my last visiting location for the first day in Beijing and I spent some few hours inside the Palace museum area, photographing interesting sceneries, watching all kinds of foreign visitors' and locals' faces moving around the area, making more pictures etc.The second day (Monday) I joined a small western tourist group, guided by Konglin & Violet. At first, we had a one-hour-and-a-half guided drive to Mutianyu Great Wall (the cost of that round trip was 300 RMB). When approached the sight we started the adventure with a cable car drive to the top of the Wall (35 RMB per person), then had some 2-hour guided walk through the Wall (if I remember properly, that was a walk from the tower #8 to the tower #14 or so; entrance ticket was 40 RMB per person). At the ending tower, we used the toboggan (40 RMB) to go down to the parking lot level. The Great Wall was fantastic experience because it was obvious that this 'endless snake' has required so many years for its construction and in the same time, several thousands of workers have to do the hard job, many of whom died there.After the Wall, we returned to the Beijing city area where the next stop was the Nest – the new Olympic 2008 stadium. After making some pictures, we visited the Silk Market building where our group started to dismember because of various plans. I wanted to see the Acrobatics show (ticket was 180 RMB) and have the Roasted Duck dinner at the famous DaDong restaurant (the duck, the soup and a beer cost me around 240 RMB), so all went great. I must say Konglin did the great job for me, because I mistakenly did not bring enough cash along with me for all the things. Therefore, after the daily schedule was over, he and Violet gave me a lift to my hotel where I had enough cash to cover their guidance fee, pay for ticket arrangements etc. Thank you, Konglin & Violet! I can recommend your services to prospective TA visitors of Beijing, without any hesitation!My third day, Tuesday, started with Lama Temple. It was an interesting experience because I never saw Buddhist believers to pray and I liked their procedures of firing their candles, communicating with their Gods etc. Although I did start the day with a taxi provided by my hotel staff (car plate B-G2600, 32 RMB for app 13 kilometer ride), the concierge suggested me to look after the metro station, which was close to the Temple area. The idea was to use a combined two-subway line ride to approach Summer Palace in the second half of the day. However, I also wanted to take my chance and after visiting Lama Temple, to see the capital's history museum that was supposed to be within some 10-15 minute walks from the Temple. Unfortunately, it looked that they have relocated the museum from an old location that was closer to the Lama Temple (according to the city maps), and it looked that the new building was not so close to the area. Instead, I managed to approach another interesting place, which was Confucius Temple and Guozijian museum (20 RMB entrance ticket). I paid the ticket and spent some nice time there because in opposite to lama Temple, the Confucius one was a very quiet and relaxing zone. Then I finally entered the Beijing metro system for the first time (it was the station called Yonghegong). I started with the subway line #5 heading to the Huixinxijie Nankou station where I switched to the subway line #10 heading to Bagou station (Bagou was the last station of that metro line). From that area, I was supposed to catch a bus to the Palace (the bus line #73 if I remember), but I happened to miss the bus and did not want to wait for the next one because it was already the mid-afternoon. Therefore, I hired another cab that drove me to the main entrance of Summer Palace. (That one was B-H8494, 20 RMB for app 6-kilometer ride – later the concierge told me that particular ride was a bit overpriced. In addition, it seems that even Beijing taxis are not so cost-effective for short distances.) The Summer Palace (20 RMB ticket) was a splendid experience and I enjoyed an easy walk through many nice walkways, bridges, ship-like buildings (see the picture) etc. The whole sight was fully crowded by organized tourist groups and other visitors. In the evening – app 6 pm it got darker and due to my being not so familiar with the public transportation, I decided to hire another nice cab to get me to the hotel (car plate B-K0260, 53 RMB for a 45 minute, almost 20 kilometer ride).The Wednesday's adventure started with Houhai lake area. Unfortunately, I went there in the afternoon because I spend the whole morning in the bed because the previous evening I survived an accident with falling in my bathroom's slippery bath. (I had a great luck with that fall because I have not broken anything but still had a great pain on my right side so decided to stay in bed until I felt well enough to go outside.) So far – so good. The taxi driver took me to the Houhai area and pointed his finger to the main entrance where I left the cab (Car plate B-F3089, 45 RMB for some 17-kilometer pleasant route. An interesting detail: During the ride, the cab driver talked with somebody by his cell phone. At one moment, he gave me the phone and I heard a female voice trying to ask me something. Due to my prolonged stay in the hotel room that morning, I thought it must have been somebody from the cleaning department trying to find out if I had some laundry or like – similar to what they already did earlier the same day. Nevertheless, it appeared that the cab driver was not sure about which particular side of the Lake I wanted him to let me go, but could not ask me for details due to a language barrier. So he contacted the hotel staff and they responded by asking me what I wanted to see. After some additional conversation between the driver and hotel staff, in Chinese, he let me go near the main entrance.) By the way, before I entered the Lake's surroundings, I discovered an outlet of the Beijing's Xicheng Tourism Administration. I went there to obtain some information in English (I looked for the area's souvenir shops) and managed to find there some additional prospects describing some more must-see sights of the Chinese capital (Eg. China Science and Technology Museum, Mansion of Prince Gong, Beihai Park etc). In the area of Houhai lake was an interesting preserved old-style village (such types of villages they call a 'hutong') and I visited some of its shops where I purchased a nice art picture made on a rectangular ceramic plate (I managed to bargain it to some 150 RMB). Many tourists have taken their opportunity and hired 'rickshaws' (a kind of a man-and-bicycle-powered vehicle) but I preferred to do the whole visit by foot. Later in the afternoon, I hired another cab (B-L1914, only 13 RMB for some 15-minute ride) that transferred me to the famous Wangfujing shopping area, fully crowded by foreign and domestic - mostly rural visitors. As a part of Wangfujing zone, there is a street market area where you could buy some weird food (including fried little scorpions and other kinds of roasted bugs, as well as chicken, beef and otherwise 'known' meat on a stick).After spending some few hours at Wangfujing, I finally learned how to return back to the hotel (Holiday Inn Central Plaza) – but without taxi. Actually, there is a Wangfujing subway station that is hidden in the basement of a large shopping mall (I forgotten its name). If you happen to be accommodated in the same hotel as myself, you should take the line #1 in a direction that goes thru the station named Nanlishilu (A remark: Take always a city map with you. By the way, subway tickets are two RMB only). At Nanlishilu station, exit the subway, go upstairs and out the station, turn right at the street crossing, walk some hundred meters and locate the bus stop for bus line #56. (I was amazed when recognized people quietly waiting in a queue, one by one – which is something completely opposite from the custom in Serbia.) So, join the queue if it is there, enter the bus (bus tickets are 1 RMB, don't expect to get a real ticket from a driver or bus conductor – just put the money in the transparent box close the crew), and enjoy local passengers watching you as the stranger for some 10 minutes. Leave the bus (I forgot the name of the nearest bus stop but if you happen to miss the stop *before* the hotel if it is dark outside, you will spot the green logo of the hotel, so leave at the stop *after* the hotel and walk back, what happened to me once). After a 3-minute walk, you are in the front of the hotel. That way, and despite Holiday Inn's no proximity to a subway station, you would be capable to each major locations (Tiananmen, Wangfujing etc) for just 1+2=3 RMB per direction. In addition, if you use that kind of transportation back to the hotel in the evenings, very close to your #56 bus stop there is a bakery and some food stores so you can get something for your supper at almost no cost. Beer cans start from 2.60 RMB, salted peanuts and/or a cookie at 3 RMB, a package of various kinds of Chinese cakes at app 8-10 RMB etc. Compare that with the Holiday Inn's 200+ RMB buffet dinner…) Being a passionate beer lover, I wanted to taste as many kinds of it as possible. I have not noticed international beer brands in Beijing but their national (local) products of Tsinghua brewery in Beijing area offered several kinds of beer in both cans and bottles. They all tasted good.The next day, Thursday, I started the city journey by visiting Science and Technology Museum (from the hotel I was driven by B-M4439 at 41 RMB for some ½ hour, 16-kilometer ride). I had luck with timings because I approached the museum at some 1.30 pm and just some 45 minutes later, there was a scheduled scientific documentary in the museum's 'B' block. Although the film was not much related with Chinese science (if any) it was interesting opportunity for having a rest for a while in comfortable chairs for museum's visitors. I even spotted some teenage youngsters who fell asleep during the movie. After watching the film, I returned to the 'A' block and continued with exploration of Chinese science. The best things I found on the fourth or the fifth floor, where they have proudly displayed the most important inventions of the old China: Paper, Printing, Gunpowder and Compass instrument. Of course, the Silk was also there, though they do not count it within the most important products listed above, due to unknown reasons. Overall, I was there until some 3.30 pm and when left, I took another cab to take me to the lovely area of Prince Gong's Mansion (the cab was B-J4866, at 20 RMB for some 20-minute, 5-kilometer ride). The entrance ticket was 30 RMB and the area was full of visitors. The small lake with a building in the middle of it, the birds swimming in the water and amazing stone constructions were interesting to see. Finally, I strolled thru the area of Beihai Park and lake (5 RMB ticket) to finish that exciting day of excursion. Outside the Park, I caught the bus to Tiananmen Square (it was the bus line #5 if I remember properly) and from the Square I was capable to continue with the subway (see the picture).My last day in Beijing, Friday, I left for some shopping. According to the Holiday Inn's duty manager, Mr Bob Tan, who helped me a lot to find myself as familiar as possible in that fascinating city, I used again the bus line #56 from the hotel to the Nanlishilu subway area and from there I took the metro line #1 to Tiananmen Square to visit Chairman Mao memorial hall. After that, I decided to take a walk from the Square to Wangfujing shopping area – just to measure the walking distance between the two: It took some 15-20 minutes of walk to approach Wangfujing. After their shopping malls inspection, I took #1 subway line to reach Xidan station, because Mr Tan had suggested me to research its own shopping centers. It appeared that spring sales took place in Beijing these days, so all stores were crowded with both foreign and local customers. Later, I returned to Wangfujing, made some purchasing there (mostly some traditional-style silk shirts) and went back to the hotel.My week-stay in Beijing finished with the 1-hour, 39-kilometer (115 RMB) taxi ride to the modern, clean and well-organized Terminal 3 of the Beijing's airport. I had enough time to spend remaining RMBs for some sweets and souvenirs before I left China. I am sure that in years to come I am going to revisit that country again."
50,“Beijing tips”,"Beijing has something for everyone. My experience was back before the Olympics but the info is still relevant. BEIJING - If there is one descriptive - BIG. Whilst Hong Kong and Shanghai seem to pack the people into a confined (relatively) space, Beijing's 14 million plus are spread over a huge area. The taxis are cheap but you can better experience the city via public transport. Therefore choose a hotel within a block of a subway station. (The blocks are quite large.) I chose Crown Plaza near the Wangfujing shopping area and had no problems. GETTING AROUND - If you have luggage get a taxi from the airport for about 80RMB (A$15). Like Shanghai you will need to trust the driver as their style of driving seems sure to lead to a heart attack. The subway is cheap. 2 RMB for a single trip with very regular trains. Around 5pm they can be very crowded. Don't let the map fool you as there is about a mile between stations so you should wear comfortable shoes. If you have children hold onto them when crossing streets. Like Shanghai the rules are different than every other country I have ever visited. Even if the pedestrian crossing is green, turning vehicles from both directions have right of way. The trick is to cross with a local and stick with them. SIGHTSEEING - The Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City are your normal musts. I'm not a museum goer but I do recommend the Capital Museum (20RMB). It is a great building and houses displays of past Beijing life and Chinese artifacts. See the movie on the history of Beijing but sit at the front or stand at the back of the sides so that you can read the English subtitles at the bottom of the screen. There is also a good shopping centre diagonally across from it but they would not bargain on prices. Even at a fast pace allow 3-4 hours for each of the above. RESTAURANTS - Trust your concierge or stick to the hotel restaurants. Using the adverts on the maps or trying a restaurant because it looked OK led to very mixed results. Cost was very low so there was no harm leaving the food. BUILDINGS - Obviously the Birds Nest and Water Cube are a must for a drive past. I could not go to them during my visit."
30,“Halting new-comer”,"This is a 3+ review. With some adjustments it will be a clean 4. We stayed in Beijing for one week and decided to find an apartment to have more space.When you read this review keep in mind the following: We first booked at Westin Residences in Financial Street but re-booked because we found out that Fraser had a more central location. So we sacrificed the 5 star breakfast at Westin for a 1 star breakfast at Fraser's. That may influence this review a little bit.The Fraser breakfast was boring. We ended up eating at a French deli down the street the last couple of days. Many residents are from Asia, and this was reflected in the very few hot dishes that was on offer each morning. In addition, some danish pastries, jam and toast. The juice was completely tasteless, tasted like thickened water.The breakfast is served from 0700 to 0930. Do not get there too early as the hot dishes are not ready until 0730. We were actually offered cold beans and bacon one morning when we got there at 7 am. Yum!The apartments at Fraser are lovely though, new, fresh and modern. We stayed in a 1 one-bedroom premier. But it seems like the carpenters were in a hurry to get the complex ready in time. Loose wooden floor and some other negligences regarding filling and painting in our apartment serve as examples of that. 4 times during our stay our toilet was flooded. Need I say more.We chose Fraser because of the location. And it is not bad at all. But when you hire an apartment you expect to find a super market or at least something similar to a 7 Eleven nearby. No such thing. The super market closest to Fraser's was one kilometer away. That is not acceptable.If you have not been to Beijing before you will sooner or later experience that most taxi drivers neither speak English nor can read maps. Therefore most hotels provide their guests with a business card with the address of the hotel in Chinese. Fraser, too. Problem is that the street name is completely unknown for the drivers. Most of them end up letting you off at something called The Place, and you would have to walk the last 500 m to the door. Fraser's should therefore provide their guests with a much more comprehensive and detailed instructions on how to get back ""home"" (also due to some traffic and one-way-street regulations nearby).Fraser Suites also provide their guests with pool, gym and business centre. We only tried the pool. It was cold, and the changing room was freezing cold. It seems like they saved money on heating, including elevators and breakfast room. Not exactly guest friendly.Fraser Suites has to improve to deserve more than 3 stars."
50,“what an amazing experience”,"We are a family of 5 who have just returned from the olympic games in Beijing and the only thing we can say is;WOW. We have had the most amazing time of our lives, everything, the people, places, food etc were fantastic what a city it is. The vastness of Beijing almost overwhelmed us, it seemed to take ages to get anywhere and the heat was also an issue but it was worth it all. Anyone vaguely considering a trip there should go for it you will not be disappointed."
50,“The City with Culture and Character”,"Beijing is a city like no other. It has rich culture, friendly people and lots of attractions for all age groups and people with different interests.The major attractions in Beijing (not to be missed) are:THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA:I'd advise you to go with a tour, since if you try to get there at your own, it will waste a lot of time although will save you some money. Don't forget to take a water bottle with you. Once you reach Great Wall, take the ""slanting car"" to go up the steepest part of the wall since walk can be very very tiring. Then climb rest of the way upto the highest point. Badaling section is most traditionally visited. Although nowadays second and third time visitors go to other parts.TIANANMEN SQUARE:One of the most major tourist attraction in Beijing, if not in China. Surrounded by museums and well decorated. Again, dont forget to take some water with you and enjoy yourself :)SUMMER PALACE:Beautiful, perfect for a romantic getawayFORBIDDEN CITY.SILK STREET:And pearl market. You will find anything and everything from designer shirts to rugs and table cloths here on very reasonable prices (if you know the art of bargaining). I suggest you to pack light when going to China coz you will come back with lot more stuff.Everything here is usually very good quality so you can shop with confidence. For bargaining, following tips:1. Some say divide the asking price by 2, some say offer 20%, I'd say start by offering 10% (there is a good chance u will get that) and dont go any more than 15-20%.2. Eavesdrop on other shopper's bargaining (and keep in mind that they might not be good at it)3. Try the ""walk away' technique. Tell them in a final tone ""you are going to the next shop"" and walk away slowly, usually they will give you a much lower price, turn back and repeat your final offer. If they dont agree, walk away. Usually they will give it to you. If not, go to the next shop.4. Don't be flattered no matter how charming the shopkeeper is and how ""handsome"" or ""pretty"" you want to think you are.5. Convince the shopkeeper that you did not hop off a tourist bus and you know the city and the market, so give you a genuin price.6 Remember, people working there are good people working for long hours, be respectful to them. Hopefully both of you can agree on a price and everyone will be happy.Dont forget to try both the food court at the lower most floor of silk street and also the great restaurant at the top floor.If you are going to Silk street, check out the underground market right in front of it which u have to go through to reach the subway station. Locals shop there and its very cheap.There are other markets in Beijing which are bigger than silk street, but to reach them you have to take buses and its not as convenient.Other attractions like Ming tombs are ok.For food, one thing that you should not miss in Beijing is Roast Duck, that I tried in Wangfujing area and was absolutely amazed at the juicy taste.Hotpot you can try in any city, but in Beijing also its pretty good.Its a great city to visit. I hope you enjoy your time. Best of luck."
20,“If you are going to Beijing...”,"Beijing was a very interesting city, and I will never regret making the trip. However, since the city will soon experience a boom in tourism due to the Olympics, I thought I would help my fellow travelers with some observations. If these aren't exactly coherent, please forgive me, I've only been back for a few days, and my mind hasn't quite gotten over the jet lag just yet.The first thing you should know is that Beijing is incredibly hot and according to a friend who is from China, it's only going to get hotter in the next month. It's probably a good idea to follow the lead of the Beijingers and use an umbrella as a parasol, especially if you are fair-skinned. With the heat, be prepared to sweat, a lot. Therefore, drink as much water as you can. However, it's not uncommon for public bathrooms to be without toilet paper. Charmin makes little to-go rolls, I highly recommend sticking a couple in your bag. And don't be surprised when the bathrooms are little more than holes in the ground, not exactly what we're used to in the States or western Europe. While we're on the topic of bathrooms, bring anti-bacterial hand gel. Don't bother with hand wipes, as they only create more garbage. If you find it uncomfortable to have a layer of sweat on your face, bring some of those water-less face clothes. Dove makes some that are easy to stick in your pocketbook, or just bring a small light-weight cloth to wipe your face with.If you are a picky eater, pack some granola bars, trail mix, or anything else that will get past customs and be easy to tote around. If you are adventurous, have at it. None of the people I was traveling with were brave enough to try anything outside the hotel. Be warned, however, that most stories of stomach bugs I heard came following eating street vender food. If you go to some of the outdoor markets, be prepared to smell things that you have never smelt before. It's telling when the people who cook the food do so while wearing surgical masks.I was told that a lot of people in Beijing speak English, this isn't necessarily true. Most taxi drivers don't and they will look at you cross-eyed when you point to your destination in the guide-book. Have your hotel front desk write down your destination in both Chinese dialect and English. This will help both the cab drivers and you be sure of where you are going. Also, write down your hotel address in both Chinese and English, so that you can find your way back. Lastly, make sure that your taxi driver uses the meter, otherwise you are likely to be overcharged.I think that's it...if you are going to the Olympics, have a great time, take full advantage of your time over there. Make side trips, and if you can get to Hong Kong, do so. We spent a week each in Beijing and Hong Kong and I very much preferred Hong Kong.Happy travels!"
50,“top tips for first timers”,"Arrival- langauge barrier (get hotel name in Chinese character)Be ready for bad air quality, we came through shanghai - went outside and the sky was yellow!Don't be put off by all the building work. Check out the westernised name badges of hotel staff (some are classics)Tips are not part of the culture - you are not in America (we were advised it is deemed rude, although now common place in large international hotel chains for bell staff etc.), although expect many US visitors won't be able to help themselves - Once started there is no turning back....Get some background on culture, manners, and what local wages are. (YOU ARE IN CHINA- PAY IN CHINESE NOT DOLLARS!). This really started to annoy us.Try the local food- within reason not KFC, visit old town(hutong)before they all get knocked down.get up early one morning and go to Temple of Heaven park- One of our highlights (traditional Ti Chi/ dancing/ paper art/ people watching)- all locals and not laid on for the tourists- utterly amazing experience.Best bet hire a guide and car for the day - much more benefit than a organised tour (wall etc) as you'll spend large amounts of your day in shops that give the company commission. You will also find out much more about the country & the people.Haggle at the markets Hard, it adds to the fun. and they did expect it, although watched a group handing over chunks of Dollars to a smiling vendor- Remember they will not sell it if they aren't making any money...Take lots/lots of memory cards- Be very wary of ANYTHING you buy as you must assume its fake (memory cards/ clothing/ anything that seems too good to be true).Bottled water is one to watch (Easy to pick up a cap sealing machine)- buy from a proper shop.(A travel plug for the sink/bath), carry lots of toilet paper/ tissues (very rare to find in any restroom outside main shopping centres)If going out on day trips don't expect to find many amenities."
50,“Kung Fu Journey”,"Great place, great people, great food."
40,“Chinese signs are necessary for travel - English language is no good”,"As in other places in China, it is good to carry the hotel name and address in Chinese - example - Novotel Xinqiao, Beijing(北京诺富特新侨饭店). Ask for the hotel card in Chinese once you reach there.http://www.sinohotelguide.com is useful that I found which provides the names and addresses of the hotels in Chinese. So, you can print this and have this handy.Also, http://www.beijing-travel-guide.com is a useful site where you can find names of attractions in English and Chinese with the phoenetic pronounciations and voice. Remember, the Chinese names of hotesl and attractions are different from what we know in English - example - Forbidden city is gǔgōng in Chinese. Also, the site includes common phrases in Chinese.http://www.mangolanguages.com also has some free Chinese lessons - very useful - if you have the time before your travel."
50,"“Great Guides, Great Hotel, Great Trip!”","This trip report is long overdue but here goes anyway! I'm rushing a little so please forgive the grammar. This report is about the hotel and the guides we used in Beijing. I won't say too much about the sites since there is already so much written about them but if anyone has specific questions, I'm happy to answer.Went to Beijing in November of 2007 as the final leg of a China trip with my extended family. We had already spent a week in Hong Kong which included a trip to our ancestral village in the south of China to bury my grandmother. This was now the fun part. My husband and I took our 3 boys ages 7, 9, and 11 and spent 5 days in Beijing. It was terrific. We stayed in a suite (huge!) at the Grand Hyatt on Wang Fu Jing which cost an arm and a leg but was worth every penny. The service was fantastic - 3 panda bears waiting in the room on the beds for the kids and a rollaway brought in quickly by three very efficient staff members. There was also a chocolate welcome basket there. The suite had a big kitchen with microwave, two tvs, two baths, robes for all and slippers. Really nice. There was even a cabinet for our shoes! The pool is unbelievable. Breakfast buffet is also not to be missed but try to get it as part of your room package. It's pricey. The kids especially loved the real honeycomb dripping honey. The hotel is incredibly central and convenient. It sits over a large mall with an underground food court. There, you can find anything in the world you want to eat and if it's Chinese food, it's dirt cheap! $2 for a giant bowl of delicious noodles. Then of course you are right on Wang Fu Jing, a big shopping street in Beijing.The hotel was great but the best part of our trip was our guides, Konglin and Violet. Hooray for them! I found them here and on the Fodors website and cannot say enough about them. We arranged the details through emails and Konglin was waiting there with a sign with our name on it as we exited the baggage claim area at Beijing airport. What a welcome sight! He whisked us to his waiting van where we met Violet. It was Sunday, and the fabulous dirt market is only open on weekends (Konglin's recommendation) so he quickly took us to our hotel to check in, change then charge off to the market where we browsed and bought wonderful stuff for a couple hours until it got too cold.Generally speaking, we were pampered and whisked around to everything we wanted to do and see the entire time we were there. It could not have been more easy, especially with our three kids. Whenever we arrived somewhere, we would all jump out and Violet would immediately arrange the tickets. After touring the site or seeing the show, we would emerge from the exit and Konglin would be waiting there. What VIP treatment! Both Konglin and Violet speak English well and are very knowledgeable about the sites. My husband and I had both been to Beijing before but when I was there, there were more bikes than cars. Things have changed in ways I couldn't have imagined (can you say, Mazerrati Beijing?!). Being there with kids was a whole different deal too, so having guides was invaluable. We couldn't have done all the things we did in the time we had without them. The next day was sunny so we set off early for the great wall at Mutianyu, stopping on the way to see the Cloissone factory and have a delicious (and cheap!) lunch where Konglin must have ordered 12 dishes. It was great. Mutianyu was amazing. Clear, not crowded, a fantastic day and we all loved the sleds on the way down. I found some wonderful hand made dolls there at the market (the sellers are pretty aggressive as they are in most places), similar to ones I found at the dirt market - they are all intricately dressed with terrific headdresses and beading. A great souvenier.We went to an acrobat show, kung fu show, shopping at the pearl market and silk market (the boys became quite good at bargaining with the calculators!) and the toy market. We also of course went to the Forbidden City, the Beijing Zoo, Temple of Heaven (we all really enjoyed the walk out of the park there with all the retirees singing, playing cards, hanging out, a real slice of life), Tiananmen square, the Ming Tombs (again, NO ONE THERE, couldn't believe it, and beautiful weather) and the area around ""bar street"" where unfortunately the hutong have been completely sanitized. The only thing we didn't do is see the Olympic stadium but we chose to go home and take a last swim before departing that day. THe only thing I wouldn't recommend is going to the silk ""factory"" which I really had wanted to do but turned out to be more of a fake factory in a store that sold silk comforters. It was still interesting though, to see the process - the kids liked that part - it was the hard sell later that we all got tired of. Also, i think next time I would do a better job of striking out into the hutong on our own. We didn't see any of the very old hutong and i would definitely like to do that before they are all gone. Even my very recent guidebooks recommended hutong that had already been sanitized by the government, all traces of old and interesting parts plastered over, etc.Shopping was terrific. We spent all day at the silk market which is really a giant indoor street market with everything from silk to toys to knock off purses to jewelry. I bought some beautiful coin pearl and seed pearl necklaces as well as silver. Violet knows some of the vendors and can help get a good deal. She and I also went alone (no kids, woo hoo!) to the pearl market where I bought some other beautiful necklaces - very good deals - as well as pearl earrings for something like $5 each. I brought a lot of those home for gifts.People in Beijing drive like lunatics and Konglin hangs in there with the best (worst?!) of them, but we always felt safe and secure. All I can say is that if you are going to Bejing, especially with kids, you will love Konglin and Violet. They were so sweet with the boys, very patient and fun, buying them little treats and just being incredibly understanding. We were so sad to say goodbye! My parents are going to a silk road tour next month and will be calling them. Oh, also, my very disorganized brother was arriving in Beijing three days before me and got Konglin's phone number at the last minute, called and was able to hook up with him and Violet. They took good care of him and his wife and son as well!The weather was very cold but we had clear days which is lucky considering how incredibly polluted it can get. The only bummer is that we were SO busy all day and into early evening that by the tiem we got home the kids were completely wasted. Often we would go to forage in the food court and bring it back to them so my husband and I missed out on Beijing night life. I imagine I could've asked Violet to stay with them one night but I didn't think of it! We did sneak out for half an hour in search of an ATM the last night though and went to the food street off Wang fu Jing where we saw everything imaginable to eat on a stick including scorpions and centipedes. Very cool and worth going. ALso, the Olympics and signs of preparing for it are everywhere. It was fun to stand in front of the countdown clock in Tianamen Square.That's about it!"
40,“guides in beijing”,Well what can one say about china they are doing great without the western world.Only went there as i was turning fifty and wanted to see the great wall.we decided against tours as Im hard of hearing and have hearing aides and in groups hearing becomes impossible.We stayed in beijing for 6 days and loved all that they had to offerthanks to trip advisor as spent weeks reseaching where we were going.it was thanks to other travelers that we took there advice on thing to do and see.english was on the short supply there but still managed to get my point across when looking for a phone card.the great wall is a must I think for anyone going to beijing well worth the time spent.We were lucky we had a great guide named Konglin as he lined up when the queues were impossible booked our tickets to the Kung Fu show and acrobat shows and even booked our train trip to xi-an.he went out of his way to make our holiday special.sounds like im pushing him Im sorry but unless you like pushing through crowds and speak the lanuage guides do make it so much easier and personally we know we wouldnt or couldnt do half the things we did without our guide. more english signs would have helped but just the size of the train station and population is overwelming.I have Konglin (guides)email if anyone needs it and would be more than happy to supply it anytime.Get him to show you the art market as not crowded and geat bargains.Got know idea of the name but just told him what we wanted to see and he suggested ideas.Im not suggesting you need a guide every day but a few days to start off gets you pointed in the right direction.The markets are a must although found we needed a break every floor to build up enough strength to take them on again but it was fun.What ever you do in Beijing im sure you will have fun and loved the taxi fares as always seem to cost the same cheap fare every where we went.To sum it up trip advisor and guides are what we found made our trip worthwhile
20,“General Tourist information”,"This information pertains to our stay at the centrally located Harmony Hotel in Beijing:We found laundry to be a big issue... unlike Hong Kong where there are numerous places to drop off laundry in the morning and pick up in the evening, we found it hard to find a place to do laundry. The hotel does offer a dry cleaning service, but not laundry (for socks, underwear, T-shirts, etc.). We eventually found one in the Henderson Center (a block east of the hotel) on the 2nd floor, but had a lot of trouble with them. They spoke no English whatsoever, so it was difficult to communicate. They seemed to be primarily a tailor/dry cleaning shop, but did some laundry. When we finally managed to communicate we wanted laundry not dry cleaning, it took them two and a half days to do it, and to our surprise, when we picked up, all items were still wet! So, we had to hang them up all around the hotel room to air dry.Beijing is a rather big and confusing city, easy to get lost, especially since almost no one speaks English, and most signs and directions are in Chinese. We took the advise of some people here on Trip Advisor, and hired Sofia as a private guide. Sofia is 26, university educated, and speaks relatively good English, and is an accredited offical tour guide - meaning she gets free access into most tourist attractions (except the Forbidden City), so you don't have to pay her entrance fees to the sites. Sofia is in demand, and if you wish to book her, make sure you do it well in advance (at least a month or two) before you visit. She charges about 400 RMB (about $55) a day for two people. We also paid for her meals and our transportation - usually inexpensive: bus service is 1 RMB per person, and the subway is 2 RMB. For meals, she took us to some good local eateries to sample the local food, including 'hot pot', where you cook your own food in a hot pot in the center of the table. Sofia is also quite knowledgeable about the local vendors, and can advise or even help you get the best deal. She can be contacted at: [--]Although Sofia is an excellent guide, she will use public transport with you. She does not have a car, so if you plan a visit to the Great Wall, she will hire a car for the trip - this cost us an additional $600 RMB for the trip. The Great Wall is about 90 minutes from the Hotel, but definitely worth it - it was the highlight of our trip - of any trip I have ever taken - absolutely a must see. Consider paying a few dollars more to take the toboggan run back down from the wall - fun!Two of the more interesting places to shop are the silk market and the dirt market. The sellers there are usually better versed in English than the rest of the people; they are accustomed to barganing for items. They suggest a price and you counter offer, and it goes back and forth until a mutually agreeable price is met. Generally, if they offer a price, start with a counter offer of about 10% of their offer. And be firm.. even walk away.. they will come after you offering a lower price.The silk market is a 5 or 6 floor building, containing mostly clothing, but also some electronics, luggage, and other items. One floor is dedicated to the Pearl Market, where you can get good deals on cultured pearls. And don't forget the underground at subway level and in the under-the-road crossing... there are also many vendors there. The silk market east of the Harmony Hotel, and is just two bus stops away on the 802 bus line, which you get in front of the Henderson Center on the north side. You can also reach it on the subway line.Continue on the 802 bus a few more stops and it will drop you off at the Dirt Market. Best to go there on Saturday or Sunday, when there are more vendors set up on the side lines. A must-see experience, with some very different and unusual items. Do not take a bicycle rickshaw back to the hotel. We had a bad experienc with this - although we showed the driver (who also did not speak a lick of English) where the hotel was on the map, he eagerly said he would take us for 100 RMB (Yuan), however, it is a long trip and he got very tired and just stopped after some time dropping us off in some place where we had no idea where we were. Furthermore, he wanted an additional $100 RMB, claiming the price was 'per person', not per trip. A rip-off! We hailed a taxi that took us back to the hotel for $10 RMB.Speaking of getting lost, ask for a tourist map at the hotel desk. It is not perfect (does not list many of the smaller streets), but it does have many of the popular landmarks and tourist sites on it, including the Olympic sites. It is better than any map I could find on the internet. Also, always take the little folder card your key-card csme in with you - it has the hotel address and phone number (in Chinese), as well as a small map to the hotel on the back. As others have noted, this hotel is small and most taxis do not know where it is. Highlight the hotel on the card and on your map, and use them to direct the cab driver to your hotel.Maps of Beijing may be hard to find on the net; but as I said, you can get a fairly good one at the hotel desk (ask them for the tourist map), which has all the major tourist (and Olympic) spots highlighted. I made a copy of this map and can be viewed at: www.trenmore.com/images/Beijing-Map-2008.jpg (or you may email me for a copy). The Harmony Hotel is highlighted (in a red box) and is located just south east of the Forbidden City in the center of the map.Despite having the tourist map, it is easy to get lost in Beijing. It is a big city, and distances on the map are deceiving.. it looks closer that it actually is. And bring a good magnifying glass.. you will need it to read the map - the type is incredibly small! While there is some English on the map, many streets are in Chinese, making it still more difficult.During our stay (March 2008), much of the city was under reconstruction for the coming Olympics. This included the subway system, which was being upgraded with automated ticket machines. Currently, everything is done manually with staff.There appears to be a real concerted effort to clean up the city - thousands are employed with brooms and scoops, and are continually cleaning up the streets of litter.Beijing is a police state, and it is very obvious. There are military (green uniforms), police (blue uniforms), and security (grey uniforms) almost everywhere. Sort of gives you a safe feeling moving about the city. However, none of any of them speak English, so don't bother asking directions or anything else of them.On the other hand, we found the people in general to be quite friendly and helpful. While standing looking at our map, we frequently had strangers approach us asking (in very broken English) where we were trying to get to. Unfortunately, they did not seem to know how to read a map or find our location on it.The city center is about 30 to 35 km from the airport. However, because of traffic, expect the taxi ride to run about 100 RMB, including the road tolls. And allow about 1 hour for the trip - traffic is extremely congested. In fact, to allieviate some congestion as well as smog, the city plans to restrict vehicle traffic during the Olympics (odd licence plates on one day, and even on the other). The new subway line to the airport is also planned to be completed by the time of the Olympics.Be extremely careful crossing streets.. pedestrians do not have right of way.. cars, buses, and large trucks just barge right through intersections. It is a free-for-all mess - don't even think of renting a car or bike.. much too dangerous."
50,“Rants and Raves”,"We have just returned from a week in Beijing. The Orange Hotel, 1K from downtown is a budget hotel, close to subways. As a budget hotel we would rate this excellent although english is a problem. Peking duck 2 block south, $7. We hired an excellent driver named Robinson Li for the day, who spoke good english and was very funny. He is expensive, but it was worth it. He gave us excellent tips on how to see the attractions and helped us buy incense etc. I would highly recommend him as we were able to see many sights and learn about them and he took us for a great lunch of dumplings. His company is www.beijingtaxi.com and email robinsonlitour@hotmail.com, cell phone [---]. Be sure to ask for him for the whole day as we only had 1/2 a day and then they switched drivers and the 2nd driver did not speak much english. Beijing is fun, exciting, modern and the people are great and want to help, but few speak english, there are no maps in english, few menus or info in english, so to hire a tax and eat in local restaurants is hard. However the people are extremely honest and will normally not overcharge you unless you are in a barter area. We have had no problem with GI, and have eaten fruit, nuts, salad etc. but the air pollution and dust can be an annoyance. I would say to good far outweighed the bad and the Olympics will be awesome to watch."
40,“Great place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there”,"So Beijing....a place you should definitely visit, but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list of places to visit.PROS: The people are nice and the food is very good (when cleaned and prepared properly).There are beautiful women everywhere. In my opinion the ratio of beautiful women to not as beautiful women is around 7 or 8 to 1. If I was single, had the resources, and could say ""Where can I go to 'have fun' for a month or two before I get married.” Beijing would definitely be one of my choices. (Of course this was my first international trip outside of USA in 16+ years). Anyway the point is the girls were very cute, especially those massage parlors. (No not that kind of massage parlor, or at least not what I saw of it.) The girls in the massage parlor were simple/plain, but because of it you could tell how pretty they were.EVERYTHING IS DIRT CHEAP. There’s no crime, at least not visible to the public.CONS: Everyone smokes, it's noisy as hell (they communicate through honking car horns.), and the city is very unorganized and not properly administered. Transportation is dangerous and lazy.It's not so much a tourist trap as everyone is trying to get over everyone (or at least the tourists).The environment is very polluted and the air is slowly approaching un-breathable.Because everything is bootlegged/dirt cheap the quality of what you get may piss poor at times.CULTURE: Chinas culture is very rich in Beijing; at times the people are very beautiful (you know nice attitude and what not.)The outskirts of Beijing are very pretty too. I went to one of their famous lamaseries (kind of like a monastery), the summer palace, and Tiananmen (sp) square. All very awe inspiring places, really humbles you. The food is great like I said.As a black person being over there I was like an alien to them. Most people don't have TVs and when they do watch TV they almost never see a black person so most people, especially those that live in the outskirts of the city and outside the city have never seen a black person. I was felt up (in good and bad ways so many times by people of all ages and sizes trying to figure out why my skin was the color it was. They kept asking me where I was from and of course no one ever heard of Jamaica so I had to fake it and say America. They kept telling me I was so buff and handsome and telling my girlfriend she was so lucky and that we were going to have big strong babies and [--] like that.Even at the massage parlor when we went I'd have at least 2 females and maybe a male working on me because they weren't used to a 6'1, 225lb black guy. It was a lot of fun because (with my girlfriend) instead of the normal 4 people (me, my girlfriend, and 2 massagers) the rooms were filled with more people and we were all laughing and joking and trying to explain why I looked the way I looked and how America was compared to Beijing and [--] like that.Beijing is a fashion/entertainment type city so the women there often dressed very hip/sexy very much a turn on.The food was great too, I was only sick once.I ate at their famous Peking (Beijing) Duck restaurant too (this is not where I got sick), my girls father is the manager/owner. You know the place that’s been around since the 1800s or whatever. They have a lot of food, heavy food, but not fattening, kind of weird.Bootlegging is everywhere and everything is cheap. They have legitimate stores and malls that sell everything fake. You can by anything and everything there. If they don't have it, give them a picture and they'll make it. The exchange rate is about 1USD=7.5RMB so 200USD gets you 1500RMB. Meals cost about 7RMB at the chain fast food restaurants. Probably closer to 20RMB at a nicer restaurant and for a couple like me and my girl that went to try everything we spend about 100+ RMB on meals sometime. But at 7RMB for a meal, you can eat for 1 US Dollar. They probably think Americans are rich though. I know a guy over there that makes about 12k USD a year but for him being 23 that’s great money (80k RMB a year). We bought a bunch of bootleg DVDs and CDs (got the Simpsons). Essentially we paid like 1-2USD per movie. (Simpsons was 20RMB or about 2.50USD) Hi end items like purses clothes watches, Gucci, Prada, LV, Rolex you can get at like 50-70% off if you go to the right places (of course it's all fake.)The pollution and air sucks. Buildings are falling apart in some places and there’s debris all over the place and the air is worst than LA. Half the time I was there I was coughing and my nose constantly itched. You can’t see past the horizon and definitely not past about a mile or 2. The air looks a nice grayish brown constantly. Except for when the GOVT makes it rain to wash the pollution out of the air. Because the Olympics in 2008 are going to be in Beijing though they have been cleaning up the surface of the city and the major roads you'll probably see on TV. Everything else though looks like a bomb hit it.Kids don't wear diapers if they’re poor and most people are poor. Parents cut a hole into the pants of the kids and when they need to go the parents hold them up in the air and aim and let it fly. Yes they go in the street/on the sidewalk in public. It's kind of funny and sad at the same time to see all those babies walking around with their bottoms cut out for easier access.Everyone smokes. I can't put it anymore simply than that. There are as many people who don't smoke as there are black people in China.It's noisy. Everyone honks constantly from 5AM in the AM till 4AM the next morning. There are no rules of the road. Pedestrians have no rights. If you are in the way of a car you either move or get run over. I can still hear the honking. Major intersections sometimes don't have stop lights and even if they do sometimes people will ignore them or they won't work. Cabs are strictly ornamental as most cab drivers refuse to pick you up or make a U-Turn if your destination is in the opposite direction. They also will drive the wrong way down the street and on the curb if it'll get them to their destination quicker. The city is unmanaged and the service industries are pitiful. They have no concept of customer service or quality of service, you get what you get and if it's not good enough or what you expected then tough [--]. Essentially you get what you pay for and because everything is cheap as you’re not getting much.In general though, if I was a single smoker and had like 500$ to blow (after flight). I'd go to china for a couple weeks and find a couple cute girls to keep me company.Otherwise, no thanks. It's a place I would hold off going to until I had been to everywhere else on the planet. You know the people are nice and the food is good but the air from pollution and smoking is so bad and being stuck in traffic for 2-3 hours is just not cool."
40,“A really big city”,"The air is terrible. The sight is great, lots of ancient palace"
50,"“Great Culture,History, Sites, but... I was there under Marcial Law...Ti a namen”","The morning we arrived to Beijing From Hong Kong, we were told that Marcial Law was just declared. When checking in at the hotel we were told we could not leave their premises. A revolt of no significance and it was for our safety. When we got to our room, looked for CNN, it was fine until new from China were aired. They were blocked and censored by the government. When we went to take our pre-purchased tour, the government owned tour company cancelled al tours with no refunds. When we tried to leave the country the same they we arrived, the government owned travel agency did not accept our travel tickets and wanted green backs! So what would an AMERICAN do under this circumstances? I defied tyrany! Hired for a week a female taxi driver. Took us to all the places that we wanted to see, including Ti a namen Square. We walked among thge people, no issues! We enjoyed that well spent additional $100.00"
40,“Travel in Beijing”,"For anyone traveling to Beijing, there are a few things you should know before you go. I found little info that was helpful on actually being there unless your on a group tour which I was not. Beijing is beautiful and huge! You will be much better off stayiing at a Western chain hotel as they are more likely to speak some English, although this may have its limits.You must have a travel book with addresses of attractions you want to see written in Chinese characters. Taxi drivers that speak English are few and far between. Taxi's are very cheap and I had no problem with them other than telling them where I was going. A taxi from the airport to downtown was about 80 yuan (11$)Restaurants that are not associated with tourist will only have menus in Chinese so take a phrase book with you at all times.China can be very very inexpensive or it can be comporable. The malls connected to the Grand Hyatt and China World are great but expensive. Stores that are on the street are cheap and the people are very friendly.Watch for the young cute boys and girls that come up to you and say ""hello< I am learning English. Can I practice with you? Its a scam!!"
50,“A great Trip To China”,"A Great Trip to China – Beijing , Xian & ShanghaiDay 1: Depart USA for NRT - in our case on Flt 19 MSP/NRT departs 3:05pm arrive NRT – 5:05pm following day.Day 2: Connect with NWA Flight 11 departs daily at 6:25pm arrives 9:20pm in Beijing .On Arrival in Beijing , take a cab from the airport to your hotel – (Only use the taxi cue outside, do not go with random drivers that approach you they will charge you 5x more than the going rate.) Ideally have your destination written in Chinese for the driver since most drivers do not speak English, at the very least have the phone number to the hotel and hotel name on a piece of paper, the cab drivers will call the phone number for directions. It is very inexpensive to take cabs in China . Example a 50 minute ride from the airport to your hotel should be around 100rmb (about 13.00usd).We have stayed at several places in Beijing . Our favorite so far is the Rosedale Suites Hotel – It has every available amenity and internet access is available in the business center off the lobby. The restaurant buffet is very good, but the hotel food tends to be very expensive by local measure.The best way to see Beijing is to prearrange a tour. We’ve used several services but our favorite tour guide in Beijing is Bob Wang - His cell phone is: [--]. His email address is: [--] he has a new website he is just getting setup it’s: [--]. He will arrange anything you would like to see or do, at a great price!The daily rate for 6 people was 400rmb. For smaller groups of 2 he is around 200rmb for the whole day! You don’t have to do a fixed package tour, which is really nice; you also don’t have to do any of the factory tours on the way to and from the main sights like the Great Wall, if you don’t want to. We requested the silk factory since its fun to see how they actually make it. But most tour companies get a kickback from these places. We have used him for many days at a time and love his fun personality and willingness to accommodate all of our requests. (The whole family went – a group of 6 people!) Bob even arranged for several people in our group to have massages after hiking the Great wall for the Day! They were only 100 rmb for a 1 hour massage and they came to our hotel!Day 3: Bob the guide, picked us up at the hotel in the morning. He hired a large private Van and Driver for our group of 6, which included a vehicle and driver as well as the tour guide. The cost for the entire day was only 1200rmb. That included 800rmb for the vehicle, gas, highway tolls, and Driver as well as the 400rmb for the Guide. We were gone the entire day, visiting the Great Wall at Mutianyu which was beautiful, about a 2 ½ hr drive from Beijing , It’s definitely worth the trip!. We paid our admissions to the Great Wall (60rmb each-about 7.80 usd ea) for a round trip which included a ski lift ride to the top and a giant slide down the mountain on these great carts that slide on a huge track about a mile long! You can also go up a separate part of the wall in enclosed gondolas, all from the same ticketing area. There are all kinds of vendors you can buy things from as you enter and exit the wall.From the Wall we went to Tiananmen Square . In the Square off to one side is the Official count down clock for the opening of the Olympics; on the other side is the Chinese Equivalent of the White House, and in the center Chairman Mao’s mausoleum. There will be vendors everywhere trying to sell you Olympic memorabilia, and lots of other items. Remember to Bargain with them - 20% of original asking price! You will see on another side of the Square, the Forbidden city (Tomorrow’s tour). Our guide took us to this wonderful restaurant when we arrived back in Beijing . All 8 of us (6 of us plus driver and Guide) had a fabulous dinner for 237rmb, including drinks. It came out to be about 30.00usd for 8 people! We treated them to the dinner, and we still had lots of food left over! Back to the hotel to rest and have massages!Day 4: Bob (Tour Guide) met us at the hotel and took us to the Forbidden City . The cost to enter the Forbidden City was 60rmb each. This is the only attraction that does not allow tour guides in for free – so we paid for Bob’s admission of 60rmb also. We spent a good part of the day there walking the gardens before we entered the actual city itself., then off to late lunch (another great deal). Next we went to the site where they are building the Olympic Stadium – They call it the birds nest. It's amazing! The swimming bubble building next door, is also an architectural wonder. At the end of the day we went to the Silk Market a great place to buy just about anything. They are open until 9pm everyday, and anyone you ask can tell you where it is. Great bargains to be had by all. You can usually get them down to 20% of the original price they tell you they want. Only things that are very high quality leather for example would cost more – maybe 50% off the original price. But most items Should be 20-30% of original asking price. Great Christmas shopping! We took cabs all day with a total day cost around 20.00usd.Back to the hotel to get our bags and off to the train station. Bob took us to the train station and helped us find our way all the way to our actual rooms on the train. We booked our train tickets thru the hotel concierge ahead of time, or Bob the guide in Beijing can buy them for you too. It’s much less expensive then the other options that charge a big fee for buying them. You can buy the Deluxe Soft sleepers up to 20 days ahead, all the other accommodations can be booked at only 10 days ahead. You definitely want the deluxe soft sleeper cars on the train if available as you have your own private bathrooms. Western style. ( The Chinese style bathrooms can be quite an unpleasant surprise everywhere, not just on the train!) The train tickets were 772rmb per person including the service chg the to the hotel of 220.60rmb for all 6. (about $100.00 per person.) The trip is about 12-13 hrs depending on which train you take. .Day 5: Arrive in the morning around 8:30am. We arranged a tour guide to pick us up at the train station. It’s easier than taking a cab for the day, since there are several places to visit. We found our tour guide thru the trip advisor website doing a search of tour guides. It was 800 rmb for the day, for all 6 people for the van, driver and Guide. Things are less expensive in Xian then the other big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai . You can arrange for your guide to stop at the hotel first, to check in and leave your bags before heading off to tour the sights. We then went to the see the Terra Cotta Warriors. This is a fabulous exhibit of Archeology. The exhibit contains more than 2000 Terra Cotta Warriors of all types, as well as horses and chariots, buried for over 2000 years. They are about 2 meters tall and no 2 are alike. They were buried; it’s believed to protect the deceased Chinese Emperor in his afterlife. It’s amazing! The cost to see the exhibit is around 85rmb each (11.00 usd) and there is a little train you can take each way from the main gate to the exhibit – (cost is 6rmb). Otherwise, it’s a short walk maybe 10 minutes. It takes around 2-3 hours to go through all the buildings – there are 3 main buildings. It’s really fascinating!After we left the Warriors we went to see the Xian City Wall. The wall completely surrounds the center of Xian and it takes about 2-3 hours to walk around the whole wall. Or you can take little trolley cars that hold about 10 people, it’s about a 30-45 minute trip around the wall. You can also rent bikes to ride around the wall. We chose the trolley, which was 40rmb each. There is also an admittance fee to see the city wall. (40rmb each). The view of the city from the wall is wonderful.Off to dinner and back to the hotel. Options are to take the train back to Beijing or have pre-booked a flight on Shanghai airlines. (Cost 95.00usd each for a confirmed positive space ticket to either Beijing or Shanghai ). We had the hotel business center buy the plane tickets for us thru a local travel agency when we arrived in Beijing . It was much less expensive then booking ahead of time. The train was sold out, so we took a flight to Shanghai from Xian.Day 6: Shanghai : This is a great city to spend a couple of days. The city is much more modern then Beijing and Xian. Beautiful architecture! The best buys in Shanghai are pearls. You can find the best shops in the Pearl Market building on Nanjing Road in downtown Shanghai ; it’s a 4 story building right on the center court. They have the best quality and prices; you need to bargain with them here too.Arriving in Shanghai : If you get a chance take the Maglev train from the airport to downtown Shanghai . ( It’s about 10.00usd each.) It’s a fun ride. You travel at about 300km an hour. It’s a magnetic levitation train, so you kind of float. It’s worth the trip. You can access the train via the skyway from the main airport terminal. You will see signs showing the way. You buy the tickets from a little booth manned by agents right at the entrance to the train. You will get a discount on the train tickets if you show them your airplane ticket. Then you can take a cab from the other end of the MagLev Train line to your hotel. The train is just a straight shot from the airport with just one stop. Again, only take the cabs from the cue at the train station. The Marriott is a great hotel in Pudong. They have English speaking staff, and the restaurant in the hotel is very good. The hotel will give you these little cards you can show the cab drivers that have all the sights in town to see, you just point and they take you there, then on the back is the hotel address and a note to take you back to the hotel. It’s great for the cab drivers, since again none of them speak English. The Old Town is really fun. Lots of fun shopping in this area. In the center of Old Town is a wonderful old tea house in the center of a small lake with 7 bridges surrounded by ponds full of coy, it’s wonderful. If you go into several of the buildings that surround the tea house to the 3rd floor, there are many wonderful restaurants where you can sit and look over the whole area, while you have lunch. It’s wonderful! Again, all the food here is incredibly inexpensive! Cabs back and forth are only 2.00usd most of the time. It’s not worth taking the subway for that price!Day 7: Take flight from PVG ( Shanghai ) to NRT and Home to the USA .Take NWA Flt 26 PVG/NRT this will leave in the morning around 10:00am and arriveIn NRT at 2:05pm. Some of the flights back to the US don’t leave until the afternoon, so if you have time to relax find the lounge on the lower level, below the original world club, not the new one. They have reclining chairs, as well as internet access and large tv’s showing CNN news down there. It’s a great place to relax between flights.A great finish to this trip is a stopover in HNL on the way home. You arrivein the morning and don’t leave until the evening. You can spend the whole day at the beach, and still make the next flight! Or if you’re really inclined like we were you can spend a couple of days in HNL recovering from the Asia Trip!"
40,“lived here. it rocks”,I lived in beijing for a while after I graduated. It's dirty and hot and the air is thick with pollution but after a while you kind of love it. See it now before old beijing is lost forever and replaced by something more sterile and less fun.
20,"“Beijing is very hard work, for a tourist”","First trip to China - spending 7 days in Beijing at end of March, '07. I am an experienced traveler - mature, laid back and open to differences in different cultures.Things I liked:Cheap cabsFantastic value for price with hotelsForbidden City798 Arts District (allow a full day - they close on Mondays)The Sunday flea marketLaoshe TeaHousePeking Duck RestaurantsBest thing is just looking at the Chinese people - the unsophis-ticated ones from the country - see the toll that their hard lifehas taken on their bodies but also see the pride they have inChina's great progress. I saw dozens of faces that wouldinspire a novel to be written.The Great Wall - very moving. This is worth the trip, even ifeverything else sucksThings I didn't like:Terrible smogVastness of the city -Not a friendly city for walking - not at allWangfujang Shopping area seedy and 3rd rate - approachednumerous times by prostitutes at night. The underground mallcalled Oriental Plaza is great - ultra high end - but why comeall the way to China to shop as if you are in New York.No one speaks EnglishEating out is difficult - no English menus around and you neverreally know what it is you are eatingThe whole price haggling thing is really tiresome after a whileand remember, what you are haggling over is probably a fake,so what is the point anyway?Not a user friendly city - it is very institutionalized in its look andfeel - very hard edged - seeing hundreds of glass walledapartment towers is not my idea of a good time."
10,“don't go if you have a choice”,"Go if you like: crowds, pollution, rip offs, weird food, unsanitary!!!conditions and horrible (absolutely horrible dirty stinking!!!) washrooms. All ancient architecture looks the same, taxi drivers are cheaters. Trip to the great wall included unsolicited visits to unwanted places such as a jade factory and medicine shop. Take a private driver if you want to see the wall. Which is quite boring after initial 1/2 hour and full of beggars. Beijing is OK as a stop for business purposes, but as a vacation - do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. I do not understand why was Beijing chosen to host 2008 Olympics, the newly constructed buildings are already sooty and dirty."
40,“Get the best of Beijing”,"Visiting Beijing is a breeze even for an unsure tourist. Right from the airport there seems to be a genuine warmth for foreigners and its a very easy city to get around. I dont think I've ever got through customs and arrivals quicker at any international airport.The taxi rank marshalls at the airport speak english and will translate your destination for you, help you with your bags and give you a brochure that explains how to make a complaint against a taxi driver.Taxis are a cheap reliable and very trustworthy way of getting around and whilst some are a little erratic in their driving manner it just fits with the general traffic flow.We visited in the middle of winter, but loved it. Sure it's cold...but it's also sunny and very little pollution comparitively.Highlights were the summer palace, drum tower, temple of heavenly peace, Beijing duck most nights, Yanjing beer every night, shopping at Yashow markets and eating and shopping in general.We also made contact with a guide named Qing[--]who was recomended from this site and we employed her for three days of hard core tourist bustle.She turned out to be the surprise number one highlight for the trip. We have had private guides elsewhere but never have we had one we ended up wanting to adopt!She's amazing for shopping, and local knowledge and we even got to visit the hutong she shares with her family.More importantly we got an insight to modern Beijing and China through the eyes of a 24 year old university graduate with a wicked sense of humour and an endearing manner.By the way, if you wear glasses take a prescription with you as Qing knows a whole building full of optometrists with specs at prices you won't believe!Beijing is going gangbusters at the moment with the Olympics around the corner and an economic expansion that will almost certainly propel China to become THE world economic power.It ain't all great of course...poverty still is widespread and to be poor in Beijing in the middle of winter whilst surrounded by examples of new found wealth must be real tough.We stayed at the Novatel Xinqiao in a executive room that was excellent for the money...we booked through the hotels own website and there was no problem at check in. Breakfast was included and was in a seperate lounge and as far as i could tell they would cook whatever you wanted. Also complimentary drinks and pastries were provided in the same lounge and at night there may have even been alcoholic drinks available but we were always out eating beijing duck and drinking Yanjing beer. I can't remember the name of the restaurant, but there is one diagonally opposite the Novatel in another hotel that does great duck. The decor is rubbish but the duck is good and cheap.Many attractions are walking distance from the hotelI dont think we are alone in wishing that something could be done to curb the spitting by men in the streets...I know it's their culture, and so much of their culture is being overtaken by western icons and traditions but...it can't be good for public health.Watch out for the 'art students' who will try to flog you rubbishprints for 50 times what they are worth.The history of Beijing and china is fascinating, however the contemporary city and it's challenges,people and prospects are equally interesting.Avoid the rush, rug up and enjoy the sights in the off season - you'll be glad you did."
50,“Beijing is the noise a bicycles bell makes...”,"Still more old China than new- go to Shanghai for a more upto date version. Beijing still hangs on to some of the old ways- for another couple of years at least!Cars are rapidly overtaking bicycles. Preparation for the Olympic games will take away some of the character and goodness knows what the traffic will be like by 2008!Go and see the forbidden city whilst it is still a dilapidated symbol of decadence before it gets ""restored"" to suit the tourists and walk across Tianemen whilst there are still people to meet who were there during the ""cultural revolution"".If you like experiencing other cultures you must go. This isn't a place for a suntan and sangria. You will definately feel like a ""foriegner!"" and if you are blonde expect to be photographed with people a LOT. Most important of all, talk to the people..."
30,"“VERY Interesting history, quite dirty, expensive”","I spent a week in Beijing with my Chinese fiance Spring 2006. Of all the places I've been in China; Beijingers came the closest to reminding me of the rudeness and filthinness of Paris!!! I could spend a lifetime in the Beijing Museums and Antique shops but could never live here. Tianamen Square and the Imperial Palace are wonderful to visit once but each courtyard and exhibit is much like the previous one and they seemingly go on FOREVER! I found the restaurants to be more expensive in Bejing (but still cheap compared to US prices) and the portions to be generous but I warn you.................don't ever look in the kitchen itself!!! Unless you stay in a 5 star hotel....don't expect many English speaking staff members. Some have basic skills but if you have any special needs it can be troubling communicating. Beijing seems to be 80% under construction......noisy day and night, dusty and very complicated to get around. I'm very glad I visited but don't see myself going again."
50,“trip report”,"Just returned from 6 wonderful days in Beijing - our second trip there. Stayed at the Peninsula Palace Hotel. Everything about the hotel was 5+ stars. Chose this one because of it's location as the last time we stayed at the Novotel across the street and found the location couldn't be beat. Unfortunatly the Novotel was not offering any deals through our travel agency and the Peninsula was, so that answered that!!! Will stay there again for sureThe weather for the middle of April was quite different than we had before. Wind, dust storms, clouds and cool conditions prevailed for most of the week. At the Great Wall we were forced to purchase gloves, hats and wool scarves because it was that cold and windy. Didn't mind a bit (the buying) as it allowed me to practice my negotiating skills before I went in for the kill at the market.Did all the usual tourist sites, as we were travelling with our 25 year old daughter and 17 year old nephew who had never been there before. Finally had a real Peking Duck feast (as I had gotten it wrong the last time) thanks to this board. We went to Qian men Quanjude Roast Duck near Tian a men Square. A complete 10 course feast including beer for 4 cost 1400 yuan - try that in NYC!!! Just was not happy about trying to get a cab home and being pulled at by beggers and little kids. In fact one woman went so far as to try to get in the cab with us. Pretty scarry!!! Next time I will make sure that I have a bunch of coins with me to throw away from them to get them away from me! Went to A Fun Ti Ulger Minorities Restaurant for the last night - had done that the trip before and loved it. Did not realize that there were two A Fun Ti's and had never been to this one before. THis restaurant had lots of business groups, both local and western. (the last time, we were the minorities). Fun show, 13 course dinner with winefor about $75 for four and at the end we all were dancing on the tables!!! We did make the mistake of ordering the tourist meal and the Chinese one looked better. Great fun place though. THis is were after 32 years of marriage, I found out that my husband was deathly afraid of snakes during the belly dancing, snake show!!! Had he been the one chosen for the show, he would have had a heart attack!!! I ran for the exit as the snake was carried towards him!!I want to thank who ever gave prices on what we should be paying for things at the market as that was a great help in negotiating. I did very well with my shopping as that is one of the things I love about Beijing!! I stood my ground and bought things for what I felt they should be. You don't come from New York after knowing the wholesale market and pay the same or more than you would there and I let the vendors know that. My family does think thought that they must now have a large picture of me posted at some of the markets though!!! Tried a new market this time, Sanli Tunya Show Clothing Market, and did VERY well there. Many of the vendors are the ones that had been at Ya Ba Lo (the Russian Market which I did very well at last time!). I started out at the Pearl Market and went to Mr. Ping (#111). I was pleased with him last time, but found that many of his prices were a bit higher than Show Market, and at Show Market I did not have to haggel as much. Mr. Ping did have some higher quality pearls that I didn't find as much at Show, but his less expensive pearls, I felt, were a bit more expensive thank Show's. Last time, though, I picked up several beautiful strands of sea pearls for $45/strand and they were appraised at home for $1200 a strand. The appraiser knew I had picked them up at China and that they were China pearls. Just hope I did as well this time. Did not get to the new Silk Market this time, but I understand from talking to some of the flight attendants on the trip home that they did well as the vendors seemed slow and really wanted to make a deal. I stayed away this time because I just didn't want to deal with, ""HELLO, HELLO!!!!"" and people grabbing after me! Now I'm sorry I didn't make the trek. A heads up when leaving the markets. The first time we got taken for $10us to get a cab back to the hotel. It should have cost between 10 & 16 yuan! The next time a cabbie tried to get us, I told him I was only going to pay if he used the meter. since I realized that he was going to get me one way or another, I just walked a block away and grabbed a metered cab. Success!!!!If you have any questions, just e-mail me at elle481@hotmail.com~Elle"
10,“People of Beijing are Racist”,"I just returned from Beijing. I was overwhelmed by the racism of the city's people. I was raised in the South of the US where racism is well known and have travelled extensively over six continents. Nevertheless, I have never encountered racism so blatant and omnipresent as in Beijing. Everyday people laughed, stared, and jeered at me. I am too well-acquainted with the Chinese culture to believe this was a cultural misunderstanding. This was racism. I may have been the only brown person they have ever seen, but that is not reason to treat me with disrespect. Everyday I felt as if I was not welcome and should leave. I felt this everyday by an overwhelming number of people, young and old, male and female. I felt this everywhere I went from the Forbidden City to the local shopping mall to the random streets. I felt unsafe.I wish I had gone only one day - to see the Great Wall and quickly leave Beijing. No other place in all of China was worth the treatment I received."
50,“And then I discovered Beijing”,"It always seemed strange to me, considering the expense of international travel, that people get so excited about visiting England, Australia, and other developed nations. For my dollar, it seemed a wiser choice to go somewhere where the people didn't wear the same clothes, eat the same food, speak the same language, or have a similar culture; in otherwords, someplace a bit exotic.To that end, I've visited almost every place there is to see in Asia. Thailand was wonderful, Japan was spectacular (though a tad too expensive), and post-war Vietnam was rather what I expected. I experienced South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, Maylasia, Singapore, the Phillipines, Cambodia, and then I discovered Beijing!The Capital City of the People's Republic of China is clearly the most delightful place that anyone could hope to see. Not only are the typical tourist sites rich with historical significance and visual grandeur, but Beijing explodes the senses unlike any place on earth.Though you must see the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, don't spend all of your time at the typical tourist venues. Awaken with the city and explore the back alleys on foot, seek out the places where you see no Westerners. Amid modern glass and steel skyscrapers are lanes seemingly unchanged with the passing of time. Wander the markets, freely interact with the openly gregarious people, and barter for Asian treasures of every description at amazingly low prices. Try a spicy noodle soup or a familiar Big Mac; it's all available and anxious to delight.My hotel of choice is the marble decored Palace Hotel (5 star) which offers buffet meals right out of a James Bond movie (you'll likely gain ten pounds in a week), and is located in the center of one of Beijings best shopping districts, within walking distance of Tienanmen Square.My knowledge of Mandarin (the language spoken in Beijing) is non-existant - I can only say hello (nee hao) and thank you (shie-shie), but since everyone in China seems to know English well enough to communicate, it's never been a problem. Crime is not an issue as it is many large Asian cities, walk about freely and unafraid any time of the day or night; honesty and courtesy are expected behaviors in the People's Republic, you will be treated fairly and well. Inspite of what you hear in the news, Americans are liked and respected in China, plan on being the object of friendship with the people of Beijing.My greatest endorsement for travel to Beijing is to announce that I leave for my fifth trip to that city in just a few short weeks. I save my pennies in a jar and eagerly await the time when I have enough to return to what my friends now call my ""adopted home in China."" I sincerely hope to see you there someday!Gary BrenzStoughton, Wisconsinmacv1@merr.com"
50,“Imperdível”,"Vale a pena ir à Pequim só para conhecer a Cidade Proibida, a Praça da Paz Celestial e a Grande Muralha."
40,“Linda ciudad”,"Le doy a esta ciudad 3 o 4 días para visitarla y lo que mas me gustó fue la muralla china que sin lugar a dudas es una terrible obra de ingeñeria para el tiempo en que fue hecha.Hay que visitar la plaza de tiananmen, La ciudad prohibida y el Palacio de verano"
50,“Más que muralla....un muro”,"Me gustó el paisaje en general y la gente. NO me gustó el caótico tráfico que hay en Beijing. Una anarquía completa de los conductores de coches, motos, transeúntes...lo raro es lo escaso de accidentes de tráfico que podría haber. Tampoco me gustó la contaminación ambiental....un verdadero problema de salud."
50,“Приятные пешие прогулки по уголкам Пекина”,"В Пекине очень редко встретишь человека, понимающего по русски. Поэтому при знакомстве с этим городом, лучше надеяться на себя, либо карты и справочную литературу. Нет ничего лучше побродить по старым кварталам, паркам Пекина и торговым улицам. Везде интересно, приветливые лица, меняются представления о народе. Приятно удивило отсутствие каких-либо пробок на проезжей части, несмотря на большое количество машин, порядок при входе в автобусы, милые бабушки, занимающиеся по утрам гимнастикой и многое другое. Такси очень маленькие, огромные русские мужчины будут чувствовать себя стесненно. Если боитесь потеряться возьмите визитку отеля, всегда можно показать ее водителю такси (цены не дорогие). Еда не всегда для нас подходит. Удивлением была сладкая колбаса. Обязательно посмотрите гимнастов."

50,“北京很现代，很亲切”,去了天坛、中山公园、天安门，这些都是必不可少的还参观了鸟巢、水立方，很有现代气息让人感觉这个外表古老的城市也很年轻
30,“为什么每次去北京都觉得特别累”,北京已经去过多次了，这回儿子上小学了特意带他去看看祖国的首都，可是每次去都有同样的感觉，也许是北京的生活节奏太快了，或是城市太大了，反正至身其中就会觉得很累，到处噪杂，儿子倒是在水立方嘻水乐园玩的很高兴。
40,“Vielfalt für mehrere Tage”,"Dem Erstbesucher Pekings bietet sich eine Vielfalt des touristischen Angebotes, das für mehrere Tage ausreicht. Ein gut ausgebildeter einheimischer Führer ist ein Muss, um in akzeptablen Zeiten die teilweise erheblichen Entfernungen zwischen den Attraktionen in dieser rasant wachsenden Großstadt zu bewältigen. Entgegen den Beteuerungen des Führers ist aber immer mit Smog zu rechnen, selbst am Wochenende. Im Spaziergangstempo kein Problem, aber auf intensivere sportliche Betätigung im Freien würde ich verzichten."
50,“Pechino”,"l'unica pecca è l'inquinamento, ma per il resto risulta essere una città fantastica ricca di storia che alterna palazzi antichi e moderni molto velocemente..la maggior parte delle persone conosce un minimo d'inglese quindi è anche facile riuscire a muoversi.."
50,“Definitives Muss in China”,"Natürlich ein absolutes Muss wenn man in China ist. Kulturell hat die Stadt unglaublich viel zu bieten. Auf jeden Fall sollte man den Temple of Heaven samt Park, den Platz des himmlischen Friedens, die verbotene Stadt, den Summer Palace und die große Mauer anschauen. Bei letzterem lohnt es sich auch etwas weiter rauszufahren um nicht dort zu sein wo alle Touristen sind. Ich war gut 4 Tage dort und war die ganze Zeit nonstop unterwegs. Es gibt in Peking so viel zusehen, man kann sicher 2 Wochen lang rumtouren. Also diese Stadt ist auf jeden Fall eine Reise Wert!"
20,“北京的司机们，你们真担不起首都的名！（有些片面，但很真实）”,我必须要分享一下我在北京某晚的囧境，然后，大家会理解我的评价。陪公司的客户来北京首都，请了当地的旅行社豪华游，纯玩，松散，基本每天就去一两个地方。第一天，司机向我暗示，因为我们是纯玩团，他只管8小时，之外，木有。我没跟老外说，因为老外已经说起小费事宜，说最后一天一起给。第二天，我们晚餐去全聚德，司机说，离我们酒店近，就不接我们了，然后就在巷子口把我们放下了，我们就慢慢的走去。其实一般还好，但我们同行的有一位腿脚不便的老太太。第三天，我本来打算着去钓鱼台国宾馆，司机又扛上了，嫌远（我们在王府井），要加班费，一小时一百至少的说，我给镇住了，平日我们也就给司机个百加上晚饭也可以拉原来北京的司机太厉害拉！……给两百，司机说不干，拉倒，我就让他去别的饭店～～～然后，好容易说，出门，然后，故事来拉！！！半路，老太太身体极其不适，说要买药，司机又不乐意了，但也帮我们找了，OK，接下来，老太太更不舒服说要上医院，找酒店问，说协和有接待老外的医生，行，回头。快到医院，司机又说了，把我们放医院他下班了，我说就像原来给你200+行不，帮忙一下（考虑到北京的士的难叫，我必须呀），BALABALA，还是不行，老外问拉怎么拉然后说不用司机了我们自己回去吧反正他的车颠得厉害，我就感觉到可能有事情呀。然后，在协和医院里，遭遇了混乱的收费，崇洋的大夫（这是老外说的，我有感觉但没好意思说，毕竟是我的同胞，毕竟被看轻的是我），友好的北京大妈，还有跟我们穷说医院服务之差的大姐，我们在混乱之中也度过这一段。差不多要结束，我们以为可以请医院帮我们叫车，收费口说找护士，护士说我们不叫的的士不肯来的，云云，然后我们就上大街上去拦一部车。先是一部车下客，我噌得坐上车，请司机调头进医院接人，一调头，没认路，司机没找到，又转过来了，然后我说大概在再后头的一个口，司机就问你们去哪，我如实回答，司机就说不去，他不认路，我说请帮帮忙，毕竟有老人家头晕着呢不能走，司机就是不乐意，怎么说也不行，停下来说我不做你这生意，找个认识的去吧！！！天知道我们就在协和医院的某一个门口！那是一个火呀，我下车，到对面去拦车，那是晚上9点，木有车，我真是哭的心都有了。然后，终于来了一部黑车，然后，虽然车很小有点旧，虽然司机上来就有点乱开价，虽然老外们奇怪地问这不是非法的车吗，虽然我们争执出口在哪的问题，但终于我们还是顺利地回到了酒店，然后，结束了纷扰的一天。第四天中午，在酒店叫车，聊起这事，司机说，就是这些人把大北京的形象给弄坏了，我深以为然。不过，这得怪谁呢？是日益增长的物价和人们无法遏制的金钱至上感，是大城市人们的冷漠和感情缺乏症，是人们心理的失衡，道德的缺位，或者是天朝……？？总之，我对北京观光不可抑止地反感起来了。
20,“Lieber nach Shanghai”,"War vorher in Shanghai und es hat mir echt gut gefallen. Auch Tianjin hat seine Seiten. Beijing fand ich furchtbar. Der Airport war noch ganz okay, aber extrem wenig Angebot für so ein Riesending. Aber noch ausreichend. Wangfujing Street eine Riesen Enttäuschung, ständig wird versucht einen ab zu zocken (Taxi Fahrer, Schlepperinnen bei Wangfujing, vor den Hotels usw.). Die Mitarbeiter in Hotels und im Restaurant waren aber immer super! Nicht dass hier der Eindruck entsteht dass es grundsätzlich ein Problem mit Chinesen gibt. Ist nämlich nicht so. Aber mir war das hier zu viel. Am schlimmsten: DER SMOG. Ekelhaft, teilweise kann man kaum atmen. Die Olympia Überreste sind nicht halb so toll wie man hofft, die Märkte (Seide, Perle) gibts woanders auf der Welt besser. Ne, Beijing muss nicht sein. Zugegeben: Verbotene Stadt ist durchaus beeindruckend."
50,“北京首都的变化很快，真的很漂亮”,10年之前的北京和现在两个样，变化非常大，走在北京的大街小巷，真的感觉很舒服，空气也不错，路过草坪，真想在哪里睡上一觉。呵呵。
40,“欢乐水魔方”,在团购网上团的水魔方的门票，原价200，团假38，带了宝宝去，之前在大众点评网上看到攻略，觉得不错，想补充一下带宝宝去玩的心得。周日人多，团了很久才决定在29号去，一是因为之前不是曝晒就是大雨，眼看30号就要到期了所以决定就是他了，二是周末人多，据说排队换门票就要1个多小时，我带着3岁的宝宝，这个辛苦是万万不能的，所以决定让宝宝在幼儿园吃过午饭睡过午觉之后，请了半天假带宝宝去的。庆幸的是老天照顾，虽是闷热，但是个大阴天不会暴晒或是大雨，水温合适人又少，又不会被晒成黑蹦筋，美啊！总结优点：1、宝宝在幼儿园吃过午饭，睡过午觉，体力充沛，因为提前离园，心情愉悦，玩的会更开心。2、人少，危险系数降低，排队枯燥的事情会减少，拍片的质量会大大提高3、下午3点到7点水温合适又不会太晒。4、玩完后一家共进晚餐免却背进园区进食物品的准备和辛苦。5、在园区大雨过后暴晒4天后去，相信水循环及阳光会杀死许多不干净的东东。以保证宝宝的身体及卫生。缺点就是：翘班带来的损失。失意的事项：应该提前买好宝宝的救生圈，虽然在园内买的游泳圈24元，价格不贵，但安全性却不高，因为宝宝一扥，就放气了，很危险，救生圈最好是不能排气的那种，尤其是对儿童。最高兴的事：选对了天气和时间。遗憾的事：还有很多项目没开放。搞笑的事：看别人玩刺激的游戏项目的表情。最爽的事：冲浪。希望的事：再次开放这个价格的团购。感谢的事：依照攻略给宝宝带了浴巾，改善的事：洗浴的水温低，水流小。
40,“能让人心情愉快的美丽城市”,在漫长的假日里，随着家人一起来到北京。品尝了北京著名的小吃，领略了北京的美好风光。长城，故宫，天安门，颐和园...在着一片美丽的土地上，能让自己感受到身心的放松，忘却了生活中的一切烦恼，只是深深滴沉醉。各位不妨在闲暇的时候也去感受下那忘我，自由，放松的时刻。
50,“北京”,"北京是中国的首都.去过很多次.每一次去,对它的变化都很是惊奇.它代表了一个国家一个民族的崛起,作为一个中国人感到自豪."
30,“真好”,去年暑假去了北京，其实觉得在那里住上几天，有兴致了出门去逛逛景点，累了就只是在住的地方附近逛逛街，串串巷子也不错！与其他地方相比，北京旅游景点的门票是比较便宜的，最贵的可能就是海底世界的门票，一百二，学生证也没有用！北京的小吃有很多吧，不过去的时候没有庙会，只逛了几个美食街！
50,“我爱北京天安门”,自从8岁上一年级的时候，就学会唱“我爱北京天安门”，四十多年的梦想在今年终于实现了，看到了雄伟的天安门，站在天安门城楼上，心情无比激动愿我们伟大的祖国繁荣昌盛。
40,“首都还能有什么说的”,chairman mao is watching!出去玩最好坐地铁，经济实惠，现在堵得太厉害了，打车就算了吧！玩的地方也太多，什么胡同里面很多特色小店的，记得当年在东直门附近的有条街都是卖玩具的，很有趣！
50,“北京”,去过北京一次，一级城市、非常不错的地方。我喜欢！天安门、故宫、798等等都不错，就是有的地方消费比较高！北京的酒店消费也很高，住房有点贵，便宜的不好找！
50,“北京，四合院的记忆”,四合院是一直让我神往的地方，我每次去北京都会去胡同转转，无论春夏秋冬，南锣鼓巷，猫儿胡同，后海，三里屯，789等等都有着浓重的北京范儿。
30,“北京很大”,北京很大，之前就很想去北京，后来有时间啦，我和家人就一起去啦，但不像在电视节目中看到的那种感觉，有点失望！哎！感觉一般！
30,“失望”,别人说六十之前总要去趟首都，更何况08年8月北京刚开完奥运会，总觉得应该去看看，所以当年我兴冲冲的报名参加了赴北京的旅游团，只是等我到了北京，才发觉原来一切都不是想像中的美好。一上当地的旅游车，等人一到齐了，导游小姐脸马上变了，开口就是让我们交那莫名其妙的多出来的不知道什么的钱，不交不走人，其次；早饭没有一餐是正规坐在桌子前吃的，都是一人一袋冷食坐在空调坏了的车里吃的，中午、晚饭吃的只能用猪食来形容；洗澡水都是冷的；早上四五点出发，晚上十一二点到宾馆等等，是我游玩过的最最差劲的城市了。
40,“首都”,很美的一个城市，既有东方的古老又有西方的现代，很多的名胜古迹让人流连往返。我们去了圆明园，北大，去了鸟巢，水立方，去了王府井西单。不同的景点展示了北京不同的一面，都具有如此的魅力！
40,“首都印象”,第一次去北京时，就感觉到车多，人超级多。现代商业气息很浓厚，我去的地方比较少，仅仅是路过北京。本来想去看天安门升旗呢，结果却看了个下午的降旗仪式，总体来说还是不错了。
40,“帝都”,原本很不喜欢的城市，去多几次后，发现是个很有底蕴的值得细细品味的城市。喜欢那的胡同，喜欢转角遇到的惊喜。每一次去都会有期待，希望一直都会带给我这样的惊喜
40,“北京自助4日游”,清明节和几个同学去了北京····到达北京西站很喜欢这个火车站的建造风格！第和天 我们去了颐和园 清华大学和奥体中心····地铁很方便！
50,“景美”,北京首都不仅景美人更美，山美水美情更美，有机会还是到天子脚下走走转转玩玩乐乐，舒缓心情，陶冶情操，修身养性，嘻嘻！
40,“Pechino”,"durante le vacanze pasquali con mia moglie sono stato due settimane in Cina, per fare visita a nostra figlia che sta studiando all'Università di Chengdu. Durante il soggiorno, siamo stati per sei giorni a Pechino, che abbiamo visitato non soltanto nei soliti luoghi turistici, anche perchè il tour lo abbiamo costruito autonomamente e direttamente via internet. Devo dire sinceramente di aver trovato molto confortevoli i viaggi aerei domestici ( ne abbiamo fatti diversi) mentre i voli intercontinentali di una nota compagnia di volo mi hanno un pò deluso. E' un viaggio che consiglio anche se il suggerimento è quello di affidarsi ad un tour operator o ad una guida locale, perchè, nonostante mia moglie conosca molto la lingua inglese, abbiamo avuto non poche difficoltà per farci capire; soltanto negli aeroporti parlano un inglese sgrammaticato e con influenza cinese. Fortuna che avevamo la figlia che colloquiava egregiamente con i locali."
40,“北京”,北京这个地方很好，但人多，车多，比较拥挤，有很多世界著名的景点，比如，长城，故宫，颐和园，天坛，···这些景点我都去过，而且特别让我流连忘返
40,“大气，但是细节可以做得更好”,我们是冬天2月去的北京，虽然那时候并不是北京最冷的时候，但是作为一个南方 人，这样的冬天也算是很冷了，不过天气的确很干燥，干燥得皮肤发痒了。北京就如同其他驴友所说的那么大气，但是却给人的感觉有点儿脏，很容易能看到有游客或者当地人吐痰的痕迹，让人感觉不是很舒服。不过总体来说还是不错的，就是太大了，坐车坐得太久，走也走得累了！
40,“德云社”,提前在大麦网订了票，去了现场果然票卖光了，很开心换了票。门口有小吃店吃了卤煮火烧，黄牛倒票价格很高，不过也有人买。当晚演出是德云一队，说的大都是传统相声，老婆白天太累听着听着实在挺不住打盹了，我听得兴致勃勃，下次有机会还去。
50,“北京”,北京是中国的首都，在2006年我踏入首都，心中感到无比的自豪，见这么壮观的宫殿，为之震撼，想想中国历代皇帝的行宫如此的强强强
50,“很宏伟”,那年我去的时候是高一~那时候还没有举办世博~北京的天沙尘很多~但是景点是别的旅游趋势没有的~比苏州园林宏伟的颐和园~延绵的卧龙长城~令世人遗憾的颐和园。。。这些去过了都不曾忘记~北京~真的很经典
50,“北京是个好地方”,是个非常好的地方，我喜欢这个地方，有机会还要再来一次。有中国特色，不到长城非好汉，地安门，南锣鼓巷（老外很喜欢去的地方，意境很不错，也适合一个人去逛逛顺便也吃饭了）这两个地方不远，北京西站坐122、109到达官营换42路公交车地安门下就可以直接到，或者你换乘到地铁也可以到的。
40,“:)”,人多，车多，环境可以，各方面服务态度也好，就是路很不方便找到，城市的绿化也可以，城市繁华，尤其故宫、颐和园不错，呵呵！呵呵！！
50,“充满文化的城市”,走在北京的街道胡同里会闻到那里人的欢笑 韵味 生活 工作的气息会感受到那里人的热情 聪明 和谐 大气很值得去的地方
30,“eine einmalige Erfahrung wert”,"Peking ist eine unglaublich große Stadt mit einem gut ausgebauten Netzt an öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln. Es gibt unzählige Geschäfte und man kann sich fast alles kaufen was man sich nur träumen kann.Doch es gibt auch viele Schattenseiten: in Peking gibt es kaum Grünflächen, die Stadt hängt immer unter einer riesigen Dunstglocke, die Luft ist auch alles andere als gut und es sind so viele Menschen auf der Straße, dass man sich kaum fortbewegen kann."
50,“故宫拥有独特的历史厚重感”,很喜欢北京这个城市，故宫更加是首选，拥有历史的厚重感、安静又很内敛，可以轻而易举的消化掉现代人城市生活的浮躁感。
40,“梦里的北京”,想去北京是因为让我魂牵梦萦的老胡同，很喜欢北京人哼着调子在胡同里穿梭的感觉，古老而深远。也因为奥运会梦想踏上那片土地一睹其芳容。最终到达北京，去了天安门，故宫，颐和园，感受到了深厚的文化底蕴。却没有机会好好逛胡同。北京值得去，下次带父母去好好看。喜欢旅游的人，处处都是风景，
50,“Ein Traum für eine Städtereise”,"Peking - ein Stadt voller unterschiedlichster und intensiver Eindrücke!Problemlos und bisweilen auch günstig per Nonstop-Flug von Deutschland zu erreichen, bietet Peking einen einmaligen Einblick in die Geschichte und Kultur Chinas. Ratsam ist eine Unterkunft in der Nähe der Wangfujing, da dort sowohl die Verbotene Stadt, Nachtmärkte wie auch die Einkaufspassage vor der Tür liegen. Nicht ausgelassen sollte eine Tour per Rikscha durch die Hutongs (""Altstadt"") und eine Tagestour zur Chinesischen Mauer. Mein Tipp wären mindestens 5 Tage für diese vielfältige Stadt! Zudem bieten sich die Monate April oder September an."
50,“北京 长城”,我是2008年北京奥运会的时候去的，去了很多地方，北京故宫、颐和园、王府井、长城等很多景点，印象最深的就是长城，中国伟大的里程碑，很了不起
50,“非常好”,我爱北京。俗话说，不到长城非好汉，作为一名北京人，我很荣幸成长在天子脚下，亲身感受到北京地大物博。这是一个古老而文明的城市，有很多美食和景点，希望大家也能爱上北京！
50,“北京小吃旅游样样行啊!!!”,"欢迎前来旅游,在北京有古老的文化,特色的小吃呢!!!可以称得上是旅游的好地方呢,生活在这里,喜欢北京的老北京胡同,喜欢这里的乡土人情~~~~~"
40,“北京”,"挺好的交通很方便,只是偶尔会堵车.风景很漂亮.景点也很多,西单那很热闹 .买什么的都有.我个人喜欢西单图书大厦,里面很好"
30,“moloch”,"peking, die haupstadt chinas liegt im norden des landes. sehenswurdigkeiten sind: der tianemplatz, der tiantan, die verbote stadt, der sommerpalast. ca. 1 autostunde entfernt kann man die grosse chinese mauer bewundern.es gibt viele hochkaretige hotels. hier gibt es -im gegensatz zu deutschland- autentisches chinesisches essen.leider spricht man jedoch in china (noch) kein englisch und somit sollte man in einer touristengruppe reisen."
50,“这个我爱着的城市”,"北京 一个来到这里就会爱上它的地方. 它是一个国际大都市 一个包容性很强很强的地方, 有来自各个地方的人 聚集在这个首都 . 它和 那些国际发达城市又不一样, 这里你能见到林立的高楼大厦 美妙绝伦的现代建筑 , 也能见到美如仙境的古典韵味风景 也许要把现代和古典如此和谐的融入在一起 就只有北京能做到了吧.来过 便不曾离开 , 我的爱 北京"
40,“百花深处”,来北京一年了，觉得很干燥，刚从南方过来时候完全不适应，特别是刚入秋时候，几乎保湿的东西都是一堆一堆买的，后来发现只要多喝水注意保湿就没有问题。如果以后能留在北京也是很好的
50,“北京”,真正的国际化大都市，身为北京人，就要以北京为骄傲！这里包括了全世界的好吃的，好玩的，好看的！北京也是很多人梦想中的城市吧！真的很好！足够繁华！大都市！
50,“整齐”,北京国际化大都市，我最喜欢的城市，街道整洁，花园优雅，夜景的炫彩，天安门庄重，人民英雄纪念碑庄重肃穆。人民素质相当的高
50,“北京”,北京是我们的首都，每个人都引以为豪的城市，这里有三千年的文化底蕴，也有现代化的都市风情，科技与文明相交织，造就了北京的与众不同。
50,“北京印象”,作为中国首都的北京，不仅拥有悠久的历史文化也渐渐结合了很多现代化的元素如：蓝色港湾、三里屯等等。除此之外，北京还聚集了各地美食，应有尽有。
40,“很好”,总体环境不错，城市很干净，房子距离很长，感觉还可以，玩的不贵，总体还说吃饭和住房比较贵，夏天比较热，冬天也不是很冷。
50,“北京我最喜欢的地方”,去北京玩了长城、故宫、天安门、天坛、十三陵，颐和园给我的感觉太好了，还想再去。十三陵去了定陵，陵区内松涛阵阵，帝王陵寝，好风水
50,“大气魄”,04年第一次去北京，终于看到了首都！北京真的好大呀！虽然人口那么的多，可是到处都很干净！而且市民的素质都很高！值得去！
40,“不虚此行”,北京之行，实在是不虚此行啊！！！我们在此吃的开心、玩得尽兴、住得满意，大家欣赏领略了长城的雄伟与壮观。。如果有机会，我希望再来玩一次。。。
40,“一个值得全身心去体验的城市。”,"中国的首都城市,令人骄傲的城市,令人向往的城市,一个全中国人民都知道的美丽城市,是一个值得全身心去体验的城市!!!"
50,“粉喜欢”,很喜欢的一个城市，去爬过一条龙的长城，喜欢那里住的，吃的，玩的，还有那里的人很好客，有机会还要去欢乐谷玩玩，去坐坐那里的三轮车享受享受，喝瓶那里的酸奶，很浓的说，下次要带上我亲爱的他一起，求有缘人。
40,“希望重游的故地”,北京有位影响我人生的书友，北京有我想见到的人，北京有我未实现的愿望，北京，北京！……想一个人静静地再踏进故宫，慢慢地行走，感受历史在这片土地留下的痕迹；想看看老北京的四合院，走走胡同弄堂，品尝冰糖葫芦的酸甜与炸酱面的咸淡，真切的感受古城的文化，希望能在那方土地留下自己的足迹，如果可以，也希望能开拓自己的一片天地。
50,“我爱北京天安门”,首都北京不愧是集政治、经济、娱乐、时尚为一体的大都市，到处风景秀丽，人文景观，古都风貌，购物、吃饭、住宿，真的是方便之至，每次游玩都是流连忘返。
50,“北京.首都”,"首都就是首都,繁华之中又不失庄严,长城的长,故宫城墙的高,透露着宫庭的森严,颐和园的宁静,联想到当时太后的奢侈,一个字,爽!"
30,“古典与现代的非完美结合~”,都知道北京有很多古建筑，然而也很现代化~但是总感觉自己与这座城市很是格格不入，也许是自己一个人旅行的缘故吧~
40,“古老与现代的集合”,北京这个城市，包含着我们太多的感情。小时候，她是我们玩耍的胡同，常去的公园。大了，她又是现代化的高楼大厦、演出场所、便利的设施，以及越来越多来这里工作、定居的人们~
30,“北京太大了”,作为宜居城市，北京好像不够格，气候不好，交通不好，房价奇高，收入差距大，压力也很大，还是中小城市更适宜普通人的居住。那里是有钱人的天堂。
50,“我爱北京天安门”,孩子将要过生日，已经兴奋了好几天。终于等到这一天，全家一起坐火车来到北京，登上天安门城楼，留下今生难忘而美好的回忆。
40,“真的也不错”,我感觉去北京就是玩古，而且北京堵车厉害，但是北京人的热情还是蛮高涨的，喜欢老北京的吃的，很过瘾，但是就是脏，而且北京人很朴素。
50,“北京，我们的首都”,北京去过很多次，都是路过或者短暂停留，直到前几天因为出差住了一个月，才有时间好好看看。地铁公交太挤了，购物很方便，首都人民也比较热情！
40,“繁华之上，寂静之下...”,大都市和胡同的融合...既有时尚的元素，又具有古典的风味...就是人有点多的...一到节假日，各地的游客都蜂拥而至以至于公共交通很令人头疼！
50,“北京，喜欢这个地方”,去北京是因为看演唱会，虽然时间很短，只停留了2天的时间，但是北京改变了我以前印象中的感觉。街道很干净，人也很好！我喜欢这座城市！我还会再来。
50,“综合大都市”,北京是一座集政治、文化、人文和现代的大都市，在这里能感受中国传统文化，也能体会现代城市的潮流和方向。是旅游的好取出。
30,“比较大气”,比较大气，但是人很多，天气很干燥。一年四季之中，感觉春天和秋天比较短，夏天和冬天比较长，加上风比较大，所以天气很干燥，需要多多喝水，多多补水，才能适应。
40,“蛮好的。。”,比前几年好多了。。虽然还是那么的多，路还是那么的堵，但是感觉不一样了，多了些人文底蕴，平民素质提高了不少。。真的蛮好的。。
40,“国际大都市的繁荣与发展中国家的窘境辉映一体的城市——北京”,北京作为中国的首都，是中国的政治文化中心，它是进步和腾飞着的中国的一个缩影，处处体现着中国的繁荣与发达、和谐和昌盛。古老的城墙、典雅的皇城建筑和浓郁的京韵气息，繁华的购物街、发达的交通和挺拔的高楼，都向全中国乃至全世界的人们昭示着北京的幸福之意、中国的国泰民安。然而，北京身处发展着的中国，又作为一个现代城市，仍然免不了城市发展背后一系列问题的困扰，脱不去发展中国家面临的窘境留在她身上的痕迹。北京也是一个城市，和世界上其他的城市有着同样的问题：城市垃圾、道路堵塞、交通事故、大气污染……甚至所谓的“贫民窟”。北京没有你想象的那么完美，她不应该承受那么大的期许，尽管她是首都、她是古城、她是中国的一只眼睛，但她毕竟归根到底是一座城。北京也没有你想像的那么发达，他也有郊区和蚁族；北京更没有你想像的那么文明，她也有闯红灯和乱丢垃圾……总之，来过北京之后，特别是在这里住过一段时间之后，你就会了解，北京，就是一座繁荣与萧条并存的大城市，不要对她期望太高，更不要小看她，正如我在前面提到的，她是中国的一只眼睛，她需要你以一颗平静的心去看待她，去了解她；而当你真正了解了她之后，你才能更好的理解她、理解中国，因为从这只眼睛里，你能看到中国的心灵、中国人的心灵。
40,“太大了”,到底是天子脚下 故址、遗迹、自然风光、现代游乐场、商业、金融，不知多少天才能细细游完。分次去吧。只是交通太拥堵了。天气太热了。
40,“北京，还想再去。”,2008年夏初，单位组织我们去北京旅游了，坐动车去的，北京是我一直想去的地方啊。行程是两天一夜，去了天安门广场、故宫、长城、颐和园等著名景点，留下了深刻的印象，但时间太短了，真想再去一次啊。
40,“Citta in rapida crescita”,"La crescita di pechino lascia sempre stupiti. Visitando la citta a distanza di qualche anno si corre il rischio di non riconoscerla, lo sviluppo vertiginoso della citta pare quasi svilupparsi in modo incontrollato. Spesso i segni del passato vengono cancellati e nella costruzione del nuovo si rischia di perdere la coscienza delle radici della citta. da visitare prima che cambi definitivamente"
50,“真的好棒”,北京给我的第一眼感觉就是太棒了，真的没想到，第一次去我感觉就像到了一个天堂，好棒啊，新鲜的空气、高高的大楼、天安门、还有鼓楼、颐和园、长城等各个景点，真是太好了，尤其是哪的夜景太美了，使我流连忘返，还有那的酒店，宾馆，服务太周到了、太到位了。我相信北京会变得更好。
40,“北京节假日”,平时的北京很美，特别是北京的周边，密云那里，很好玩，风景很好，而北京最不尽人意的地方就是人很多，特别是节假日，是非常的多。总体来说很不错。
50,“工作在北京”,来北京快一年了，来工作，来之前听说外地人在北京生活压力很大，说实话，来真么长时间了，我并没有感到什么压力。我喜欢北京，既现代又古老，既稳重又有活力，喜欢去逛那些不知名的、有屈指可数的老建筑，也喜欢去798、西单、新世界、SOHO，体现时尚的北京。我爱北京
50,“长城”,去爬长城了，看到蜿蜒的长城，心情好激动！可所谓是不到长城肥好汉，看到了好汉碑！从北峰下来，就是熊乐园，好可爱的熊熊们
50,“北京”,首都的交通很方便 而且非常便宜 景点用学生证也相对便宜 学生证在北京还是很有用的 不像在其他城市 打折打的很少 不过不要国庆去 去长城的时候跟在上海世博排队有的一拼 最喜欢北京的后海 总体印象非常好 到底是首都！
50,"“逛不够, 人均综合素质较高”","我去的时候不是旅游旺季,可能融入性比较好,所以深刻体会了一把北京人的生活,第一次来北京可以选择一些经典的景点。比如故宫、天坛、颐和园、八达岭长城、十三陵、恭王府等，(这些莪都没去,所以说是来体验生活来了)除此可逛逛老北京文化的东西，比如后海的胡同、南锣鼓巷等,南锣鼓巷好玩的东西很多,人也总是很多(文宇的双皮奶是真不错)"
50,“北京”,不愧为首都啊 北京人很热情 物价有点高城市很卫生干净 就是公交车相似的太多了 但是交通既便利又便宜 社会服务相当好
50,“首都北京”,古色古香的城市 时尚与复古的结合 人文气息浓郁 当然 交通极其的拥堵 人才济济 很向往的城市 很具有中国特色的一个城市
40,“很不错”,到北京已经去了好几次了，总觉得这个政治经济中心让我玩不够，今年三月就又上北京感受一下北京的春天，我去的时候没有见到风沙，很不错。
50,“干净，卫生，文明”,北京是一个干净，卫生并且很文明的城市，在这种高节奏的城市里面生活，一定也不能忘了要欣赏欣赏路边的美景，品尝路边的美食。
50,“首都.向往之城”,小时候就梦想啊一定要去首都看看天安门，爬爬长城，这样说自己都觉得幼稚啦，呵呵 小时候跳绳时念得顺口溜“毛主席的像，挂在墙上，好好学习，天天向上”我去了北京第一件事就是看升国旗，气氛之热烈，所有在场的人不由的一起唱起了升旗歌。故宫.长城.颐和园.不虚此行！！！想听听我在颐和园的笑话吗，秘密啦！
50,“5月的北京，让你向往”,都说北京一到夏天就是“桑拿天气”，其实看你什么时间去了。7-9月，那你肯定是被“蒸”和“煮”的后果，我建议您5月去，初夏的味道，风和日丽，凉爽宜人。5.1小长假，去北京购物。在适合不过了！
40,“北京很精彩！”,记得很小的时候就去过北京，之后又先后去了多次，北京是个历史与现代结合的城市，市中心高楼林立、非常繁华，但也还有待开发的地区。我很喜欢老北京的小玩意，南锣鼓巷是个好去处，798也不错，年轻人的地盘，去那扮酷都没人觉得你奇怪，哈哈！总之，北京很精彩，值得一去！
10,“黑心导游”,我在北京金水桥那里报的团，去了长城和十三陵，景色不错。但果黑心导游为了为了准过外快不顾游客反对私自带大家去别的地方，还必须买东西，不买就不走（旅游社的车，那里打车很贵）大家就只好买导游推荐的东西
50,“北京”,很喜欢北京这座城市。交通方便，市民质朴友好。毕竟是历史名城，有着浓郁的历史文化气息。京城里有很多值得一去的地方，需要耐心的寻找和玩味。每次去都有新的发现和感受。
30,“还需做“大”城市”,北京作为国际大都市，在很多方面还需做“大”。比如：交通、环境、人文，还有对外来人员的态度、服务等等。个人认为不单是要城市大，更要气度大！
50,“北京”,建议去清华北大游一番，可以领略一下曲径通幽的意境。古老与现代交融的城市。胡同里冰糖葫芦的叫卖声和三轮洋车前的纸风车饱含了老北京十足的韵味。前门大大小小的茶馆让您不禁想起了老舍笔下满清后期瓜皮帽下那一条长辫子。北京是交通很便利的城市，四四方方的城市，交错着龙盘似的立交桥，使人们出行更加的便利，尽显大都市的辉鸿大气。
40,“我爱北京”,中国的首都，北京，这里有很多你想不到的东西，这里的科技一天一天在发达！！去过一次天安门，。觉得人很多！！很壮观，喜欢，很喜欢！
50,“听说，那是一场心灵洗礼的旅行。北京”,听说，在繁华的城市会被房贷的沉重包袱所累下。听说，在繁华的城市会“一切皆有可能”。听说，在繁华的城市每个人背后都有不尽人知的秘密。四月的某一天，我来到了期待已久的北京。情理之中，又意料之外。心里些许地兴奋，又些许地激动，还有那一探究竟的心思。人在北京，才发现在北京生活好辛苦。朝八晚六的日子，我会替北京的朋友捏上一把汗。当每日的交通高峰期来临，是井然有序地“塞车”，人挤人的地铁站。每个擦肩而过的人一脸的淡然，似乎已经习惯了这个城市的拥挤。记得那天，和老友Y约好在王府井见面。6点左右坐上的士，没过几分钟便遇上了拥堵塞车，师傅很热情地建议让我到附近的地铁站下后乘搭地铁，要不估计还得等上2个半小时。话音刚落，觉得那2个半小时是个让人伤不起的数字。心里焦虑已经来不及去平息，只想赶紧到达目的地。到附近的地铁站下后，我搭上了地铁。遇上了“疯狂”的高峰地铁人流。我被一层一层的人流挤压，度过每一站2分钟的车程，心里有些煎熬。虽然，地铁拥挤，可是秩序良好，让彼此度过每一站的人们有了些释怀。见到老友Y，自己累得精疲力尽。她逗我说，你是不是太脆弱了？虽然这句话问得很幽默。当时的我，是真笑不出来。体验北京的“拥堵”过后，开始想念自己土生土长、四季宜人的小岛。偌大的北京，因为“拥堵人多”，会很辛苦。从前一直期盼的城市，现在的我少了些憧憬少了些迷恋。其实，美丽的小岛真的很好很好，天气的适宜，便利的交通，美丽的大海，可口的美食，清新的空气.....想轻轻地说声，这是一场心灵洗礼的旅行。
40,“匆忙的首都”,还是最喜欢北京的古建筑，在北京的街上很少见到像我一样常常到处闲晃的人，有时候觉得她太匆忙了晚上的三里屯或者白天的798，都文艺得好遥远我宁愿去胡同逛逛，虽然总是迷路，还是愿意在那种生活气息浓厚的地方我一直固执地认为那才是北京
40,“北京印象”,充满文化，充满思想，包容但却拥挤的一个大都市。政治气息浓厚，商业气息也渐渐趋于上升，与上海是两个完全不一样的城市氛围，如果你喜欢竞争且有实力，你可以来试试，发挥你的才智，成就你的梦想！
50,“故宫”,故宫，中国古代的帝王每朝每代的住所，是中国最具代表性的一个古建筑，里面包括很多来自于中国著名的建筑，帝王的所有妃子，家人都住在里面
50,“北京四联北新桥店”,我昨天刚去完北新桥店，还是有名气的老店，价格也不贵，而且与发廊用的毛巾截然不同，太卫生了看着就舒服，在说理发的126号师傅给我理的，动作非常麻利，我大概一说要理什么样的马上就明白，不想发廊那么费劲，我很满意，态度也很好，说话还挺幽默。
50,“Sehr sehenswert”,"Die Hauptstadt Chinas hat enorm viel zu bieten, und man kann hier mindestens eine Woche verbringen. Die Kombination aus Museen, Parks, Tradition und Moderne ist wirklich gigantisch und das kulinarische Angebot sowie Shopping-Möglichkeiten sind im Überfluss vorhanden.Neben den Highlights in der Stadt, wie z.B: der Sommertempel und der Verbotene Stadt, gibts es noch zahlreiche Sehenswürdigkeiten im näheren Umland. Die bekannteste Sehenswürdigkeit ist dabei sicherlich die Große Mauer.In Peking selbst findet man für jedes Budget eine gute Unterkunft und passende Restaurants. Auch günstigere Hostels haben ein sehr hohes Niveau.Peking ist aufgrund der guten Anbindung an den Fernverkehr auch ein hervorragender Ausgangspunkt für weitere Reisen nach China. Mit sehr günstigen Nachtzügen, kann man den Rest des landes erkunden.Peking war für mich eines der Highlights meiner Asienreise, und ich werde mit Sicherheit wiederkommen."
40,“五一别去挤”,五一黄金周又来到来了。对于北京这个大家一直向往的城市来说五一黄金周已经提前引爆、城市已经开始变的很拥堵。大家来长城旅游最后是在五月3号以后。
40,“古城”,我去过一次北京，不错哦，马路好大，京味儿十足啊。印象最深的是故宫，想到许多电视里的情景，非常壮观，喜欢！遗憾的是没有去长城，哎~
50,“北京哇哈哈大酒店”,入住了四天，感觉很不错。环境很优雅，价格四百元还比较容易接受。有报纸还有矿泉水和水果赠送。另外还有冰箱，很人性化。。
40,“桔子酒店不错”,北京的几个桔子酒店都不错，都住过原来是在这边念书的，就一直住宿舍这两年来出差，一直选择桔子酒店，还是很不错的性价比也很高一直都推荐同事住。。。
40,“北京的人文”,北京有好多可玩的景点，比如故宫，天安门，长城，北京购物可以上西单，王府井，北京的糖葫芦也好吃，想吃各地的小吃也很方便
50,“祖国的核心”,北京环境非常好 我是07年去的 人有点多 坐地铁都挤不上去 愁死人了，我去了长城，那里面的玉器大家不要买 买了就后悔，尤其是说是你老乡的绝对不要信 他们都是骗子，而且大家去革命烈士纪念馆的时候要注意买票哦
40,“北京一角”,到了北京，随处问路买东西都要用普通话，北京人说话和四川完全不搭调。忍着别扭说着川普，感觉怪怪的。还好，在北京的那几天天气还不错，还买了串老北京的糖葫芦。
50,"“Pechino, la bimillenaria capitale cinese”","Per dimensioni e rinnovamento urbanistico-architettonico Pechino è la seconda città della Cina dopo Shanghai, mentre è la prima per testimonianze storiche e, ovviamente, per importanza amministrativa.Con 15 milioni di abitanti nell’area metropolitana e la sede governativa del Paese più popoloso del mondo la “Capitale del Nord” (questo il significato di Beijing) è una delle più grandi e celebri città del mondo.Il modo migliore per arrivare a Pechino dall’Italia è volare con Air China, principale vettore cinese, membro di Star Alliance e piuttosto efficiente e puntuale. Air China offre numerosi 6 voli alla settimana da Milano Malpensa via Shanghai e alcuni anche da Roma Fiumicino, a breve sarà inaugurata anche la tratta diretta Milano Malpensa – Pechino Capital Airport.Il Capital Airport di Pechino ha tre terminal che ben testimoniano il grande balzo in avanti del gigante asiatico: ai due datati e di medie dimensioni terminal 1 e 2 si affianca l’immenso, spettacolare Terminal 3 inaugurato per le Olimpiadi del 2008 che ha portato in soli due anni lo scalo cinese ad imporsi come terzo al mondo per traffico passeggeri, dopo Atlanta Harstfield e Londra Heathrow.Il terminal 3 da solo – dove approderete se volerete Air China – varrebbe la visita per gli appassionati di architettura ed ingegneria: è uno degli edifici più grandi del mondo e le sue immense strutture curvilinee ed allungate in vetro e acciaio e i colori rosso e oro ne fanno una vera, colossale meraviglia.Dall’aeroporto un comodo treno vi porta a Donghzimen, nel cuore di Pechino, in corrispondenza con due delle 9 linee di metropolitana (attenzione però che la numerazione non segue la realtà, alcuni numeri sono attualmente saltati si ché l’ultima linea è la 15) che, estesissima e molto efficiente anche se affollata, vi porterà ovunque molto più rapidamente ed economicamente che qualsiasi altro mezzo. Scordatevi di noleggiare un auto: il traffico è soffocante (uno dei più attuali problemi della megalopoli cinese è appunto l’inquinamento) e per strada si va più piano. Il taxi serve solo di notte fonda, quando la metro non funziona. Usarlo dall’aeroporto poi è puro masochismo: tempi di percorrenza e costi verranno quantomeno triplicati e starete pure più scomodi, rischiando di rimanere pigiati e completamente immobilizzati in auto in un ingorgo autostradale, mentre i treni sono comodi, moderni, puliti, spaziosi, climatizzati e provvisti di gabinetto.Della città sono note le meraviglie antiche: La Città Proibita, il Tempio del Cielo, il Palazzo d’Estate, Piazza Tienanmen ma forse vi sorprenderanno di più quelle moderne: il già citato terminal 3 dell’aeroporto, la stazione ferroviaria di Pechino Sud, i CCTV Headquarters, il World Trade Center, l’Opera House e l’ormai celebre “Bird’s Nest” Nido d’Uccello, ovvero lo Stadio Olimpico.Personalmente, nelle due categorie mi hanno sbalordito il Palazzo d’Estate e il terminal 3 dell’aeroporto. Di quest’ultimo ho già fatto cenno mentre, da Europeo abituato a residenze suburbane quali Versailles, Charlottenburg o Schönbrunn, sono rimasto letteralmente sbalordito dall’immensità del Palazzo d’Estate, che potrebbe contenerli tutti senza per questo essere meno aggraziato ed elegante. Il complesso è così grande che servono delle vere e proprie linee di navigazione per attraversarne il lago, il parco è vastissimo ed incantevole.Da Pechino è escursione d’obbligo la Grande Muraglia. Non accettate i pressanti inviti dei tassisti che si dichiarano “a vostra disposizione per un giorno”! Ci si arriva benissimo dalla stazione di Pechino Nord (Beijing-Be) con treni moderni, veloci, comodi, puliti e dalla segnaletica scritta/audio/video bilingue (cinese e inglese), località Ba-Da-Ling. Ci metterete meno, viaggerete più comodi, vi costerà meno, e soprattutto non sarete vincolati agli orari del tassista che, a vostra disposizione all’inizio, sarà molto più impaziente alla fine. Se appartenete al sesso forte, compiuta la visita non mancate di prendere in giro i vostri amici dello stesso sesso che mai sono stati a Pechino citando loro una delle più celebri massime di Mao Tse Tung, abbondantemente ricordata dal merchandising: “Chi non ha mai scalato la Grande Muraglia non è un vero uomo”."
30,“北京还行”,也就看看各大景点，没什么地方可玩的，而且地方太大，交通拥堵，时间都浪费在路上了，没有旅游的乐趣，只占了一个首都的好处
50,“北京的老胡同”,我爱北京，更喜欢北京的胡同。北京的老胡同散发着一股亲切的人文味道，体现一种深刻文化底蕴。外国朋友来中国，一定要坐着人力车到北京的胡同里来体验一下哟。
40,“北京”,很美很发达，生活购物都很方便。但是交通状况不佳，城市很大，很多景区都在郊区，很有可能一天只能去一个景区游玩，太远的地方不适合骑自行车，会有公交车直通景区，打车太贵，但是汽车会经常堵车，地铁目前已经比较发达了，市区出行建议坐地铁。
50,“我生活在北京 我爱北京”,北京是一座古城 历史很悠久 京味十足 北京人很热情 北京有很多小吃 我从小生活在这座城市 我爱这里的一切 我爱你 北京
30,“不上长城非好女呵呵！”,匆忙而偶然的北京之旅！！北京的冬天相对武汉的冷好象只是看起来更凛冽而已，迎着飘雪上长城的感觉，而今想想还是很难得的！！
40,“北京古城”,主要逛得中轴线，很大气，很漂亮，这才是古都，尤其是在景山公园的时候，可以俯瞰北京城，才体会到古都的魅力，从永定门，到钟鼓楼，很震撼
30,“城市区别”,去了北京，感觉北京和我所生活的城市-石家庄完全不一样，她是一个古老的城市，历史悠久；又是一个现代化的城市，生活节奏快，按照我的生活方式，我感觉自己不适合北京，我只是她的一个过客，匆匆而去，匆匆而归，北京不是我的归宿，我终将回到属于自己的城市。
40,“北京我来了”,初到北京被北京的天气吓到了，很干燥，我是南方人很不习惯那的天气，不过和女朋友在北京度过一个星期后觉得北京并不是那么可怕的，消费水平也不高，就是楼价贵了点，希望政府的措施能让房价低点
40,“除了空气差点，气候干燥，别的挺好。”,除了空气差点，气候干燥，别的挺好。这几天正是柳絮乱飞的时节，影响生活。去餐馆吃饭，要担心它飞到吃的里面。从外地来北京可能会得上过敏性鼻炎。哈哈，移植的花卉品种太多了。
40,“北京的夜”,北京是我国的首都，刚去的时候还很小，后来去的时候就有了印象，天安门，故宫，颐和园，长城都是我国有名的旅游景点，出了这些还有就是购物，可是北京的夜也很漂亮，霓虹灯闪烁，在王府井散步的时候，有古朴也有现代。有安静也有热闹。很繁华的城市。
40,“北京真不错、”,北京还是挺好玩儿的，就是气候很干燥，食物有点单一（指的是特色小吃少）故宫很雄伟，有种震撼的感觉，爬长城累晕了，但还是挺有趣的
50,“不到长城非好汉，北大清华也要观”,不到长城非好汉，北大清华也要观。最好不要到假期去玩，人太多，没意思，看的都是人，要错开黄金期，北京参观的还是挺多的，对学生更适合，
40,“国际化大都市”,我最爱的城市之一，国际化大都市，美食旅游景点应有尽有。北京人说的是最标准的普通话，不用担心语言问题。北京的司机是最热情的，与他们交流可以更加了解北京。
30,“不要相信街头的北京一日游，防止被骗！”,尤其是公交车票上，经常贴着有北京一日游的广告，基本都是有陷阱。上当过，而且电视也报道过，大家可以搜搜视频，贵州卫视在4月初还做过专门的报道。去长城玩的话，自己去完全可以，买个去八达岭的动车，从北京北站出发，很方便的，自己行动也自由。
50,“一个充满吸引力的地方”,北京是一个高消费高素质的城市，每天都有无数忙碌与拥挤的人们，看到后总是给人以一种斗志。北京这个巨大的城市总是会让你找到你喜欢它欣赏它的地方。
30,“北京”,北京是一座现代化大都市，有着无穷的魅力，吸引着无数人的眼光，北京是中国的首都，政治中心，文化中心。是一个旅游的地方，是一个度假的地方！
40,“北京，首都”,去北京是个意外，却是我一直的梦想。一直梦想去这个歌谣中的地方，首都北京天安门，冉冉升起的国旗，王府井大街，北京大学都对我充满吸引力。喜欢北京，喜欢她北方式的宽广大气，喜欢她的繁华。
50,“Great Wall und Verbotene Stadt - ein Must do”,Großartige Stadt und großartige Kultur. Die verbotene Stadt ist beeindruckend aber die chinesische Mauer ist einfach nur überwältigend. Speziell wenn man sie bis nach oben geklettert ist ! Es war zwar bei minus 15 Grad etwas kalt im Januar aber trotzdem eine Reise wert. Die chinesische Kultur und die Freundlichkeit der Menschen ist einfach überwältigend.
50,“北京之旅”,北京是祖国的心脏，自建国以来北京城内建有各处景点，故宫 天安门 天坛等 让人流连往返 去北京的朋友 别忘记去鸟巢 水立方 那里景色也十分壮观哦
40,“北京”,北京是一个古代与现代建筑相结合的地方，让我们充分的的体验和感受古代帝王居住生活的地方，也是一个充满后现代宏伟建筑的集合点。
40,“Beeindruckend”,"Eine interessante Stadt. Durchaus sehenswert. Langweilig wird einem sicher nicht, Man kann viel unternehmen, sich eine Menge anschauen. Ein Ausflug zur Chinesischen Mauer ist ein absolutes MUSS. Einfach ein Taxi für ein paar Stunden mieten (sehr günstig in Peking) und direkt zur Mauer fahren. ca 90 min Fahrt pro Strecke, Der Fahrer wartet bis sie wieder zurück sind und bringt sie sicher wieder zurück in die Stadt. Dort angkommen geht sich noch eine kleine Shoppingtour am Nachmittag aus, zB auf dem Perlmarket oder am Silkmarket, wo man nach beinharter Verhandlung auch wirklich gute und vorallem spottbillige Dinge kaufen kann. Essen kann man sowohl einheimisches als auch internationale Küche, die meist aber auch zu europäischen Preisen angeboten wird."
40,“皇城根儿”,北京市一座特别霸气的城市，它不仅是新中国的首都，也是明朝，清朝的行政中心。北京有太多值得一去的景点，首当其冲的是故宫。花上一整天，也就是看了个大概，三大殿很气派，正大光明牌匾很招游客们喜爱，个个争相拍照。在故宫内的石壁雕刻得尤其出色，龙凤都是栩栩如生的。其次，要去一下八达岭长城，坐索道上去，爬一爬好汉坡，看一看这雄伟的建筑，人们常说：长城是中华民族的脊梁。第三要去尝一下，北京烤鸭-全聚德。鲜，香，脆给我留下了深刻的印象，百年的老牌子果然非同凡响。第四要去看看天坛，这是当年皇帝祭祀的地方。第五可以去恭王府，由于时间的关系，这次没有去成，有点可惜。第六是后海那里的白色喇嘛塔。第七是北京奥运会的主场馆——鸟巢，以及旁边的水立方。第八是去颐和园看看，在昆明湖上泛个舟。最后我们尝了东来顺的火锅。最后一站是首都机场，现代，摩登，运行顺畅。
30,“北京是一个张扬的城市”,北京很大，但是并不干净。北京人的视野很狭窄，但是他们却浑然不觉。北京很有韵味，但是也有点固步自封。北京很现代化，但是却处处体现着秩序的不井然。北京是一个很有意思的城市，但是也会让人很快就厌倦。古老的文化已经不那么韵味飘扬，北京让人又爱又恨。
50,“喜欢这个古老有深蕴的城市”,和上海比起来，北京显得更加沉稳，匆忙的城市中有那么一些让人感到舒适的地方。我去的时候正值奥运会，看过了鸟巢水立方之后，转了什刹海和胡同，那种感觉很亲切，虽然也多了些商业气息，但是在一个城市里能保有这些慢节奏的舒服的生活，很赞
50,“以为不会留恋”,初次去北京是在09年4月，当飞机到达北京时，看到外面光秃秃的树木，悠然的升起一股寒意；干燥的天气，让整张脸都开始出现白皮，永远不知道喝多少水才够多；走在天安门广场，不自主的会哼起“我爱祖国天安门，天安门上太阳升~~~”走到老胡同里面，吃着老北京小吃，听着字正腔圆的北京话，以后就这样很美，当时间久了以后，开始讨厌寒冷的天气，讨厌永远干燥的天气，开始不顾一切的选择离开，当真正离开以后，跟朋友聊天，说的最多的全是北京的好，连天气干燥，都是那么的好，朋友告诉我，回忆个串串的时候，我才发现北京我还有很多地方没有出过，心里还在渴望过去，还是在留恋在哪里的时光，如果有机会，一定要去，一定要再回去，一定要好好珍惜在哪里的一分一秒。
40,“万里长城”,走上万里长城，有一种舒适感，壤望大地，呼吸新鲜空气，回想着祖国的历史回忆，只要登上万里长城，必定有种念史的感觉，大家也去瞪吧！
40,“北京”,"北京有着古老的遗迹和不朽的的历史,让人神往的天安门,古博的故宫与天坛,绿树群山的映衬下雄伟壮观八达岭长城,皇家园林的颐和园,时尚的也有最有名商业街王府井,鸟巢，水立方，国家体育馆.....集古今文汇于一方,有句话说:不到长城非好汉,来过北京你会想说:不到北京非(中)国人."
50,“五彩斑斓的城市”,北京我经常去，每次到北京都要去天安门广场看看升旗，上周去北京博物馆已经快开业了。 下次一定要去看看。 前门那边的交通、宾馆、购物都很方便。 希望也没有去的人赶紧去看看天安门，升旗！
50,“美丽的北京”,老北京真好的啊，地方美丽.让我们一起看看老北京的文化。希望北京的文化永久长存。最喜欢哪里的简陋了，还有很多很多的地方。故宫也是我的最爱之一哦
40,“首都文化底蕴十足”,走进北京，就感觉到十足的文化底蕴，气势磅礴的万里长城，威武的故宫，富有神秘感的中南海，优美的北海公园，我都被一一吸引。
40,“人多楼多什么都多”,喜欢这个城市的气息，却不喜欢它的紧密；喜欢这个城市的繁华，却不喜欢它的虚伪；喜欢这个城市的文明，却不喜欢它给人的压抑。。。。。。
10,“服务态度”,本以为作为中国的首都应该有大都市的风范，结果大为失望。建筑是大都市风范，可是服务态度不敢恭维，可以说是我到过的城市里最差的一个，真应了那句话，别的地方的服务员是为顾客服务，而北京的服务员只是在工作。
50,“有点震撼”,一个人溜达着逛得北京城，感觉挺好，不过如果现在再让我自己一人去的话估计会很孤单！！不同的时间同一地点会有不同的心情！！
50,“北京-现代与传统的碰撞”,北京作为中国的首都 决定可以称之为国际大都市 高楼大厦 国际品牌 及现代建筑加上世界各地的美食 在北京都可以找到 无论是俄式 泰式 越南菜 台湾菜 日本料理 韩国拌饭 西式餐厅 几乎在任何一家商场都能找到你想要的而北京又到处可见全国各地的美食小吃 湘菜 云南火锅 东北菜 新疆菜 各种各种推荐地鼓楼大街王府井小吃街
40,“挺好的”,很美很发达，生活购物都很方便。但是交通状况不佳，城市很大，很多景区都在郊区，很有可能一天只能去一个景区游玩，太远的地方不适合骑自行车，会有公交车直通景区，打车太贵，但是汽车会经常堵车，地铁目前已经比较发达了，市区出行建议坐地铁。
40,“北京美食”,没去过北京的童鞋，如果想带点特产回家，有几个推荐的：1.糖葫芦，各种口味，各种水果，各种干果----大爱山楂和草莓（很强大很便宜）2.稻香村的糕点，每次去都会带一盒回去3.喜欢吃肉的童鞋可以试试烤鸭-----但是仅限不太远的能飞回去的童鞋，这东西凉了很难吃，而且即使再热也没有那么好吃了。全聚德就算了，又贵又难吃，鸭王不错
50,“首都，没的说！”,喜欢这里的故事，尤其是那充满神秘的古代建筑！还有那都市的快节奏，那您无时无刻不留恋这个地方，所以我喜欢这个地方！
50,“good”,在北京上了四年大学，去过很多好玩的地方，吃过很多好吃的小吃，很喜欢这里。城市也非常漂亮。环境也很好、很喜欢这个地方
40,“京空宾馆性价比很高”,我们是去年暑假去的，这家是部队办的宾馆，管理很得好，位置很方便。早餐也不错，价格也便宜而且含双早。140/天标间，很好的哦。
50,“亲爱的北京”,第一次去北京的时候 第一感觉就是觉得北京是座很现代化的城市 在几天的旅行当中然我深入了解了这座城市~~~真的让我觉得很安详 很平静的感觉 人们让你也很热情~~总之我爱上了它
50,“感动”,因为偶然的机会，去到北京，是个寒冷的冬天，到北京后直冲天安门，在寒风中等候了半个多小时，终于迎来了降旗仪式，当国歌奏响的那一刻，眼眶却湿了，心里涌现无限的感动。。。
30,“首都”,可以说对这个城市一般，我更喜欢人少的城市，那样更舒服，贴近自然，人太多，车多，旅游景点人更多，但是文化底蕴很浓厚，人都很好，也有自己的风土人情
50,“美丽的首都”,北京市世界上最美丽的首都，他有着中华民族气魂，象征着中华民族再世界中的地位，是不可博取的，没过白宫在中国也不过就是一个旅店而已
50,“北京游的特点”,去年国庆和朋友一起去了北京，与其他地方相比，北京的车票特别便宜，我们坐1号地铁转2号再转4号再转3号才2元，超便宜啊！北京的小吃也有很多，还特地感到全聚德吃烤鸭，排了一个小时的时间。遗憾的是因为人多，国庆那天没有看到升旗仪式.....
30,“感觉不好，脏”,"去故宫的那天，太阳火辣辣的，在门口排队的时候，一边一堆的垃圾，脏死了！其中一天跟的是北京的一日游，到下午4，,5点的时候到了十三陵，特别没意思，就记得那个导游就一直在教我们怎么样跨门槛~"
50,“古典与现代的完美结合”,北京 大气而不失温婉 古典而不失现代 走在繁华的大街忽然会出现一处亭台楼阁 穿梭与古今之间 真的很美 北京人也很善良
50,“北京很给力”,北京值得来。。。北京很给力 北京作为中国的文化古都 具有深厚的文化气息 尤其是胡同文化。。。例如南锣鼓巷 现在就是中国年轻人 乃至外国友人向往的地方
40,“文明古都”,这是一个历史悠久的城市，有着众多的历史古迹，又不失现代都市的繁华，是一个有故事的地方，值得走一走，看一看。北京欢迎您！
50,“首都印象”,北京是中国的首都，去过很多次，南锣鼓巷影响深刻，各种特色小吃，让人记忆深刻，每次去都有不同的收获，北京中国的形象。
20,“北京人”,北京人都好骄傲，自自以为自己是首都人，对别的城市的人很不礼貌，特别欺负外地人，我在北京去玩的那几天，我没有一天高兴，北京城市非常干净，但北京人太坏。
40,“威严”,北京充满着王者的霸气！虽然时过境迁！沧桑的历史遗留下的气息处处可见！老胡同，四合院，八旗子弟，等等不一而足！北京也渐渐的融入了现代化的气息！像鸟巢等等现代化的建筑也随处可见！
50,“我喜欢的城市”,有什么比一个国家的首都更吸引人的么？更何况还是古老文明古国的首都，有着悠久灿烂的历史故宫颐和园这些美丽的带有百年历史的建筑分散在这个喧哗的城市古老与现代的完美结合我还没玩儿够呢准备明年夏天再去一次逛遍那些古老的巷子
50,“北京，我们的首都。”,从大学期间开始，就不停的抽时间去首都北京游玩。虽然时间已经不短，但还是没有把北京转过来。就简单地讲几个旅游胜地吧。我们去的最多的是北京欢乐谷，那时年轻人的最爱。既充满刺激，又不失浪漫，确实是一个情侣约会、朋友聚会、联络感情的好去处。其次就是北京奥运会刚刚结束时的鸟巢、水立方。当时鸟巢水立方都没有改建，还是比赛是的场景，到那旅游，仿佛置身于奥运盛会中。虽然现在已经改建，可是游览的价值不是降低，而是在原来的基础上有所升高。最后，希望大家能够多去北京走走，看看首都的风土人情。
40,“拥挤的皇城”,北京是一座既古典又现代的城市 有很多特色小吃和迷人的胡同 四合院 但是人的确很多 交通非常 推进三里屯和后海的小吃
40,“虽然拥挤，但很有序”,北京的交通虽然拥挤，但是乱变车道的车比较少，看起来挺有秩序的。但是想想住在五环以外在二环上班的人，每天上下班也够辛苦的了。
50,“放假去人太多~”,国庆时好不容易去个北京 结果被堵个半死，堵车~堵人 连上长城都因为人太多 挤不上好汉坡，故宫里挤不到位置拍照，景山都进不了门了~~~
40,“恭王府”,恭王府 。和珅的家 。让我印象深刻。尤其是在假山里藏着 刻在石头上的一个字。是福字 也像寿字。还有藏着不同金银珠宝的窗户。
30,“人多，车多。”,一片盛世繁华的景象，个中滋味，只有局中人知道。希望能早日改善。周边的景色还是很值得看的，高山流水，世外桃源。十渡就有。来吧
40,“皇城脚下的现代都市”,北京，这座古老而又现代的城市，留给我最深的印象是它的包容性。在这里，你既能看到传统的风俗，又能体验到现代生活的精致与奢华。
40,“首都 北京”,去过两次北京，比较幸运，都赶上了好天气，晴空万里。总体感觉北京人素质比较高，政治和文化气息比较弄，城市道路比较干净，毕竟是首都呢。唯一一点就是堵车受不了。
50,“北京 中国首都～～～”,不是一个土生土长的本地人，在国内待过的地方也很多，北京说实话，还不错，08年奥运以后环境提高不少，但是，车越来越多，人越来越多，让我住着不是很舒服，希望慢慢改进吧，加油～！
50,“古都”,北京是一个有着悠久历史的城市，然而时代的发展给她注入了新的元素，王府井的繁荣，长城的悠久，碰撞在一起，展示着一种活力。
30,“北京文化”,一个文化层次很高的城市，很适合去了解历史。很有意思 尤其是喜欢故宫，还有颐和园超级漂亮的说喜欢买衣服的MM可以去西单逛逛 很不错的
50,“中国的首都，一篇和谐景象”,不愧是中国的首都哦，具有典型的北方特色，一年四季分明，每个季节都有可以游玩的地方，商业也比较发达，各种品牌的东西都有卖，小商品可以去天意，批发衣服可以去动物园，数码产品可以去中关村，旅游可以去故宫长城
30,“祖国的首都！”,北京作为中国的政治和文化中心，文化活动是相当丰富的，大型表演、歌剧、各种活动应有尽有。不过北京的交通真的是不太方便，车辆拥挤，地铁上人又多，会破坏你美好的心情！
40,“北京印象”,北京的皇家气势还是非常令人惊叹。便宜的公共交通系统也是其他城市没法比的。遗憾点的大概就是北京的空气和绿化了，三月的北京看不到多少的绿意。
50,“地大物博”,对北京的印象总体来说是非常好的。景点、住宿。除了旅游餐不敢恭维。吃的就别提有多抠搜了。吃饭的碗跟茶杯一边大，菜盘子是正常大小，可是菜只有一盘底。
40,“北京，一个很大气的城市。”,北京，一个很大气的城市。北京这座东方历史文化艺术的璀灿宝库，不仅住在北京的一千万市民关心她、热爱她，中国的十亿各族人民关心她、向往她，世界各国的朋友也关注她、热爱她。每年有数以千万计的同胞和朋友，从四域八方，宾至北京，以饱览她那瑰丽的雄姿，巍峨的宫殿，优美的园林，奇魅的艺术。
50,“一个定居北京的外地人有感而发”,作为一个外地人来十年前来到北京，随之被这座城市深深地吸引，虽然中间也有到过其他城市，但感觉均不可同日而语，为此本人最终选择在此定居。北京给人的感觉很大气，无时不在凸显着一个政治文化中心的地位，街道横平竖直，对于我这个路盲来说道路却也出奇的好认，天气虽然没有南方湿润而且还会有沙尘暴，但是这些都不会让我对这座产生的归属感降分多少！北京的四合院和老城墙有着历史的见证，长城和故宫更加说明了这片土地曾经的辉煌，我爱北京！
50,“我愛你，北京”,北京是我最愛的城市，她有最現代的建築，最有最發達的經濟。在北京，你可以看到最精彩的演唱會、音樂會，你可以吃到全國各地的美食。我愛她的一切，並且為了我的理想我一直在努力奮鬥！儘管她交通擁堵，房價居高不下，但是她是我們的首都，我們有理由一直擁護她，愛護她！
50,“国都”,北京的人情风味很浓郁，蛮喜欢北京爷们的 有机会希望再游玩一回 哈哈 价格北京人也好 啊 北京爷们真男人，北京烤鸭超赞
30,“爱恨纠缠”,北京，中国的政治、经济、文化中心，祖国的心脏。一直吸引着无数外地朋友来这块宝地拼搏，哪怕是放弃本地的荣耀也愿意来此地打造另一片天空。在这里生活快2年了，爱？恨？唉。。。皆有啊，新的征程，开始起航吧
40,“很喜欢”,很喜欢想去好多地方，但只要不开会就好啦哈哈，去K歌，去逛街，去动物园哈哈，还有大前门，还有很多地方哦，住的也很好哈哈
50,“古建筑”,在北京这样的一座古城，带上一份地图去穿越大街小巷，寻访帝都遗韵、市井民风，感受建筑艺术的魅力、体味历史变迁的沧桑，这实在是旅行者或闲暇者的一大乐事，又是建筑、规划、历史、艺术等专业从业人员和学生的重要功课。《北京古建筑地图》编写的初衷，就是为了帮助那些穿行在城市历史时空中的人们，那些和我们一样热爱北京，热爱中国古代建筑文化的人们
10,“现在的北京真的很糟”,"小时候,我一直住在北京,我不知道现在的北京人对老北京是否还有印象,但是我的印象中,老北京城啊,一直是天堂样的地方,美,干净,每个人京城人都会很自觉的爱护北京环境,没有人会随地吐,随便扔,不像现在,尽管各方面开发的都很好,却失去了曾经的纯朴与无瑕"
50,“喜欢北京”,北京是个很美的城市，拥有古老的皇城，伟大的长城，美丽的故宫，更有美味的小吃，当然更有文明的老胡同，老到这里你不会后悔
50,“北京旅游”,去年我和我的家人共9人去北京旅游，金秋十月的北京，晴空万里，秋高气爽，24°的气温让人感到舒服，北京是世界历史文化名城，有悠久的历史与灿烂的文化给北京留下了大量的文物古迹，让人回味无穷。
40,“Moderne Stadt mit altem Kulturgut”,"Peking ist laut, dreckig und modern, aber überraschend, wenn man dann plötzlich in den alten Sehenswürdigkeiten voller Kultur steht. Das chinesische Essen ist gut, aber es gibt viele fuer uns Europäer merkwürdige Dinge. Wenn man Huhn bestellt, muss man davon ausgehen, dass der Kopf mitserviert wird, auch bei Pekingente, U´Bahn fahren ist gut, es ist alles auf englisch ausgeschíldert, die Züge fahren sehr oft und die Stationen werden im Zug angezeigt und auf englisch durchgesagt. Der Verkehr ist sehr chaotisch, daher empfiehlt sich die Ubahn."
30,“一辈子应该去一次，却又没那么美好的城市”,"北京，并没有想像中的那么漂亮。 而且人一直都很多。因为年年去的原因，所以，再去北京时，一些古迹景点已经不吸引我了。如故宫这种景点，实物完全没有电视上好看。比如一些宫殿的柱子。电视上看是鲜红鲜红的，实际上的实物却是已经黑棕色，而且斑驳掉漆的。再比如长城，人非常非常的多。而且一般跟旅行团的话，在长城停留的都有固定的时间要求，如停留两个半小时，因为这种时间上的要求，还没走几步，就得马上掉头回去，省得给旅行团添麻烦，毕竟不能因为自己一个人让大家等吧。不过每次去北京，都要去看一次升旗，不为别的，每当看到升旗时，人会不由自主的内心激动。。。不好表达，大家应该去感受一次。吃的东西非常贵，KFC 什么的，到北京算是比较便宜的。上次去北京烤鸭店，三个人，也没吃什么，就进去小一千。要命！住的也不便宜。最好别赶上旅游最旺的时候去。而且可以提前 预订。 北京往天通苑那边有很多温泉度假，建议大家提前预订一下。便宜很合理，大概双人间，一夜168,还可以免费泡温泉。"
40,“古典与现代的结合 首都北京”,来北京已经不是一两次了，名胜古迹数不胜数，像故宫、长城、圆明园等等，同样北京也是现代的，商业繁华，各大世界大牌在这里汇集，中国首都北京怎能不来一趟呢···
40,“City”,北京给我的第一印象就是特别繁华。特别漂亮。北京好玩的地方也很多。我们去了故宫。里面很大，各种各样的古玩玉器，看得我们眼花缭乱，中国古代的皇家园林真是宏伟。
50,“长城”,我认为作为中国人，一生有几个地方一定要去的，其中第一选是北京，特别是长城，只有你站在长城的上面，才会知道什么叫雄伟、什么叫壮观、、、
50,“首都”,中国的首都，心脏，从小就渴望的地方，北京我很喜欢，就是太堵车了。好多景点没有逛完就要回家工作真不甘心，以后有机会还要去玩！
30,“北京，您正在失去过去……”,北京，来过很多次了，发展得很快，但是发展得太高了，太错落了。说他错落实际并不是褒奖，北京的楼太乱了，美感很少。北京的古城墙，古故宫，古颐和园……正在失去古意，变得金光闪闪，变得现代感十足。10年前，当我走进颐和园，一只松鼠蹲在树上好奇的看着我，我好欣喜，5年前。当我走进故宫，每一个宏伟的宫殿里面黑漆漆的，窗子里摆着假的不能再假的文物，外国人都惊叹---中国的国宝不过如此而已。1年前，当我爬上长城，到处都是兜售便宜衬衫的商人，到处充斥着叫卖声，我只能叹气。北京，你还是从前的王土吗？你还会回来吗？
50,“环境”,环境相当干净。没有不舒适的地方。而且北京人也相当热情好客。有素质。这是我第一次在一个城市坐公交车可以看见那么多为老人小孩让座的。很温馨。
50,“北京旅游”,北京旅游业的服务态度真的够可以的，态度不是很好的，有的地方还可以，不是都不好，只是个别的地方。宾馆的服务态度很好。
50,“如果来北京”,如果有朋友来北京，带他去哪里。才能看清楚北京，这个问题时常，挂在嘴边，也时常困扰着我。如此如此，北京已经地覆天翻。新北京、老北京，连我们这种生长于斯的孩子，也看不清北京。当旅游路过想要略窥一下北京的风情，能看的也无外乎故宫长城北海，南锣后海鼓楼。但怎样才能玩儿出京味儿呢？
50,“我爱北京”,也想北漂，也想在北京崇文内购买房产，大小倒不论，有就可。能够顺利融入其中，那将是一件很快乐的事。在北京，你能做很多想做的事，前提：要么很有钱，要么很有本事。
40,“Storia e cultura millenaria oltre il muro”,"esperienza molto interessante sotto molti aspetti. le persone sono gioviali per la maggior parte, i siti storici e culturali sono curati con molta attenzione. i trasporti lasciano un poco a desiderare, così come le idicazioni sul cibo in tutti i ristoranti.la lingua inglese è ancora molto poco diffusa."
30,“北京人太坏”,去北京参加比赛，打车挨北京人宰... 给我绕道儿 刚开始我没说什么 我说只要能赶上飞机就行 他说没问题 可是.....害得我都没赶上飞机
50,“这个城市”,繁华，古老，各种小想法在我的心中翻腾。王府，长安街，故宫，天坛，景山公园，陶然亭，地铁，动物园。。。很多，还有鸟巢，水立方。夜晚的北京，灯光弥霓，我喜欢在这样灯光下散步，一个人，静静地走。
50,“古都底蕴浓厚”,北京好多地方我都去过了，他作为中国的首都，文化底蕴浓厚，现代化气息强烈，五星级旅游景点是世界上数一数二的城市，很值的一来
40,“中国的首都”,从小都想去北京玩，看到同学们有的从北京回来带回的照片，喜悦之情露于言表。后来我和家人去了北京，游过了所有的景点，吃到了各色小吃，北京古城真是千年的文化城
50,“北京不错”,我很喜欢北京是因为北京有这很多古老的东西 故宫 颐和园 长城 都是很不错的 人很多 但是都很热情 我很喜欢去北京动物园因为那里的衣服很不错
30,“真的不一样”,去一趟北京真是让我感受不一样，和我们这差不了多少。不过街道还很宽，也见到了天安门，很雄伟，很壮观。故宫很大，总的来说还算可以吧
40,“我们的祖国心脏”,开动车以来，上北京也确实方便许多，体验自助售票机，便捷开心，寻找宜家，感受现代家居，渴望那个梦想中的家 渴望那份现代 简单的家居环境
30,“很好”,北京很好！只是消费很高！旅游景点很多！但是没有不要钱的地方！嘿嘿~什么时候政府能不收费进北京的各各旅游点！哈哈哈哈哈
40,“国家首都”,北京是个美丽城市，是个国际化的大都市。有这悠久的文化底蕴，我希望是中国人的都要去感受以下，去过得人是不会后悔的。
50,“长城-水关”,绝对不能听信住的旅店和小型宾馆，他们所推荐的导游及服务都是骗人的。我就上当了。说是去长城的车。犹豫了最后 决定信他一回。下车我找缆车没找到，我就认为上当了。结果后来才知道，我们去的不是八达岭长城，是水关。累了半天原来是个假的。又花了50元打车到了八达岭。
50,“北京长城”,大家常去的是八达岭长城，但是北京著名的还有慕田峪长城和居庸关长城。慕田峪就是鲜花盛开，居庸关就是雄伟壮观，八达岭就是人山人海。去长城就要坐专门的旅游专线了，虽然有点远了，但还是很值得的!
50,“香山”,中秋节全家总动员去香山，风景很美，一家人，开开心心去登山，香山景区有植物花草，还有亭子，还有好多卖纪念品的，坐着缆车也不错
40,“北京”,很规范的城市，方方正正，规划不错！除了堵车，什么都好！最爱去的还是天安门，有种归属感和荣誉感。再者就是北四环，学院和科技气息！
10,“不喜欢这里”,北京去过2次，住了2年，很不喜欢这里，北京人眼睛都在头顶，傲气的很，真不知道傲气什么，做汽车刷卡非常的便宜，我记得那个时候只要0.4，哎
40,“Eine sehenswerte Großstadt”,"Es ist zwar schon eine Weile her, dass ich in Peking war, dennoch sind die Erinnerungen durchwegs positiv. Unbedingt sehenswert sind der Platz des himmlischen Friedens und dieverbotene Stadt. Etwas außerhalb der Stadt kann man bei Badaling die chinesische Mauer besteigen. Ich empfehle aber jedem, der nicht in Besitz chinesischer Sprachkenntnische ist, sich einer Reisegruppe anzuschließen. Ansonsten kann es schwierig werden, sich zurechtzufinden."
50,“大北京”,2003年的时候去了次北京，给我的第一感觉是北京好干净哦，去了长城更感觉非常的壮观，故宫也非常的精致漂亮，北京振的是蛮值得去的一个地方，有机会还要再去次！
50,“好地方！”,北京我已经来了很多次，非常美的一个城市！每次比赛我都会在这里转火车，在这里休闲娱乐是非常好的一个去处，非常好！
30,“物价昂贵，交通方便”,来北京很久了，现在感觉北京的压力越来越大，这个首都远远没有外表看着那么光鲜。高昂的房价和物价，让生活在这个城市的人们压力倍增。总之，这是中国特色！
30,“北京的天空”,北京，应该是个空气清馨的城市。但是，作为文明古城、政治中心、商业中心的大都市，由于人口众多，车辆众多，使得北京的天空严重受染。蓝天，只能看到灰蓝色的天空，遇到天气不是很好的时候，就是灰黄色的了。深深的为我们生活在北京天空下的人们难过。想念并向往着曾经去过的西藏、海南、罗汩湖那湛蓝湛蓝的天空。
50,“城市的整体素质很高”,北京给人的第一印象是城市很干净，出行安全，人员素质高，还有就是景点很多，但是景点很挤这样也带来了消费旅游业的繁荣，同时住宿偏贵。
30,“移動は大変楽でした”,地下鉄、バスによる交通網が発達しています。乗り換えは伴いますが、ほとんどの名称（当然、万里の長城など郊外は別）には、公共交通機関で移動できます。ただし、市民の生活を見たかったのでスーパーに行くときはタクシーを利用しました。地図を見せて、場所を説明したのですが、通じたのか最後まで不安でした。一方通行制限が多く、いきない逆行したときはあせりました。
40,“值得多次游玩”,北京太大，太多的人文都值得一玩：故宫、天坛、长城、香山、天安门城楼、毛主席纪念堂、軍事博物馆、景山、北海、后海、王府大街、新东安市场、地坛、鸟巢、水立方、胡同等，一年四季都不同的韵味，细细品味~~~`
50,“喜欢”,北京的生活节奏很快，喜欢这样的生活！北京旅游的地方很多，风景很好，适合各种年龄的人群居住，特别的喜欢北京的生活！
50,“故宫”,很气派，很有王者风范，也很有中国古代文化艺术传统的象征，象征了古代封建制度的王权至上，也留下了源远流长的中国古代历史。
50,“上东国际酒店”,上东国际酒店位于北京市朝阳区石佛营路口东南，给人的感觉服务好，住宿环境很好，服务员服务相当好，就餐环境也好，总之，目前没有发现问题，好评！1
40,“五彩缤纷的城市”,"在这个城市,你不敢怠慢,享受着城市的快节奏,感觉生活很充实,很快乐~!如果你也是个敢闯,勇于拼搏的人,那也快来加入我们吧!!!"
40,“北京交通不太好”,1.交通比较堵：在北京几天，交通到处堵车，特别是去前门附近，从圆明园打车到前门要2个多小时，太过分了。2.空气比以前好多了：10多年前来过一次北京，感觉北京的空气比以前好多了。
40,“一个不错的古城”,所有的旅游景点都不错。恭王府就和电视里面是一样的。很古色古香。遗憾得是没有去长城看一下子。要到北京去玩。想玩好，最好充足得时间。听去过长城的人说过那里看日出非常爽得一件事情。不过就是爬起来很累。
40,“北京环境”,说实在的北京车多，人多的，但是治安很好，就是风沙挺大的。我最难忘的是那边的公共厕所都是不收费的，而且里面很整洁，很干净卫生。
50,“首都就是首都”,大气磅礴，悠久的历史文化~站在天安门下就感觉到一种庄重威严！尤其2008年奥运会的开办，鸟巢、水立方等等像外面证明了中国的实力~~身为中国人而自豪！
40,“具有传统特色的北京”,北京的地铁和交通非常方便、快捷，价钱便宜，旅游景点很多，既有故宫、天坛、颐和园等带有历史传统意义的景点，又有天文馆、军事博物馆等激发儿童学习兴趣的旅游点，适合于不同年龄、不同文化层次的人到北京游玩。
50,“北京人的生活”,我第一次到北京的时候，北京人的生活让我感到很是惊讶，他们的生活节奏快的让人可怕，在济南的时候还没有感觉到这样的生活。
50,“美”,说城市美化的美还不如上海，但是美食一种感受，记得小时候5岁去北京，去了北京当然是要去天安门的，我们一家去看毛主席遗体，，因为是夏天，到了12点就关馆，因为游客会带进更多的热气，，影响室内的温度，我应该不是最后一个，但是我前面的那个人把最后一个位置让给我了，他说他星期坚持来看主席，估计他应该是一党员，他对主席心存感激，他听出我是外地，所以把这次的机会让给了我，很感谢他，就像他对主席那样的感激
30,“im Land des Lächelns”,"Wer eine Stadt mit über 17 Millionen Menschen besucht, muß starke Nerven für den Autoverkehr mitbringen: 6-10 spurige Straßen auf denen für deutsche Verhältnisse jeder macht, was er will. Wer sich davon nicht irritieren läßt, sollte die ""Verbotene Stadt"", den Sommerpalast und die vielen kleinen interessanten Orte suchen - und natürlich die Mauer. Überall sind viele viele Menschen, die laut kommunizieren. Es wimmelt von Bankenhochhäusern und größten Großbauten. Ein ruhiger Ort ist das Konzerthaus das sogenannte ""Ei"". Ein gewaltiger Bau, in dem sich Konzerthaus, Theater und Oper befindet. China hat eine faszinierende alte Kultur, die man noch finden kann. Wenn man die Menschen nicht in Verlegenheit bringt (sie haben kaum Information über das was wirklich passiert), kann man herzliche Begegnungen, beste Restaurants finden."
40,“很不错呢”,"环境不错,服务业可以哈.有绿卡就是方便,去旅游住酒店方便又实惠,省去很多麻烦.以后去旅游就可以直接找这个连锁的住宿了~"
40,“saubere Stadt”,Peking hat meiner Meinung nach noch viel mehr Freizeitmöglichkeiten bzw. Attraktionen als zum Beispiel Shanghai.Auffälliges:- Es gab wirklich sehr viele Straßenfeger und die Stadt war sehr (!) sauber.- Die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sind sehr gut ausgebaut: Es stehen außerdem sehr viele Taxis herum und man kann sich für sehr wenig Geld fortbewegen.- Vom Flughafen bis in die Innenstadt kostet es per Taxi nur ungefähr 8 Euro!Die Eintrittspreise waren m. E. ebenfalls sehr güntig. Somit kann man auch für wenig Geld viel Spaß haben.Das kulturelle Angebot ist ebenfalls sehr ausgebaut.Allgemein ist Peking eine absolute Empfehlung.
20,“万里の長城はさすが！でも…”,万里の長城は、教科書でよく見たまさにこれぞ中国！の光景で感動しました。しかし、全体的にやはり不潔です。トイレはすごく汚く、ホテル以外でのお手洗いはできるだけ我慢していました。食事も…日本の中華料理屋さんの方がやっぱりおいしいと思ってしまいました。オリンピックをきっかけに整備したとのことですが、首都とは言え街はまだまだ発展途上の様子でした。ちなみに、私が行った時期は真冬、しかもちょうど６０年に一度と言われる大寒波がきていたときで、気温はマイナス３０度。死ぬほど寒かったです。少しも肌を出すことができず、写真を見ても誰なのかわかりません…
50,“北京很好”,北京好很漂亮很干净人好是我们希望的地方美丽的风景美丽的城市美丽的古都是人们向往的地方人民大会堂天安门
40,“春節最後の17日の花火は凄かった！！！”,今年の春節の旧正月は、2月3日でしたが、2日から3日に掛けての深夜に、中国全土での花火や爆竹による火災が約６０００件発生したことは、インターネットで知りましたが、特に東北地区の遼寧省瀋陽市（省都）の5星ホテル・マリオットの全焼には、驚かせられました。被害総額25億元（約315億円）で、何と法律違反の外壁材に非耐火材を使用していたことも判明したようです。今回14日から19日に、北京市・長富宮飯店（宿泊）を拠点に17日を迎えたのですが、花火を使い切る最終日の為、その凄さにはビックリ。タクシー乗車時での道路の路肩の花火には、脅威すら感じました。この一般市民による花火は、日本のチャチな花火ではなく、花火大会用のような一尺球さえ発射されるのです。そのタクシー乗車時には、タクシーの脇の路肩に沿って花火が置かれており、タクシーの走行に並行して花火が発射されたので、まるで機関銃射撃のように花火射撃で襲われているような状態でした。但し、深夜12時（やはり中国ですので、禁止時間にも拘らず、12時半位まではどこかで花火の音がなっておりました）で終了しますので、寝れないことはありませんでしたが。（小生は、カラオケクラブにおりました）旅行時期をこの春節の最初か最後に合わせるのも、違った文化に触れる良い機会ではないでしょうか？是非とも有意義な旅を楽しんで下さい。九拝
50,“很好”,很优美的城市，中国魅力的首都，当然这是我深爱的家乡，一直没有什么机会玩，现在有机会了可以在这样的城市看看！！！！愉快
50,“Prachtvolle Haupstadt”,Beijing (Peking) ist die prachtvolle Haupstadt von China. Lassen Sie sich von der fernöstlichen Kultur verzaubern. Hauptattraktion ist wohl die berühmte Chinesische Mauer.Wie in allen großen chinesischen Städten muss mit großen (großen!) Menschenmassen gerechnet werden. Insbesondere in der Metro ist so gut wie nie ein Sitzplatz zu ergattern. Und nachts kann man selbstverständlich nach westlichen Standarts ausgehen!
50,“后海”,不错，适合年轻人约会，环境也不错，我喜欢，哈哈，嘿嘿，呵呵，帅哥美女也很多哈，，冬天滑冰也是不错的最佳选择，希望驴友么去那看看
40,“首都好”,人热情，风景美，故宫的古老与历史让人回味，天安门的伟大形影，让你想像，西湖的风让你，忘记太多人世的不快乐，让你身在其中，心情愉悦！
50,“北京美”,北京的风景，名胜古迹非常美。我特别喜欢！去了还想去。还有小吃也很好。北京烤鸭更好吃！颐和园，圆明园，香山，八达岭长城，其风景的美丽是独一独一无二的！我非常喜欢！
40,“interessante stadt”,"interessante stadt mit vielen gesichtern. es gibt das kaiserliche peking mit dem kaiserpalast in der verbotenen stadt, auch der sommerpalast des kaisers lädt zu einem spaiziergang ein. daneben gibt es das kommunistische peking mit seinen breiten verkehrsstrassen und dem mausoleum mit mao. auch das moderne peking mit seinen wolkenkratzern ist sehenswert."
50,“大气的北京”,走在北京的大街上你会感到京城就是大气，每一处建筑都会让你觉的宏伟。走在胡同里你会觉得这就是老北京，很有感觉的。
40,“适宜旅游不合适长居”,中国人都知道北京，知道北京的故宫，长城，但去过北京才知道北京的风沙，脏乱。房价还高的离谱。上海同价的房子要比在北京买的好的多。难怪大S跟汪小菲结婚。都让他在上海买房。哈哈
10,“胡同（フートン）散策”,2010年5月1日から3泊4日で北京に行ってきました。天候不順で雨が降ったり霧が出たりしての旅行でしたがまあまあ楽しんでいました。しかし３日目に北京市内観光。輪タクに乗り、明代の路地裏胡同（フートン）散策は、昔の風情がある場所の散策なのでしょうが、汚い洗濯物が見えるは、汚い公衆トイレが見えるで散策する意味が分りませんでした。１度行っただけですが北京には２度と行きたくないと思いました。
10,“想”,先是跟想象中的差远了，交通很实用及，故宫等旅游景点也没啥好看看的，宗旨我不是很喜欢北京，空气之快，人也不是很热情
50,“北京2日游”,元旦和朋友到北京玩了两天，我最喜欢的就是逛街了因为时间短逛的地方太多所以商场的名字不太记得了，但是那里的东西很便宜样式也很漂亮北京王府井的小吃街很多好吃的，尤其是炸酱面喜欢美食的朋友可以去尝尝。特别提示：有学生证的朋友一定要带学生证去！会省很多钱的。
50,“Speciale Pechino”,"Pechino e' la capitale della Cina. Situata nella parte settentrionale della pianura Huabei, si trova sulla stessa latitudine di Roma e Madrid. Pechino ha un clima continentale, e gli inverni sono più lunghi delle estati, la primavera e l’autunno è secco e breve, la temperatura media è 11.8°C.Pechino possiede la lunga storia che risale ad oltre 3000 anni fa. Sin dall’antichità Pechino è stata una città militare molto importante nella parte nord della Cina, Pechino come capitale dello stato lo è stata dalla dinastia Qin, da allora in poi, la dinastia Yuan, la dinasita Ming, la dinastia Qing, hanno fondato la capitale a Pechino: in tutto 34 imperatori si sono succeduti e hanno pubblicato ordini governando tutto il paese.Dopo la Fondazione della Nuova Cina, specialmente negli ultimi 20 anni di apertura e riforma della Cina, l’aspetto di Pechino ha subito un grande cambiamento. Attualmente, gli edifici moderni, l’allargamento degli scambi con l’estero, Pechino sta cambiando il proprio volto in quello di una metropoli internazionale. L’antica storia si fonde perfettamente con la città moderna. In questi anni Pechino riceve migliaia di turisti cinesi e stranieri.Saluti,Massimo"
50,“Ein Top-Ziel für eine Städtereise”,"Peking ist ein Top-Tipp für eine Städtereise!Bequem nonstop von Frankfurt erreichbar, bietet Peking (durch Olympia) zahlreiche neue Top-Hotels zu günstigen Preisen. Zudem bieten sich zahlreiche Kultur-Highlights wie die Chinesische Mauer (Fahrt ca 45 Minuten), die Ming-Gräber, die Kaiserstadt, die Altststadt (mit der Rikscha) und einfach tolles, abendteuerliches Essen (u.a. auf Nachtmärkten)."
40,“呆了六年”,挺大的，好玩的地方也挺多，怀柔影城看来，南锣鼓巷玩来，鸟巢去来，西单经常，王府井东西贵啊，恩，建国门白领多啊，真是无法形容啊
30,“北京北辰洲际酒店”,卫生间好大， 冲淋和浴盆分开，卫生间与房间隔着玻璃用木质百叶窗隔开，很雅致，交通有地铁还算方便，但吃饭非常不便，最近麦当劳也要10 分钟
30,“不愧为首都，”,很大气的一个城市，刚一落地就感到她不同反响的底蕴。站在天安门广场，油然而生一种骄傲与自豪，期待有一天能在北京城多呆些日子，慢慢体味！
40,“年前游北京，感受中国年！”,这已是我第三次来北京了，所以对北京还并不陌生。没事的时候经常出去逛逛。年前这两天闲的没事就出去转了转，感受一过年的气氛。我第一次来北京是在2008年。那时就打算去前门，可是那是前门没开放，没去成甚是遗憾。正好快过年了就打算去前门转转。先是到正阳门，非常雄伟而且墙体保护得还很好。很多人都在那拍照留念。接着就来到了前门大街。那里张灯结彩，人们穿梭往来非常热闹。再往里走一段有一个台湾印象。里头展示着台湾浓郁的本土文化。`观赏台湾风情的同时，还能买一些台湾的小吃饰品等等。值得一逛！
50,“移動が簡単になりました！”,北京市内は広いので、以前はタクシー利用が必須でしたが、地下鉄の路線が増え、何処でも地下鉄で移動可能になりました。わかりやすいので、迷わず移動が可能です。最近の北京市内は、交通渋滞激しく、移動時間に時間がかかりますが、地下鉄ならば早くて安くて安全でお勧めできます。上海に比べ、市内には観光名所が沢山あり、レストランのレベルも高いです。オリンピック後、素晴らしいホテルが沢山出来ましたが、他の都市よりも安めの価格で超一流ホテルを楽しむこともできます。
50,“中国的首都”,中国的首都，北京，是一个很好的旅游景点，有万里长诚，故宫，香山，前门的小吃，王府井的购物街，等等，有好多好玩的地方，哈啊好
50,“时尚北京”,在逛完长城，故宫，颐和园等必去之地后，现在的新一代驴友们开始挖掘更多的“北京内容”。798艺术区就是一个能点亮眼眸的好去处，另外还有每年在北京举行的中国时装周，如果能看上几场专业的时装秀，那可是非常养眼的啦~~
50,“走寻老北京的印迹”,到旅馆稍微休息一下后，便背上包包开始了我的旅程。按照地图的指示，最终来到了最想去的地方之一-------南锣鼓巷，这一条小巷有很多风格迥异的小店，感觉很不错，走在其中，乐在其中......
30,“北京是文化中心，经济不够发达。”,北京是文化中心，经济不够发达。看看故宫，长城，天坛，奥运村，国贸等重要的区域就可以代表北京了。王府井，西单是比较好的购物地方，物品品种丰富，就是北京的物价比较贵。交通堵车厉害，地铁人很多。
40,“流光溢彩，却终止了我向往的脚步！”,北京，这个从小就首先知道的中国大城市，从小就有的向往。当我真正的踏在这方土地上的时候，总感觉到一如既往的不真实。耸入云霄的高楼，闪烁的霓虹，二十四小时一直不见减少的车流，这座城市节奏快速，生活精致。一边过着自己滋润的日子，一边还受到世界各地的关注，她就像是一个才华横溢的美丽姑娘，不管是内在的还是外在的都那么的让人着迷。但是，对于如我一般的平凡人，只能是一个过客，看过了，欣赏过了，赞美过了，也就结束了！还得回到我应该过的生活。她太优秀，也就挡住了我无谓的向往。
50,“客栈服务细致周到”,我们是一行4人（两对母女）凌晨一点多才在小李的接送下入住客栈，昏天黑地的搞不清方向，全程六天的食宿出行都是在小李的指点下完成的！客栈前接南锣鼓巷，后连什刹海，交通便捷，商业繁华。最让人感动的是，由于两位母亲迫切想要观看人艺话剧表演，而孩子却吵闹着要回客栈，当务之急，又是亲爱的小李叔叔把她俩接回了电视屋！服务到了这个份上真是没话说了！！刚开始几天都是坐着公交地铁在北京满城绕转，结果到了最后两天居然发现什刹海的滑冰场，恭王府的福字碑，计划中的烟袋斜街都近在尺尺，鼓楼东大街上的姚记炒肝，西大街上看不了的嘻哈包袱铺，令冬日的京城亲子游意犹未尽。。。平生第一次入住胡同客栈，感受到了全方位的贴心服务！
40,“痛并快乐着”,在北京的生活，对我来说是痛并快乐着。首先，这里既是聚合六朝文化的历史古都，又是极具现代化气息的大都市。生存在北京不容易，可是却依旧有那么多人被这里深深吸引。宁愿选择为梦想去吞下艰辛，也不远庸碌而享受片刻。也许，这就是北京最迷人的地方。
50,“成熟型大都市”,非常成熟的城市，古都文化源远流长，城市道路四通八达，具有典型四合院风格的文化一条街，南锣鼓巷，汇集了老北京的老物件
40,“北京”,一个国家的内脏，孕育着无数的宝贵文明，来的了这个城市生活，倍感兴奋之余也有些许劳累的感觉，忙碌于工作与生活中，交替着，继续前行。
50,“玩转北京”,北京是我国政治文化中心，有其特有的魅力与底蕴。各大景点的美远远超出我的想象，也因此，我与这座城市结下不解之缘··
40,“北京，小住方得怡情”,作为中国的行政中心，文化中心，北京当然会成为所有国人一生中应该前去的地方。可大多时候，旅行总是来也匆匆去也匆匆，对于北京这样的城市则无从领略她的神韵。游览北京，最好抽出一段时间，在北京的胡同小住，体会老北京的生活，到皇城的周边多去转转，除了现代化的鸟巢，北京有着更深的韵味。
40,“Stadt der Gegensätze”,"In Peking liegen große Gegensätze oft dicht beieinander. Alte Hutong-Siedlungen, die in letzter Zeit wieder liebevoll restauriert worden sind, befinden sich direkt neben Hochhauskomplexen. McDonalds kann man unweit einheimischer Garküchen entdecken.Die unzähligen Fahrräder werden zunehmend von Autos verdrängt, was auf den (teilweise sechsspurigen!) Straßen nicht selten zu kilometerlangen Staus führt.Beeindruckend auch die morgendliche Gymnastik in den vielen Park - oft zu ganz und gar nicht meditativer Musik aus plärrenden Kasettenspielern.Insgesamt ist die Stadt mit ihren vielen, vielen Tempeln und dem Kaiserpalast natürlich immer eine Reise wert"

40,“首都北京”,09年5月份去的北京，天气不错，但是北京的灰尘啊！！什么车都是厚厚的一层灰啊！特别喜欢的北京的胡同，租了自行车骑了一圈，感觉非常好，还骑到天安门了。我个人觉得骑车比坐车旅游爽，什么时候想停下来玩玩拍拍照啊很方便。长城只去了居庸关，因为八达岭很早就结束发车了，因为节假日的原因，控制客流量。去了山顶公园观看了一下雄伟的故宫，因为不想进去走一天，俯视一下也不错！
40,“文化氛围会让我上瘾不想走”,在北京四周详细的走一圈，用心去体会其中的人文，风土，习俗，不敬意间，你会被那种到处可以作为文化展示在外人面前的景致所陶醉的-----当然前提是你很在意这张叫做文化的东西。
40,“大都市”,很多人向往的城市很多可以玩、可以看的城市每个北京人可能也只对一小片、局部的北京熟悉，我也是在这里我留下了很多美好的回忆
30,“我国的国都”,很多女孩说话声音好听，不过我猜是外地的，很多名胜古迹是大家都向往的，有些票太贵了，应该免费开发嘛，交通很差，有待改进，塞车塞得太可怕了。
40,“史都”,恢弘大气，文化积淀深厚。同样这座城市的都市人由于生长在皇城根下，有着与生俱来的优越感，他们乐观而又平淡还有着淡淡地玩世不恭
30,“北京”,北京具有大都市的繁华，也有沧桑，但是北京却人人向往生活的地方，打拼的地方，锻炼的地方，我希望我能早日尘埃落定吧。新年祈愿，梦想成真
50,“首都！北京”,不愧是首都啊 大得出奇先不说 有很多有意义的老经典···比如故宫！颐和园！景山公园等等~~都很有历史意义！不过最壮观的就是天安门了~~来北京一定要看升国旗仪式！

50,“北京”,北京，我的家，北京是中国的首都，无论从文化教育还是娱乐美食，或者是名胜古迹，从各个方面都没的说，都是非常棒的城市。我是北京人，从小生长在这里，所以非常热爱这片土地，我爱北京。
30,“酒店偏贵”,酒店倒是满多，连锁也很多，但价格不菲，条件一般，下两百元的非常少，两百出头的就是经济房间了，条件设施都不太好，跟地段也有关。
50,“房子贵，生活便宜”,哎呦，不错哦！生活在北京很好的，除了房子压力大，交通拥堵点。地铁拥挤点，其它都还不错，特别是天子脚下讲道理啊，不像地方政府，TMD一顿乱拆。。。。。
50,“美丽的北京”,北京市中国的首都，也是我们中华文化的集散地，那里有美食美景，让去过那里的人们流连忘返。可以参加当地的几日游或者买张地图自助游都很是不错的选择。
40,“北京的龙庆峡”,龙庆峡真是北京的一个非常好的景点，有着北京的大气，又是一个有山有水的好地方，又能游艇，又能爬山，娱乐挺综合的，也很刺激！
40,“大气”,到北京的时候是夏天。正好是最炎热的那几天过去了。所以不很热。这让我这个怕热的人对北京的第一感觉就非常好。因为时间有限。北京的好友陪我大致的逛了一些景点。感觉非常好。
40,“北京交通”,在北京快两年了，北京给我的印象有好有坏，很喜欢北京的后海和南锣鼓巷，非常有味道，北京的交通实在是让人抓狂，那是相当的堵啊
50,“龙庆峡之旅”,龙庆峡的气候很宜人，风景秀丽，波光荡漾，乘着腾龙电梯俯瞰众山水，乘船游览凤冠岛，钟山，划船泛舟好不惬意。神仙山，百花洞等等都是探知的好去处。
30,“大而无当”,"冬天的北京,寒风凛列,高楼大厦将阳光挡掉了不少，整个城市更显得冷漠和寒冷，拥堵的车流，高昂的物价，都让人感觉这是个居不易的地方。"
50,“北京游”,第二次去北京旅游了，北京给我的感觉是非常大气。每次去都有不同的感受。北京值得我们一去再去。还要同不同的人去。感受很深!
40,“中式酒店”,中堂客栈是我在一个很冷的冬天住进的，温暖的房间给了我家的温暖，四合院给了我不一样的感受。红色的油漆门需要敲开，迎面而来的是大红的灯笼。
50,“首都印象”,我是在残奥会期间去的首都，空气好得不得了，清新干爽，蓝天白云到处有。交通也很便利，2元可以坐满全部地铁线了。出租车也容易打，司机都相当能侃。群众热情有礼，去吃了全聚德的烤鸭，还可以啦~~最难忘在鸟巢唱国歌~
30,“拥堵的京城”,12月初去北京。感觉一般。可能是之前期待的太高。印象最深的是北京的塞车，一动不动，原来京城连塞车都可以这么牛逼。长城，故宫，天安门广场，跟电视上看的差不多。还是得慢慢悠闲着长时间去游览会有更多不同的感受。
50,“雄伟的天安门”,雄伟的天安门城楼，是世界人民和中华人民最向往的地方。是中华民族儿女最自豪的象征和骄傲。它象征着世界的和平，象征着人民生活的安宁。
40,“工作在北京”,旅游的话酒店相对较贵，建议大家通过旅行社或者别的渠道订购酒店，北京的天气也相对干燥，注意保湿，冬天的北京非常冷，得把自己裹得很严实才对！
30,“有很多历史故地，可以去看一看”,个人觉得因为北京的旅游景点实在太多，所以需要花上几天时间好好逛逛的，没有去过的可以去看看我国的历史，建筑，是多么伟大和雄伟，不过个人觉得因为我是南方的，所以取得时候觉得气候比较干的，其他还OK，吃的很多，逛逛吃吃看看，还OK~~
40,“北京汉庭酒店”,酒店安静整洁，可以通过网上预订，方便快捷，而且如果到了预订时间没到，酒店也会打电话询问是否会于当于到达住宿，酒店地点离学校区很近，晚饭后可以去各学校转转，重温自己当年上学的记忆。
40,“北京”,北京很美，玩的地方很多，各方面也很方便，住宿，美食，出行，但需要注意的是避开早晚出行高峰，因为会堵车，选择地铁出行是不错的。
40,“交通赌塞严重”,景点都不错，人文气息很浓。就是那个交通啊。头疼，头疼。故宫很好。进去之后感觉人的心整个都宁静了，摸着故宫的每一片砖瓦，好多的遐想
50,“北京土著”,生活在这了20多年了，身上有深深的北京烙印，北京情结。是个古色古香可以让生活慢下来的城市，好爱红墙琉璃瓦，我爱北京!
50,“首都北京”,其实去过北京几次了，上次去都是十一的时候。带儿子一起去的，让儿子感受了一下自己国家首都的氛围。在天安门看升国旗，儿子很兴奋，回家以后还特意跟老师说了一下看升国旗的心情，呵呵！

40,“旅游还行吧”,景点比较多。。路面交通太挤。。公共交通方便。。公交便宜。。地铁方便也便宜。。能感觉到是国际化。。寸土寸金。。吃的比较贵。。楼多。。楼间距近。。
40,“大气”,特别喜欢北京的公园。有人告诉我，在中国，看了北京的公园别的就再不想去。赞同。一座有底蕴的城市，不愧是首都。但是不适应那里的天气。太干燥了。
10,“北京的交通”,北京旅游是很好的，有很多的名胜古迹，可是，北京旅游的交通不敢恭维，慢的像老牛车。一天的光景基本都浪费在了路上。尤其是在应季的时候比如红叶节去香山，哈哈，你可想而知了。
30,“长城”,本来北京人是不错的，我在请教那条路怎走的时候，别人知道的都会教我怎走，可是就是去长城的时候，说好了一个价的，可是上了车之后，这个也要钱，那个也要钱，这个就不好了，而且导游为了挣钱可是不讲情面的啊，我希望林改改，人活着不一定就是为了钱而活。
30,“北京的车北京的人”,没去北京之前一直向往，国家的首都，商业的中心。刚刚到达北京的时候给我第一印象就是，人可真多，到处都是人，不管是公交车上，地铁站里人挤人。看了几天的奥运会丢了一个手机，亏死了！！！
40,“首都北京”,一个国际化大都市下，却掩盖不住落寞人的落寞。无意指责世间的人情冷暖，只愿在同一片蓝天下，人人有饭吃，人人有房住，人人过的快乐
50,“北京后海”,后海到南锣鼓巷，从中国的古朴建筑到现代的灯红酒绿，在古都中寻找浪漫的绝佳去处，建议三五好友聚会，情侣约会，推荐岳麓山屋的湘菜
20,“個別火鍋”,ここのところ、どんどん不動産価格が上昇していて空港近くの中級戸建でも3億円だと！！　すげえバブリー。王府井近辺のホテルに泊って辺りをうろうろ歩くのがきれいだし、ご飯もおいしいところが多いので無難だと思う。　わたしはここのところ西洋風に変えたなんちゃって火鍋にはまっている。　一人鍋なので、西洋人の接待にもOK。
50,“温文儒雅”,有着深厚的文化气息，正是这种气息让我爱上了这座城市，每每到一个地方，我都会不由的联想起曾经在这里生活过的名人、文人，对他们敬仰是我这一生的追求。
40,“我爱北京天安门”,今儿俺去北京天安门转悠了。天气还行，不大热，也就32度呐。带伞出来之后看人撑了我才撑了下下，后来就直接塞包包里了。梅静的包包，怪衬我衣服的。嘿嘿。谢谢了啊。到了王府井的时候已经差不多12点了，下车就一溜儿逛啊。最开始进的那个D1大商场，壮观啊。全都是名牌啊，牌子啊。不过我都没听过更没看过。结果我的一席话把娜给整郁闷了。经过几次的咨询之后，总结了一下，咱啥都别问了，没一样是我现在能买的起的就对了。还是闭嘴吧，省的娜直接扔我下去。嘿嘿。看她绝对有这冲动啊。冲动是魔鬼啊，我不能和魔鬼较劲啊。嘿嘿 。咱就一路拍啊，用的那索爱的像素挺好的。还拍了好多不知道的牌子的好看的衣服还有装饰品。啧啧。。真是赞啊。还是娜技术好，我感觉我的都是糊的（其实这也是她说的，咱得配合着应着不是。嘿嘿）有点兴奋的是那个我见着传说中的CK了哟，就是那小四郭敬明在小说《梦里花落知多少》里头写的那付小司和陆智昂穿的。把我一阵兴奋的，感觉好像看见他们再那儿试衣服似的。主要是想象自己见到帅哥了。嘿嘿。接着我指了个看上去色系搭配超好的店给娜看，问了句我现在还后悔的话：那儿衣服贵么？娜用一种特别复杂的眼神看我：没有两三千绝对下不来一件衣服。。。我直接直抽气。妈妈呀。牌子的威力！什么牌子来着？忘了，真是不好意思啊。。。王府井真是大啊，牌子店一路接着一路，看都看不完，眼睛都花了。。。可惜没钱买。不怕，面包会有的，钞票也会有的。看见帅哥了，给娜看，她都说没什么太好看，把我整得郁闷啊，你个丫头眼光长哪儿啦?不就身高矮了点儿么？别那么打击人家啊。。。其实五官真的不错哟！很安静的样子。从王府井出来的时候已经是下午4点了，赶到了天安门，嘿嘿。真雄伟啊。这好似小学老师教的口吻哦。嘿嘿。壮观。看到超多老外啊，啧啧。。不过我不知道哪些才是帅哥，就全当是帅哥好了。。嘿嘿。。接着是拍照拍照，我做背景，景点就是主景了，嘿嘿。反了全。去了三个地方看了，宫女住的地方，还有埃及石碑，不过都是仿制品。。。不过也够了，我要求不高的，我来的主要目的就是来拍照的。嘿嘿。得在天安门留下我的小爪子。嘿嘿。还有娜娜的。溜达着就出来了，拍了好高好高的城门，有个在维修，可惜了，没让它做主景，我做背景衬它了，嘿嘿。有个特逗的事情，我出了天安门的时候在外头停下休息的时候，看见一老外了，貌似是帅哥哦，我的感觉告诉我啊。然后我小声问娜：娜，那是帅哥吗?好家伙，直接把我拽走了，我还奇怪呐，干嘛啊这是。一路小跑，娜用特埋怨的语气和我说，都怪你，本来可以把那个帅老外拍下来的，结果你一直叫唤。我发誓，我不知道哪老外懂不懂中文的，我以为他们很多人不懂的。结果娜说，来中国的谁不会说啊，只不过他没和你说而已。然后我直接闭嘴了。哈哈。真逗。坐地铁去了人民英雄纪念碑那儿，应该是那儿坐的地铁吧？应该是吧。嘿嘿，不大记得了。反正是坐了。。呃。。。不大好的消息就是娜的脚磨起泡了，真是心疼的，又不肯再多休息会儿，一路辛苦的。诶。。。娜，真是。诶，辛苦了。值得恭喜的是我一路上都没有吐噢，虽然还是不大舒服，但是仍然是太值得表扬了，应该载入史册了。《徐氏语录》啊。嘿嘿，那个吃了晕车药的事情可以忽略麽？呃。。咱不提那个行不？知道内情的一律封口！o(∩_∩)o...哈哈回到家的时候已经是晚上8点多了。啧啧。。我头一次吃那么多鱼噢，以前我是碰都不碰的呐。实在是因为我得给梅静这个自封的哪什么香格里拉大厨面子啊。o(∩_∩)o...然后又看见讨厌的留言了，啪啦，咱全删了，当她自己说自己个吧。照片100多张呐，有一张实在是太逗了。啧啧。。o(∩_∩)o...哈哈。我爱北京天安门，以后我得去看升国旗。嗯！
50,“我爱我的故乡”,我是一个土生土长的北京人，不管是文化地理，人文知识都是随着北京的发展一步一步走的现在，北京的每一个变化让我颇有感触，交通的顺畅，地铁的方便，各种名胜古迹都历历在目，确实让我们心情愉悦！
20,“我很惊讶！我很... ...”,我居然在长安街天安门以西第三，还是第四个街口，看到马拉的胶轮平板车由南向北穿越而行。车上堆着水果，过路口不足二百米便停车叫卖开了，...... 我很......！
30,“北京”,北京曾经很美好，身边人们都很友善，出租车司机永远有说不完的话跟你聊，但是自从全国各地的人都挤在北京之后，再也回不去了
50,“北京很好”,来来回回去GGPP家，都是从北京走，北京很大，比我所在的大连要大的多，人的素质很好，毕竟是首都，我很喜欢北京，还喜欢北京的烤鸭
50,“いろんな面がみれる街”,中国という国のいろいろな面を見ることができます。紫禁城をはじめとする観光地はもちろん、首都としての近代的な街、その一方で、生活が苦しい人々に遭遇することもある、多面的な街です。
30,“北京也不过如此”,北京其实是我一直向往的地方，国家的首都嘛呵呵，可是等我切身处地的到北京的时候才发现北京也不过如此，到处是成堆的人群到处是瘫痪的交通，什么好心情也给磨没了，东西还特别的贵，真不知道那些个扎堆在北京的人在想些什么
50,“来到首都”,去了北京很多地方，最喜欢的晚上去的鸟巢和水立方，当走出地铁站向前看的那一刻，我们都被震撼到了，不由自主的发出了惊叹声，北京真好！
40,“北京印象”,在北京工作生活了六年了，去近郊短线游还是去延庆，秋天感觉最好，景色很美，人也不是那么拥挤，整个人都感觉静下来了。
20,“去北京看同学的不爽遭遇”,十一去北大看同学，开始还憧憬首都的美好。可是四天的经历让我对首都的印象大打折扣啊。下飞机后打车就遇到了载人的司机，不知道怎么绕了路，同学说十几块的车费居然变成了24！还有就是吃的东西特别贵，15块一碗的面条基本吃不到什么东西，恶心啊。20块钱的锅贴那也不像人吃的。最后就是交通，那个车堵得太厉害了，4站路一个多小时，也就地铁过得去。还很拥挤。所以北京真是一无是处啊
30,“大城市。。快节奏”,想要拥有轻松的假期，我就不建议去北京。。大城市生活节奏快。。东西不是多好吃。。但是可以集中区温泉度假山庄或一些片的地方享受大城市的轻松时光
40,“全是名胜古迹啊”,学生去的话应该很便宜，如是愿意住学生公寓，总的来说交通考走，门票打折几乎花不了什么钱。所以还是很推荐北京附近的学生去看看的~（建筑学的最推荐）
50,“很有文化底蕴的古都！”,凌晨五点火车到的北京，清晨的北京黑得像泼过墨一样！稍稍地在朋友家眯了一下，便直奔紫禁城，这个城市啊！曾经在我的梦里出现过多少次，故宫、长城、那些遗落在岁月中的历史，都深深地让我迷恋。后来知道了安缦颐和，便计划着某年再来一次，我希望不要孤孤单单地来了，可以和他一起，如果那时我还在，他也没离开的话。
50,“北京”,很漂亮的城市，有很多好玩的地方，我去过香山，天安门等等，很漂亮，壮观。下次还想去，去一些没去过的地方，去爬长城等等的。
50,“感觉很有安全感的城市”,以前看过许多关于北京的报道，总以为那里很多沙尘什么的，去了就感觉北京给了我很清新的，满地都是兴奋，每条路都蕴含着历史的味道，他比我想象中更美好。我和朋友们去了好些地方游玩，最有意思的还是清华大学和颐和园。我们花了大半天游颐和园都没逛完，那里实在太大了。我们爬上了颐和园的最高点，在那照写好些照片，还攀上了石头上摆POSE，老外看了都乐了。清华大学是中国最知名的学府之一，也是校园面积最大之一，我们几个租用了单车游玩，骑过教堂、荷花塘、情人坡、图书馆。我们转了又转，始终不愿离开这个知识渊博的地方。夜晚降临，因为要去好些景点玩，经常玩到很晚了才回去，走黑暗的小路，我心里也不觉得害怕，反而觉得首都很有安全感，是我去过的城市最有安全感的一个。我爱北京。
40,“地理位置”,大，平，好比较时间的换，比北京市一个好地方，有山有水哦，有好多的人，好多的汽车，好多的房子，好多的机关，好点的酒店，好呀！
40,“奋斗向前的城市”,感受忙碌的城市打工族的繁忙紧张，另咯老北京居民的京腔口吻，走访古都遗留的雄观城池····适合年轻人成长的城市，回想北京
50,“首都风范”,北京是我国首都，是全国的政治、文化、经济中心，具有很大包容性和创造性，在这你可以看到古今交替，中外合璧，是一个不折不扣的国际大都市。
50,“北京不错”,北京是个古老的城市，有着很多景点，去过故宫，颐和园，圆明园遗址等很多地方，呆了将近一个月，却还是没走完景点，下次一定要再去回顾回顾
50,“北京”,一个时尚和古典，超现代和历史结合的地方，这个地方有着外国风尚同时又夹杂着中国古典的韵律，很美很有内涵，是个美丽的大都市。
40,“京味足不足？”,生平第一次去北京，是夏天，很热；游玩的时间不长，觉得不怎么尽兴。没有看到期待的四合院，十分遗憾。赶早去看天安门升国旗，到了才知道自己出来已迟。整个广场肃穆庄严，即使什么也没有望见，依然激动不已。总觉得四周京味不浓。倒是出租车司机浓重京腔让人觉得一丝过瘾。
30,“酒店”,说实话，北京的酒店房间又小又贵，不太好！还是喜欢南方，两三百块钱可以住好大的房间了！北京的酒店住的也不怎么舒服，没有给人一种像回到家的感觉！
40,“贫”,北京特有味儿，一大特色就是贫。贫让人感觉轻松，忙碌的生活有了些些生气。做上出租，司机就能跟您贫半天。。。绝对不会让您的旅程死气沉沉
30,“在北京住过好几次了”,北京找住的地方不难，但是，难的是找到适合自己住的地方，所以去之前一定要先选好住哪再去，要不然就会眼花缭乱的。整体来说比较贵啊，也不是很干净，跟南方的一些城市的宾馆相比，性价比不算高
40,“北京，我的向往”,中国首都北京，是人人向往的城市之一，进入北京不只是去吃那里的美味，住那里的豪华酒店，更重要的是约同伴们一起去爬长城，去体会那里的无限风光，他是中国悠久历史的见证。
40,“北京--小时候的梦想”,小时候这里是梦想中的地方，长大了，置身其中，虽然不如想象中的美好，甚至有很多的缺陷，但是总是有了很多或苦或甜的美好记忆。
40,“很好的地方”,环境优美，还有很多好玩的名胜古迹~~虽然人们生活节奏有点快，但还是个令人眼花缭乱的大都市~个人觉得故宫、天坛、长城是必去的地方
50,“地羙，人善”,在北京生活的这段时间，我认识到了很多北京人，去了很多美丽的地方。我了解到了老北京的风土人情。。北京就是一个地羙人善的地方，这里的人们对人都特别的热情友善，让我步伐离开这么美丽的地方~
50,“古都之美”,虽然北京发展的很快，但是仍然不是古都之美，很有感觉的城市！故宫，长城，虽然没有让人流连忘返的美景，但是确实不可不去的地方！
40,“北京可去的地方多”,北京可去的地方多，城市太大，玩的时候一天内的景点选择精而集中才好，出行要么赶早要么晚点避开早八九晚5-7点的上下班高时间段。
40,“大气北京”,作为中华人民共和国的首都，硬件设施毋庸置疑，在这里你可以看到时尚前沿，可以看到各种精彩演出，可以穿梭各大胡同，可以畅享各种小吃。除了令人不快的常态堵车，北京其实挺好。
50,“很强大的城市”,无论是环境 安全各方面，都很喜欢北京，不愧是首都(～ o ～)~zZ 虽然地铁拥挤，但看到你们超快节奏的生活，感觉到了生活的紧迫感，每天的交通费更是让人感到意外！
50,“魅力北京”,北京是一个具有魅力的城市，那里环境优美，交通发达~文化底蕴也很浓郁，走进北京传统的四合院，浓浓的北京文化感染了我的每个神经和细胞饮食文化也很吸引我，豆汁儿，炸酱面。。。细细品尝，别有一番滋味
50,“我的青春留在了那”,在北京呆了四年，所有美好的回忆都在那里。时尚、古朴、大气！我爱北京！我爱北京的酸梅汤、爱北京的公交地铁、爱北京的南锣鼓巷、爱北京的很多很多~
50,“好”,北京市个生活节奏快，锻炼人的地方，很好，时尚，复古都有。。不错，想要的一切都可以在那得到，文明程度比较高，人的素质也高。
50,“给力”,北大，清华，宁静幽雅的校区，书生气卷十足，味道浓郁的林荫小路，光是一个校区就足够走上一天，出来之后买了老北京豆皮，冰糖葫芦，酸奶，金秋十月，品尝这好滋味……难以忘怀的北京之旅
30,“说实话，不喜欢”,有那么几年，因为工作的关系，几乎每个月飞一次北京，只是，公司在工业区里，没有很多机会观光。不过，再怎么说，该去的也都去的差不多了：故宫，长城，十三陵，圆明园，颐和园，前门，后海，天坛，景山......对我这个历史和文学爱好者来说，最喜欢的居然还是那座废墟。每一次面对残垣断壁，仿佛心里总有一种莫名的感怀。所以每次有机会，都会去圆明园瞻仰一下。顺便，也看看清华北大呵呵。后海也是比较喜欢的地方。个人认为比上海的新天地别有情趣，主要在这一潭水上了。有了水，便有了灵气。尤其到了夜里，桨声灯影，更添繁华。至于故宫，总是想等我有时间了，一定要花整整三天，把里面的宝贝看个够。
50,“好”,"好,干净,安全,北京的发展真是用日新月异来形容,记得刚来北京的时候对北京是充满好奇,这里的什么都是新鲜的,好玩的,好吃的,好逛的,应有尽有,"
50,“Tradition und atemberaubende Dimensionen”,"Peking ist einfach eine Reise wert. Für Deutsche gilt das Kempinski als typische Unterkunft in Peking , ich bevorzuge das Sheraton. Aufgrund der immensen Strecken und der schlechten Luft eignen sich zu Fuß Unternehmungen nicht wikrlich. Es ist ratsam sich mit dem Taxi fortzubewegen - zumal die Taxipreise für europäische Verhältnisse sehr günstig sind. Achtung: Ich empfehle immer auf das Taximeter zu bestehen, da diese Preise in der Regel 5mal so günstig sind iwie der angebotene Pauschalpreis...aber auch der ist verkraftbar. Was man unbedingt sehen sollte: Große Mauer - als Tagesausflug- Sommerpalast, Himmelstempel, Kaiserpalast, Lamatempel (finde ich persönlich sehr nett). Abends gibt es immer irgendwas zu sehen: sei es die Geschichte von Kung Fu (geht so) oder Variete Theater (ganz großartig). Wenn man günstig einkaufen möchte und einem das chinesische Gewusel nicht zu unangenehm ist empfiehtl sich der Pearls Market."
40,“北京游~~”,在北京有很多地方可以玩，有名胜古迹还有潮流圣地，但是一定要有一双发现的眼睛~~无论男女老少，在这里都可以找到适合自己的一片天地~~~
50,“没有让我失望的北京”,北京太大气了，街道很宽建筑很宏大，虽然不想香港建筑那样拔高，但是很有气势，北京人很好，听着北京话特逗，在北京玩的很开心，去了好多地方好多条胡同，首都不愧是首都啊
40,“宽阔而细腻的北平”,北京市给人的第一感觉是视野很开阔，但是这并不是说她粗糙，北京有很多景点好玩的地方值得你去细细品味。她的宽阔，体现在面积大，视野非常好，看到漫漫无际的天空，有如大海般的宽阔，你会突然觉得心情非常好，觉得世界如此之大，如此之妙。她的细腻，体现在人文景观，你会发现北京有很多著名的旅游景点，这些地方都是深藏着浓厚的文化底蕴，值得我们去细品。
40,“首都”,我们去了.长城.天安门.圆明园.植物园.动物园..我感觉去北京的就要去天安门...看看我们的主席....其他的也没什么了......是个比较文明的城市啦
40,“还不错”,当时去的时候是个多雨的季节 感觉还不错~ 很有情调~登山的时候也不是那么的热 偶尔有泉水从山上某个泉眼里流出来 凉凉的 呵呵~
40,“古老现代和杂乱”,传统和现代中无不充满了发展，还有拥挤脏乱，13亿人的中心，无数人向往的城市。国家机关的工作人员，精英，有钱人，还有为了梦想而北漂的人，还有农民工组成的城市。
40,“北京的市民真好”,多年前到过北京几次，总感觉北京的市民特傲慢，问路不是爱答不理就是胡乱指点。但是今年带女儿到北京来玩，感觉北京的市民变得特别热情。无论是年老的还是年少的，只要有需要，都是热心的帮助。一次向一位大妈问路，这位北京老大妈，竟然帮忙一直把我们送到目的地，太感动了！都说奥运会之后北京人的素质提高了，果然如此呀！
20,“旅游，很好，居住，很可怕……”,悲摧的在北京上大学。说实在的，北京文物古迹及其他各种文化资源之丰富是中国任何一座城市都无法比拟的。现代化的部分也在增多，震撼人心的东西还是挺多的。但是，在这三年了，还是难以接受这里的食物、气候、堵车，更重要的是官僚作风。北京人还是挺友善的，但是有个别的自以为是的人会让人很反感。一言以蔽之，北京城市发展的智慧还不够。总而言之，北京作为首都，是一生至少要拜访一次的城市，但作为一生的居住地，我的答案是，绝不。
50,“美丽的首都”,真的不错 我和喜欢 边出差边旅游了 真是不错的选择啊 希望有时间会多多去 只是没有看见毛爷爷 有点遗憾啊！下回希望自己能够幸运一点！
40,“发达快节奏的城市”,这里的节奏很快，但要承认的是它也很发达~去过几处景点，像欢乐谷、龙庆峡、香山、动物园，感觉还不错的~以后有时间了要去长城看看~
50,“我觉得北京人很热情，很喜欢这个城市的感觉~”,我到北京一点没有生疏感，总觉得这个城市的感觉那么的平和、舒适。如果不去地铁、火车站、公交车这种人流密集的地方，你会感到这个城市是那么的平活，节奏是那么的舒缓。可惜去颐和园那天下雨了，没有更好的欣赏那里的美景。不过也不枉此行！
50,“繁忙的首都”,古都宜人，风景秀丽，每一条小巷，每一个巷口都有自己的独特魅力。建筑恢弘气魄，宫殿林立，楼宇密集，繁华的都市，宜人的古城！
40,“北京之旅”,今年年初去了北京感觉很不错，那是个很偶然的机会！呵呵，着实体验了把~~对电影大兵小将的印象很好，夜间了想见的人！成龙
50,“有气魄”,北京越来越有大都市的样子了 大都市要有大气魄 希望越来越好 在原有基础上保存好的 去除糟粕的 我们想要一个平和的氛围去欣赏
40,“首都”,中国的首都，一个古老而神秘的城市，中国博大精深文化的充分体现，有中国特色的味道，需要仔细品味，中国特色，我爱北京
50,“古色古香”,生活在北京，越来越爱她！藏在胡同里的小店，吃、喝、玩、乐俱全！既有古老的气息，又结合现代时尚的艺术氛围。商业又文化。时常发现惊喜。。这就是北京~
50,“北京很大”,我于今天12月10号去过北京，北京毕竟是中国的古都及现代化的国际性大都市城市繁华，古都复现。总之玩的也是非常的high，希望都去看看呀
50,“北京，好美”,9月的北京，天高气爽，令人向往。我们去了北京的八达岭，鸟巢，感觉好美。白天去鸟巢和晚间去，景色大不相同。建设真是太雄伟了
40,“虽然很堵，但是还算习惯了”,在北京呆久了，对于堵车会有很好的耐受性，堵车的时候玩玩手机，发发短信，就会觉得怎么这么快就不堵了。呵呵，习惯就好
50,“北京”,不愧为首都，藏风聚气的吉祥之地。二环以内的古色古香依旧存在，虽然现在有些古建筑已经在原来的基础上翻新了，但还是很喜欢这种庄严而不失神秘的感觉！
30,“北京印象”,北京作为我们国家的首都，部分出租车司机的素质应该有所提高，上次我们一行人坐出租车去公司总部培训，连坐四天基本上路都有点印象了，第五天的司机居然带我们绕了一大圈路，车上四人，分别来自台湾、上海、武汉、广州，都没办法用自己当地的语言去讨论司机是否在绕路，我们只得用英语来说司机好像绕了路，等会怎么路他谈。。。。总而言之，希望北京出租车司机能够考虑到作为一个首都市民及城市窗口工作给外来游客留下的印象的重要性。
40,“拥挤”,政治经济中心，祖国的首都，城市也很美丽，也有好客的北京人，还有很多很多的小吃，我感觉，就是拥挤，到处都是人都是车。或许大城市都是这样子
40,“首都”,北京太大，转转的就转晕了，不过还算是个比较喜欢的城市吧！在这里购物的时间比较多，总的来说每次都有收获的。玩的地方没怎么去过，有印象的就是野生动物园，不过还是小的时候去的。
50,“我觉得是最值得玩的城市。”,来北京还是很值得玩的。城市常常是无趣的，匆匆走过，也感觉不到什么生活。可是北京不一样，二环以内的随便一条路都保存的很好。我觉得北京的景点是各种所谓景点中最值得花钱买票的地方。比如故宫，比如天坛。比如长城。很有特点，而且绝无仅有。我常常觉得这些是自然景观，可是不是的，他们的雄伟壮观中还包含着历史。我很爱在故宫里想象那写过去的故事。还有后海。沿着湖走一圈，可以听到不同live bar里穿出来不同的主唱歌手的声音，一个一个的走过，很有特点。
50,“有的玩，有的看，有的吃的大城市”,已经在北京生活了有快三十年了，我对北京是有着深厚的感情的。说起我对北京的印象，那可真是有一肚子话要说：1.从故宫，天安门，天坛，地坛，颐和园皇家园林建筑，再到二环内的胡同文化，天桥大栅栏的古文化购物娱乐街。可以说这些都是老北京文化深厚底蕴的体现，来北京不去这些地方看看景点，体验一下古老文化可真是可惜了。2.从爆肚，豆汁焦圈，北京烤鸭，小肠陈卤煮到簋街饮食一条街，在北京可以吃到从东北到南方的各种美食，要是想吃最地道的小吃，可不要选人山人海的地方，一定要挑藏在胡同深处的老字号，酒香不怕巷子深，最好的美食一定要靠挖掘的。3.从西单商场，王府井百货，新光天地一直到潘家园旧货市场，古玩城。北京这个地方，真的可以让你既体验最现代最时尚最先锋的购物经历，又可以让你回归最传统最原汁原味的老城生活
50,“beij北京喃莫万”,北京真的是个很好的城市，生在中国真是我的荣幸。北京我爱你。我呆了半年在 北京，那里的空气、人和车、鸟语花香真的很好。
50,“古色古香的城市”,这个城市曾经居住了非常多皇帝，只是一个帝王之都，这里的好多东西都保持着以前的风格，让人感觉回到了那个时期。这个城市不错。
30,"“Peking- schöne Stadt, aber wenig Leute, die englisch reden”","Peking ist eine schöne Stadt. Die Stadt hat vor allem sehr viele Sehenswürdigkeiten. Um die meisten zu besichten, braucht man mindestens eine Woche dafür. Ein großer Nachteil ist, dass die Taxifahrer überhaupt kein englisch können und auch meistens nicht lesen können, wenn man Ihnen die Straße von Hotel zeigt, auch wenn sie auf chinesisch geschrieben ist. Ich wurde irgendwo rausgelassen, weil der Taxifahrer nur rumgefahren ist und nichts gefunden hat. Ansonsten ist die Stadt sehr schön. Die chinesische Mauer liegt ca. 40 km von der Stadt entfernt. Hier sollte man einen Ausflug von Hotel aus buchen oder man kann auch mit dem Zug hinfahren.Am besten sollte man mit Chinesen die Stadt besuchen, damit sie sich mit den Einheimischen verständigen können."
40,“令人感到渺小的城市”,前段时间去北京绕了圈去的目的主要是看表妹现在都是独生子女，我这个表妹，在我所有唐啊 表的兄弟姐妹中，算是最亲厚表妹在北京打拼六年，小有所成。东4.5环的房子（舅舅语），可爱机灵的女儿，才开就碰擦的马六……一大早就不见了踪影。舅舅舅妈只能在假期过去陪，但就算这样，一天到晚都难见表妹。北京城又大，大的让我没有任何归属感。某天坐了1号线，看着起始站黑压压的人群中，大多是年轻的身影，一到国贸站，年轻人大批的下，又大批的上，我突然就很悲哀。没有根，没有归属，没有亲人。一个人孤身在北京，这滋味，好受吗？表妹是成功了，她在北京成长并如鱼得水。但不是所有人都和她一样。更多的人，是忙忙碌碌，到头来却默默无为。成功者之所以被人羡慕，在于大部分人都是失败的。成功者，总是少数。一将功成万骨枯啊！反观自己除了出门旅行，就没离开过南京城，大学，工作，都是在自己的家乡，在父母的眼下。当年年轻气盛的时候，也想着大学的时候离开南京，但体会到有人帮你洗衣做饭甚至帮你带小孩，让你有时间上网的舒服温暖，我就再也没了年轻时的心气。我甚至可以预见我十几年后的工作情况，表妹估计不会喜欢我这种几十年如一日的工作吧。所以她奋斗，她赚钱，她成功。我却只能养活自己，陪在父母，儿子身边，波浪不惊。两种生活，两种人生，各有个的选择，各有利弊。在北京看着天南海北的人黑压压的挤地铁的时候，我突然觉得自己是多么的渺小这些为生活忙碌的人，都有自己的目标并在为之奋斗可是我们是多么的渺小啊，如果总是在为了生活而忙碌，那生命有什么意义有时候悲哀的想，国人真的悲哀，一生都为了这或那而忙碌，却总不是为了自己我一直有个梦想，去世界各国看看，但我知道，这个梦想，是永远不会实现的。因为渺小的我，选择了安逸的生活。所以，我的世界，永远不会有表妹精彩。不过，这就是我的选择。听着儿子被我父母逗的咯咯直笑，我想，渺小的我，还是适合安逸啊。
40,“北京繁华大气不失底蕴的都市”,北京的繁华不像上海深圳那样让人压抑，给人一种舒适的感觉！繁华大气而不失其文化底蕴。北京人给人的感觉也是很热情。
30,“国际大都市”,文化大都市，但是给人的感觉是很累的，每天过着很累的生活，工作和生活的压力都很大，不如小城市生活的那么的舒适啊。
30,“环境”,北京我去过两次，但是总体给我的印象一般。尤其是卫生环境不是很理想，人情也不很友善，问了两次路都告诉是错的，还有说话很冲人。
50,“很好的地方”,到北京两次了，每次都有意犹未尽的感觉。这是一个文化氛围十分浓重的城市。就算去十次我也不会腻的。希望大家都能去看看。
50,“短暂的北京之行”,交通方便，城市卫生干净，安防设施完善，如北京的地铁只要2元但可以到达市区内的任何地方，北京到天津的高铁简直是神速！一个字，牛，两个字，超牛！！
40,“我称之为古城都市”,恐怕北京可不是寥寥几个文字就能说的清的！去过北京N多次了！以至于都没想起去点评他！今儿诗兴大发，写两笔！还记得第一次去北京的那种感觉！兴奋之情溢于言表！恨不得把北京每一个角落都看个遍！太好了！但后来去的多了走的城市也多了！就不再有那种感觉了！但是没去过北京的朋友需要去一次！哪怕一次！感受中国的文明古都！北京如果细玩的话！可不是一天两天能玩遍的！至少要几个月！景点就至少500个！天安门广场是必去之地！王府井、东单、西单就不说了！我最喜欢的应该是798艺术区！氛围挺好！期待再去一次！去的多了就不一一举例了！大家有机会要去看看！
40,“北京天安门之午门感受”,去年暑假到北京玩，去了天安门，被他的磅礴气势所吸引，尽到了面看时，看到了午门的面貌，心痛啊！到处都是纸屑和果皮，其数量之大令人叹为观止，堂堂皇家禁城竟变成了这般摸样，希望大家能有良好的习惯，不要随手丢垃圾，这种行为真的很不好！保持城市卫生是我们应尽的基本义务，那景点内是不是更应该注意一下呢？
50,“喜欢北京”,北京，大气磅礴，低调而奢华，喜欢北京这个城市！北京唯一的缺点就是道路交通太堵，最不喜欢的是高峰期打车。贴张王府井附近的教堂照片。
50,“文化底蕴深厚的国都”,北京是我国的首都，它的迷人不是用官方语言可以政治性的表达的，而是用我们自由行的自由人的感受去表达的。到达北京，不要直奔那些装饰堂皇的多少星级大酒店。找个胡同的民居住下。租一辆自行车，和心爱的人流连在大街小巷，品味着老有味道的北京老人的北京调，品尝着各种街头小吃，沉浸在皇城根下的浓浓的文化气氛。
50,“灯火阑珊的城市”,繁华，忙碌的城市，出差去的，白天要上课，晚上吃过晚饭才有时间出来逛逛，车水马龙。这座城市是一个国家的象征，里面有万里长城，天安门，有王府井，外地的朋友一定要去玩一次哦，北京欢迎你
50,“非常现代化的都市”,北京，是个另人向往的城市，自2008奥运以后，世界人对北京的认识又深了一步，一个现代化的城市中又有古典的特色。推荐。大家常去吧。
40,“人太多”,到北京的第一感觉就是人多，那都是人，南北口音，东西习惯，汇集北京。谁让那是我们的心脏呢！每个人都想去一下，看一看吧！
40,“还不错”,住宿很方便，态度和卫生条件不错。就是一日太“水”了，简直就是骗人一样，不满意他们的态度！就像是带你去购物的根本不是去景点玩的。
40,“大气婉约”,前前后后待了快六年，喜欢北京的大气、皇城的古朴、胡同里的小气息~春天的时候喜欢北海白塔下泛舟，夏天的时候喜欢南锣鼓巷漫步，秋天的时候喜欢雍和宫古老的银杏，冬天的时候喜欢窝在暖气腾腾的房间笑意浓~
50,“北京”,冬天的时候，去过北京，有点干燥，南方人要注意保护皮肤，交通方便也很便宜，美景美食，是中国人一生必去的城市，没有之一
50,“北京”,北京整体规划很好，而且治安好 人很有礼貌 而且很热情，我去了半年了 感觉很好，但就是物价有点高，吃的很贵，衣服也贵，哎
30,“北京駅は分かりにくいイ”,中国の首都の北京にある「北京駅」一日中、人であふれています。地方から夜行列車で到着したのか、大きな荷物を持っている人たちが目立ちます。標識があまりなくわかりにくいです。特に地下鉄への乗り継ぎは不便です、下調べを十分に。
50,“魅力”,人文气息很好，文化景观很美，有美丽的自然风景，有好吃的小吃，精品购物街，人情化的服务，好听的北京儿话，小肠陈，糖葫芦。
30,“拥挤”,堵车太严重交通不好 旅游景点太多人来人往淡季人也不少 玩的地方挺多就是路程多比较分散坐车时间长但是公交很便宜
40,“不错”,总来的来说还不错，很方便··房间的卫生间就是小了点，不是很通风。总体很好，很舒服，性价比也很高。环境很优雅，高贵等等等。
40,“北京我的第二故乡”,我在这个城市生活工作了十年，这里像纽约一样文化氛围鼎盛的城市，如果你来一定会爱上它 爱上它的一切。即使现在我已经离开他也已经成为我生命中的第二个故乡
30,“北京の印象”,万里の長城、紫禁城、天安門など見所多数。北京ダックも安くて美味しい。ただ、スモッグがひどく、きれいな晴天をみたことがない。気候は年間を通じて快適な時期がほとんどないのでは、と思う。
50,“北京——中国的明信片”,文化气息浓厚，西方现代化建设风格与中国传统文化有机混搭，干净整洁的城市规划、丰富多样的人文环境、方便快捷的信息资讯
50,“大都市”,作为首都它拥有很完善的交通设施，旅游景点很多，在这里聚集了很多国外的游人，在不同的季节会有不同的景色，我希望每一位游客玩的开心！
50,“北京的秋天”,我喜欢这座城市的大和方正，这里的恢弘与霸气，这里的历史与文化，甚至这里的拥堵与喧嚣。而北京的秋天却是这个城市最美的季节，这一点应该无可否认。天空的高远与湛蓝，红叶的美丽与夺目，冬天将来愈来的寒冷与萧杀。你会从中窥见这个城市在这个季节中所有的大气与美好！
40,“中国传统文化的源泉”,北京胡同是中国非常有特色的文化之一，来北京一定要逛北京胡同，比如南锣鼓巷，比如五道营，还有好多好多，特别是晚上的时候，挺漂亮的。
50,“北京，宏伟”,2009年去的北京，在怀着澎湃的心情进入了人民广场，看了升国旗，做为一个80后，我流泪了。是那种激动的心情，排着队伍进入了毛主席纪念堂。我默默的献上了自己的一点哀悼。后来去了长城知道了什么是中国的龙。什么是中国的宏伟。看下照片吧
40,“Eine faszinierende gegensätlizliche Stadt”,"Kommt man am Flughafen von Peking an und entscheidet sich dafür mit der U-Bahn ins Innere der Stadt zu fahren, so ist man gleich mitten im Geschehen.Besonders zu Stoßzeiten kann es extrem voll werden, und drängeln und schubsen gehört nun mal dazu.Eine Karte für die U-Bahn sollte man sich auf alle Fälle holen, am besten eine auf die man Geld laden kann.Wer nach Peking kommt wird viele verschiedene Facetten kennenlernen.Es gibt zum einen den alten Stadtkern mit den Tempeln und der verbotenen Stadt. Wer nur einen Tempel besichtigen will sollte sich für den Lamatempel entscheiden, dort leben noch Mönche und das gesamte Areal ist sehr schön.Auch in Parkanlagen finden sich Tempelanlagen oder schöne Gebäude zum besichtigen, zu empfehlen ist der Beihai Park nördlich der verbotenen Stadt. Alle Parkanlagen kosten Eintritt.Weiter geht es mit dem China der neueren Zeit, viele Wohnblöcke aus den letzten Jahrzehnten und viele Bauten im Kommunistischen Stil zeigen Pekings Entwicklung. Moderne Hochhäuser und das Olympiastadion zeigen was für einen Fortschritt China in den letzten Jahren durchgemacht hat.Wer gefälschte Waren und Souvenirs kaufen möchte ist bei der Silk Street richtig. Hier muss man aber kräftig feilschen,die Anfangspreise sind extrem hoch angesetzt. meistens purzeln sie ziemlich schnell wenn man sich umdreht und weiterläuft.Kulinarisch hat Peking für jeden was zu bieten. In der Nähe von Sehenswürdigkeiten gibt es öfters auch englische Speisekarten.Die Kellner sprechen meistens kein Englisch, es kann also hin und wieder eine Überraschung werden was auf dem Teller liegt, bestellt und bezahlt wird meistens von einer Person.Peking ist auf jeden Fall eine Reise wert um sich Einblick in die chinesische Geschichte zu verschaffen."
50,“北京就是好”,北京就是好，城市环境好，绿化面积大，人们热情，乐于帮助游客，景点干净，交通方便，人们生活比较惬意，是个让人去了还想去的城市，希望大家都去看看，不会后悔的
50,“现代的北京”,现代的北京已经没有了往日的特色，没有浓浓的胡同风景，没有悠闲的老人，但取而代之的是现代的进步，科技使人们的生活360°大转变，但我还是喜欢我小时候去的北京，那种令人向往的情愫，现在已然所剩无几，到处都是高楼大厦，没有太多的个性。
40,“呼呼~”,其实还挺喜欢北京滴~我从小一直在南方生活。前段时间第一次到北方。。北方的气候和南方不同。比较干燥。。但是我却挺喜欢的。风景啊什么的也和南方截然不同。。呼呼。北京我还挺喜欢吧
40,““充满畏惧”的北京”,作为一个北京附近100多公里的城市的大学生，到北京旅游是大学四年必不可少的事情，从大一刚来参加北京一日游，到前段时间的国庆7日游，让我嗅到了北京的气息，悠久历史的北京的气息。然而作为一个北漂，我对北京还是充满了畏惧，房价、交通以及身份，对于每一个北漂而言，望而却步。
50,“一句话评价这座已经呆了多年的城市”,呵呵，最大的感觉是不容易迷路，马路多半都是东西或者南北朝向的。而且地铁和公交很方便，相反方向的公交车一般在马路对面就可以看到了。
50,“北京，我爱你”,北京，至今我已经带着儿子去了五次。每次它都使我留恋。它是孩子心中的圣地。科技馆，民族园，世界公园，天文馆，古动物爬行馆，还有自然博物馆，浑厚博大。
50,“北京影响”,风景很好，小吃很好吃，不过物价有点贵。不到长城非好汉，长城很漂亮，故宫好大，这些都是国民的骄傲，人很热情。特别推荐韩庚他们家的梅花饺子馆。
40,“首都就是首都”,第一次去北京，也摸不到哪是哪，不过首都就是首都，城市建设等各方面都很好，环境也很好，就是交通太拥堵，这也是没办法的，这是发展之趋势吗，我们这的小城市交通也很堵。希望下回还能去首都北京。
30,“博大而忙碌的城市”,博大而忙碌的城市，生活在这里，好像很有希望，又好像永远没有希望。好像什么都有，又好像什么都没有。好像有很多娱乐，又好像单调的只有工作。。。。。。门外的水泥柱子仿佛都是压力。。。。
40,“北京”,我喜欢北京，不光是她的古老；还有她的现代；古代帝王将相的乐园，今天人们的首都；不一样的历史，不一样的感觉；时代的变迁没有磨灭的古老北京的辉煌历史。我爱北京，就像小时候唱过的那首歌。。。。
50,“北京首都”,胡同文化呈现了中国的文化，希望胡同文化能延续下去。因为这是一个城市的象征！北京的古董建筑永远是老一辈人的文化象征，我非常喜欢北京的文化！
40,“好”,人文景观好，首都文化氛围好，就是人较多些，不过我还是喜欢我们的祖国，下次去参观一下北京世博园及奥运水立方及鸟巢。
40,“好”,作为首都，北京无论是旅游，还是住宿还是饮食都达到了比较高的进度，只是交通还是比较令人烦躁，过多的交通堵塞让人比较烦躁
50,“Die Reise wert”,"Pekin ist auf jeden Fall eine Reise wert und man kann dortmehr als ein Woche verbringen ohne sich zu langweilen.Es ist eine verhaltnismassig grune Stadt, in der man sich leicht in einem Park erholen kann, ausserdem ist das Fahrrad wohl dasbeste Verkehrsmittel. Ich empfehle : auch wenn die Hotelangebotesehr verlockend sind , ist es wesentlich bereichender sich ein Zimmer in einem Courtyard House - also in einem Hutong zu mieten. Die Architektur und der Stadtebau sind sehr beeindruckend. Man sollte auch keine Angst vor eventuellen Sprachproblemen haben - man kommt immer durch."
40,“北京三日游”,曾经有组织去北京三日游，免费的，于是我就收拾包袱去了。路线是故宫，天安门，军事博物馆，长城...一看就是给初次来的人看的，相当的没有技术含量。住在一个五环外的2星级宾馆，天天做大客车赶场子，和一群外地人挤着看景点。真的不好...
50,“超爱的地方~向往啊”,很多人都理解不了我们北方人对于北京的向往，其实我也说不出到底是怎么回事的，可能就是一种家乡情结吧，听着京片子就是觉得亲切，有同学问：你不怕沙尘暴啊？其实北方人早习惯了凛冽的寒风啦~~
30,“北京”,初次到北京，是因为出差火车中转，没有太多的时间，看看同学是必须的。景色没有看，感觉大街都和长春的重庆路一样，哪里都那么繁华。还有就是同学电话通知我到XX桥等她，结果，我看到一个桥就等在那里了，结果搞错，抬眼一望，确实有很多桥呢！
50,“在北京你永远不会无聊！”,北京好吃的好玩的好处都有，文化、娱乐、休闲活动样样全~要逛街可以选择崇文门的新世界、西直门的动物园、西单、王府井，还有东南四环和机场附近的奥特莱斯，国际品牌都是超低价哦~后海的酒吧以及锣鼓巷的小店都很有特色~老北京小吃到处都是，但是真正要吃最正宗最地道的小吃还是要找北京的朋友们啦，家里的爷爷奶奶们做的才是最好吃的哩~~
40,“老北京九门小吃”,之前听好友说了那里的蛮地道的，因为吃就要吃地道的嘛。在后海一个小胡同里，建筑很古老也很吸引人。进门口有一个捏糖人的老爷爷。进去后买了卡就开始自选。炸酱面、豆腐脑、驴打滚、烧饼。价格还算公道吧。吃的蛮不错的，还有戏看。我很喜欢那些古朴的桌子凳子。特有味。
40,“北京大都市”,不知不觉在北京已经有8年之久了，去过的地方也很多，好玩的地方确实是太多了，但是就别趁节假日出去玩，游玩的人太多了，简直就是出去看人了，希望想来的朋友，最好能避开旅游高峰期，这样才能玩的开心、愉快。
50,“有国际大都市的水准”,在我眼中国际大都市的水准，就是白天堵车，晚上还是一样堵车，前几天，我晚上10点回家，竟然还要堵车，应为有个大商场搞活动，据说是国际一流的品牌发布，哎！！！！！！！
40,“北京印象”,到底不愧是中国的行政中心，壮观、大气是一贯的风格。欣赏并向往着。还有那最具代表性的胡同，约上三五好友，脚踏自行车穿梭其中，尤其是每天的清晨，惬意安静且满足~
50,“赞首都”,每年都会去首都北京一两次，每次的感觉都不同，总有意外的惊喜。现代与古典相结合，凸显了中华民族博大精深的文化底蕴，让人有回家的温馨。
50,“北京的美”,天安门，是我的向往。在今年的暑假里，我去了北京，哪里天安门非常的大，绿化好还有一些文明古迹，我希望有机会我还去北京去我的梦想，就这些了。
50,“北京”,是个好地方，要多去看看，真的很好，很美丽的地方，中国之首都，实在太美丽了，有宏伟的皇宫，古老的长城，颐和园。还有圆明园，有很多古籍。
50,“好地方绝对值得去”,我是在北京上学的，北京市个绝对的好地方。历史遗迹有长城天安门等，自然风景优美的有龙虎山。更好的是北京的交通很方便很便宜。北京人都热别热情。在大街上不会走了找个人来问问你一定就知道怎么走了。北京真的是一个人性化的魅力城市，值得一去
50,“颐和园”,颐和园山清水秀，风光旖旎，长廊、万寿山、石舫、十七孔桥处处让人流连往返。特别是夏天到，约情人红粉知己，荡舟水面，使人如醉如痴心旷神怡。
50,“干净清洁，安全方便”,如今的北京街道干净整洁，交通四通八达，公共设施完善，各地美食共享，绿化美化环境优美，天空晴朗空气清新，变化翻天覆地，非常喜欢这个地方。
50,“一个现代与古典相结合的城市。”,一个现代与古典相结合的城市。故宫、天安门、、长城、颐和园...以及后海，可以吃到酸奶冻，我常常在想，生活在北京的人们是幸福的。
40,“北京，典型的方格子城市”,两次去北京，一次纯属旅游，一次是为了追寻梦想，长城，故宫，颐和园，北大清华，无一不留下深刻印象，重要的是北京冬天恢弘的萧索与大气，是南方城市所没有的，也许我永远也没有机会在北京工作了，但是北京，这两个字，已经包含一切···
40,“北京很好”,到北京玩，那里的人都会很热情，无论在公交上，还是在路上遇到的人们都非常的热情。感觉很温暖！祖国的大家庭就是不一样。
50,“北京西站附近的那家汉庭”,这家酒店很不错，离西站很近，服务好，就是离地铁站远了点。不过晚上挺安静的，很容易入睡。网速也可以，能满足上网的需要。
40,“景点太多了，必须做足功课”,北京有着深厚的文化底蕴又兼备现代的时尚气息，景点太多，面积太大，不做足功课的话，会很不尽兴的。就如住宿吧，要充分考虑与想去游玩的景点的距离，不然会将大量的时间花在地铁或公交上。
40,“传统与现代的交融”,初识北京，感觉到的是一个政治中心的氛围。细细品味之后，其中的传统文化的底蕴浮现眼前，喜欢这种有历史的感觉；而她的另一面，那种极富现代感的国际大都市的形象也能让人流连，总之来到北京，那种传统与现代的交融的感觉是在其他地方难以寻觅的……
40,“漂亮”,北京是很多人没去过都渴望去的，是因为它好，天安门广场，前门，故宫，颐和园等等，真是壮观，美丽，每一条街道都是宽敞明亮，走在路上的心情都不一样，每个人生活在那样的城市，也是积极向上的，所以那也是很多人发展事业的好地方。
50,“my home”,我喜欢北京的胡同喜欢北京的大河 我喜欢我们家门口的卢沟桥和她桥底下流过的每一滴水我爱我的北京因为他有他独特的胡同子韵味我喜欢我认识的北京人我爱他们嘴里说出的儿化音我爱他们骂出的每一句脏话和他们吃饭喝酒要的大腰子我爱这个被很多人不齿的外地人的北京因为他是我的北京 我爱的 我童年的 纯净的北京
50,“one night in 北京”,我爱北京天安门，天安门前太阳升.....北京真好~！只是，点评很麻烦.......长城，故宫，颐和园...天坛，白塔，动物园。还算押韵吧？！总之，我爱北京，可惜我不在北京，保卫首都，保卫北京，就看你们的了
40,“大都会的风范”,我都过许多次北京，每次去都有新的发现、新的感受，尤其在今年9月份到北京出差，我抽了一天的时间去奥林匹克公园游览，更感到北京是一个大都市......
40,“北京夜生活”,今天是11。11光棍節。北京有很多值得夜生活的地方！比如3里屯的酒吧街，CBD的夜景，王府井的步行街，天安门城楼上还有后海的夜生活！
40,“喜欢”,喜欢北京的文明古迹 ，文化氛围，人文气息，北京来自各地的小吃也很多 ，人也很热情 ，呵呵 ，希望再有机会和朋友们多去观光路游。
50,“我的家乡我爱她”,北京市我的首都。大多数人的外地游客会认为北京物价高，北京到处都是黑导游，骗钱。作为首都人我想说，北京有悠久的历史，北京人热情好客。那些骗人的商家真的大大大部分都不是北京人。。胡同里的大爷大妈热情好客。北京小吃美味无比。。
50,“中国首都，和财富”,环境干净，卫生，人员服务热情好客。相互尊重，团结友爱。北京像征着中国的国门，是中国政治和经济的首要地带。北京是中国的骄傲！
50,“北京之旅”,这次北京之行，我们去了几处，主要有北京天安门，北京八达岭长城和北京故宫博物院，站在天安门广场上感到自己的渺小和劳动人民的伟大，长城更是我国古代劳动人民的结晶，还有故宫的伟大！
40,“爱恨交加的北京”,北京，是个围城，很多人想进来，很多人想出去。北京是一个包容性很强的城市，这里有形形色色的人，外国人很多，中国人也很多，各个阶层，各种类型，各种素质的人都有，北京向一个大熔炉，将所有这些人都包容了进来。很多国来北京旅游，都必去故宫、长城、颐和园、天坛等地，这些已成为北京文化的一部分，很多外国人来北京也去这些地方，不过他们更喜欢去什刹海、南锣鼓巷、王府井这些有着浓重老北京特色的地方。新旧交融，传统文明和现代文明交相辉映，相映成趣。北京近年来，还给人以高房价和“首堵”的印象，交通堵塞，使北京成为巨大的停车场；高昂的房价让很多想来北京定居的人望而却步。然而这并不影响北京作为政治、文化、旅游中心在人们心中的影响力和地位。随着越来越多的地铁线路的贯通和城市规划进程的推进，这些问题将逐步得到解决。北京的小吃很多，南来北往的都有，鼓楼那边有炒肝和爆肚，还有难喝的豆汁。什刹海有糖葫芦，南锣鼓巷有宫廷奶酪。有名的小吃街，王府井小吃街每天人山人海，热闹非凡。北京也有很多可以购物的好去处，有句话说，有钱人去新光天地，白领去东方新天地，穷人一般去西单。现在还有动物园、木樨园、奥特莱斯、上品折扣、天兰尾货等一些淘宝的好去处。高昂的物价、不涨的工资、巨大的压力让处在这里的一部分人身心疲惫，也让一部分如鱼得水，无论你爱北京，还是不爱北京。北京欢迎你。
50,“首都北京”,现代化的大都市，权利与金钱的聚集地，只要呆着钱来旅游，没有玩不高兴的！切记，要低调，不要张扬过度，这里不比外地，你爸是李刚也没有用的，因为还有很多李刚的爸在首都~~~
40,“心脏地带”,到了北京给我的第一印象是雄伟壮观 现代化大都市环绕着老北京味儿十足的四合院京韵文化发挥到了极致 在北京已经有段日子了 唯一感觉美中不足的就是拥堵 貌似所有国家的大城市里时间都是最贵的 人人都低着头想自己的事情 没有放轻松来看看周围的风景 给我的感觉北京就是一个适合旅游不适合居住的地方呢
50,“繁华的城市”,不愧为中国的首都，车水马龙，高楼林立，超大型的购物广场，琳琅满目的商品让人眼花缭乱，还有漂亮的美眉……呵呵！！！我向往的地方。
50,“很好”,非常喜欢这个城市来到这真是不虚此行过一段时间我会和家人一起再来一次，我还会告诉我的朋友，让他们也来这旅友！！
20,“人のマナーが悪い。歴史的建造物が多いのに残念”,歴史的な建造物も多く、とても楽しめる場所だと思いますが、中国人のマナーが悪くとても嫌な思いを何度もしました。タクシー/ホテルから乗ることをお勧めします。それ以外は地下鉄で。路上で捕まえるタクシーはもちろん中国語しかできませんし、とても態度が悪く、不安さえ覚えました。観光地/中国人観光客が我先に、と平気で人を押しのけるため、何度か階段などで危険な思いをしました。
50,“一个充满古老气息的都市”,在这里你可以享受到来自世界各地的美食和外交的风采，尤其是在燕莎商圈。北京，欢迎您，我想这句话，真的很有味道。我想你会来的。
50,“北京发展太快了”,我去了北京很多次，但是很次去的感觉都不一样，每一次去都有很大的变化，首都的人，很热情。故宫也改变了，重新修过的，没有原来的那种感觉，总之有很多的地方都是不断的在进步在发展，希望祖国有明天更美好！
30,“好吃好玩好挤……”,北京作为政治经济文化中心，有着悠久的历史，玩的地方多以名胜古迹为主，带有浓重的历史气息，吃的方面就汇聚全球，想吃什么都能找到，特爽啊！！！唯一让我郁闷的就是人太多，o(︶︿︶)o 唉，车多人多，玩个地方得走半天……
50,“北京越来越发达”,看着北京的高楼大厦，看着道路上飞驰的车，北京的变化简直太大了，真为我们中国感到自豪，为我们的首都北京感到骄傲
50,“哈瓦伊”,是个让我激情澎湃的城市。以前总是记忆中的样子，在那里的生活和旅游让我知道，其实真正的崇拜和敬仰，是每时每刻当你站立在天安门城楼前就会油然而生的
40,“文化都市、北京”,中国の中でも、文化にふれるチャンスがたくさんあります。天安門はなんどみても圧巻されるし、すこし足を伸ばせば歴史の授業で学んだことが実際にみれます。非常に安全なのではじめて中国へ行く人にはおすすめです
50,“赞”,完美的城市，文明古都，无时不刻的传达着那里特有的人文气息。雄伟的八达岭长城，庄重的天安门，历史悠久的故宫让人流连忘返。
40,“北京印象及期待”,北京集古老，悠久与创新与一体，政治文化中心使得它发展的尤为迅猛，日新月异。2008年的北京奥运会让世界认识了北京，就让北京走向世界。
40,“历史底蕴，历史气息浓重”,地地道道的京味话，让我感觉听起来很舒服，特别是看到北京的老四合院，建筑格局别具匠心，想起了电视中的老北京人的生活。北京的风景挺不错的，天安门，后海，恭王府，都是值得一去的地方。值得推荐。
50,“正在腾飞的国际大都市”,北京是个动感的城市，因为它处于地震带上，不过比东京安全的多 O(∩_∩)O~；她是个集自然风光与文物古迹于一身的城市；是一个传统文化和现代文明融洽共存的城市；是真正的政治、商业、文化、教育中心，一个高速发展的国际化大都市！
50,“中国风”,北京的所有东东对于我来说都非常的新鲜、亲切，从这里可以看到许多中国历史的兴衰、历史的痕迹，此外，还可以品尝到许多人间美味，是个不错的旅游目的地
50,“因为是我们国家的首都，所以非常热爱。”,第一次来北京，感觉是个陌生而又繁华的城市。我是和同学们一起来的北京，来的那一刻成了实实在在的北漂一族。我爱妳北京。
50,“很不错”,北京去过很多次了，感觉很不错，大气，有吸引力。很向往，打算明年有时间再去一次，租个单车，畅游在老北京的胡同里，别有一番滋味。。。
50,“北京很好”,北京作为首都，无论从哪方面看都很好：饮食、旅游、观光都是个好地方，北京的天气也很好。作为全国政治经济文化中心，值得大家去。值得大家去。值得大家去。
50,“首都”,来的时候可以参加旅游团的北京三日游或者四日游之类的，一定要公交旅游公司的正规旅行社，参观时不要掉队，北京太大丢了就麻烦了，呵呵。
50,“首都”,"很美丽的首都,中国的骄傲! 交通便利!站在天安门前升国旗的感觉无比的自豪和骄傲,美丽的故宫,雄伟的长城,让人留恋往返^^^^"
30,“太拥挤”,太拥挤了，堵车，一出门就是大半天。不喜欢，虽然每天都生活在这个城市。基础生活没有舒服感。其它日常的生活品质倒还是可以保证，北方人居多，适合北方人生活。呵呵地域之见
40,“Für mich wie in einem Traum...”,"Peking ist für mich einen sehr schöne Stadt.Shopping ist überall sehr gut möglich.Mein Tipp: Leihen Sie sich ein Fahrrad und fahren in der Früh (5-6 Uhr) in einen Park, dort erleben Sie das wahre China mit Morgengymnastik und Gesellschaftstänzen...!"
50,“在北京感觉特别好”,在北京感觉特别好，尤其是二环内的老胡同，特别的有感觉，适合徒步旅游一个下午。还有后海，晚上的酒吧，真的是特别棒，值得一去。
40,“中国大城市里面唯一一个让人想要停留的。”,北京是个很特别的城市，刚刚来的或许不习惯，但是越来越喜欢这里。归属感强，人文气息很浓厚。景点多，可游性强。让人想一直呆下去。不错。
30,“北京的交通”,北京的车辆增长太快了，交通完全没增长迹象！如果仍然按照这个速度增长下去的话，限号的对策都不能解决北京的交通问题了。
40,“享受北京的古都风情”,北京的景区非常之多，无论是文物古迹，风景名胜或是游乐场都是全国著名的，享受北京独特的旅游风情的同时，必须要忍受每个景点都是挤挤攘攘的人，噪杂~！！
40,“华北最干净城市”,我认为北京不错，有山有水，环境也不错，是养人的地方，另外冬天不冷，（因为室内都有暖气），夏天不热，是我见过的华北最干净的城市
50,“不一样了的北京”,我1996年去了一次，2001年去了一次，2008年再去了一次，举办奥运之后的北京真的不一样了，以前的灰灰的，现在到了深秋都还是到处都是五颜六色的，美！以后还要带儿子再去一次。
40,“整体印象很好”,城市规模很大，道路宽敞，交通便利，北京人很nice吃住都比上海的便宜很多，购物环境不错，旅游景点也都很漂亮就是不管什么季节北京永远人多。
50,“梦中之城”,北京，融合古典与现代，就如同奇怪的童年少年中年于一身。不成枚举的旅游景点让这座城市始终吸引着众多的目光。生活节奏不紧不慢，悠闲中透着紧迫，但特殊的休闲让你欲罢不能。要是北京的决策者可以找到好的办法治理交通，无疑，北京将成为世界上最有吸引力的城市，这一次没有之一。
40,“北京”,北京现在是古今中外风景到处可见到美。地铁线路四通八达，交通便利。全国特色产品到处可见，首都设施与其它城市确实是无法相比。
50,“文化氛围浓厚”,北京，这个我毕业之后生活了4年的地方。中国的首都，文化中心，政治中心，教育中心。有许多的事情值得回忆，我的青春挥洒在这个神奇的地方。
30,“北京北京”,北京太大了，真的太大了，暑假在它的里面穿梭行走经常会感觉自己仿若尘该，有这么多人为梦想或者生存在挣扎在奋斗，有些人成功了，有些人消失了，这座城市承载了太多意义和情节，我想他不属于我，但不妨碍我欣赏他。
50,“北京”,初次来到北京，就被北京的时尚动感所吸引，靓丽的外貌，喧哗热闹的街市、无处不彰显着北京这个中国首都的繁华场景，北京，有时间我还去找你
50,“北京的公交很便宜，退卡很烦”,北京的公交用公交卡很便宜，但是退卡很烦，特别是有损坏的卡，一定要到公交总站才能退，公交总站很远，而且人很多，要是以后退卡点多点就好了
50,“北京人文景观好”,经过和谐社会洗礼，尤其是奥运会召开，整座城市焕发出了无比多目的光辉。相信在不久的将来，北京一定能够成为全世界最美丽的城市之一。
40,“北京-首都-名副其实”,没办法，北京太大了，转几天都没转过一个熟悉的地方，看了很多名胜古迹，新兴建筑，比如天安门，故宫，鸟巢，水立方，长城，天坛。。。。。。。都觉得很不错，只是堵车太厉害了， 如果这个解决的话，5颗星是没问题的，呵呵
50,“中国游首选地”,"大国之都,国际焦点,历史名城.积千年古韵风华,聚万方时尚精髓,藏琅琅山川之秀,荡浩浩中华之魂.游之,揽之,思之,慨之.吾生之幸之."
50,“北京”,北京不愧为之首都，很繁华，道路很干净，生活质量高，工作效率高。北京的人们热情友好，率真！北京的景色优美，旅游景点众多，服务一流。
40,“错落之美 北京”,北京给我的感觉就是既有一座国际化大都市的时尚、现代的气息，又有作为一个文明古都的历史的厚重之美。唯一美中不足的，是那里的生活节奏看起来非常得快。
50,“挺好玩的”,北京的景点很多 还有粉多的粉多的好吃的好玩的 最著名的当然是全聚德的烤鸭了 那才叫一个好吃.尤其是北京的夜景真的爆漂亮.
40,“旅游的好地方”,旅游的确是个好地方，就是交通比较麻烦，还有就是空气不是很理想，想了解历史的人去北京那是错不了的。还有就是北京的长城到了北京一定要去哦。
40,“只要你有一双善于发现美的眼睛”,对观光客，怎样利用最短时间，最快了解一个城市的风貌，最大程度饱眼福，可是一门大学问，要涉及数学、地图学、系统工学、最优化方法等等等等。没有两把刷子，做个合格玩家还真不容易！很多人来到北京就直奔故宫、天坛、颐和园，跟这些有名有姓的景点拍完合照，就打道回府了。回去闷头想想，觉得北京不过如此。北京可是800年古都，一出无时无刻不在上演的精彩大戏，故宫、天坛、颐和园是这个大戏里比较显眼的明星，可是别忽略了更多深藏不露的角儿。再者，明星也是戏里的明星，不能脱离剧情大环境单挑出来？否则，明星也没了光彩。话又说回来，这出大戏，一般人又看到了多少？香港有双层观光巴士，坐上去畅游港岛很拉风，杰出人士乘双层巴士环游还是一种荣誉。这样的拉风一样可以在北京实现。北京的双层公交线路有大约20条，不同线路各有特色。来北京的朋友，逮着空了，也不妨坐坐双层公交，来次别致的巡游京城体验。这里简单推荐经典线路——800路。800路沿着京城二环跑一圈，分内环和外环两条线路，内环顺时针路，外环逆时针转。沿着二环路一圈转下来可不近，有30多公里。不堵车大约一个小时。建议在始发站上车，坐到二层最前面，沿途美景一个也落不下。800路外环始发站是南二环边上的永定门长途汽车站，内环始发站是左安路，可以根据自己的方便选择内外环，景色基本相同。以800路外环为例，从永定门长途汽车站发出，沿线的主要风光有：南二环：护城河、永定门和先农坛、天坛、方庄大社区东二环：龙潭湖、东便门角楼和明城墙遗址公园、建国门西南角的古观象台、大公司总部云集的朝阳门南北大街北二环：雍和宫、东城胡同保护区、德胜门箭楼、积水潭（即西海，后海一部分）、汇通祠和郭守敬纪念馆、新街口老商街西二环：西直门地标西环广场、梅兰芳大剧院、官园花鸟鱼虫市场、白塔寺的白塔、金融街、中央音乐学院、西便门城墙和角楼、北京城区现存最古老的建筑天宁寺塔、广安门北京城肇始纪念碑再回南二环：大观园，最后，即将回到终点站时，会经过陶然亭公园，高君宇、石平梅在这里长眠。北京的双层公交线路还有很多，除了环行二环的800路，还有环行三环的特8路。其余的都是非环行线路。辨认双层公交线路的方法：凡是“特”字开头的线路，都是双层车，如特2、特3等。此外，23、50、54、72、83、84、85、319也都是双层车。在乘坐双层车时，可以选择非高峰时段，再就是了解始发站的位置，以尽量获得良好的旅行体验。
50,“如果再选择一次，我要在北京上大学”,选择在哪里上大学，这座城市的文化内涵是我考虑的首要因素。北京丰富的人文自然景观，数不胜数的五百强公司总部，古老与现代的交融，让我流连其中，乐不思蜀。
50,“服务”,服务很好！都赶上空姐了！还有东西吃的，信阳去北京8-9个小时就到了…，速度蛮快！ 就是不知道到时候 高铁速度怎么样？听说比这快哦！
50,“北京天安门”,世界上最大的广场，早上6点起床去看天安门升旗，顺便去东单王府井、东方广场转转，再去西单商场、西单大悦城转转非常好玩的，隔天休息一番再去长城爬爬
50,“首都很美~”,很喜欢故宫的建筑，喜欢明清的历史~喜欢北京的生活气氛，繁忙中又休闲~去过一次，以后肯定还会去的~还没去过长城，我一定会去的~
40,“很好”,去的时候人别较多。。。不过总体来说还是很好。。。喜欢后海的酒吧一条街。。。建议到那里住四合院。。。还是很有老北京的感觉的。。。小吃非常不错
50,“说不出的浓香”,那次去北京是跟旅行团去的，虽然我们自由逛逛的时间不长，但记忆已深留于心。厚积薄发，像一杯暖酒，蕴育了百年的浓香，悄悄地静止，直到微风拂过，才淡淡地绽放芳香。在那里，每一棵树，都撑起一段岁月的青葱；每一块石板，都留下一个朝代的纹路；每一个脸庞，都写着一个都城的味道。有繁华，没有喧嚣；有古朴，没有落后。未曾枯死，只有永存。北京，北京，风沙掩盖不了你如水的媚态，霓虹眩晕取代不了夜点橘灯，在你的怀里，找不到离开的理由。
40,“我眼中的北京”,灿烂的历史，丰富的文化，让人垂涎的美食，历史和现代化在北京同时上演，长城，燕山等它的郊区感受一年四季明显的差异，尤其是在秋冬。
30,“太过拥挤”,人太多，到哪里都是拥挤的，也许是出门的时间是高峰期，但是塞车太厉害，居然能塞2小时，都不敢出门了，不过个人爱上了北京地铁
50,“北京值得每个人去的地方”,北京，一个我们既熟悉又陌生的地方，又是一个你去过都会喜欢的地方，那里的名胜古迹令人留连忘返，令人真的百去不厌！
50,“中国的首都啊”,在北京生活了短暂的一年，感觉就一个字，人多，呵呵。不愧是中国的首都啊，到处都是一片生机勃勃的样子，不过感觉污染很严重，不是个适合居住养生的城市。
40,“很安全，节奏快，公共服务水平高”,在北京经常能看到警察、武警、特警，安全应该是很有保证的，但是节奏很快，生活压力较大。北京的公交系统很发达，而且乘车非常便宜，公园门票也很便宜，公厕非常多，很好！
40,“沙丁鱼城市的魅力”,这是一座拥挤而繁忙的城市，街道上的车辆川流不息，永远没有停歇的时候。很多很多的人，都渴望在这个城市扎根，落脚，可是并不是每个人都可以做到的。不过，这个城市还是有它特有的魅力的，浓郁的文化氛围，都让每一个生活在这里的人感受到了浓浓的京韵，古色古香的四合院，老北京的京腔京调，都可以还原一个老北京，中国人，浓浓的眷恋。
50,“喜欢这里的一切”,即使这里有超高的房价，可以这里的文化，交通，信息，城市对外地人的接纳，最重要的是无处不见的素质和文明，不是一下子能够说清的
40,“很美”,很美很强大的中国首都，有着很多的中国气息，景点非常之多，也很好玩，去过一次，玩的很开心，很想在去，如果有时间的话再去
50,“北京，我难忘的旅程”,北京是个非常不错的地方，到那里，第一件要做的事情就是看早晨的升国旗了，后海，长城，都很不错！！明年继续去北京那边！呵呵！
50,“精华--京华”,我非常喜欢北京这个城市，有着古典美和现代美，每次到北京都特别喜欢再晚上去逛逛那繁华的城市，灯红酒绿，让人陶醉，同样我也忘不了，曾经的大杂院，充满着欢乐和温馨，每天早上清脆的叫卖声，总是像一个特色小曲不断在耳边回味。。。。
50,“北京旅遊”,總的來說一路順利，看到長城終於體會到那句不到長城非好漢的含義，給人以向上的感覺，到嘞長城后悔洗掉你的頹廢，這次旅行非常的有意義
30,“第一印象”,人多。繁华，忙碌，人多，生活压力大，景点多多多！！！到处都可以看到外籍人士。有很多好玩的地方，不过王府井大街里的特产什么的就不要买了，都是骗人的，不好吃。
50,“心向往的地方—北京”,60国庆，令人激动的日子，令人震撼的时刻。站在天安门广场就会有让人莫名的激动与兴奋。像是陶醉在中国的巨大飞速的发展之中。为祖国的繁荣昌盛感到无比自豪！那一刻让我更加感受到作为一名中国人我是如此骄傲与自豪！
50,“我眼中的北京”,这是一个很美丽很休闲的城市，特别是在即将入冬的季节走在街头，北京让你感到清新，尽管这里充溢着竞争但同样拥有更多的生存机会，我很喜欢这里。
40,“多去外面游玩一下”,北京市个好地方，哪里的风景非常好，关键词序也很好！我去过那里一次，我希望下次我还有机会去！想去北京游玩的，要叫上我。
50,“北京”,北京人民很友好，去过一次，那里人民很热情，作为我国首都，还有历史悠久的风情。真是太美丽了 只想留一点回忆，能够让我们依靠
50,“中国首都-北京”,第一次去北京是5岁的时候、当时只记得去了天安门那里、觉得很庄严。随着年龄慢慢增长，才一点一点对北京了解的更多。那是我们祖国的大心脏。我爱北京，我爱中国！！！
40,“北京人多啊”,对于北京的印象就是繁华 其次是交通 人真的很多 不过北京的景点很漂亮 大部分都是外来游客 所以节假日去北京很拥堵
50,“首都--内心最向往的地方”,北京嘛，天安门、长城、宽敞的马路、河边的垂柳，这些都是我向往的东西。生于北国的我是永远也适应不了上海这种南方城市的拥挤和嘈杂，与北京的博大宽广相比完全是两极。
40,“北京印象”,北京人的素质还是比较高，问路、打车都很热心给你指路，知道给你搞明白才放心。有的景点人太多，比如故宫、长城，配套设施对于接待能力还有些不匹配，希望今后加强。还有就是太拥堵，车太多，地铁早晚高峰的时候人更多。
40,“首都北京”,做为首都，应该是全国的典范，发展的方向，引领未来。不过现在北京还是要努力，城市建设和交通等等一些问题还很突出。不知道政府还要怎么办？？
50,“草厂胡同”,在草厂胡同可以看到很多历史久远的对联，举个例子，有什么“子孙贤族将大，兄弟睦家之肥”，也有“忠孝传千古，诗书抵万家”、“物华天宝日，人杰地灵时越看越有意思。
50,“北京印象”,因工作原因，经常出差到北京，使我有机会近距离了解首都北京的风貌。很繁华，高楼大厦林立，很现代化，公交地铁出行都很方便，旅游景点太多，小吃特别多。酒店，旅馆特多，很方便。
50,“可爱的北京”,北京是我非常熟悉和喜欢的地方，特别是天安门，每次都给我留下非常深刻的印象，唯一稍感不足的地方就是车太多了，每条道路都是那么拥挤，但是我还是非常喜欢北京。
40,“北京应该是全中国的榜样”,北京应该是全中国的榜样，而不是全中国的特例。北京建设得非常好了，但是全国还有需多地方建设得不好。应该带动全国共同发展，而不应该全国人民建北京，牺牲全国，让北京成为国中国。
50,“Peking ist eine Reise wert”,"Neben den Hauptsehenswürdigkeiten von Peking ( Verbotene Stadt, Olympiagelände, Sommerpalast, Tiamanplatz) empfielt sich ein Besuch des Yonghe Tempel. Dieser Tempel ist der grösste lamaistische Tempel außerhalb Tibet und zeugt den lamaischen Glauben in all seinen Fasetten. Aber auch die Buddafigur, welche aus einem 26 m Holzstamm geschitzt wurde und eine Gesamthöhe von 18 Metern aufweist, ist unbedingt zu besichtigen. In unmittelbarer Nähe ist der Lamatempel, wo wichtige Inschriften auf Stelen aufbewahrt werden."
40,“大气的北京”,去过北京很多次，而且跨时很长，感觉北京越来越漂亮了，特别是在举办奥运会之后，天更蓝了，空气更清新了，道路更干净了。而且北京的景点真的特别多，值得去的地方也很多。北京---不错！
20,“有关城市的记忆碎片<北京>”,以前一直很难说清楚是喜欢节后的懒散，还是讨厌假日综合症带来的诸多迟钝，这个长假却非常的不同，节日活动组织者发来的短信一下就把节后的时间给占据了，充实，快乐而且头顶上弥漫着好多潜伏很久的情绪，以至于小宇宙都在开始影响着周围的一切人与事情。。。今天就想着记录一些有关城市的记忆碎片和絮语。。。尽管我们是在一个村庄中的迷你城市中长大的孩子，并不妨碍我们对不同城市的指手画脚。。。北京是个粗糙的城市，尽管有十年一遇的大场面，我们一家还是在那个向全世界炫耀的日子，早早就去了机场，等待数小时才能被允许起飞的航班，平日频繁的地面交通管制已经到了扰民的地步，现在更好。。。升空了。。。为什么不把区域分的细致一些呢？很多时候管理者是否可以做得更好，比起上海，香港（不提东京了，多数人不喜欢那个一衣带水国家，虽然人家做的更好），信号灯的处理，路面车道的宽度，还有路边花坛里的泥巴，北京都以粗见长，是否有人研究过城市空气里的颗粒，估计比直径的话，北京也是当仁不让的粗大。。。我们小的时候对空气最坏的记忆，也无非是所门口的偶尔路过的“大解放”扬起的黄尘，可那时候都恨不得跟着车屁股在车尾的扬尘中跑个几百米，快乐而且健康。。。
40,“中国首都”,北京的气候非常干燥，去旅游的时候一定要带上足够的护肤品。去景点的时候还要带购足够的水哦。文化气息很浓，每个地方都有一段历史和一个耐人寻味的故事。
40,“Reizüberflutung”,"Also wenn man von Europa das erste mal nach Asien kommt ist es auf jeden Fall ein totaler Schock. Aber ein doch sehr interessanter Schock. Peking ist groß, größer, am größten.Übernachtet habe ich im Empereors Guard Staition ist ok und sehr schön wenn man das wahre Leben sehen will.Shoppen kann man in Peking überall wo die Touristen sind ist am teuersten also man bezahlt zum beispiel am Himmelstempel den 5fachen Preis als im normalen Leben.Leider ist man in Peking taubstumm wenn man kein Chinesisch spricht da mit aufgefallen ist das wenn die Leute mal Englisch konnten wollten sie einen übers Ohr hauen hier ist Vorsicht geboten.Generell ist Peking eine sehr sichere Stadt. Vom Straßenverkehr abgesehen wird man sich kaum einer größeren Gefahr ausgesetzt sehen, allerdings sind Touristen oft das Ziel kleiner Gaunereien und Tricks. Überall zahlt man als Tourist einen Preisaufschlag und man kann oft auch erleben, dass Verkäufer Preisschilder entfernen, sobald man sich nach dem Preis eines Artikels erkundigt. Außerhalb von Märkten sollte man in der Regel nicht mehr als die Hälfte bezahlen, auf Märkten sind die Anfangspreise noch sehr viel teurer (bis zum zehnfachen des realistischen Preises). Generell gilt es zu verhandeln.Essen kann man fast überall sehr gut keine Angst vor den den einheimischen Restaurants kann kein Wort Chinesisch und war immer dort essen, preiswert und gut."
50,“北京北京”,首都，中国的政治中心，有这丰富的人文文化和物质文化，有着丰富的世界文化遗产，里面真的很深奥，无穷的力量吸引真我，身为一个中国人我自豪，祖国会更强大，富强。
40,“除了人太多，其他都好”,我喜欢北京。觉得那是一个干净的城市。北京人的素质也特别的高，不像有些地方的人素质不高，北京人也特别直爽。好吃的也很多。
50,“首都北京”,北京是中国的首都，北京是中国文明城市的象征，我们相信北京永远会昂首挺胸的走下去，我们永远支持你，北京加油！中国加油！！
50,“心目中城市”,北京已将去过很多次，喜欢他古老的城墙，喜欢故宫的庄严，喜欢在故宫中遐想那过去。。。。。，它又有新的容貌，3环，4环，5环，代表着它的高速发展，高楼坐坐起，不如上海那样让人带着现代国际都市的压抑，！
40,“环境卫生”,环境卫生有待于提高，很多地方垃圾满天飞，交通拥挤，环境卫生有待于提高，很多地方垃圾满天飞，交通拥挤， 进一步改善环境卫生
50,“北京值得去一趟”,不要跟团走，自己买张地图，顺着老街走，有很多地道的小吃，不自己找发现不了，但是有些是外地人吃不习惯的，例如炒肝我就吃不下去，看着就不行了。
30,“首都其实也就那样...”,繁华绚丽，也喧闹无比...看来俺这种小城市长大的孩子，多少难以承受这份绚烂...溜了趟后海798南锣鼓巷，装了会文艺小青年，虽然我语文经常不及格..不生活在这里，总是感觉自己是异乡人，木有归属感。。
30,“去了一次北京，再也不想去了。”,去了一次北京，再也不想去了，都说北京的烤鸭很出名，一打听，得，司机大哥都说是全聚德的号，去了吃一次也就那个味，还买了两只真空包装的，回来后那个味差的啊，别提了，还有王府井卖的果脯，真是TMD烂，回来一吃竟然发现有活蛆，我当时就吐了，这样的场景我可不想对外宣传，但是也毕竟是祖国的首都，窗口啊，要是外国人去了，还不得笑话死啊。。。。我说的都是真话。
40,“玩家的天堂”,在北京，不论想玩儿什么，都能够很容易找到同道中人，而且高人比比皆是，不到能玩儿的尽兴，能结交不同的朋友，还能学到不少专业知识，很高兴在那里生活了4年，值！
40,“环境气候建筑”,这边的建筑和生活环境都还好也是个有的玩有得欣赏的地方、名胜古迹，潮流前线都齐全，唯一不足是这里的气候有些干燥，有些让我不好适应，
40,“Lærerig øjenåbner”,"Noget af det mest karakteristiske ved Beijing er blandingen af nyt og gammelt. Man kan næsten fornemme sammenstødet mellem to generationer. Midt i byens støj, højhuse og firmaer, der skyder op alle steder findes pludselig en kæmpe park eller den forbudte by med ældgamle paladser og ophøjet ro. Kineserne har desuden en ydmyghed, fleksibilitet og upoleret nysgerrighed, som ikke findes i den vestlige kultur. Åbner man øjnene rigtigt for byen og dens omegn, så er der læring at hente. Muren er en meget storslået oplevelse. Begejstringen overraskede mig. Det er størrelsesforholdene, proportionerne, naturen og det kæmpe bygningsværk."
50,“旅游方便”,旅游地方巨多，而且都很便宜交通方便，地铁基本上都覆盖到了不过吃东西不符合南方人口味吧尤其是北京特产实在是吃不习惯
50,“北京有首都”,就好象小沈阳在电视上说的一样，他的父母告诉他，在北京一定要好好演，因为北京离首都不远。一国之都，大气之貌。北京话逗，人实惠。买东西吃东西游玩的地方特别多。
40,“我喜欢的城市”,有悠久和富有内涵的文化底蕴，有热情的人们，有完善的各项城市设施，还有各色美食，美景，良好的治安，这都是我喜欢北京的理由。
50,“魅力北京”,北京市我国的首都，使我们旅游的最佳城市之一，在食住行游购娱上给我们很大的便捷，喜欢美丽的北京夜景，万里长城，满山的红叶等等。
50,“休闲”,北京是个集休闲，娱乐，购物，度假的好地方。购物有大的批发市场和大商场。度假可以感受城市的喧嚣也可以体会郊区的宁静与自然
40,“欢乐首都行”,首都就是首都，现代的城市步伐，快捷的生活节奏，高楼林立，让人心中由生一种激动，欢动，和向往。天安门，故宫，王府井，西单，颐和园处处让人难忘。八达岭的雄伟，欢乐谷的激情至今还让我难以忘怀
50,“北京圆明园”,"一直以为圆明园就是那末点废墟而已,到了那里才感觉到他从前是多末的宏伟,大气.让人惊叹.漫步园林,一边感受着大清皇室走过的步道,一边呼吸着现在荷花池带来的清新,感受真的不一样..旅行,个人喜欢自助游,带上地图,哪都能去.北京地铁也非常多了.四号线圆明园站下车即到.景点门票不贵,大门10元,在门口租个解说仪就全齐了."
40,“我眼中的北京”,本是一东北人，由于种种原因，假期常在北京度过。今年暑假在北京当了一个假期的导游，对北京有了一个更深刻的了解和认识。过去常常观赏的故宫，长城，颐和园竟成了无法忘却的记忆。刚刚当导游时，带的是国外团特紧张，还好北京多是古老而沉寂了的风韵，才是的我心中有细微的放松。现在我在学校里，品着江年水乡的风采，还真的很怀念北京的壮阔。若各位喜欢文化气息浓厚的四合院，胡同文化，你可以来北京。若你想观览现今中国的壮阔，你亦可以来北京。当你看到鸟巢，水立方，过街楼的金融中心，及首都似雄鹰的飞机场时，你会更爱我们的中国的。
50,“北京的冬天很美，尤其是下雪的北京”,下雪天的美好时代就在北京的冬天夜晚，走在路上你会感到寒气逼人，但同时你也会享受到爱人从手心传递过来的温暖，是约会的好地方，我自己推荐
40,“观光旅游好地方”,旅游景点比较多，地下地铁比较方便，但是地上交通就不行，拥挤呀，而且住宿的地方比较贵。来北京之前，希望朋友们事先找好地方，带好交通指示的工具。。。
40,“北京市”,因为在天津 离北京较近 去的次数还算多 感觉 北京不是一个适宜居住的地方 人太多 交通太拥挤 不过地铁还是很方便的 适合偶尔去那购物 游玩兼吃吃喝喝 记得有一次去看演唱会 之前在群里咨询北京的朋友说我们住的地方离演唱会地点近不近 告诉我挨着很近 结果打车都开了半个多小时 这就是北京人所谓的很近了 我想他们都已经习惯这样的距离了。。
30,“行走”,从第一次到第三次，在北京的我总是在不停地走着。秋天的北京，碧蓝碧蓝的天，耀眼的太阳，和长年被厚厚云层遮挡的盆地气候的鲜明相比，无法不让我爽朗。爱上一个城市很简单，一个人，一个理由，一种感觉；留在一个城市，却需要更多。当媒体一如既往地说着逃离北上广深的理由和数据时，那些留下来的人代表的是怎样的意义呢？我，一个再普通不过的游客，无论什么意义也不过是对我而言。这里没有四川的滋润，却能让我看到北方平原的辽阔；这里没有南方海洋层次渐进的蓝色韵调，但能让我在狂风肆虐中恣意释放；这里有和我无法遗忘的城市一样的蓝天，这里也有让我为之陶醉的公共阅读环境（一点没错，这完全可以成为一个城市的文化高度）。对年轻人来说，一个能够提供机会的城市是最大魅力。所以，留下来的人永远是更多的。北京，期待下一次，能够发现更多。
50,“北京”,以最卑微的身份呼吸最伟大的空气，北京，每一个中国人心底最后的秘密。故宫隐匿在现代人思古之幽情最骄傲和最哀伤的记忆里。
40,“北京东古岩村游记”,10月5日上午我们来到了北京西郊的东古岩村，著名元代的词人马致远所写的千古绝唱“枯藤老树昏鸦，小桥流水人家，古道西风瘦马，夕阳西下，断肠人在天涯。”提到的古道就在这里。我们看到了四百多年前商队的马匹在古道上留下的蹄窝，真的很震撼，这是当年连接北京和西安之间的唯一道路，还有摩崖石刻，据说是晋代的石刻，还有待考证。接着，我们又去了马致远故居，当年马致远仕途不畅，就隐居在这里，因北京秋高气爽，整个村落古朴，静谧，树影婆娑，炊烟袅袅，徜徉在夕阳下的小桥流水之间，没有词中所描述的苍凉感，反倒是有置身于江南某个小村落错觉。
50,“好”,中国的首都 有好多好吃的 好玩的 有天安门 故宫 颐和园 圆明园 长城 北海 香山 现在就是去香山看红叶的时候 满山的红叶 特别的漂亮
50,“长城”,是一个很值得留恋的地方，作为一名中国人不去很可惜，古人非常伟大，在没有任何机械设备的情况下，建造出如此美丽的建筑。十分非伟大
50,“北京”,这座城市用她千年的历史包容着一切```大气而优雅，沉稳又富有活力，琉璃厂 故宫 园林 长城 胡同 无不展示着其文化底蕴```怎一个美字了得```
50,“浓厚的文化气息”,喜欢北京的安静 喧闹 古典 美丽 北京一个完美的城市 喜欢这里的景点每一个地方都展现了北京的特点 喜欢北京 喜欢一切
40,“游览天安门”,保定离北京非常之近，有时间的话，总想抽时间把北京的景点逛完，可北京的景点实在是太多了......趁着假期带孩子去天安门看升国旗。毕竟是首都北京，夜里还有公交车，这让孩子兴奋不已。到达天安门时才凌晨2点半，我们只好在天安门的外围溜达，周围很少有休息的椅子，我看到有的游客只好席地而坐。好不容易开始安检，我们终于进入了天安门广场，等待着升旗的时刻。现场看升国旗仪式的人很多，人们都各自找着自认为最佳的观旗地点场面有些乱。建议北京旅游局能不能在天安门周围设置一些简易的座椅，让参观的人们有个休息的地方，毕竟天安门的客流量是很大的。再有在保证安全的基础上，是否能在广场设置些临时看台，看完升旗后就能立刻推走的那种。这样可以保证在天安门的游客都能清楚的看到整个升旗的过程。天安门是我们每个中国人的骄傲，衷心希望它建设的更加美好，让每一个到过天安门的人都不虚此行。
40,“德云社”,德云社 每次都没去成 进场票真的很难没买到 看到报道德云社要搬迁了 不太明确搬到哪里 知情人士看到着我的信息告知我下 谢谢！
50,“首都好呀”,马路干净，人们热情，尊老爱幼，警察细心等等......天安门雄伟壮观，盛大辉煌。毛主席遗体展厅没能进去，遗憾呀。总之，一切都好。因为那是我们的首都！
40,“可以一看再看的城市”,总体还是很好的，可以看可以吃的都很多。我最喜欢的还是吃的，念念不忘。只是，各行各业的服务都不怎么好。每次去都只能逛一两个地方，希望下次可以呆久一点。
40,“大北京”,北京真的很大很大。。。走马观花。。。还是没有看完一个完整的北京。故宫可以不去，但朝阳公园一定要去啊。虚化南京的人可以去哪里。鸟巢最好是晚上去，故宫就要起早
30,“北京的四月”,北京的四月天气很干，后来发现喝了一些菊花荼，喉咙好多了，没有喝菊花荼之前，真是感到无比的难受。希望这个小贴士，对春天和秋天去北京的人有所用。
40,“除了堵车，其他都不错”,北京作为首都，文化经济是一流的，在北京吃喝住玩都能找到合适你的地方，什么档次都可以再北京消费，不过不好的一点就是行，其公共交通系统相对上海深圳来说比较缺乏，导致私家车超多，出行一堵一两个小时的情况常有发生
40,“历史的痕迹”,无需使用交通工具，欣然漫步在故宫、颐和园、天坛、长城；放开思绪，你能感觉到在历史与现代文明交替的空间里驰骋，深厚的历史文化底蕴让人只好虔诚的膜拜。喜欢这里，因为不用活的那么做作。
10,“北京的早晚治安有些乱”,天安门等地在早八点之前和晚八点之后治安状况不是很好，在这期间骗子相当多，请初次到进京人员千万小心，以免上当受骗。
50,“印象北京”,城市干净，人民有礼貌!热爱北京....喜欢王府井大街，跟那里的小吃~.遗憾的是去了一次北京，没有去爬长城...准备下次旅行再去首都！
40,“爱上北京的夜”,北京 这个 让我欲罢不能的城市我爱他的地铁 爱他的夜爱他的古老 爱他的文化爱他的灯红酒绿 爱他的人来人往鸡头 凤尾该当如何选择
40,“我爱北京”,北京，祖国的心脏，繁华的都市，总体印象很好，有着悠久的历史和文化，加上现代化的都市氛围，适合各个年龄阶段的人群居住，缺点就是堵车严重。我很喜欢这个城市。
30,“我严重的北京”,北京我们的首都也是前年古都，但又是一个很现代化的城市。可就这样一个旅游城市和现代化的城市，除了在高楼大厦以为整个城市让我感觉很旧，少了千年古都的味道。谢谢
50,“北京好”,在北京呆了段时间，喜欢上了北京，虽然交通很拥堵，但还是喜欢，真的很想留在北京，定居在北京，让我们为了定居在北京而奋斗吧！
30,“交通”,我感觉北京的交通是让人很闹心，我记得我在北京海淀区工作的时候每当周一到周五的时候尤其是上下班的时候堵的是没办法
50,“Die neue Oper und Stadtplanungsmuseum”,"Vom Platz des ""Himmlichen Frieden"" kann man beides zu Fuß sehr leicht erreichen.Das Stadtplanungsmuseum sollte als erstes auf der Liste der Besichtigung stehen!Hier kann man komplett die ganze Stadt als Modell sehen(Durch Lichteffekte beiTag und Nacht)Danach ist die Neue Oper nicht weit,sieht aus wieeine ""Dampfnudel"" auf einem Teller mit Wasser.Hatte selbst dasVergnügen das Silvesterkonzert zu erleben(Ein Traum!)"
50,“北京”,景色好，管理的也好，是个好去处，非常好，非常棒，要是去玩的话，一定要去北京，不去的话，你一定会后悔，记得一定要去哦，一定要去。
40,“好玩 有人情味”,扑面而来的亲切感 包容自由的环境 享受生活的贫嘴人民 还有五花八门的演出展览博物馆种种 总之就是赖上不想走了 o(∩_∩)o...哈哈
40,“北京历史是那么的悠久”,拥有那么悠久的皇城历史的北京。。让我去后赞叹不已。。希望。。很赶快再去一次。。把剩下的那些东西。。游玩个遍。。。。。。大家都一起去吧。。一定会流连忘返 。。
30,“中国首都”,恩 不错 交通拥挤 生活节奏快 是每个一线城市的共性 作为一个经济发达但有充斥着历史古香的城市 这里也不失为一个旅游的好去处。
50,“北京”,中国的首都，公共交通很发达。呵呵。。。特别是奥运会，加速了这个城市的基础见识，北京的房价在这样高度发展的进程中，真是物有所值，一点都不贵！
30,“帝都－浮华背后”,"北京地价贵,贵到酒店费贵到要死质量还奇差,288一天的莫泰168,脏到坐在桌子旁边就感觉有小虫往身上爬,睡一夜起来身上莫名其妙出现一滩滩红印过敏,放在桌子上的瓶罐底部居然沾上了莫名其妙的方便面汤的味道.本来没住过莫泰姐心头还有那么一点点的好奇,住完之后我觉得一定要和我们家小孩说""小时候要好好读书阿,不然长大只能住莫泰阿!!!""每天住在那里简直是by second在count down哇.北京交通差,差到我都觉得差过魔都,没办法,谁让帝都的牌照那么便宜呢. 每天打车都如临大敌,要环顾前后左右随时出现的竞争者,前有狼后有虎,一不小心车就被人抢走,然后活活在原地站半个多小时!再有,今天搭飞机去重庆,因为某领导人出行的交通管制害我差点赶不上飞机,春哥探头向拦路的交警大喊""叔叔我们真的赶飞机来不及了!"",叔叔一边用""天王老子也不放你过去!""的表情回答说""放你过去了你也过不去...""北京服务业服务意识差.虽然是首都机场,但是晚到旅客居然没有专用安检绿色通道.真的像尖峰时刻一样满头是汗方才赶到登机口,真是惊险那.等到上了飞机,又开始了所谓的首都机场限流的桥段,等阿等阿等阿等阿飞机就是不飞,我手机开开关关,关关开开.几近崩溃的时候飞机终于起飞了.内牛满面阿.顺便说一下国航的空姐们最近降薪了还是NPL了?怎么个个都是一副欠她多还她少的表情.看了心烦."
30,“一般的北京印象”,没去北京之前，觉得她是个浪漫的城市；去了北京之后，其实再现实不过了……一个喜欢和全国人民谈论素质的城市本身素质并不高！
50,“北京是个有文化的城市”,第一次到北京的时候，是冬天，在一个寒冷的下着雪的傍晚，站在国贸的某个天桥上，看着车流，感觉这个城市不属于我，我不属于这个城市，我被排外了，这个城市如此陌生，我微不足道，甚至还不如老人或贵妇牵着的一条狗。在这里，我找不到归属感。我极力地想逃跑。我后悔来到这里。第二次，奥运会期间到北京，突然感觉这里都变了，或许是因为有了更多的陌生人，让我在陌生的环境里有了沦落人。一切都变得美好，不陌生了。不怕夏天的炎热，脖子上挂着公交卡，以4折的优惠价格狂坐公交车，一圈一圈地绕北京。浏览广告牌上的宣传画，读京华时报上的当天新闻，听广播里的最新歌曲，看Belle的流行元素，尝老北京的特色小吃，逛一条条有名的没名的胡同，赶大红门动物园的早市批发，欣赏我能付得起门票的演出，玩转首都的各大名校。。。。满满的两个月暑假，我的心融入了这里。我才发现，这是个有文化的城市。这样的内涵，也只能慢慢地去体会。北京一日游，二日游，三日游，五日游，还是算了吧。走马观花，能把一个城市的精髓吸收多少？想要真正了解一个城市，要熟悉它，直到这个城市对你来说没有什么是风景了，不知不觉中，你已潜移默化成一个当地人了。
50,“有钱人呆的地方”,很好很富有的城市，等我有钱了就来这里好好消费一下 过过也胜过 夜生活好啊 都是有钱人玩的 北京 我爱北京 我爱这个富有的城市啊
50,“北漂的浪漫”,798艺术，北京长城，这些令人心灵沉淀下来看现代的好去处，实在是不得不去。另外故宫，一定要亲自目睹美好的地方。魅力无限
40,“北京”,北京不愧为人民的首都，首先是交通挺便利的，其次就是环境还好，绿化也不错，道路很宽敞，再次就是，北京的宾馆有点贵，实践玩花的钱并不多，全花在吃饭和住房上了！
50,“难忘的冬季”,去年圣诞节后一天李宇春在北京五棵松开了场阿么李宇春演唱会，所以我有幸去了趟北京过圣诞节，虽然南方人去到北方会不适应，因为北京的冬天特冷，但此次游玩很开心，去了长城去了故宫去了北京天安门，我非常喜欢北京蓝蓝的天空，和北京的夜晚，有机会还是会去北京吃北京烤鸭，特好吃，嘿嘿~~SO期待李宇春再在北京开场告别两T（两公司）演唱会。哈哈哈
50,“首都北京”,北京是我国的首都，十几年前我来过，2010年10月1日又来后，北京已发展名副其实的国际大都市。五环、六环建成，北京的天也变蓝了，空气污染也不存在了，城市文化气息更加浓、厚重的历史让人回味。
40,“北京印象”,十一在北京呆了8天，我最大的感受是国庆期间任太多，，，其次是北京的公交事业还是不错的，，特便宜，，，但是去一个地方需要花费很多时间在车上，，，，，总体来说北京市一座历史与现代并存的城市
40,“旅行”,很适合旅行但不适合居住，因为没钱，但是只要去旅行，一年四季总有适合你去的地方，好好发现一下这里确实很不错，穿梭在时尚和传统之间去寻找曾经的那些发生在小胡同的故事就是一种享受
40,“首都太大啦”,北京--中国的首都，有历史景点，也有新的景点，我只觉得北京的广场和公园都很大，行都脚仔都软，但总体感觉很是不错的，交通费用不是很贵，2元的地铁就可以坐全程不限距离，公交也是1元起，但的士就有得贵，白天10元起表，晚上11点后-凌晨5点公交停运后就11元起表，机场大巴统一都是16元，景点门票就有点贵，而且很多园中园，最好就是买套票比较换算，但有好多费用不是很值的，自己根据预算考虑清楚吧。
50,“我很喜欢这座城市”,北京是一座极具现代气息的古老城市，她代表这中国。来到北京，发现我深深的爱上了她，北京的交通四通八达，市民热情好客，购物之类什么的都很方便。
50,“我喜欢北京”,从小出生在北京，很喜欢，北京是首都，全国人民向往的地方，住习惯了，感觉北京哪儿都很好，习惯成自然，我喜欢北京，永远住在这里
50,“美丽的城市”,作为中国的首都，这里有许多文明古迹，是中外游客的旅游休闲圣地。雄伟的长城，气势磅礴的故宫，美丽的颐和园，古朴的四合院，等等，都代表了这座城市的古朴。鸟巢、水立方、国家大剧院新的城市地标印证着这座城市不断地发展前行。北京必定会成为国家化的大都市，古朴和现代交相呼应，科技和文明一路前行。
50,“北京是个好地方”,北京是个好地方，一是政治中心是我国的首都、二是文化中心、三是千年的古都，城市建设规划好，城市干净卫生，很适于住家、创业。
40,“北京印象。”,有很多具有中国特色的建筑。可以学习很多中国历史的文化知识。很值得一游。环境也很好，人非常的有素质 涵养。很好玩的。，
50,“干净、大气、文化底蕴浓厚的北京”,4月底去的北京，还有些凉意，但是南方长大的我第一次真正感觉自己是到了北方了，就连风吹得都不一样。北京很干净，街道都很宽广，到处可见的文化遗产，尤其是故宫，还有颐和园，真是太美了，让我无比的羡慕以前的皇帝。还有北京的公交很便宜，拿着卡去刷，一般都是0.4角，地铁是2元任坐。我还想再去北京。
50,“伟大的首都，中国的心脏”,北京的名胜古迹众多，餐饮娱乐也相当丰富，除了故宫、颐和园、天坛等知名景点外，像酒吧一条街、什刹海、欢乐谷等去处可以为你的北京之行增加很多乐趣！
40,“首都是国际化大都市”,交通便利，有便宜的公交卡，可以买到。住宿，种类齐全，建议普价的找找。景色，没的说哦，从古至今，建筑，人文地理环境优越。再者，政治中心的一说。
40,“人太多”,北京好玩的地方值得去的地方很多啊 天安门啊 故宫啊 颐和园啊还有鸟巢 水立方 就是人太多啊 不过可以理解 毕竟是首都啊
50,“历史文化名城”,我认为北京的魅力在于它的东西方文化冲击与碰撞所展现出的独有的美感。与气派的现代化大都市相对应的还有中国传统的古老建筑，会使游客不停地在现代与过去之间转换，不仅使眼眶在不停的转动，更使我们的心灵得到满足。北京带给我太多感动，相信也会给大家留下难以忘怀的经历。
50,“旅游北京交通工具首选:地铁”,到北京这个城市旅游，交通十分方便。特别是地铁，两块钱，坐着地铁可以几条地铁线，绕来绕去，而且不会堵车，快捷、方便。而且，很多北京的著名景点，都可以到达：如颐和园，雍和宫，圆明园，故宫，等等。
50,“富丽堂皇”,我去过很多次了 这次还想去看看看，上次去的时候故宫 没有观光完整，这次很想再去体会一下很壮观 风景很美 心情舒畅的感觉。
40,“天安门”,这个地方总是有那么多的人流！！！早晨很早就有人去看升旗，到黑都还有人在天安门广场流浪，呵呵，这就是中国啊，人多也不是没有好处的
40,“我爱北京”,北京是个住越久就越喜欢的城市，第一次来北京觉得环境差，交通拥挤，人多， 反正没有什么好感。但是来到这边真正开始生活就开始喜欢上北京啦。
40,“北京，比我96年去的时候更繁华了”,96年，我去北京了。在去北京前一直听别人说北京的卫生是好讲究的。待我到北京时，卫生的确讲究特别是在景点中，如果有随便丢垃圾的人，有人会罚款。但只限于外地人，当地人，他们是会给面子的。所以，还有种种旅游中发生的原因，觉得北京，我不想再去第二次，但由于工作原因，08年就再踏上北京土地上，这次，是因为奥运会举办的原因，北京作也了很多规划，其中当也有不足之处，但还是其中的原因，北京发生天翻地变的，但，在此值得一提的事，北京人少信！
40,“爱北京”,"万里长城,天安门,故宫,颐和园,圆明园,都是百去不厌的地方奥运馆鸟巢和水立方在月圆之夜更加动人正宗的北京烤鸭真是好吃"
50,“胡同”,北京的胡同还是值得一看的，很多有意思的小店都隐藏在里面，好吃的、好玩儿的，哪怕就是坐在门口晒太阳的老太太，也是新鲜的
30,“环境”,环境不怎么样，购物不方便。道路周遍没有便利店，感觉不方便。酒店的价格很贵，便宜的也不怎么样，酒店在一些比较偏的地方。
40,“好”,好 ，就是交通堵 ，开车堵 ，坐车挤 ， 地铁晕 夜里十多点东西二环还堵车。晚上什么都关门， KTV也不关 不过车多，我喜欢车更喜欢豪华车
40,“六朝古都 文化名城 政治中心 活力都市”,是的，北京有很多很多可以介绍的地方。她的历史，她的变迁，她的故事，她的兴衰，她的过去和现在。她是全体中国人的都市，她欢迎全世界的朋友们来做客。
50,“我爱北京”,北京经常去，但每次去北京都给我留下了不同的印象，它的美丽、现代、古朴都是在中国任何一个城市所不能比拟的，到中国任何一个城市如果没有去过北京，那么你不会真正的了解中国！
50,“喜欢北京”,喜欢那的文化氛围，很有活力，很有朝氣，很大气，包容性很大的一個城市。从4年前第一次就喜欢上了，北京的胡同 小吃 让人难忘。
50,“盛世都城”,这是怎样一座城市呢，享誉全球，历史悠久，又是现代化的政治经济文化中心。故事太多，太长。来到北京，从来不要嫌时间不够，一辆自行车，一张地铁卡，北京，有很多等你发现。北京的青年是全国最有范儿，最潮的一群人。北京的胡同，有说不完的秘辛。北京的紫禁城，那更是我们的自豪，甚至不敢去细说去评价。就连专家的8集《紫禁城》都说不完的故事，怎敢轻易置评。无论你想找到什么，梦想，历史，故事，自己，北京都不会辜负你
50,“北京”,最大气的中国城市 很喜欢上次去北京还是奥运会期间 很久没有去了 上次留下了很好的印象 希望能够在半年里面再去一次
50,“北京故宫”,北京故宫是大家都要去参观的地方，让你亲身感受一下皇家宫殿的雄伟 壮观 神秘，在这样的宫殿中生活你的渺小，感受古代王朝精美工艺。一定不能错过的地方。
40,“城市太大了”,城市太大了，出门就迷路，车也多，每天坐车都要花掉三四个小时，去过一次就觉得只适合去玩玩，不适合居住，太不方便了。无语。
40,“北京自助游”,北京的路都是方方正正的，东南西北特好分，路很宽可是交通还是很挤印象很深的是哪里停车费特便宜基本上所有的景点学生证都能打折饭店的菜地道，就是素菜很少和北京人说话很舒服，他们说话特爽他是一座给人感觉很大气的城市很想再去一次
50,“旅游不错地点。”,北京有很多玩的地方，唯一的缺点就是人太多了。像北京的长城确实是个好地方。与长城相比，故宫其实就不值得一去，除非你是考古一方面的专家。
40,“我的眼光看北京”,北京，故时的皇城，今昔的首都。但给我留下的整体影响是一般。我没有照着旅游指南去游览，而是随意的看了看。我到了王府井，昔日闻名遐迩的小吃街早被商业化，完全没有了老北京的味道。听着《前门情思大碗茶》，来到前门大街，古香古色的建筑风格依稀让我感受到了北京独特的味道，加之老字号品牌的点缀其间，这条街成了我对北京最高的评价。至于天安门广场，在早上升旗时去是最好的选择，仪仗队给你的感觉不仅仅是震撼，一种对祖国的敬仰油然而生，会让自己切实的体会到，哦，原来我是这样爱国！更多的风土人情不在城市，而在周边郊区，农家乐，老四合院，都找得到踪影。市中心的金宝街，正打造中国自己的香榭丽舍和第五大街。大悦城等都是城市国际化，现代化的一种标志。北京，一个古老而现代的国际大都市正逐渐清晰的展现在你眼前。
40,“一个政治文化中心的城市”,北京的景点很多，我们到过故宫、天安门、八达岭长城、颐和园、毛主席纪念堂，鸟巢、北京科技馆等等、、、交通方便，坐地铁比公交车舒服北京烤鸭叫好吃、当地特色小吃和地方风味的东西不怎么吃的惯，总的来说还是比较满意
50,“Beijing das Tor ins historische China”,"Ein Rundgang zu den wichtigsten Sehenswuerdigkeiten in Peking genuegt um einen guten Einblick ins historische China zu bekommen. Zum einen die verbotene Stadt fuer das kaiserliche Leben, der Himmelstempel um das geistige Leben, die Hutongs um das Leben des gemeinen Volks zu sehen und den Sommerpalast fuer die hoefischen Freuden kennenzulernen"
40,“大气的城市”,北京不愧为首都，确实很淡定和大气，特别喜欢颐和园和北大，还有长城，植物园等也很值得一游，羡慕北京人可以有这么多的去处。但是对故宫很失望，和想象中的富贵雍容不一样，难怪皇帝都喜欢下江南。
40,“和谐 文明”,和谐 文明 整洁 的北京城。马路干净整洁，市民纯朴，热情，好客，待人有礼貌，人与人之间和平相处，植被丰富，来到北京让你有回家的感觉！
50,“够味道”,老北京的胡同足够你一天溜达，后海，三里屯的夜生活；故宫长城的老文化；鸟巢水立方的新文化一切等你来体验。
40,“单车.老歌.咖啡馆”,秋高气爽，阳光洒在身上，暖暖的，有明媚的色彩，却无高温的炙烤，这是我喜欢北京的秋天胜于盛夏的原因之一，当然，还有那触目皆是的萧瑟感和斑兰绚丽的色彩。昨夜玩HERO(WOG版，雇用的英雄是亡灵城擅长聚灵术的死灵法师Thant，亵渎里把消灭异教徒称为灵魂收割，这真是死灵法师最喜欢的事了)放纵到凌晨4点才睡，但早就约了同事8点在copus见，只好嘟嘟囔囔的早起。库帕斯是一个丽都边上的bakery，每天新鲜出炉的各种面包，供有咖啡等各式饮品，接有wireless，堪与雕刻时光媲美。丽都附近的咖啡馆、酒吧和面包房都是蛮不错的去处，倘佯其间，竟会让人恍以为置身在以休闲生活闻名的欧洲或者美国小镇。在同事的新居庸懒的过了一上午，看科普杂志，吃面包聊天。昨日在北语帮朋友找的自行车不合要求，午后骑回去更换，大凡二手车，我能想到的来源无非两种：学生买卖和修车处淘换。有二手车地方现在屈指可数，奥运嘛，创造商机的同时必然也剥夺了很多人的商机。几近周折找到一辆很合意的，车身破旧，性能卓越，24型斜跨式，完全符合老头子的要求，都想据为己有了。如何把两辆车同时从亚运村骑回学院路，无疑于我一大挑战，摔了近十次，弄的converse裤子全是泥，代价惨重啊，终于掌握了双手驾驭双车的诀窍，并且速度几乎不逊于单车。总结一下经验：双手手腕均要使足力气，以能精确控制车龙头的行进方向，同时保证双车步调一致，避免龙头和脚踏相互干扰，眼睛平视前方，任何时候都不要分心，否则很容易车头分岔。我就是在这种自豪与痛苦的交替煎熬中奔回北语，因为紧张，手心全是汗，虎口更是隐隐作痛。来往车流滚滚，最可怕的还是逆行的，真是可耻啊可耻，逼得我不得不下车。单车再返回丽都，夕阳西下，shuffle里传来的正是丹尼的那首我最喜欢的《涟漪》，这是大二入广播台首次制作节目时使用的背景音乐，老台员们好评如潮，说在路灯初上的校园里，这音乐和歌声让一切显得那么宁静和美好，哦，迷人的校园夜晚。大三的时候，听说这首歌被丹尼的妈妈以50万港币卖了充做赌资，不知丹尼泉下有知当作何感想，当时我们正在下四国军旗，无语。再后来，下雨时就想听这首粤语歌“生活，淡淡似流水，全因为你，变出千般美。。。。”。现在，再无复当时之宁静，人潮如涌，车流攒动，触目嘈杂，闻声喧嚣，心中竟有忧伤汩汩留出，似乎在祭奠过往的青春岁月。雕刻时光的兼职本来是20点到22点，因为今天的客人特别多，所以从19点做到23点，也是两个月没过来上班有些愧疚呢。这次的状态竟出奇的好，或许是中秋晚会时和大家都熟络了，加上新换的秋冬季工装比夏装的体恤衫更喜欢，并且基本没闲下来，所以时间过得很快。他们都认识我，但我唯一能叫得出名的只有店长susan，她会趁空教我各种饮品的摆放以及书籍的归类，毕竟我没有参加正式员工的系统training，厨房的大厨mm允我下次教我做pizza，期待ing。很久没过来上班，店里增加了几个新面孔，其中一个还是从西安店调过来培训的，小姑娘显然还不能完全适应，并且看到我下班后立马脱掉工装坐在店里喝咖啡把整周的薪水一下挥霍掉，使她很困惑。大家很不喜欢看我比他们先走，但是明天还要早起上班，只好开溜了。回到宿舍已是午夜，想想这个周末又是忙忙碌碌，没怎么睡觉，参加了一次短距离马拉松4km，来回两趟骑车往返丽都到学院路60km，还在咖啡馆上了三小时晚班，双腿蹒跚回屋（想想这月底的北京国际马拉松，sigh，心中堪忧，摇头叹息），不管它了，倒床就睡。
30,“首都北京，实在一般”,因为很久没有去过，所以4个人都去北京了，说实在的，真的不怎么样，空气脏脏的。而且东西也不好吃，因为是首都的关系，所以作为中国人，应该还是报以崇高的精神去的。
40,“魅力的文化之都”,作为首都，北京每天都会吸引成千上万的华夏子女前去瞻仰朝拜。故宫长城天坛加上鸟巢水立方构成新北京的又一道道风景线。北京从来都不少人文景点，只是从前的我不知道，低廉的物价，日益改善的环境又提高了北京的竞争力，使之越来越适于居住生活。
50,“文化古城”,中国的首都，中国的政治、文化、经济的中心，其文化底蕴深厚。主要有八达岭长城，故宫、十三陵、圆明园、颐和园、雍和宫、天坛、地坛等名胜古迹。
40,“北京景点概况”,在北京有段时间了，去了大部分的地方。下面说说我的感受吧！一、故宫，是必去景点之一，自己去的，走马观花一小时就下来了。可什么也不知道，稀里糊涂的，最好租一个语音导游器。那样还了解历史。门票65，里面还有珠宝馆、钟表馆个10元。最好带些吃的，里面又贵感觉还是过期的，里面的纪念品千万别买！看看还可以。二、景山公园，门票2元，性价比较高。这里可以看紫禁城全景。最好是从故宫北面出来，对面就是景山公园了。上那个山，有两种路，一种是费劲的，全是台阶，一种是抹坡路，清松点。这里不大。一会就逛完了。三、北海公园，门票20元。这里就是小时候唱的那首歌，让我们荡起双桨！呵呵，美好的回忆啊。在这里划船是不错的！在唱着那首歌，美死了。这里挺大，但逛得地方不多。四、正阳门，门票20元。这就是个城楼，里面没什么，而且栏杆特高，不好照相。建议不要去。五、天坛，门票35元。北京必去的地方，但我去了好几次没什么感觉了。看个人情节了。六、鼓楼、钟楼，门票30。上面什么也没有。感觉外观就可以。照几张相片！附近倒是可以去后海啊、烟袋斜街，还不不错的选择。在后海租辆自行车，骑骑挺惬意的。也不贵！七、孔庙、国子监，门票20，这里不错，看看过去怎样考试，了解一下孔子。附近有好多小店，可以买点小礼品，吃点小吃。八、古观象台，门票10。这里参观的人不多，如果去过南京紫金山天文台的，就没必要去了。九、颐和园，60元。这里真的很大，在进去之前，最好买份地图，里面10元。在这里划船还是不错的，因为昆明湖真的很大，不停一直走，需要一小时左右。十、北京动物园，40 元。这里也很大，进去之前一定要买些吃的，里面的东西真的很难吃。而且贵。。。。北京还有馆，110元。去过其他海洋馆的，就没有必要了。因为大同小异。十一、中国美术馆，20元。这里感觉没什么，不值得一看，还不如军事博物馆。十二、八达岭，45元。自己去，不好。交通不方便，找不到车的话，打黑车贼贵，要200多，送到别的景点，在送到公交站牌。所以建议，跟团去。滑车，30元，下面有个熊乐园，不要去那里，那里没什么，而且车特少，全是黑车。十三、十三陵———定陵，60元。根本不推荐去，什么也没，对不起门票。十四、明十三陵神道，30元。就是两排石头动物、人。没了。下面推荐一些免费景点：一、军事博物馆，免费领票，需要证件。也有一些收费的项目，建议不买套票，因为有的需要等好长时间，进去喜欢哪个可以单买票，10元左右一项。二、首都博物馆，需要提前两天预约，网上比较方便。三、自然博物馆，提前预约，电话预约。挨着天坛，可以一天游览。四、毛主席纪念堂，早上人很多，建议十点左右，排队十几分就进去了。不让带包哦，最好有人陪同。五、天安门广场，这里有很多建筑，照个像就可以，没必要进去。如，人民大会堂、国家大剧院等。六、大栅栏，这里是条老街，小吃啊，纪念品啊，还是不错的，我经常去。那里的纪念品可以划价。嘿嘿，感觉是北京买纪念品最好的地方。七、烟袋斜街，挨着后海、鼓楼。商业街，逛可以，买吗就不合算。八、后海，这里天天很忙，尤其晚上，这附近有好的可以参观的地方。如，宋庆龄故居。九、南通锣鼓巷，这里也是条小街，东西卖的挺贵。小吃特贵。十、徐悲鸿纪念馆。十一、曹雪芹纪念馆。十二、老舍纪念馆。十三、中国人民抗日战争纪念雕塑园。十四、鸟巢、水立方，适合外观。买票进去看，不值得。参观了这么多，感觉大同小异。大部分地方有学生票，学生证很重要。
50,“爱上”,北京去过多次，都是蜻蜓点水匆匆路过，象候鸟在途中某棵大树上栖息一样，除了环顾一隅之外，对这棵大树的全貌并没有清晰明了的深刻认识。
50,“Mix版的恢宏壯闊”,对于北京的热爱.从小开始.些许受父母的一些影响.但总是没能抓到机会的尾巴.前往.第一次的北京之行.是大二的国庆.为了到达.不惜坐了24小时的硬座.对北京有了第一次真实的感受.第二次.在圣诞节.住着小胡同裡的老屋.在平安夜进入人头攒动的教堂.第三次.借着学习的名义.在这个美好的城市待了一个半月.出于我的探索精神.从旅游的目的变成享受这个城市的生活步调.各种美食.各种繁华的景致.时隔一年.又是北京.虽然只是作为一次旅途的中转站.但还是难掩心中的激动.虽然那两天下着毛毛细雨.但还是阻挡不了前进的步伐.小时候的我.只是对我爱北京天安门这首歌.烂熟于心.现在的我.对北京的各种街道.各条地铁线路.各大商场.轻车熟路.心裡默念着故宫.鼓楼.前门.颐和园.长城...等等等等.流连于大悦城.三裡屯.南锣鼓巷.798.世贸天街....一头勐扎进gui街.牛街.鼓楼周边.地安门....开心地手拿稻香村.味多美...还有无数大学的积淀气息.Beijingers豪爽阔气的翘舌音.都让我想深深地扎根在这裡.不愿离去.
50,“北京是让人感到最随性的地方”,北京是首都，天子脚下，北京这个地方都有一种劲儿，包容、亲切、热情、自由，总的一句话，不论谁来到北京，都可以找到自己的圈子，用一个词来说就是：随性。活得很自我。这不是拿钱和地方来评价的，完全是存在人的内心之中的。我喜欢北京，众生百态。
50,“北京”,第一次到北京，感觉很好，北京天安感觉很亲切很美丽，心中充满油然而起的敬意。在北京我感受到了北京友好文明，这是我的初次感受，很好很美很温馨。
30,“City Trip Peking im August 2010”,"City Trip Peking im August 2010Im August 2010 bin ich alleine (männlich) zu einer 6 tägigen Kurzreise nach pekin aufgebrochen.Ich hatte mir einen Ausflug in ein exotisches Reich vorgestellt.Mein Trip konnte verschiedene Vorurteile schon mal ausräumen:- Luft dreckig - falsch; ist keine Bergluft aber es fahren kaum LKW in der Stadt, fast nur neue Autos,- Chaos, Fahräder exotisch - falsch, das ist jetzt alles ganz geordnet und relativ ordentlich, hat mich an viele Ostblocksatädte erinnert, letztendlich kaum anders als Sofia, prag oder magdeburg- Bombastische neue Bauwerke, falsch, die vielen neuen Bauwerke verteilen sich so auf große Bereiche dass es eigentlich nicht besonders auffält- Betonwüste, falsch - selten so eine grüne und mit Seen gespickte City gesehen. Ho Hai, Be Hai, verbotene Stadt und Umgebung alles schön grün und mit Seen gespickt.- Sommer heiß und stickig, also für mich war`s OK, waren zwar 30°C aber einigermaßen angenehm, kein schreckliches Klima wie oftmals angedrohtAlso Peking kann man durchaus machen, man muss es sich aber erarbeiten.Tips von mir:- Hotel in der City nehmen (z.B. kapok)- 1 Tag verbotene Stadt von 12-18°° alles zu Fuss, Essen (Subway) und Trinken mitnehmen- 1/2 Tag Sommerpalast, mit dem Taxi hinfahren und dem Bus zurückfahren, danach 1/2 tag Shopping- Mauer Badaling kann man vergessen, Busfahrten zur Mauer werden mißbraucht für cheating, also als Verkaufsveranstaltungen--> Taxi nehmen 600 Y und selbst fahren lassen, einen Tag- Abends Essen im/am Ho Hai- Night Life - Vorsicht vor cheating, Girls locken einen in sauteureBars und KaraokeschuppenAlso ei ziemlich aufregender Trip, aber natürlich nicht Schanghai, Hongkong oder Singapur."
30,“右折車に注意”,北京をはじめ中国の道路では赤信号でも右折は常時可という独特なルールがある。横断歩道が青信号でも横から車が突っ込んでくる。慣れるまでは怖い。
50,“人文气息浓厚”,北京虽然是首都，有着光鲜的地位，但是北京的人文气息是任何地方都不能比拟的！胡同，公园，酒吧每一个地方都让人流连忘返，如果有机会的话，真想住在北京！
40,“古老的城市”,今天的房山区琉璃河镇的董家林村是西周初年燕国都城所在地，是北京历史上最早的城。我们常说北京建城 3050 年，就是从这算起的，这里青山绿水，景色宜人。
40,“北京小吃”,北京小吃品种多，味道好，有很多历史悠久的美味小吃，像灌肠，驴打滚，都很好吃，去北京游玩一定要去品尝下小吃，一定会回味无穷的！！！
50,“Verwöhnen und Gutes tun - Medical Massage”,"In China lassen sich blinde Menschen zu medizinischen Masseuren ausbilden. Diese Menschen, so hat man das Gefühl, sehen während einer Behandlung wirklich mit ihren Händen.Die Behandlungszentren sind spartanisch ausgestattet und der Effekt der Behandlung äußert sich zunächst in ""Wohlweh"". Spätestens am nächsten Tag aber fühlt man die Wirkung und empfindet eine große Dankbarkeit gegenüber dem Masseur, der die wunden Punkte erkannt und mit Erfolg behandelt hat.Der Preis der Behandlung liegt bei ca. € 3,-- pro Stunde. Ein Grund für ein sattes Trinkgeld..."
50,“这里是北京”,这里有时尚、艺术的798，这里有讲述历史文化的故宫、天坛，这里有老北京的美味小吃~这里就是北京，时尚和历史并存的中国城市。
40,“爱你 ~京城”,去过几趟北京了，每次去找朋友去玩，他们都会带我去不同的景点玩，北京的景点太多了，故宫，天安门广场，王府井，香山，后海。。。好多地方去了就不想走了，各有各的特色和感染力，不愧是我们的首都！美丽的京城以自己独特而丰富的魅力感染着全世界的每一个人。。
50,“北京”,北京太大。景点太多，一个星期根本玩不过来，光故宫就至少要在里面逛一天才能基本尽兴，其他颐和园，圆明园等也一样，个人认为，跟团太累，而且无法尽兴
40,“文化中心，中国中心”,我到北京去过故宫，登了长城，逛了北海公园，瞻仰了毛主席，看了升国旗，总体感觉很不错，就是人多，车多，新的旅游景点鸟巢，水立方很不错，冬天鸟巢还有滑雪场呢！
50,“繁华与萧条的对照”,北京最大的特点是，繁华的地方太繁华，萧条的地方太萧条。跟着旅游团去北京旅游的时候，我们在市区看到的是一幢幢高楼大厦，车水马龙，夜晚亮丽的霓虹灯晃的人好像在虚幻中一样，可是当车行驶到另外的一片地方的时候，却猛然发现，一切的繁华都已消失殆尽，行走在街头的，都是生活在城市最底层的人，他们或者推着手推车，或者骑着破旧的自行车，与市中心的繁华相比简直让人心酸。北京，也许就是这样一个城市，繁华与萧条对比太明显，甚至让人都无法有心理准备，一下子就会从繁荣到萧条，也让人内心涌起无限酸楚。
40,“北京不错，比较大气”,北京不错，楼都比较宏伟，看起来挺近，走起来特别远，累啊。还是比较大气的，很有威严感，估计是因为北京是政治中心的原因吧。
50,“亚洲的魔方城市”,一个城市有几个面？雍和宫 轻烟萦绕一份尊贵。颐和园 夕阳泛起一份悠闲。全聚德 味蕾偶尔放浪形骸。圆明园 历史厚重无法言说。一个城市有几个维度？以水平横轴加速撤退南锣鼓巷内一家小店；或者垂直纵向仰视世贸天阶；又或者以斜向上或向下30度横截面预览全球第二大宜家的各层展厅；再或者以360度全景无死角环视鸟巢神奇构造。一个魔方城市，以双脚为轴，想象为手，任凭你随意翻转，拼选独特意象，行走城市，不只是获得答案那么简单。
50,"“莊嚴的老北京,新潮的北京”","还沒有北京,就覺得北京是一个很古老,四周都好嚴肅的地方。但是當真正到了,卻認为北京是两个部分,是老北京和新北京。事實上,在天安門,故宮,会覺得那是了解歷史的地方,很莊嚴;但是到了鳥巢,水立方,三里屯等地方,卻覺得北京很新派!!新舊交接,我覺得北京是每个中國人都应該到的地方!!"
50,“北京市”,北京是个极好的旅游城市，有很多古建筑群，也有很多北京小吃，爱吃的朋友可一定要来啊。八达岭长城，故宫博物馆，天安门一定要去
40,“北京故宫与八达岭”,在历史故事中，在景观介绍文中，在现实中，才知道文人的修饰不用限量，故宫的宏大与雄伟是笔墨难以抒发的；而现实中长城的残缺与不够有力量也是文人的夸张，现实与现场让我很是失望。“不到长城非好汉，再到长城我是傻蛋”！我宁愿再一次欣赏恭亲王府也不愿再上长城。
40,“Favorit in China”,"Ein unbedingtes Muss bei einer China Reise ist der Besuch von Chinas Hauptstadt. Die Historischen Sehenswürdigkeiten, Himmelstempel, Sommerpalast, Verbotene Stadt und nicht zuletzt die Grosse Chinesische Mauer werden jeden Besucher sehr beeindrucken. Durch den Besuch wird das "" Alte Leben "" in den verschiedenen Kaiserzeiten von China eindrucksvoll und nachvollziehbar wiedergegeben.Zusätzlich besticht Peking mit dem Flair einer Mega Metropole, dem Regierungs -und Botschaftsviertel, dem Olympiapark und einer Unzahl an Kulinarischen Restaurants aus der ganzen Welt."
30,“北京的交通”,在北京总体都是很好的 吃的也好 住的也好 北京是北方人 对这些还是比较习惯的但是唯一不足的就是 走的那天耽误了火车 堵堵堵 北京永恒的话题
40,“Spannende Stadt im Spannungsbogen zwischen Kultur und Moderne”,"Peking bietet für jeden etwas. Shopping, Bars und Clubs und jede Menge Kultur. Besonders die alten Viertel, die sog. Hutongs haben es mir angetan.Wer in Peking ist sollte sich unbedingt ein Fahrrad mieten und die Stadt auf zwei Rädern erkunden."
30,“体验京成的皇城根韵味，就到北京吧”,北京十一哥可以让你体验古韵风华与现代文明交织融合的一个集合体，热爱皇城根的历史韵味、喜欢北方红黄绿瓦的艳丽璀璨的话，来北京看看吧；体验大都市人流不息的忙碌和科技文明的跨越，也来北京吧，毕竟，从历史、人文、政治、文化多角度来说，在客观上和主观上都构成了北京的独特风格
40,“压车”,压车太厉害了，火车站拉客的司机太黑了，去首都机场要200。大街上随便拦个出租车都回告诉你路怎么走，出租车司机很能侃，一般比较热情，没有遇到绕路的；工交车服务也很好，不愧为首都。
50,“首都风范”,"打小儿跟这儿长大的,喜欢北京小吃...喜欢北京的古城....喜欢北京的胡同....喜欢北京人的自来熟...喜欢北京话....喜欢北京的一切!"
50,“北京的名胜价格！！”,故宫：60元颐和园：30元天坛：15元北海公园：10元圆明园：60元中央电视塔：50元中华世纪坛：60元雕塑公园：10元北京植物园：5元中科院北京植物园：10元香山：10元碧云寺：10元西山八大处公园：10元玉渊潭公园：5元动物园：15元
40,“很亲切的城市”,历史文化古城人文地理特殊一个文明大城市一切都是那么令人向往有古色古香的四合院有现代化的高楼大厦有红色革命的遗迹还有先人们遗留下来的历史文明北京的小吃品种非常丰富
40,“大气的首都”,每年都会去北京，或出差，或探友，总的感觉就是非常大气，城市建筑中规中矩，是现代与传统结合的非常好的一个国际化大都市，北京人较能侃，对国际国家大事均能有独到见解，文化底蕴很深，国内要首选的工作、生活城市非北京莫属
50,“首都”,古迹甚多，美食甚多，值得一游的首都特别推荐故宫＼纪念堂＼长城＼颐和园＼圆明园＼天坛＼十三陵＼密云水库＼地坛＼后海＼王府井＼奥运馆
40,“闲适”,第一次单独逛北京，已是高中毕业那年，因为高考成绩还可以，爸妈带我出去玩。后来就留我自己在小姨家住。自己去找朋友玩，可是诺大的北京城，一上公交便坐反了方向，北京人倒是非常热心的告知我该怎么坐回去。我心存感激，觉得原来他们这么热情。下了站，还要走一阵子才能倒车，又是很迷茫。一问路，一对夫妇非要同行，边走边扯着闲篇，还说他们孩子像我这般大的年纪是不敢单独出来的。带我到了车站，送我上车，还告诉我哪里下车，感觉上不是陌生人，竟像是父母叮嘱远行的孩子。我心里直到现在还觉得暖暖的。想起上海人一问路就躲开你的时候，觉得北京人是如此的和蔼可亲。后来就心里释然了，上海的速度太快，北京因为历史的沉淀，连性格上也变得闲适和舒缓。他们的可爱大概就是这种闲适吧。
30,“北京很热闹，很拥挤”,无论白天黑夜，在北京的大街上，你永远都不是一个人，除非是郊区。全世界的人们都在建设北京，全世界的人都涌向北京，北京用高房价，高消费把人分档，然后把满足条件的留下，不满足条件的扔出去。全世界的建筑师都在北京展示自己的才华，所以北京的建筑很杂，到处都标榜地标的建筑，古老的城市，年轻的心。
50,“北京，我心中的爱”,向往和经常去的地方。宏大、干净、气派。尤其是那些小四合院，温馨，生活味道很浓厚。希望保持这样的风格，有特色得城市才是，美丽的城市
50,“可爱北京”,可爱的北京非常漂亮、尤其是北京人特别有素质，彬彬有礼，非常规矩，北京市是中国第一个齐聚56个民族的城市，说明非常有感召力。
40,“北京的购物及小吃”,适合学生的购物地点有两个，西单和动物园，此处的动物园是个地名；至于小吃，本人认为坐着公交车在市区转转到处都是小吃，不过最好是在四环之内。
40,“北京值得一去”,北京是个历史、文化、政治、旅游中心，对历史比较感兴趣的人值得一去。，北京的交通、住宿都很方便，要是想好好地了解一下北京的历史文化，建议花上十来天的时间来个自助游。
30,“没有北京，只有首都”,小时候来过几次北京玩，没有太多的记忆。大学时火车的中转站，没有一点归属感，太大太高太冰冷，匆忙的逃离。现在大学毕业工作在北京，慢慢生活其中，了解他，也许首都的使命让北京背负了太多，渐渐的面目全非，没有了北京，只有中国的首都。无论爱恨，它都在按某些设定好的路线，发展着。人来人往。
30,“对北京的简单印象”,凡事看两面，下面是我对北京的简单印象空气差，交通拥挤，人多，房价物价高工作机会多，不排外，交通发达，高校多，春秋天气候非常宜人
50,“我心中的北京”,北京不仅仅因为她是国家的首府，而是因为她是历代朝廷的京都，有着悠久的文明历史和文化古迹！巍峨的长城，雄伟的天安门，宽广的广场，旖旎的颐和园；碧波荡漾的北海，小巧玲珑的团城.......这一切都让我神迷！蓝天白云，高楼环路，这亦让我流连往返！我爱北京，不仅因为她是我居住的城市，更重要的是，她带给我梦魂牵绕的心灵徜徉的享受！
40,“我爱首都！”,北京是国际化大都市，有着各种各样的人，黑色的，白色的，黄色的；北京也是一个很传统的城市，故宫、紫禁城、颐和园；我能够从北京这座城市中感受到现代化带来的冲击，也能够体会到历史所带来的积淀。
50,“北京城赞”,千年老城 北京确实是旅游中不可或缺的一个大城市 悠久的历史 沉郁的古味 徘徊老街 感受着老城的问题 一个好 赞 推荐
40,“中国北京 首都挺好”,中国北京 首都挺好 北京有着丰富的历史文化的沉淀 机场挺漂亮的 交通也方便 就是上下班时有些堵 公交刷卡成人4毛 地铁2快 机场线除外 天安门广场 长城 故宫 清华北大 鸟巢 前门 都应该去看看。。。。。
50,“环境”,北京，中华人民共和国的首都，环境相当不错，道路宽大整洁，交通也是非常方便，空气质量比以前要好得很多，景点也很多，真的不错
50,“历史的聚集”,历史味浓重的北京城，将中华五千年的文华聚集于一身。让人无时无刻都感觉到那股陈陈浪头扑面而来。绝对不会让你失望~~~~~~~~~
50,“首都”,作为祖国的政治经济文化中心，北京渐渐成为国际大都市，越发成为世界各地友人的旅游胜地，我为祖国的未来骄傲，为中国的崛起自豪，同时祝福祖国的每天更美好、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、
50,“故宫”,进去就让自己亲身体会到以前古代中国是多么的昌盛！里面的石像，雕刻，是那么的精致。有一种回到过去的感觉。让人不停的想要感叹祖国的伟大。！
40,“历史 现代 创新 封建 根深蒂固 酷”,真正意义上的冲突，不同的地区不同的品行，不同的人文，不同的风景，皇家，政治，历史，匆匆的过客带来的重大而且不可磨灭的改变。
40,"“文明, 現代化, 景點多”","相隔二十多年重臨北京, 變化很大, 十分先進. 人們在巴士站有秩序地排隊. 很是難得. 北京很多景點值得遊覽, 首選故宮, 萬里長城, 奧運館..."
50,“北京城，文化底蕴浓厚的城市”,上京城，古装剧里面的常用语，在新时代，我们进京就是真实感受京城的文化底蕴，感受城市中的文化，处处都会发现文化的深度。看看京符号，听听京片子，给自己做文化梦的机会。
30,“北京”,公交车太堵，地铁很方便~人太多~~公共厕所需改善~~清华北门保安素质很低~~四环以内房价太贵~~四环以外又太远~~狗不理很好吃~~哈哈
40,“现代与古代的结合”,非常漂亮的城市，在那里不仅有漂亮的牡丹花，还有经典的古迹，是个不可多得的地方。而且城市也建设的很好，空气也非常干净。
40,“ein Tip für Kulinarik und Kultur”,"Die Stadt ist wirklich spitze und auch für Europäer sauber, das Essen ist abwechslungsreich und spitze...jeder sollte die wahre chinesische Küche versuchen, zudem sind die Hotels super günstig und das zu vergleichbarer 4 Stern Qualität in Österreich und Deutschland.Ein Erlebnis für sich sind die verrückten Taxifahrer. Wichtig ist jedoch dass man alles in chinesischer Sprache hat (Hotelnamen, Straßennamen usw) weil englisch spricht man höchstens im Hotel oder man hat einen chinesischen Reiseführer"
30,“Smog oder Nebel?”,"Dreimal war ich bisher in peking und jedesmal war von frischer Luft keine Spur. Ist das Smog oder Nebel? ich tippe auf verschmutzte Luft. Insgesamt hat mir Peking nicht besonders gefallen. Die ""verbotene Stadt"" ist ein Muss. Der ""Platz des himmlischen Friedens"" natürlich auch! Hoteltipp: Ritz-Carlton oder Intercontinental Financial District. Sehr gute Hotels zu vernünftigen Preisen."
50,“北京”,北京很美，走在北京的街上，到处充满现代化气息，走在古老的胡同里，感受古老王朝的气息，走在中关村的街上，看看时代的进步
50,“老北京的风采”,去年的8月份的时候去北京旅游，发现北京的人文地理都非常的好，尤其是北京人特别的热情，如果找人问路的话都特别的耐心与热情不但告诉具体位置还帮你直接带领过去。到了北京的鸟巢和水立方的时候心里特激动，感到了做为中国人的一种骄傲，而且鸟巢和水立方的景色太让人着迷了，尤其是晚上的时候。又去了故宫和长城，在故宫的时候终于体会到了皇室的风采和中华五千年的历史，站在长城上的时候发现景色真的很美，可以感受到这万里长城永不倒的精神。晚上的骑着自行车在故宫的周围和北海公园转转，路过很多有意思的地方，晚上最好在北京的鬼街吃饭，那有很多的美食，有羊蝎的火锅、香辣的小龙虾、香辣蟹、海鲜等等好吃的，我去吃了羊蝎的火锅真是美味，大块的羊脆骨、大块的羊肉真的很正宗很美味，真是意犹未尽啊！有时间的话希望有很多喜欢旅游的人们可以去首都看看，真的很让人难忘！
30,“北京游”,"北京是中国的首都,到了那里就感到首都的魅力,不过天气实在是冷到骨子里头.北京的故宫应该去看看,不错!天安门早上的升旗仪式也颇壮观!之后就是尽享北京的美食拉!!"
40,“韵味北京”,"北京这座城市,要细细的品味.现在的北京糅合了古老和现代的气息.老北京的文化,是一本读不完的书,现代的北京是一本难读懂的书."
40,“后海的夏天”,6月的夏日早晨，骑车徜徉在后海的微风和阳光里，感受着老北京的文化和底蕴，那是记忆犹新的一段回忆~北京，希望你的天空一如奥运后般湛蓝 o(∩_∩)o
40,“北京小吃”,很喜欢北京的小吃，尤其是翅酷的烤鸡翅，真的很好吃，只是人很多，没有订位子的只能打包在外面吃，不过你避开高峰期，一般不用订位也可以进去吃的。
50,“我爱北京”,在北京生活7年，经历了奥运！看着北京一点点变得更加美丽，钟爱北京的豆汁，那酸酸的味道。喜欢北京的美食，应用尽有。喜欢去故宫、后海、颐和园、、、北京出行交通便利，价格很便宜，出租车师傅态度不错1
40,“Viel besser als erwartet”,"Peking, die Hauptstadt Chinas, ist natürlich als eine der größten Städte Chinas sehr frequentiert. Der Straßenverkehr ist unglaublich stark und man braucht im Vergleich sehr lange von einem Ort zum anderen. Andererseits ist das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz sehr gut ausgebaut und ermöglicht es, die Ziele ohne Stau auch sehr gut zu erreichen. Die Fußgängerzone ist zwar nicht sehr groß, aber sehenswert. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten sind im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes sehenswert: Ob es der Platz des Himmlischen Friedesn, der Kaiserpalast, der Sommerpalast oder der Himmelstempel ist: Ich würde keine Besichtigung missen wollen. Die Mentalität der Bewohner ist natürlich sehr unterschiedlich von unserer. Die Sprache Englisch ist bei Weiter nicht so verbreitet wie man nach der Olympiade annehmen würde. Man sollte also immer etwas in Papierform in chinesischer Schrift dabei haben, wenn man unterwegs ist, damit man auch dort ankommt, wo man hin will.Fazit: eine sehr sehenswerte Stadt mit kleinen Abstrichen"
40,“我爱北京天安门”,大到不得了，爽到爆的二十四小时的步行让北京首先给我这样的感觉。古老文明和现代时尚的激情碰撞，古老文明和现代时尚的完美融合。
50,“我的另一个家”,在这里我遇见了我生命中的另一半，感谢这座城市，让我收获了事业和爱情。在这里我们拥有了自己的家，我好幸福，北京，我爱你！
50,“古都的国槐”,每个城市的街道都不一样，北京的路上，最美的是国槐。细碎的绿叶黝黑的树干，配旁边砖红的城墙，古都气息尽显。冬天北京的糖炒栗子十分美好。风景上，皇家气魄的颐和园、旖旎弯折的后海众胡同，体验过可以说来过了。再加上充满光环的天安门和故宫，那就真的是来过了。想走上一条充盈着国槐的人行道，恐怕只有京都。
50,“多元化城市”,如果说单一是优点，那么北京就是多个优点的集合。这里清晨有升旗，上午有毛主席纪念馆，中午有各色菜馆，下午有优雅的安静的公园，晚上有和天上一样星星闪亮的写字楼。故宫城墙是一环，地铁二号线是二环，随着环数的增加，地域、人口几何倍数增长，伴随的各种优点、缺点都融入在这个多元化城市了。
50,“古朴的北京城”,幽深的胡同 幽静的北海 雄伟的城墙 甜甜的冰糖葫芦 都是让你爱上这座稳重城市的原因 走在北京繁华的西单 不由得感叹岁月的变迁 如此之大
50,“沉淀着历史底蕴又兼具时尚的城市”,北京虽然是一座历史文化名城，但到过北京后才发现它所蕴含的绝不仅仅如此，它犹如一个满怀童心的老人，咋一看满是沧桑，仔细观察却发现它的798、后海、南铜锣巷无一不透露出时尚的气息。北京是一座需要仔细体会，慢慢品味的城市。
30,"“boomende GROSS-Stadt, aber noch sehr chinesisch”","Eine wirkliche GROSS-Stadt, die einen zwiespältigen Eindruck bei mir hinterlassen hat. Zum einen ist Peking -ähnlich wie Los Angeles auch - sehr groß, denn man hatte Platz und hat sich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes breit gemacht, dafür gibt es nur wenige Hochhäuser. Aber: 20+ Millionen Menschen wollen wohnen, leben, arbeiten und U-Bahn fahren. Also sind die Dimensionen, auch wenn sie von den Einwohnern selbst gern verniedlicht werden (""..es liegt gleich um die Ecke"", gemeint sind aber 5 Kilometer) nicht zu unterschätzen. Der Autoverkehr bricht zu den drei Rushhours morgens, mittags und abends regelmäßig auf 5 oder mehr spuren zusammen und auch in der U-Bahn und in den Bussen wird es dann ziemlich eng. Chinesen sind übrigens für den effektiven Einsatz ihrer Ellebogen bekannt. Das mag Europäern oder Amerikanern unhöflich erscheinen, regt hier aber niemanden auf.Dagegen ist das Essen in Peking, selbst in den Ausgehvierteln wie HuBai, noch sehr ursprünglich - und teilweise zu Recht - sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig. Man kann es nicht oft genug sagen, aber das Essen beim Chinesen in der Fussgängerzone um die Ecke hat ÜBERHAUPT NICHTS mit dem tatsächlichen Essen - zumindest in Peking - zu tun. Der Geschmack des Peking-Essens ist eher schlapp, es gibt viele braune Soßen und Suppen mit viel Ingwer und Knoblauch, und zum Teil abenteuerlichen Einlagen (Bauchspeck ist da noch das Harmloseste). Nicht jeder Manns Sache, würde ich vermuten. Auch Skorpione (lebend auf einen Spieß gesteckt und erst beim Kauf frittiert) sind nichts für jeden :-).Aber es gibt an fast jeder Ecke ganz hervorragende Nudelsuppen, die man mit den Zutaten nach eigenem Gusto würzen kann.Nervend fand ich hingegen nur die Angebote in den Fußgängerzonen oder auf der Partymeile, bei denen einem mehr oder weniger öffentlich aber ziemlich aufdringlich junge Damen zu Niedrigstpreisen und tolle Massagen angeboten wurden. Beides ist auf privater Basis in China selbstverständlich verboten und lässt auf Touristennepp schliessen (das Gespräch beginnt i.d.R. auf Englisch: ""excuse me Sir, can I ask you something..."" um dann schnell zum eigentlichen Thema zu kommen.). Man sollte aber standhaft bleiben und am besten bin ich mit dem Tip eines Tourguides gefahren: Nicht hinsehen, nicht hinhören, nichts sagen...denn wenn man lächelnd und dankend ablehnt ist das nur das Signal: ""gleich kauft er was..."""
50,“古典与现代交融的生活之旅”,白日的什刹海与鼓楼静静地看着人们川流不息，夜晚的酒吧街将这份古老的宁静与现代的喧嚣完美结合。皇城根遗址公园的恬静，紫禁城里的巍峨，国家大剧院的雄伟，东四与西四胡同里地道的北京美食，东单与西单引领着潮流趋势，一切都在北京里完美的融合，感受着皇城文化、故都风韵，享受着现代生活，还有哪里比北京更适合在生活中发现美，在生活中享受旅行的乐趣？
30,“王府井的杂酱面”,到北京，到王府井，北京的特色杂酱面不得不尝一尝。结果令我失望。如果每个城市的地道的特色小吃都能在“到到”中了解，应该很诱人。
30,“变化不少啊！”,为迎接奥运会北京做了不少准备，马路变宽敞了，房子变得更具特色。但唯一不好的就是饮食，比较难找到一些物美价廉的食品，很难满足其他地方口味的人群。
30,“交通”,经常堵车，不过我想将来会好的，市政正在努力办，新的地下交通网正在形成，希望北京以后的地面交通和，地下交通愈来愈好。能辐射到河北周边包括张家口地区等等。。。。。。。。。。。。。
50,“决战紫禁城”,一个文化底蕴深厚的城市，一个充满历史痕迹的城市，一个现代与古代交汇的城市，玩遍北京城，吃遍北京城，决战紫禁之巅~
40,“北京市”,北京市是我们的首都，文化的中心，政治的中心，必须得看看，代表建筑有故宫，长城，天安门，大家一定要去看，不看白活一辈子了。
50,“爱上北京的秋天，爱上秋天的北京”,爱上北京的秋天，爱上秋天的北京——2009年10月，再次来到北京，北京的阳光，北京的微风，北京的蓝天，北京的朋友和来到北京的朋友，都那么让我难忘……也许是因为一个人，爱上一个城吧！
40,“北京是理想的居住地”,北京是中国政治文化经济中心，是全中国人都向往的地方。历史的底蕴深厚。人文景观很多。自然风光也很美。越来越现代，已经成为国际大都市。
50,“伟大的祖国首都”,北京市我们伟大的祖国首都。是我们国家的政治、经济、文化的中心。它见证了我们国家改革开放以来的巨大发展，是每个中国人都向往去的地方！
30,“人多市闹”,总的来说，北京还不是一个人居住的好地方。旅游人也很多，走到哪里都是人，到北京看景倒不如说是看人！吃的还好，住的也可以吧！！！
50,“文化之都”,作为首都它浓重的历史文化无可比拟，身在其中感受到中国建筑的宏伟、富丽、尊贵。感受天安门的磅礴气势和敬畏之情。为之感慨，为之振奋！
50,“怎一个好字了得”,"这是个不同于其他城市的城市,有着都市的繁华,小市井的生活;也有着行色匆匆,悠闲漫步;还有着底蕴文化,潮流前卫.那里,包罗万象,总有你喜欢的河泥寻找的."
40,“大气的城市”,城市很现代，文化和自然资源并存，9-10月去是最滋润的季节，天气有些干燥，时有风沙，但是独特的城市机理，文化的底蕴，让人回味。
40,“总体印象”,北京是中国的首都，是中国的政治、文化和金融中心，它有着悠久的历史和人文景观，是一座充满深厚文化底蕴和现代化水平的国际大都市，它既古朴典雅又现化时尚，但不适合居住。
50,“非常好的城市”,北京城市给人感觉很人性化，绿化等各方面都好，因为去的时候大部分做地铁，觉得交通也非常方便，加之如今地铁覆盖面越来越广，总之认为非常非常好
50,“北京-世界游客必去的一个地方”,北京很好玩，推荐一个吃朝鲜冷面的地方：府右街和文津街和西安门大街交口，北大妇女儿童医院对面的一个饭馆。叫华天冷面。10块一碗。辣牛肉15每盘。这里都有几十年的历史了，味道从没变过。希望你能来尝尝吧？
50,“繁华的地方”,这北京要去全聚德吃一次烤鸭，还有天安门附近有家炸酱面也不错。好玩得地方我比较偏向长城和各大名校得校园也是值得一逛得。
40,“北京车多，”,去年10月去北京培训到的是国家图书馆。国图的新馆真好看，t特别是从新馆最高处往下看的时候非常气派!里面的各种设备也没得说，设计的人真了不起啊!
50,“北京ダック”,北京の料理は日本人にとてもあう。どの都市に行っても同じ。特に北京ダックはとてもおいしい。日本で食べる北京ダックと少したれの味が違うかも？ゼンシュトクと言うお店でチェ－ン店になっていてどの店も味は同じだが本店は少し違う。日本人には解りにくい場所にありツアーでは行かない。是非探して行ってみるとよい。又機会があればサソリの唐揚げもおいしい。王府陳へ行ってチャレンジする事を勧めたい。
40,“北京交通不是很好”,北京的路虽然宽，但是，交通一点都不好，北京毕竟是首都，交通太堵塞了，尤其是上下班高峰期。其他北京都还好。我也很喜欢北京
50,“北京，快乐的地方”,别人把北京看得很神圣，因为它是首都，因为它有故宫之类的巍峨历史沉淀。俺对北京的感觉却相对轻松好多，就是个游玩很便宜、出行交通很方便也很白菜的快乐好地方。呵呵，因为我跑北京玩时，包括北海公园等地方都没花过半分钱，而出行做公交，那时只花了一元钱买了张票从头做到尾，再用这张票上了其他车，哈哈，SO这才是一个普通游客乐哉的地方
30,“北京的那几天”,学校采风去北京诶，北京的天气就不用说了。北京的公园我很喜欢一个人做公交到北海公园自己玩。自娱自乐哈哈喜欢古建筑
40,“从童年到成年的回忆”,最早去北京是四岁的事情，也是数次北京之行最为欢乐的记忆。2005年6月的漫天柳絮、2007年1月的最后一场雪、玉渊潭公园里的杂志社……
40,“具有时代气息”,古城与时尚的结合，走进中心城区，古老的建筑让人驻足，步入金融区，鳞次栉比的楼厦，让人不禁感叹。北京大的惊人，郊区更是美不胜收。
40,“一走古老而又充满人文气息的城市”,在北京待了有7年了，北京是一座古老而又现代化的城市，古老的是城市的建筑，四合院，老长城，还有很多的古建筑。现代的也是建筑，有鸟巢，水立方，国家大剧院。
40,“古色北京”,北京给我的第一印象就是：古色古香。交错相通的胡同，保持着淳朴风气的四合院，再加上许多的文明古迹，北京简直是给我们现在的世人展示了他一贯的古风！
50,“空气不太好”,这里空气相对于二三线城市不算太好。而且去哪人都很多。。早晚高峰最好不要乘坐地铁、公交，节假日不要去什么王府井这样的地方。。人实在太多。。但是总的说来，名胜古迹很多，要是都玩遍估计得半个来月。。欢迎来北京
50,“政治文化中心”,北京是古老中国的首都，现今又是中华人民共和国的首都，大器，登上长城，一览众山小，想当年匈奴，进入故宫，想当年历朝皇族，今天下平等，故宫也能去几回，不过中南海还是不能去。北京是个大城市，比较宽容，外地人很多，因此排外性不大，本是一个大溶炉，只要我们努力，北京的明天会更好。
50,“北京---文化名城”,说实话，不少人来这边旅游都是冲着名声古迹来的，但是我觉得最让人喜欢北京的，是他浓厚的地文化底蕴，从小胡同中的文化，到人文生活的习惯，无一不显露出这座城市的迷人文化气息！
40,“感受过两次的北京~”,前不久才从北京旅游回来，这次是选择自由行，所以，跟之前去的感受还是相当不太一样的！北京这些年改变了不少，特别繁华，有许多国际上知名的大品牌入驻北京各大商场~十分奢华！还有最难忘的属北京的交通，北京话说是四通发达。地铁贯穿你所有想去的地方，但是我这次去几乎少有坐地铁，因为地铁站首先很难找，其次步行会是一段很长的路程，有的远的地铁站几乎让你得在烈日下走近40、50分钟！特别累人~搭公交吧，人特别多，很少可以有位置坐，而且由于我们是学生，每当看到老年人上车就会让座位，一站就是很长时间，所以特别累！还有北京的公交，最有趣的是，即便它途经你待的这一站，它也不会停，它只按自己的公交线路安排的走！因此，我认为设计得很不科学，很不人性化~~基本上，我们差不多选择打的! 北京的的士10块钱起步，相比较比许多城市的出租车起步价要高。但北京又老爱堵车，尤其是傍晚在长安街那处时，你就得坐在车上苦等~但除这些以外，北京着实是个旅游的圣地！有皇城的文化底蕴，有现今的潮流时尚，有老北京的特色美食，又掺杂着各种外来美食；有个性前沿分子汇聚的后海酒吧，有三里屯！还有购物的好去处西单 每天下午品尝下三元梅园的杏仁豆腐、红果酪！ 去前门喝碗大碗茶 吃回全聚德烤鸭 晚上可以去簋街吃各类火锅、麻辣虾球、红油牛蛙~北京特色的驴肉火烧~！最后，如果您是第一次去，别忘了去恭王府，那里有专人讲解，带你喝回茶，听段戏，不过很短~想听得过瘾，就去老舍茶馆坐坐，那里可以听戏喝茶还能点餐吃饭，省事省心，当回享受~~
30,“王者之气”,就是风沙大，有点冷，吃的东西倒是可以，人情味不好，打车不贵，羊蝎子好吃，故宫还想没什么好看得，街上警察特别多，治安好，
40,“首都，北京”,文化底蕴深厚， 名胜古迹意犹未尽， 交通经济便利。气候干燥，食物不尽人意。细看故宫，需数日，如走马观花，一日尚可，需自备干粮。国子监，孔庙同在一处，清晨细品，颇具灵气。漫步颐和园，圆明园，感受清朝的没落。
40,“首都，激动”,去过北京几次，整体上感觉还不错。长城、故宫、颐和园、帝王陵等，都很有欣赏价值！但是，北京人好多呀，无论是坐地铁、乘公交车还是打出租车，都感觉人巨多！不过我还有点遗憾，没有看升国旗！
40,“挺好的”,大学四年的地方，很喜欢，特别是春天的时候，很美。每次出去玩都会发现新的事物，让充满好奇心的我一直都很喜欢它。希望自己有更多的时间去北京。
50,“I love Beijing”,说实话，北京并不是一个可与海南之类的绝顶旅游经典媲美的地方，但是北京确实是个美食圣地，历史人文类景点堪称NB，特别推荐恭王府花园，一定要请导游，她们会给你讲一些野史，还有摄影爱好者一定去故宫，其雄伟简直。。。牛
40,“beijing”,从小向往的神圣地方，祖国的首都，领袖居住的地方，她传承了我国古代建筑的精华，又吸收了现代文明的光芒， 7环，8环，9环路， 那是现代房地产业催生的骄傲。
30,“北京不是我理想的地方”,北京的人多路拥挤，我不喜欢那，尤其是在哪工作，在哪玩还可以，不过玩的地方不少，我差不多都去过了，不过没有太好玩的。
40,“Wirklich sehenswerte Stadt!”,"Peking ist wirklich eine sehenswerte Stadt!- Verbotene Stadt,- Platz des himmlischen Friedens,- Tempelanlagen (Himmelstempel)sind tolle und einzigartige Sehenswürdigkeiten.Die Chinesen, die wir getroffen haben, sind sehr freundlich und aufgeschlossen."
50,“夜色天安门”,"记得小时候经常听到一段歌词""我爱北京天安门，天安门上红旗飘""。到北京出差后真的就亲眼目睹了天安门，而且是夜色中的天安门没景。但红旗飘的景象只能白天再来欣赏了。"
40,“不错”,不愧是首都 虽然没去过唐家岭 但是首都的整体布局已经很让人惊叹了 快节奏的生活 干净的环境 逐步升高的素质 让人新生向往
50,“路过的城市”,每次回家都要在北京市下火车，人很多，道路很宽敞，车流量很大，每次去火车南站的时候，人的队伍都要排很长，等着坐公交。北京市的景点也很多，例如：长城、故宫、什刹海、清华北大里的湖与树。
30,“eine stadt mit vielen gegensätzen”,"wenn man in peking mit dem taxi aus dem flughafengebäude fährt, sieht man zuerst graue, hohe betonhäuser und man hat nicht wirklich einen guten eindruck. die architektur verändert sich nicht gross bis zum stadtzentrum, doch dort ähnelt peking einem ""downtown"" der USA. es hat viele geschäfte, restaurants, beauty salons, usw.ich habe die sicherheit in peking sehr geschätzt, ich konnte überall auch in der nacht herumlaufen.einerseits gibt es das beeindruckende stadtzentrum mit den wolkenkratzern, andererseits gibt es kleine steinhäuser gerade nebendran.die stadt ist eine sehr gute destination für leute, die das moderne china sehen wollen."
50,“北京是我老婆的目标，也就是我的目标。”,北京是我们大学美好时光的存放，是辛苦工作的回放，是美满生活的希望之所在。不论从政治经济文化各个方面来讲，北京都是北方人最好的选择。南方人也有很多爱上这个地方的。我希望北京越来越美好。
40,“北京映像”,北京，终于来到这里。到处透着古老的气息。故宫里高高的红墙，深邃而神秘。威严而庄重。是值得每一个中国人到的好地方啊。
50,“北京”,首都，道路宽敞，城市卫生非常好，名胜古迹，世界文化遗产，天安门，八达岭，故宫，清华大学，香山，人民大会堂等。小吃：全聚德，都一处等很多。
50,“不愧是首都”,北京是一个很干净的地方，我去过很多次，好几次专门为了爬香山，凌晨坐火车赶过去，北京的旅游景点很多，去过很多地方，不过一直没有想过要照相，所以都没有相片，很多的好吃的，好玩的，就连马路上都干干净净，很吸引人
40,“太有意思了”,北京的科技馆非常适合各地的家长带孩子去玩。这个暑假朋友带全家人来北京，儿子当上了小主人，两个孩子玩得很高兴，家长也被孩子的兴奋心情感染了！
50,“北京，我爱你”,生活在南京，向往的城市却是北京，怀念北京胖胖的酸奶，俏江南，冰糖葫芦，驴打滚，江米条，山楂汁，新天地，想念工体边上的酒吧。。。
40,“环境卫生，城市规划好”,北京地大，路大，车多，但是环境卫生整体还是让人满意的，城市规划方面也很超前，京腔还挺好听的，我们福州有很多可以借鉴的地方。。。
40,“一个复古现代化的城市”,交通方面 购物 旅游很安逸， 奥运会时是一座很干净的城市 觉得 有钱才可以 生活那里 不认房子是没不起的 旅游下可以的 呵呵
20,“北京印象”,大，街道很宽阔，但是太干燥，灰尘太多，公交车售票员态度恶劣，打工的人太多，整个城市感觉不安静，没有宁静的气息，很嘈杂，不喜欢
50,“北京好”,北京市 因为20080808奥运会的举办 整个城市的基础设施飞速提升 城市建设日新月异 欢迎世界各地的朋友来北京旅游。北京欢迎你！
40,“Beste Reisezeit”,Beste Reisezeit April bis Juni und Oktober. Juli und August sehr heiss und schwuehl
50,“玩的地太多了”,想在北京玩，实在是选择太多太多了。而且，在北京，富人有富人的玩法，穷人有穷人的玩法，什么样的经济条件都能找到适合自己的方式。
50,“我爱北京天安门”,北京首都这几年的变化越来越大，越来越多的新建筑油然而生，喜欢它的菊儿胡同，喜欢他的SOHU.喜欢北京故宫，等等等等呢个 有机会还要去
40,“北京 首都我来了”,北京是中国的首都 每个中国人有机会都应该去看一下 不到长城非好汉 国际大都市 浓郁的学术氛围 去看了绝部后悔 鸟巢和水立方一定要去看看
40,"“大气的北京,人文的北京”","来北京十年了,虽然有种种不如意,但去了这么多城市,感觉北京越来越像自己的家,虽然北京气候很干燥,对于我这个从南方来的人皮肤受不了,但一年一年的适应,也可以接受了,反而是南方的潮湿,阴冷更让我受不了,我还是喜欢北京暖洋洋的太阳...还有北京有各种文化社团,各种艺术社区,比如我最爱的798,不用花太多的钱,就可以流连一整天,这感觉真好."
50,“北京一夜”,北京的诱人之处难以形容，他是成熟的、又是妖娆的，有远古的气息，又有现代的步伐，每次去，因为地点不同，总要徜徉于这个城市的边边角角，我的感觉是，北京，是一个充满梦想的地方。
50,“我爱北京”,我是非常喜欢北京的 我爱这里的人 爱这里的深厚文化气息 爱这里几千年的建筑 我喜欢一个人坐在长安街上 有机会我一定回定居在北京
50,“北京很好”,北京地铁好而不贵，次序好。故宫，那座美丽的紫禁城。长城，不到长城非好汉。颐和园，天坛，香山等地方都很不错。北京是一座真正的和谐城市。
50,“Kulturstadt im Wandel”,"Faszinierende Stadt mit vielen Ecken und Kanten und immer mehr U-Bahnlinien. Neben den zahlreichen oft beschriebenen Highlights sind es oft kleine Geschichten, die die Stadt interessant machen. Z.B. das ausgebrannte aber immer noch stehende 20stöckige Nebengebäude des imposanten CCTV-Turms, das durch Feuerwerk komplett zerstört wurde und nun als ungewolltes Mahnmal die Stadt bereichert. Außerdem nett: Allabendlicher Markt in Wudaokou."
50,“我现在生活的城市--北京”,不知不觉已经在北京工作生活了七年。时间过得真快。北京这个城市有很大的包容性，汇聚国内外，国际友人。希望北京越来越好！
50,“好”,总所周知，北京是中国的首都，既是文化名城，又是历史名城。与2008年举办了29届奥运会，吸引了众多中外游客，使它的地位又上升了一层
50,“现代 绿色”,北京的大街小巷充满了现代感，同时也非常干净，处处都有一抹绿色，我很喜欢，我也非常愿意来北京玩，也会推荐给我的朋友来到这里，真的很漂亮
50,“穿梭在北京”,在北京的大街小巷里寻找着地道的北京小吃，在不经意中总能寻找到百年老店。都是那种代代相传的手艺，超棒，我爱北京。
40,“北京”,北京是一座古老而奢华的贵族城市，其积累了我国胡汉等多民族的文明成果，是人们向往的政治圣地，权力的发源地，民主的纽带。
40,“拥挤的大城市”,大城市，但是人太多了，总感觉自己很渺小，没有家的感觉。交通挺方便，也很便宜，比很多城市都便宜。关机打四折做一次四毛，地铁两元随便坐
40,“Sightseeing - Shopping”,"In vielen Reiseberichten über Beijing werden das Flair, die Sehenswürdigkeiten und die generellen High Lights einer Metropolenreise angepriesen.Nachfolgend möchte ich auf die Besonderheiten einer kombinierten Sightseeing- und Shoppingtour eingehen.Als erstes muss hier erwähnt werden das der individuelle Personenverkehr (Taxis) ein ausgesprochen preisgünstiger und komfortabeler Weg sind die geplanten Ziele der Stadt zu erreichen. Planung in Bezug auf das „abarbeiten“ einer zuvor erstellten Einkaufsliste ist jedoch Pflicht und diese Liste sollte möglichst detailliert vor Ab- beziehungsweise Anreise vorliegen.Mit Hilfe des Internets kann man sich bereits zu Hause über das Preisgefüge der Einkaufsliste ausreichend informieren. Es ist auch nicht das Ziel diese Berichtes die bekannten Fake Tempel (Silkmarket oder ähnliche) hervorzuheben. Hier muss man sowieso vorher wissen ob es Ziel ist die bekannten Billigprodukte zu erstehen oder ob man sich auf wirkliche Produkte „Made in China“ konzentriert.Aus meiner Erfahrung ist bei diesen Produkten - Kleidung vom Schneider, Brillen vom Optiker, Musikinstrumente vom Hersteller und oder alles was der Hobbymarkt anbietet – ein weitaus größeres Sparpotential vorhanden. Aber „Vorsicht“ auch hier muss gehandelt werden und es ist notwendig sich vorher Gedanken über den Preis für die Produkte zu machen. Zum Beispiel bekomme ich eine Brille mit „normalen“ Gläsern auch schon für knapp 40 Euro im Deutschen Internet ohne die Flugreise nach Beijing einzuplanen. Bei Gleitsichtgläsern oder hohen Glasstärken sieht das aber schon wieder ganz anders aus und hier kann man ohne viel Verhandlungsgeschick eine Menge Geld sparen. Die erwähnten Musikinstrumente sind ein weiteres gutes Beispiel. Streichinstrumente, Gitarren, Blech- und Holzblasinstrumente sind in der höherwertigen Kategorie als tolle Schnäppchen erhältlich. Hier gilt die Regel mit „know how“ Einkaufen gehen und dabei viel Geld sparen. Bei Kleidung muss man die Stoffqualitäten beurteilen können. Das Angebot ist riesig und die Fertigungsqualität (die Handwerkskunst) ausgezeichnet.Also auf geht’s nach Beijing oder auch in eine andere Metropole Chinas zur Shoppingtour. Je nach Größe der Einkaufsliste sollte se durch die Einsparungen möglich sein den Flugpreis zu kompensieren."
30,“我生活的城市”,2006年开始在北京生活，去过颐和园、去过故宫、去过北海，在后海逛过街，也去商场淘过打折的东西，总之比除了人多，好玩好看的东西也多，但是要论生活真的不是很适合。
40,“美丽的北京”,是有古老文化的城市，长安街雄伟的大道，北京联合大学北京理科二本大学排名北京航空航天大学北京联合大学 分数线北京科技大学 我认为北京大学是最漂亮的
50,“梦开始的地方”,可以玩得很现实，也可以玩得很梦幻。皇城根，古城墙，大街小巷——只有北京的大街小巷才会如此的名副其实。推荐从西单一路走到国贸，北京的中轴线。
40,“深厚的历史文化底蕴”,北京有着得天独厚的历史文化底蕴，是全国政治、经济、文化中心，坐拥首都的便利，交通、饮食、住宿都不错，市民素质较高，但就是人太多，交通拥挤。
40,“人文城市”,整体感觉还不错。首都嘛，人的素质总体比较高，古老与现代并存。交通票价在全国应该算是数得上的便宜，但也是超级堵。不过生活成本也很高啊
50,“北京我爱你”,今年上半年去了五次北京，每次去都给我留下深刻的印象。北京通过奥运会，对整个城市提升非常快。不仅干净卫生，秩序井然，而且人的素质非常好。就拿问路来说，北京人非常热情，给你指引的路非常详细，感谢北京人，感谢北京这个城市。
10,“der schlummernde Drache”,"Jeden Tag wird ein neues Hochhaus fertiggestellt, täglich werden über 3000 neue Autos angemeldet - es brummt auf den Strassen und die Stadt wird modern - leider mit Verkehrschaos und Luftverschmutzung. Fahrraeder sind nur noch eine Randerscheinung"
50,“历史悠久的城市”,会去北京是因为想看看闻名已久的故宫、长城等等的古迹当然并没有让我失望，这是一个会让人又意外惊喜的城市我喜欢
20,“タクシー”,タクシーに乗車拒否を何度もされた。どうも、長距離や空港に行く場合ならＯＫのようだ。近場はＮＧのよう。行き先をホテルの名刺を渡して伝えたが拒否された。しかも一台だけでなく何台ものタクシーに同様に。中国語ができないので、何を言われたかよくわからず。最後は強引にのり、なんとか目的地に行くことができた。
50,“Geschichte in Peking”,Ein Großteil der Geschichte Chinas liegt eindeutig in Peking. Die Stadt ist so toll mit ihren Sehenswürdigkeiten. Da muss man mal gewesen sein. man Braucht aber gute Laufschuhe um die Touren zum Sommerpalast oder zum Himmelstempel zu überstehen.....Ich gehe jetzt das zweite mal hin. Großartige Stadt!!!!
40,“空港が広すぎる！”,人のマナーにびっくりすることもありますが、ホテルや空港、レストランなど、人の集まるところは一定の基準を満たしているので、高齢の両親を連れて行ったのですが、特に問題なく楽しんでこれました。
30,“繁华的北京”,第一次来到北京，总觉得不适应。我不喜欢那里的面条，北京的有些地方，让人说不出来的感受。但是在天安门、紫禁城的面前时，却又感受到这座古城散发出来的魅力。我无法不承认，那样的宏伟壮观，让我突然觉得自己的渺小。北京，要感受中国的地方，就去北京。
50,“很喜欢”,去了那么多次北京，对于这个城市的印象还是很好的，不知道为什么会喜欢这个城市，但是这个城市会给我一个很舒服的感觉，说不出来的，就是很喜欢
40,“好看不好玩”,在北京三年，走了不少地方，有些地方很雄伟，有些地方很现代，有些地方还是很偏僻没开发，要说纯粹的玩纯粹的风光旅游，我觉得北京不是个好地方，比如那个颐和园，装点出来的风景比之江南太过逊色了。可是心中对北京的感情，就好像我妈妈一样，总是心里的一个精神坐标。我妈妈总觉得看到了天安门，看到了毛主席，她的北京之行就圆满了，可对于更多80后而言，到北京，总归要看看长城、北大清华、中南海等地方，这些地方就是纯粹看.等我离开北京的时候，我和母亲分别在故宫拍下了这样的照片，回到家乡，跟人说，去过了北京。
50,“很有文化气息的城市”,去过很多次北京，每次都有新发现，南锣鼓巷，烟袋斜街等等都很有“京味儿”，听说开展京西游，很值得去看一看，下次再去个新地方
50,“我爱祖国，我爱北京。”,我爱祖国我爱北京，北京烤鸭是非常的好吃，如果到北京不吃北京烤鸭那就太遗憾了，还要去看故宫，爬长城，吃烤鸭，这是到北京去必备的事。
50,“超级喜欢”,今年年前到东北绕了一大圈，发现北京是里面最好玩的城市之一，历史悠久又有文化底蕴，还有最现代化最方便的东西，很喜欢，下雪更好玩了，没见过雪的我对此相当兴奋啊~
40,“一度は訪れたい”,個人旅行で１０日ばかり滞在した。やはり、見所は多いし、歩くけど、それだけの価値はある。　定番コースを見るだけで1週間くらいゆっくりとしたいところ。グルメは、美味いものはあるが、同じ中国でも上海のほうが店が多く美味いと思う。一人一人は親切だが、鉄道職員や空港スタッフは総じて態度が良くない。　乗せてやっているという感じ。でも、一度は訪れたい街。個人旅行は、ネットやガイドブックが頼りだが、特に北京は最新版でなくては役立たない。　これはポイント。
30,“吃的”,涮羊肉好好吃哦3西单的甲不甲不也好吃!动物园的衣服好便宜！西单卖衣服的 人好凶也很会敲诈大家去西单要小心点噢
50,“北京市是一座文化城”,"北京是一座文化城市,天安门、长城、故宫都是必游之地，还素有不到长城非好汉之称，文化气息也非常的浓厚，是一座非常不错的城市！"
40,“南锣鼓巷很有味道”,春天的时候在北京闲逛了两天，去了著名的鸟巢和水立方，感受了一下曾经的奥运气氛。南锣鼓巷是下午去的，游荡在胡同里的感觉很好。
40,“北京”,"现在的北京和十几年前不一样了.原先的旧平房多数都拆掉了,替之的是高楼大厦.感觉中北京的车比以前多了很多.人多了车自然会多,因为人们的生活条件提高了."
50,“天安门”,朋友们，来北京必定要去天安门广场，中国人必去的地方，那个叫美呀，还有挺拔/英俊的警卫，他们在保卫着国家，来吧朋友门。
50,“北京”,来到北京7年多了，对北京的印象是国际化大都市，所有一切都是与世界同步的，不管是时尚潮流，还是生活品质。加上北京的特色文化，让我很享受在这里的生活。即使是北漂一族，我也不会觉得孤独，因为北京有家的感觉。
50,“北京”,喜欢老北京的豆汁，炒疙瘩，焦圈，油茶，糖人，爆肚。喜欢看北京的升旗和降旗，喜欢晚上，借着地灯，在长安街遛弯。喜欢生我的故乡。
50,“北京天安门”,北京天安门是一个生神圣的地方，尤其是60年大庆使我们中国人看到了祖国的未来，祖国的强大，繁荣富强，我爱你北京天安门。
40,“北京你好”,好 很好 很好 好 好 好就这样 旅游好地方 景点多 吃喝玩乐很好孩子大人都愿意去的不错的地方名胜古迹也丰富 老幼皆易
50,“走的传统路线”,当时是08年去的交通可能因为奥运的关系，感觉还好，不拥挤。走的传统路线，一个人逛了北海公园、故宫、长城、颐和园等等。感觉很好。但是也强烈希望下次走现代路线，去去798之类的潮地。
50,“北京”,具有悠久的历史，风景优美，城市大而好，又是中国的首都。有颐和园，天安门，故宫，等景点。是一座让人赞叹不已的城市，我爱北京！
50,“很好的去处”,北京是我国的首都 自然应该去看看 那边的各种历史文化纪念 地方 就非常值得去观赏 加上 奥运会 留下的一些场馆 也是非常有看点
50,“从小生长在北京”,从小生长在北京的，变化太大了，希望今后的环境越来越好，但是这个想法又觉得太奢侈了，现在汽车越来越多，马路越来越不够用，这点何时才能变好呢？
50,“北京5天游记”,7月小孩放暑假吵着要去北京，我们两家人四大五小一行九人直奔北京。7月8日我们坐火车从深圳上北京，坐了24个小时终于在9日下午3点到了北京。我们直接到了订好的酒店星程天安瑞嘉酒店洗刷，晚上到了东来顺刷羊肉去。咱是第一次到京城，不小心在东来顺给刷了一顿。到店服务员积极的向我们推荐他们家的套餐，说这个划算是超值的套餐，我没仔细看就点了个388的套餐，后来仔细研究一下他家的菜谱才发现上当了，套餐里净挑贵的拼，同样一碟羊肉，在套餐是68块，单点的是28块，就是叫法不一样，吃起来没什么两样的。吃完我们直呼上当了！第二天，一早4点起床，我们就去看升旗，到广场才4点20分，那里已经好多人了在围观了，没办法我们只能在外头站着看人头了，不过也很兴奋，那种自豪感是哪都无法比拟的。看完升旗，又回酒店睡个回笼觉。这一天我们去了天安门城楼，看了故宫，游了大贪官的家恭王府。太累了！第三天，起床发现天气很不错，太阳露了一下脸，我们决定去长城看看。我们参加了北京集散中心的长城一日游100块/人，来回接送包门票还管饭。上车后，导游直接拉到了明皇宫看蜡像去，其实这个景点可以不去，没什么好玩的，就一些蜡像给你看。下午到了八达岭长城，天正下起灰蒙蒙的细雨，能见度奇差。我们既来之就安之，爬了一小段长城就下了，有点失望，没能看到长城的雄伟和峻险。但是我们看到了长城秀美的一面，还是挺有一番滋味的。回来后，我们又去前门逛了一圈，晚上在大栅栏的小吃街吃了晚饭，200块全吃饱，还不错，又便宜有好吃。值得推介。第四天，我们去了颐和园和天坛，在颐和园回来的路上我们还顺路到鸟巢和水立方看看了，照了个像就去天坛了。看完天坛，我们就坐公交车又去了大栅栏吃饭逛街。第五天，本来想去再看一次升旗的，但是太累了起不了就没去了。吃过早饭我们逛王府井大街去。下午我们就坐飞机飞回深圳了。逛北京其实不用去参加什么旅游团的，自己完全能够玩得很好的。因为京城的地铁和公交非常方便，又便宜。那些旅游景点基本上都能到的，坐地铁又快还便宜呢，2块随便坐。住的话也不错，在淘宝网上先订好，很便宜的。我这次住的星程天安很好，480块商务房还送双早，超级爽。前门和大栅栏很值得去逛逛的，买东西就找大店比较有保障。
40,“精彩北京”,北京最好的观光时间在十月，清爽干净，除了去一些著名的景点，如天安门，长城之外的地方，还可以和家人朋友一起去游乐场，动物园之类的地方玩一下，只要有气氛，哪里都可以有最美好的回忆。
40,“夜，北京”,在北京生活了这么久，北京的夜晚一直是我不能忘怀的。北京的夜晚没有陌生感，也没有熟悉感，只是一种自然的奢华。不用说有多漂亮，只需要静静的享受灯红酒绿的夜滋味。
50,“北京”,"北京是世界人民向往的地方.是文化故都,在这里您可以住一住别聚一翻风味的四合院,吃一吃带有老北京特色的小吃.让您留恋往返."
50,“好”,北京市，简称“京”，是中华人民共和国首都，四个中央直辖市之一，全国第二大城市及政治、交通和文化中心。北京位于华北平原北端，东南局部地区与天津相连，其余为河北省所环绕。北京有3000余年建城史和850余年建都史，是全球拥有世界文化遗产最多的城市。其最初见于记载的名字为“蓟”。北京荟萃了自元明清以来的中华文化，拥有众多名胜古迹和人文景观。北京迎接每年超过1亿4700万的旅客。此外，现在的美国和古代中国也有许多城市定名北京。
50,“伟大首都北京”,景点非常多，非常值得长时间的停留，驻足，慢慢去看，慢慢的体会，值得用一段时间去经历新城老事的各种故事，这样的北京才是伟大的首都！
50,“我爱北京”,北京市一个美丽的国际大都市，，，，，这里不但美丽而有着很多美丽的景点 例如 故宫 长城 天安门 颐和园 圆明园 永丰屯 天安门广场等等
50,“文化巨匠”,北京既是我国的文明古都市，又是现代化气息浓厚的时尚之都，置身其中你会有一种说不出的幸福感，能到北京旅游时人生的一大幸事。
50,“Schönste Stadt in Asien”,"Für mich die schönste Stadt in Asien, wenn nicht sogar auf der Welt. Sehr sauber, überall wird geputzt und die Plastikflaschen werden eingesammelt. Es ist eine gelungene Mischung aus Moderne und Tradition. Sehr nette Menschen, die sehr hilfsbereit sind. Zwei kleine Kritikpunkte: Es wird praktisch kein Englisch gesprochen und der Smog ist teilweise erdrückend."
50,“中国的首府”,北京有着悠久的历史文化，作为古都来说紫禁城气势磅礴，万里长城绵延万里，北京小吃种类繁多，交通便利，街道干净，新新事物较多
50,“北京是一个文化大都市”,我在北京生活近11年，当初大学毕业来到北京打工，体会了北京10年来的巨大变化；北京有天坛，故宫，长城，雍和宫等古代名胜，也有现代标志性的建筑，如鸟巢，国家大剧院，CCTV电视塔（尽管烧了一部分）。北京是一个古代+现代融合的都市
50,“我们的首都”,还未出生的我就迫不及待的和妈妈去过北京了，但是那次还不能亲眼看看。长大后去过很多次但是每次时间都太短暂，都来不及看看这美丽的地方。威严的天安门广场几乎每次都去过了，只是每次都忘记合影留念，至于紫禁城那更是我必到的地方之一，由于武侠情节的缘故，传统建筑的皇家园林可以让我好好的做做白日梦。当然北京并不是一个完全传统的城市，走到北京的街道你会发现北京同时也是时尚大都，一点也不亚于其他的国家。在这个多元化的城市里，首都的人民的热情更给我留下了深刻的影响，来到这里就像是在自己的家乡一样，毕竟是首都嘛对于外国人来说那里也是我们的家乡。还是来看看照片吧，北京的好是无法用言语来形容的。
40,“中国的首都”,去北京还是我小学的时候，有8年了。记得那个时候，我一个人从长沙坐火车去北京，晚上是和列车员姐姐睡的。到了了北京，是外婆来接的我。那是我第一次去外地旅游。作为中国的首都，北京有很多吸引你的地方.
30,“北京首都”,刚到北京的时候确实有些激动哈，但是那空气是真的干燥，脸上的皮一层层的掉，受不了，不过冬天还是很好过的，处处有供暖，不冷
40,“北京游记”,北京这个城市感觉还是很有活力，但是空气质量实在是太差了。在北京停留的这几日，从衣食住行各个方面都感到了奥运气息浓厚，以至于都不知应该先选择什么地方去玩，思维中的北京印象，应该是天安门、人民大会堂、王府井、天坛、长城，觉得这些代表了北京，但在北京奥运宣传耳读目染下，思维中觉得应该首先从奥运中感受北京，也从北京游玩中感受奥运。
50,“既古香古色 又充满活力”,北京是有着三千年历史的城市，也是中国的首都。既有高大壮丽的宫廷建筑，也有矮墙低瓦的四合院。总之是一个56个民族汇总的城市。
30,“Peking”,"positiv:+ relativ billig (10 km mit dem Taxi für 1 euro)+ viele Sehenswürdigkeiten ( Verbotene Stadt, Sommerpalast und Große Mauer sind ein muß)+ ""interessantes"" Essen , es gibt aber auch für die nicht experimentierfreudigen so gut wie jede nationale Küchenegativ:- im Sommer ziemlich heiß- Luft meist sehr verschmutzt (Fotos sehen alle sehr grau aus)- englisch wird von den wenigsten Leuten gesprochen"
40,“Kurztrip nach Peking”,"21.05.2010 Peking ist eine sehr interessante StadtIch war nur 2 Tage vor meinem Heimflug von einem Business trip. Im Stadtzentrum ist die Luft sauberer als man annimmt. Auch die Stadt selbst ist sehr sauer, die U Bahn sehr einfach zu benutzen und man kann auch in kleinen Restaurants problemlos essen."
50,“北京什刹海”,什刹海就是北京的后海，风景优美，又是新一代的酒吧一条街，就风景人伦远远胜过了以前的三里屯。不但有各式各样的酒吧乐队，更有湖光山色，各种充满异域风情的小店，让人留连
50,“首都”,既然是首都 当然繁华 不过交通 很众多的人口 让人很困扰。然后 就是物价= =。。。 当然高 不高怎么算的上首都 恩 所以可以谅解人们素质还是很高恩！
50,“北京”,北京的好吃的很多，有豆汁，烤鸭........很多很多，有机会来北京尝尝北京是首都，北京人也非常热情，你如果来到北京，肯定会被北京人的热情所感动
40,“好大好美”,初到北京，满眼尽是繁华，住了一段时间感觉北京人很好客，说话很有意思，有机会还会再去！不喜欢北京的古建筑，就喜欢北京那大都市的美！
30,“确实相当大，可惜少了些气息”,初到北京时，感觉就一个字，大！ 整体建筑和南方很不一样，有点陌生，繁华是一定的，遗憾的是少了一股文明的气息，到处都被商业化，而且是相当严重的，用北京的哥的一句话就是北京现在就是个商业城，没有一块是正宗的。
30,“北京”,北京市一座具有悠久历史及文化教育体育经济交通为一体的中国一流城市水立方鸟巢都是他最近那个店的建筑阿斯科接到了
30,“变味的首都”,曾经觉得这个城市很亲切，有包容心。但重游旧地之后，才发现这里已经被物欲充斥了，一不留神，就会掉入各式各样陷阱中，有些失落！
40,“多次北京感受”,我过北京很多次了 没次都不一样的感受 第一次是去工作的 当时只去过前门当时的感受觉得北京很伟大 让我由心的产生一种崇敬之心 还有现在的大栅栏也不错啊 但是最喜欢的还是欢乐谷 个人觉得门票很值
50,“北京旅游”,北京有长城，故宫，站在长城上看着美丽的风景，是一种享受，故宫很漂亮，没事的朋友们多去逛逛，旅游，还是去北京，觉得好的话，别忘了请我吃饭哦
50,“我爱北京”,北京是我一直都十分向往的城市..于是大学就报了北京的大学..我十分喜欢北京大都市的感觉..在这里给了我们这些年轻人很多的机会..我爱你北京
50,“漂亮”,去过好多次北京，但是每次的感觉都不一样，北京一直在发生着变化，就像我们中国一样有着翻天覆地的变化，是我们国人的骄傲啊，每到一处景点都有国外友人的身影，我知道这象征中国北京以她的魅力吸引着世界各国的人民。
50,“北京”,我们亲爱的首都 总体印象还可以 很文明的城市 最爱去的地方是 人民大会堂 只去过一次 不知道还有没有机会在进去了 里面真的很不错 不是每个人都有机会进去的真希望能定期开放给公众
50,“首都”,首都是一个人人都向往的地方，大气是毋庸置疑的，也很漂亮，绿化做得非常好，气候舒适，就是有点干燥，唯一不足的就是服务行业态度不怎么好，可能我在广东待习惯了吧。
50,“中国的首都，不可不来”,"不愧是中国的首都各种地方皆可称为景点，四合院、鸟巢、王府井,...抛开这些耳熟能详的词汇，漫步在一些普通的小路上也能感觉到北京这个中国之都的风采。"
40,“印象中的北京”,2000年的时候曾经去过北京，参加了夏令营印象中的北京，天安门的升旗仪式是庄严的，天安门广场很大颐和园的环境很好，烤鸭好不好吃是缘分
40,“北京空港喫煙室の謎”,人生初めての北京。おお！これが学校で習った万里の長城かあ～と、中国のすごさを感じて楽しく過ごしました。タクシーに乗った時は行きたい所が書いてある地図を持っていたので良かったですが、ないと、運転手さんが全く英語を話す事が出来ないのできついです。ちょっと運転手さんとコミュニケーションを取りたくて、中国って大きいね！（あたりまえだけど）と英語で言ってみたけれど、まったくわからなくて、ＢＩＧという単語もわからなかったです。お互い、わからないね、みたいな表情になりましたが、私は日本人。紙に中国大と書いて見せたら、わかってくれて、強面だった運転手さんのお顔がにこにこになりました。さて帰国日、巨大な北京空港の荷物検査では、唯一のライターを没収されました・・・成田では１つはＯＫだけど、北京空港はＮＧなんですね・・・まあ、ゲートに向かう前に買えるのかな？と思っていたら、ないんです。お店の人にもきいたけれど・・・まあ当たり前なのかな。わざわざライター没収したくらいなんだから。でも、そうなると、ニコチン中毒になっている私は、どうしても！の気持ちに・・・と見ると、喫煙室が！！！何故ある！？ライター没収でショップにも売っていないのに！人に借りよう！なぜ持っている人がいるの～！？喫煙室入り、一番手前にいた白人さんに火を貸してくれますか？と言ったら・・・たばこを差し出されました。え・・・あ～！火のついたたばこでもらい火？！！貴重な！火をありがたく受け取り、せっかくすぎるので、３本続けて吸った私です。勿論、私の後に入っていらした喫煙者にも火を分けて差し上げました～あの火は、誰の火から始まったのでしょう・・・今もって不思議です！
30,“首都”,北京的人很爽气，古迹也很多，但是那里的车太多，堵车起来太吓人。地铁没有其他城市的好，太旧，夏天在里面感觉很闷，毕竟是首都希望可以有所改善。
40,“让人怀念的北京”,在北京生活了一年多，经历了那里的四季变化，十足的京味，交错的胡同，还有很多的有趣的小玩意，更不可少的还有那些好吃的小吃。
50,“北京一个让人牵挂的城市”,北京是一个让人牵挂的城市，在北京工作和生活了许多年以后，离开北京到三亚出差，一待就是3个月，离开北京的时候是冬季，到了三亚，感觉气候真是好，可是随着时间的推移，慢慢的越来越想北京，想北京的天气，想北京宽阔的道路，想北京家里舒适的床，想北京的地铁，甚至于想北京拥堵的交通，北京，一个让人不能忘记的城市，一个让人牵挂的城市，我爱北京……
40,“首都”,北京是个旅游的好城市，这里人人知晓的圆明园，有长城，有颐和园、香山、植物园、八大处、还有龙庆峡、春天适合踏青，秋天适合来这里放松
30,“总体还行”,在这里三年了，就是人多，车多，空气不好，但是东西齐全，交通便利，生活水平高，人们的生活节奏很快，刚来还真不适应。总体还可以
50,“北京欢迎您”,正如标题所言，北京人民都很热情。每问一处，都很热情的回答你的问题，而且态度都很和蔼可亲。但就是北京的天气太难让我这个南方人忍受了，风太大，吹在脸上很难受
50,“北京，一个值得多待的城市！”,一个值得多待一待，细细品味的城市！这里交通方便，坐地铁到任何一个景点都非常方便，现在连颐和园也有地铁到了。晚上， 走在小街上，是一种享受（靠鼓楼这边）！品一品人文景观，赏一赏自然景观，到小馆子坐一坐，很惬意！
50,“我喜欢那里”,那里是我们中国的心脏，我喜欢那里，感觉无论在外面飘了多久，只要站在北京，就像回到了母亲的怀抱，非常得喜欢，爱北京！
40,“北京的小吃”,半晚时分，我们来到王府井夜市，吃的东西真不少，有老北京杏仁茶，卤煮火烧，爆肚。驴打滚，味道还不错，值得一去。不过你要做好准备，人很的呀
50,“北京欢迎你！”,北京，祖国的首都，小时候的梦想，游玩北京，感受京味京韵，很特别。鸟巢水立方无不显示中国人的聪明才智和坚强的意志。我爱北京
40,“初次去首都”,一直都不是特别向往 偶然来到了我们的首都 还是在60周年庆的时候 呵呵 挺好的 感觉不错 北京大 但是感觉挺方便也不会让人迷路 我觉得那里都挺好找的 只要一张地图 一天的额时间我就可以一个人想去哪里都行了 北京也挺不错的 对它有了新的认识和感觉
50,“在北京总觉得有的逛”,北京真的是个好地方，我去了798 故宫 老舍茶馆 在鸟巢玩的最开心了，我们在广场上面放风筝，逗执勤的人。非常有意思。总体来说我觉得无论去哪里都保持愉快的心情会帮助你旅游，而且选择合得来的同伴也非常重要。北京市非常值得去的地方……走的时候我还留下了遗憾，我还要再去哈哈哈……
40,“首都”,对于首都，我的印象总是如此的庄严，伟大，但是生活在中小城市的我，还是觉得真的在北京做什么都很不方便，可能是习惯问题了。
50,“我的童年在这里”,虽然不是北京人，但从小长在北京，所以对北京的感情也很深厚，因为我童年所有的回忆都在这里，所以我爱北京，不仅因为他是首都，更是我成长的地方。
