50,“The Imperial Edo:”,"When I was a student I had taken Japanese classes at the Dauphine University in Paris known as INALCO, however, I never succeeded in mastering the language and after one year I gave up Learning the Kanas and Kanjis....was so difficult! Today, at the age of 50 I regret. I wish I had completed my degree but that's life, right? So it took me some 30 years to go to Japan and I wish I had come before. Tokyo is amazing, a blend between tradition and modernism. The city is a patchwork of neighborhoods that each have their own flair, Asakusa, Shinjuku or Chyoda and its Imperial Palace. The city is easygoing and user friendly and eventhough you do now speak Nihongo, Japanese tend to be eager to help: Japanes Hospitality at its best. Make sure to buy a ""TOKYO METORO pass"" ina dvance. They come in 1 or 3 days . You can also purchase a one day pass for ¥ 710 but beware it's not valid on the Toei Subway, which is private . Getting around is easy since most signs are in Kanji and Romaji. No problem to find your way. Prices are comparable to prices we konw in larger European or American cities. A carry-out meal ( bento is around ¥ 450 ( Seven Eleven) or around ¥1,200 in an eaterie. Beverages are around ¥ 300 for coffee at starbucks'....well, once you have paid hotel and transportation a daily budget of ¥ 5000 to 7000 is more than enough, unless you eat out in expensive restaurants. € 1 = ¥ 135 or $1. All you have to do is drop the two zéros to have the price in $ or €. I stayed in Tokyo for 8 days but I believe you can stay more than that since there is so much to do. Next episode, October when I return."
50,“JapanTattoo: english and french speaking Tattoo Shop in Shinjuku”,"There is a shop with english speaking staff near Shinjuku (Shinjuku San Chome: 15 minutes walf from Shinjuku Station)It's named JapanTattoo. They accept credit card (5% charge).Very Friendly place and the master artist (a Lady) is very skilled .It seems that they created this tattoo shop for tourists.This is where I got my back inked with a manga design (fan of anime/manga).Here's there website: japan-tattoo.comOne thing, be prepared to spend some times there:""Last time after the tattoo was finished, the customers stayed almost for five hours talking with us. This is our style: we love to talk with our international customers""I always try to pass once a week just to say hi...It's a tattoo place but it feels like a place to hang around."
50,“TOKYO IS SAFE AND BEST TIME WITH NO CROWDS”,I am here in Tokyo and surrounding areas to the west and south . I have a fairly sensitive and accurate radiation detector. The radiation readings are within the normal range. Which means it is PERFECTLY SAFE !!!!Japan is wide open and there are lots of places to visit that normally would be packed this time of year. It is a great time to come the weather is warm and the airfares are down the planes are empty.Take advantage of this great opportunity !!!!
50,“great city”,we stayed for three days. one of the best things to do is to be early in the morning at the fish market and after the tuna auction have the freshest sushi ever in one of the sushi bars nearby. also a stroll at the market area is recommended (you get kobe beef much cheaper than in restaurants!). we also did a river cruise and a lot of walking at asakusa temple area. would go there again!
50,“The most fantastic place I have ever visited!”,"Tokyo is just perfect. Lots of things to do and see. First of all the public transportation system runs perfectly well - trains and metro are always on time, clean and modern. It's frequently overcrowded but you can get used to it. I stayed in the area called Ueno which was great - thousands of little shops selling almost everything, many restaurants and bars, and the prices weren't as high as in e.g. Shinjuku. The city combines modern architecture with historical sites - you can wander around skyscrapers and then in about five minutes you find yourself in front of some small temple or shrine which brings back old days."
50,"“Great city, better people”","I was in Tokyo a month ago and I can't wait to go back. Specially now I know they are gonna be needing tourism much more. If you want to help Japan, go and visit it! It will not only help them but it will be a great exprience for you. I stayed at Horidome Vila. Excellent standards budget hotel."
50,“One of the most exciting cities in the world”,"I have been to the city last summer, i have to say, u can not ask more from a city! clean, modern, ancient, perfection, art, architecture, fashion, great food, sea, skyscrapers, temples, fishmarket..these are only a few tags that come instantly to my mind when i think about Tokyo.Some insider tips:1. for art lovers: Design Festa Gallery in Harajuku, great building, very out of main stream art; Check out also the National art Center in Rappongi.2. Try the lunch menus of the expensive restaurants, these are very cheap at lunch3. If u have a limited budget stay at Sunroute Hugashi Shinjuku hotel, just great value forthe money"
40,"“Tokyo trip - October, 2010”","Tokyo, JapanWe stayed at the Courtyard Marriott hotel, which had an excellent location. The hotel is very nice and the staff was always helpful and friendly. The courtyard Japanese restaurant has excellent steak but some of the other stuff not so good. Lobby restaurant very good. Sandwiches and some hot dishes very good, like the chicken.1000 yen (about $13) for using your laptop in your room but there are 3 computers in business center you can use for free. Can also take your laptop there and hook up for free.Lobby restaurant offers free Wi-Fi.Bathroom amenities are very good. The hotel provides new toothbrushes and toothpaste every day as well as bic razors and shaving cream, also each day.Many places to buy water and soda. Diet soda almost unheard of but some stores carry it. Several grocery stores nearby to get cheap soda and water to bring to room.Denny’s, across the street, has excellent breakfasts at less than half the price of Courtyard.Walking down the main Tokyo shopping street, Ginza, was like walking down 5th avenue in New York. The same big name shops were all over the place. The Ginza also featured some department stores that were very nice and you could pick up some gifts to take home here that are authentic. The department stores have reasonably priced restaurants on their top floors with menus in English.Many other stores too, that had nice costume jewelry, paper products, etc. Citibank was right on the Ginza, has ATM's but they also charge you a 3% transaction fee for getting Yen.Kobe beef – Terrific place right on the street in back of the Marriott Courtyard in Ginza area. Place is GYU-AN – You'll see an AMPM store. To the right is a coffee place and this restaurant is to the RIGHT of that. Its very authentic and you must take your shoes off. Sit on floor with feet in a space under the table. 6500 yen gets you a 200gr steak, the tenderest steak you've ever had. It comes with a salad and some vegetables and of course rice. About $150 for 2 people.Gyu-An 6-13-6 Ginza Tokyo Phone: 3542-0226Sushi – Much is made about going to the fish market early in the AM and then waiting in line for 2-3 hours for this one restaurant. Now you must sign up to get to the fish auction because too many people led to complaints by the auction people. They let 70 people max into the market at 4:50 am and another 70 people at 5:50 am. We refused to be so inconvenienced and were told at the hotel there were other good restaurants there so we went there at 11:30 am. The auction was well over and we stopped at Sushi Maru. Walk into the market on the left side and after awhile you'll see several restaurants. The one with sushi pictures on the outside is Maru. Terrific sushi, like smooth silk. Freshest we ever had. They have an English menu. Do try the fatty tuna, Wow!!! Many restaurants there, some serving great soup with dumplings. You'll see mostly Japanese people lining up for these. We really pigged out with the sushi and beer. The cost was about $120 for 2.I went to Akihabara, the area famous for electronics, and there were hundreds of shops selling everything you could imagine for computers, motherboards, flash drives, TV’s, cell phones, etc. BUT the prices were much more expensive than what you could get it for in New York or online. I went looking for the Casio Databank 150. They had it for $120. I got it brand new on eBay for under $30 bucks 2 days after I returned. And Casio is made in Japan. Go figure! We also went to a big shopping area called Asakusa. It was interesting, many stalls selling mostly cheap merchandise. Some temples were in this area.Trains are easy to use. We got a all day card when we knew we were going to travel somewhere. The taxis are off the charts. About $6 just to get in and go 1/5 of a mile. $370 from Narita and $70 to Haneda. The airport limo bus is $36/person. They load your luggage on the bus and it’s the best way from Narita. We took it back to Haneda and it was $12/person."
50,“My favorite place in Japan”,"Everyone says Kyoto is the most amazing place in Japan. And it is, Kyoto is a gem, but Tokyo is AMAZING! Tokyo's energy, life and size make New York City seem slow and small in comparison."
50,"“Tokyo, Japan”","We just went to Tokyo, Japan and had a wonderful time. The food was wonderful and the people were great. Most do not speak English, but we got around ok on the buses and the trains. Make sure you have a plan made out and ready, because there were not a lot of people to talk too. A must is to go up the mountain Takao, just make sure you do not go on the weekends or a Japanese holiday. You will love your trip to Japan,"
50,“My visit to Tokyo”,"It's a great organized clean city, the people are so friendly and polite I enjoyed my stay there alot."
40,"“You will LOVE it, but you will spend ALOT of money!”","I spent 5 days and nights at Tokyo, Japan. Accompanied by my wife. We are both 36 y.o. From 2nd till 6th of October 2010. I stayed at Radisson hotel (4 star, no breakfast) at Narita. We both really loved Tokyo. We come from a small city on Lesvos Island (Greece) called Mytilene with a population of 30k. So you can tell what a difference and impact the scyscrapers and lights galore and bridges and variety of restaurants and huge shopping malls made on us. But still we are experienced. We have travelled alot and I have lived 14 years of my life in Sydney, Australia. But still Tokyo was awesome. First of all we both loved the Japanese people. They are simply amazing. It's very hard to find someone who can understand english, let alone speak it. But they will do everything in their power to serve you. Like no other (so far for me). We visited the National Gardens at Shinjuku, Kokugikan Museum at Ryogoku, Odaiba at Daiba, Asakusa at Taito, Ginza at Ginza, The Imperial Palace at Chiyoda, Akihabara at Chiyoda, Mount Fuji and many other sight seeing places. Every one of those has filled me with memories. Very good ones.BUT in order to enjoy all of the above plus everything else you PLAN to do (planning what to do beforehand is a MUST when travelling alone and not with a group and / or guide) you need cash. Lot's of cash. I found Tokyo very expensive. Toll gates, parking, tickets to everything, food (especially traditional Japanese food and restaurants), car rental (I drove a BRAND NEW!!! Toyota Paso and did 850km in 4 days, Mount Fuji was a hike), train / subway / bus tickets, hotel prices, electronic devices (!!!) and everything else is very expensive. From 2 to 4 times higher than standard prices in Greece (which I don't consider expensive after this trip :D).On the good side again, every road and corner is SO clean. Smokers are NOT welcome here. They have special enclosed rooms in buildings or special smoking areas outside only for them. Very limited. You will not see anyone smoking anywhere else. Their cars and trucks are always clean. Rarely will you see a dirty or rusted truck (not a car though). Bicycles are extremely popular so watch out if you are a walker (inevitable since ticket prices are expensive). The drivers are very calm, I experienced no sign of road rage after 7 full days of driving (I drove in Nagoya as well). Generally, Japanese people are very patient. And kind. And polite. Respectful, helpful and so much more. Live this experience. BUT only if you can afford it."
50,“great place”,"Tokyo Prefecture, Kanto, Japan, Asia is such a great city, it is full of energy, a lot of places for sightseeing,wonderful japanese restaurant"
50,"“Great place, friendly and helpful people !!!”","Even though it's very far from Europe or US, really worth every single second being there !!!Everything's in order and you see only polite people that are willing to help and find a solution to a visitor problem, no matter if they know english or not !!!We've enjoyed it very much !!! We stayed at Shinjuku area, near central station and look forward to go there again some time !!!"
50,“Japan Green Land 2010”,"One of the world's most exciting cities, TOKYO is a fuel-injected adrenaline rush into a neon-bright future. But for all its cutting edge modernity, this ceaseless metropolis remains fiercely proud of its ancient heritage. Lively neighbourhood festivals are held virtually every day of the year, people regularly visit their local shrine or temple and scrupulously observe the passing seasons in lovingly tended gardens. And at this hyperactive city's center lies the serene and mysterious Imperial Palace – the inviolate home of the emperor and a tangible link to the past."
50,“Tokyo”,Tokyo has an extensive train/subway infrastructure and is easy to use. Prepare before your trip by reading online maps to help you navigate the city while you are there. Has more restaurants than anywhere else in the world which cater to all budgets.
50,“Like New York only better”,"New York used to be my favorite city in the world with it's bustling life and non stop action. Tokyo has it all but bigger. Tons of people everywhere, all the time. Action in every street corner. Public announcement and big screen TVs SciFi style in every corner. Cheap and very fresh sushis. And every body is very polite helpful and calm. Though it is a big vibrant city, you don't feel any pressure and you are relax as if you were in a calm village."
50,“My Favorite place on Earth...”,"I simply love Tokyo and there are many reasons that attribute to this.... The city is forever buzzing with life and activity... and it is once city which has everything to offer, from awesome restaurants, bakeries, street food, mind blowing shopping experiences at huge malls to roadside bargains...It is one city, were you can roam along ""alone"" and don't really need a company to visit. I have done so and have enjoyed thoroughly, roaming the streets, peeping through the windows of various stores or just sitting in a cafe and enjoying a lovely pastry...Another of the fun part is riding the subway at Tokyo, with its amazing network of so many crazy line... off course the colorful map does help...One of my most memorable activity has always been, to sit at the Starbucks outside Shibuya Station and watching the mad rush of people crossing the crossroad... it the most colourful sights ever and I can spend just hours looking out with a Hot Coffee on a winter day or a Cold White chocolate Latte on a hot summer day...Yet even after three visits to this city, I still crave to go back again, and could go on visiting the city as many times I could afford to do so...."
50,“Tokyo”,"I love Japan. Food = Super-duper #1, People = Friendly, City = Safe/Clean, Sites = Cool, Not that far away, What else?Oh yeah...THE FOOD!"
50,“A metro city”,"Toyko is by far the cleanest city to which I have ever travelled. It is aso the largest and busiest city to which I have ever travelled. The amount of effort the people of Tokyo go to in order to ensure both sanity and sanitation is simply astounding.Sights one must visit while in Tokyo include Harajuku (shopping/fashion), Ueno (Ameyoko for cheap shopping / Ueno Park/zoo), Shibuya (area for young adults), and Shinjuku (nightlife / red light district)."
50,“Tokyo is like living in the future.”,"I enjoy exploring Tokyo for it's innovative technology, it's delicious high quality cuisine and the shopping. I loved visiting the electronics district (Akihabara), especially Yodobashi electronics store to see what are the latest gadgets, visiting the trendy district (Shibuya) for it's stylish clothes and anime. Toys are everywhere. Japanese anime is everywhere. My favorite stores to visit for that are Kiddy Land & Snoopy Town in Harajuku. So much to see, so little time to see everything. Try to stay at least one week in Tokyo before visiting other cities in Japan. You'll need at least that amount of time to see a good portion of Tokyo."
50,“Tokyo is AWESOME!”,"We just got back from spending 9 amazing days in Tokyo, and already want to go back. There is so much to see and do there. For those who have never been to a foreign country, don't let that stop you. Tokyo is very safe. And the language barrier is difficult at times, but there are enough Japanese that speak at least some English that this is not a problem. I traveled with my sister plus my older teenage daughter and son. We felt perfectly safe everywhere we went, day or night.You travel everywhere on trains which are fast and efficient. My best recommendation is to buy a Suica card that you can easily add money to in any subway station. Then just flash your card when going through the turnstiles. It automatically subtracts the correct subway fare. You can even use the Suica card to buy merchandise at some stores.Tokyo is an amazing city of both old and new. Ancient shrines will be surrounded by modern buildings. There are shrines, museums, marketplaces, restaurants, literally no end of places to go and things to see. You could spend years exploring Japan; there is so much to see and do. Highlights of our trip were Disney Sea, the Ghibli Museum, Kamakura (a small town near Yokohama), the Ramen Museum, and Asakusa (where they have beautiful shrines as well as a marketplace).Tokyo is a very clean city. It's safe to drink the water. You don't need any special shots. The people are very welcoming. Several times when we needed directions the person we asked walked several blocks out of their way to show us where to go. If we looked lost kind people would come up and ask if we needed help. From ordering food at restaurants to traveling around the city, there were always friendly Japanese people who would kindly help us. If you aren't an adventurous eater and aren't sure if you will like the food over there, there is a large American fast food presence in Japan; Mc Donald's, KFC, Mos Burger, Wendy's, Hard Rock Cafe, Domino's Pizza, and many more. But you MUST also try some of the delicious local foods as well.I highly recommend Tokyo as a great place to travel. It is a wonderful destination - you won't regret it. I cant' wait to go back."
40,“Tokyo- a few hints to help you out”,"First off i would suggest researching the top places to go before your trip. its a very large city with so much to see and do it can be overwhelming. one suggestion is Ueno Park, its a nice place to go for a walk, see some temples, and visit the Tokyo National Museum.Trains- if you are not familiar with the language i would suggest checking out hyperdia.com, its a good way to search, in english, for train departure times, ect, and will give you the platform in which they leave.Japenesse to English- If you own an iPhone i would recomend downloading the Kotoba application. its a wonderful english to Japenesse dictionary that has a english spelling of the word along with the kanji. even if you have trouble pronouncing the word you can always show the person you are talking to the kanji.ATM's- pretty much every 7/11 i have seen has an ATM. I'm not sure what exit i took from the train station but i know that the Shinagawa Prince Hotel was across the street and in front of the enterence, to the left, was a 7/11 with a ATM outside. (it had a pretty good extange rate when i used it.)"
50,“Japan's Capital”,"Tokyo is a fabulous place to begin your exploration of Japan. It can be a bit overwhelming at times but you can really immerse yourself in Japanese culture with sites ranging from old temples and shrines to the electronics of Akihabara.I would highly recommend visiting the Edo-Tokyo Museum and the Ueno Zoo; both of which take a few hours. There's also Sea Life Park and Disneyland which make for wonderful day trips and the Ghibli Museum if you are a fan of Totoro like I am! To visit the Ghibli Museum you have to make reservations which can be done at any Lawson's convenient store.If you plan on spending a number of days in Tokyo (you certainly wouldn't run out of things to do/see) I would highly recommend getting the GRUTT pass which for 2,000 yen gets you free or discounted entrance to many sites including Ueno Zoo, Sea Life Park, and the Edo-Tokyo Museum. Each area of Tokyo has its own unique flavor and provides a different experience so there is something for everyone."
30,“Visiting Japan”,"My husband and I recently took a trip to Tokyo, Japan. It was very different than what we had imagined. Being from the USA, everything seemed to be mini-sized, especially the food portions (but we didn't complain about it, it just gave us the chance to eat again in a few hours). There were vending machines almost everywhere you went, you could get a drink, snack, or even a beer! We struggled a little bit with trying to understand the subway system, but if you knew the station you were going to, then we just counted the stops, and that seemed to work out. The cost of using the subway was very expensive and we do not speak Japanese and had difficulty using the ticket machines at first. In fact, there is a button you can press for English, but since it was in Japanese we had no idea! Using the subway during rush hour was in itself an adventure! everyone waits in a line to get on, but then you get packed in super tight! Plus, no-one makes a sounds, so we felt we stuck out pretty bad. But we also found it amusing. We are both vegetarians and found it very difficult to eat there. So we mostly had to eat pastries, which were very delicious and available at markets and bakeries everywhere! Visiting famous landmarks such as Shibuya, and Harujuku, was great and fun. We went to the Edo Museum and it was interesting to see world events from the eyes of another country. We never found a place to get tourist type souvenirs for cheap except at the airport, which was a disappointment. We did have fun, but we will go to a different country for our next vacation."
50,“Balance in Tokyo”,It is amazing how they balance the hectic overpopulation with quiet strolls through peaceful gardens. I highly recommend this location for a vacation. Every corner brings something new and you can allow yourself to get lost.
50,“A land of contrasts”,"Should you be given a chance to travel to Tokyo - do it, if only for a week. This one city holds 6 million people and every style of life imaginable where kimono shops and French boulangerie co-exist happily. Everywhere we went the French and American influences are so pronounced and yet the Japanese are so strict in observing their traditional practices. Traditional markets exist opposite Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Armani. After seeing a white wedding in Gucci's courtyard we witnessed the photo session for a traditional Shinto wedding (see image).The tube system is just like Paris or London but beware as the streets are not named - and the maps are not accurate or easily compared. Walking is just not feasible as this city is massive. Must sees are Tokyo Tower, the Lolitas shopping in the Harajuku district and, for reflective moments, the Hiroshima flame in Ueno Park. It is here that their treatment at the hands of the Americans is in sharp contrast to their current desire for all things American. The women either dress in sharp business suits or 1950s drindle skirts and beehive hairdo's. Coca-Cola vending machines are on every street.Tea ceremonies and 21st century technology firms can be found in the same street. As we moved between the areas we saw glass and chrome skyscrapers jostle with traditional buildings. There are frequently used shrines such as the gilded Senso-ji that celebrates Budhhism arriving in Japan. Women, children - and even traffic - are venerated at multiple shrines around the city. Look for the dolls with red neckerchiefs around the necks.However, after a week of a traditional Ryokan (i.e. an empty room and leather slippers) I was ready for a bed, chair and furniture. Mastering scrambled eggs with chopsticks is not for those who like their food warm! Every take-away food or meal is served with both plastic cutlery and chopsticks - eco-friendly they are not! On our last day we feasted at a business lunch restaurant popular with the office workers and every one of them was using a knife, fork and spoon - obviously the chopsticks are a game they play on the tourists. Another popular tourist activity is having your photograph taken by the Japanese when doing the victory symbol is obligatory for all ages. As my companion is tall, dark and handsome he often had his photo taken without them asking permission. I've been told that having an image of themselves with a westerner is a status symbol and can be sold for money or higher ratings on Facebook??!!Take your camera, take your time but most of all take in Tokyo - a land of contrasts."
40,“Tokyo Great Place”,I went on a business trip to Tokyo. Narita airport was great and very easy to get a bus into central Tokyo. The staff at the bus desk spoke English and were able to help with all enquiries.I found the people nice and polite. It was very easy to travel around the place due to efficent Japanese train system. I would not recommend taxis as they were very expensive.The food was nice and varied although the cost of basic vegtables and fruits was ridiculous.I went in July so the weather was very very humid.Coming from the London the overall prices of things were reasonable as we are used to very expensive lifestyle.There are many places to visit and I would recommend to anyone.
50,"“""There's no place like Home...... THERES NO PLACE LIKE TOKYO!""”","Tokyo is the best! My hubby and I went for Honeymoon, did not regret anything about this city, perfect place to visit, very safe and low crime rate. Went for 2 weeks at the beginning of February 09, not enough time! It was cold so we had hoodies and had to buy ear muffs and scarfs cause the wind was so strong and alot of the city your are walking up hill. When we arrived from the states at Narita airport the Japanese are sooo friendly! We were so surprised because in states people are yelling at u at the airport to hurry up. Everyone greeted us and asked if we needed help, they could tell we were American so they directed us to speak with someone in English. We took airport limousine shuttle to New Sano Hotel and it was about an hour ride, not boring very exciting and cheaper than taking taxi. These are the MUST for Tokyo(no particular order): 1)Shibuya-( MY FAV)shopping district ""109"" tower decked out female dream has very fashionable clothes, accessories its like 12 floors nothing but girls stuff. Restaurants & fast food Mc Donalds/ Starbucks. Also has what they call ""food show"" it like food court but no sit down area. Area is busy with lights and just alot in general going on, great picture area 2) Akihabara- (HUBBY FAV)electronic district for cheap! My hubby got ipod car adapter for like $9bucks and we bought 2 different tripod stands for our camera, very handy on trip! They have sooo many things make sure to buy from the vendor streets and not dept store, its cheaper. Lots of places to eat too. 3)Disneyland/sea - very fun and if not disneyland then pick the sea since we dont have in states and they have cool shows. 4) Roppongi- newest district mall with movie theatre and has upscale eating lots of food choices, very nice trendy places/architecture and night scene for adult beverages and PARTYING! 5) Harajuku- has big 100 yen store($1store), people dress up in characters and all weird on the streets but its fun. There is a shrine close to it that u have to go to. 6)Tokyo Tower- views are amazing, they have restaurants inside and souvenir shops, pay a little extra to take the highest view its beautiful and go towards the evening for breathtaking night pictures to see city all lighted up! 7)Imperial Palace- near Ginza district , you can knock these out in 1 day. Only pictures from grounds of Palace also go to their garden park grounds. 8) Vie de France(bakery) they have one across from Hiro Plaza and at Akihabara metro station. Best chocolate bread and pastries, they make better french food than anyone! 9)Mc Donalds- they have a shrimp burger and shaka shaka chicken(chicken u shake in a bag w/ ur choice of seasoning) that is the best! The only let down was Sony building cause they had everything we have in states, it wasnt anything new to see. Over all Japan is the friendliest country, great variety of food, best shopping, and tons of attractions. Great trip for family, young couples, partying, romance & adventure. If you go you will always want to go back, its a trip of a life time!"
50,“Great city! Wished we had more time!”,"We are a family with 2 young boys, ages 4 and 6. We were in Tokyo in mid-June 2009 for 7 days.- contrary to popular belief, Tokyo is not as expensive ""as"" most people believe it to be. You can eat like a Japanese and it will be reasonable (eg a bowl of tempura shrimp bowl of rice will cost about 600 yen), but if you want to eat a western diet, ie TGIF or Wolfgang Puck, then you will pay thru your nose for it. At all the large shopping centers like Isetan, Odakkyu, etc, they have depachikas, or basement food halls, selling all sorts of food items for reasonable prices, a meal will cost about 600-1200 yen. Sushizanmai is a chain of sushi bars, reasonable prices....we don't read Japanese but I think they were having a promotion (so cheaper price than usual) but we had medium fatty tuna (chuo toro, melt-in-your-mouth delicious, top quality) for 150 yen a piece. The cucumber rolls only about 120 yen. We went into a ramen shop in Ueno and the ramen about 650 yen. A stick of yakitori from the Tsukiji fish mkt yakitori stall is 100 yen a stick....really really good (comparing to the other bars/shops where the chicken meat stank a bit...I didnt want to eat it, but my husband thought it was fine). Uniqlo is the Japanese version of GAP, tshirts for 1000 yen, white shirts for 1500 yen, yukatas for 4900 yen, mens jinbei (like a yukata for wearing at home) for 1900 yen. 100 yen shops (Daiso, Cando) sell all sorts of wares for 100 yen (we bought onsen bath powder, toys, Hello Kitty merchandise, cute bento boxes, etc). One caution is that you do not go to Japan to shop, you go to sight-see, so don't expect to shop cheap there. I am shoe-shopping fanatic and shoes in Japanese malls cost about 12500 yen and up. I did score a great deal by chance though at the 7th floor of Isetan (seems like it is a deals-floor, tons of women buying stuff like they were free!!!) where a pair of slingbacks cost 3100 yen. Only one pair in that design and size....they were waiting for me!!!- very very clean city. We walked around for blocks literally looking for a garbage bin/receptacle...none in sight, not even in the malls. You'd think that they would put at least one garbage bin near the escalators...but none. The funny thing was that, with the difficulty in finding a garbage bin, there is no garbage/litter ANYWHERE.....which is commendable in a great way (great moral upbringing) but do Tokyo-ites carry their garbage all the way home?- massive transportation system, very efficient, all signs avail in English. Rail staff very helpful and some of them (staff) on the platform even spoke English, not just the information counter girl. You could get lost in the first day or so till you get the hang of it (especially in the large stations like Tokyo Stn and Shinjuku Stn). Tip: get a Suica card, as it is a preloaded card that you just swipe and don't have to worry about how much to pay for what distance etc. If you take the Narita Express (N'Ex) from the airport into Tokyo, you pay 3100 yen for the airport to Tokyo trip and they give you a free Suica card good for 2000 yen of travel. The Suica card can also be used for vending machines (buying water, pop) or even in some convenience stores/restaurants. The card is a must-have. We went to Tokyo with very minimal luggage (2 bags for the whole family)....so it was ok to drag the bags up the stairs, but when you go back home, take the airport limousine bus. Cost is the same.- go to Disney after 6pm and use the ""after 6 passport""....only 3100 yen (about half price of the regular fullday passport) but with way less crowds. We went in mid June after 6pm to Disney Sea and it was not busy. It was on a weeknight. The waits were about 0-10 mins...most were in the 3 min range. The only drawback this way is that you have to rush thru the park in order to complete the park in 4 hours. However, since the lines are not busy, it is do-able in 4 hours. Also, it is cooler in the evening (much more) than in the day (it was very hot and humid in the day). In June, the sun sets in Tokyo at 7-ish pm. We took the subway from Shinjuku Stn to Disney (2 trains, with a change at Tokyo Stn), The actual train ride is only 30 mins but if you include all the walking (when changing lines at Tokyo Stn) will take about 1 hour. The Stn at Disney is Mahaima Stn.- we went twice to the Pokemon Center in Tokyo. Take the Daimon or Hamamatsucho Stn. Not really what I expected, but the kids went crazy there...its a store that sells all sorts of Pokemon merchandise, from cards, to DVDs to DS games. We went twice....the first time just before they opened and we were immediately worried....there was a huge lineup. Once the shop opened, the crowd was let into the shop, it was fine. There were kids everywhere loading up their DS with games (seems like it, I couldn't read any Japanese and most of the staff did not speak English). The second time we went in the afternoon and it was not busy at all.- don;t bother going to the East Gardens at the Imperial Palace (read my review on it), waste of time. Go to the New Otani Hotel instead.- we went (well, attempted to go) to the Tokyo Museum 3 times. The first time was on Monday (they close on Mondays!) and then again in Tuesday (for some reason they were close on that Tuesday). We went again on Wed and it was open. Tip: check the hours before going there.- near the Tokyo Museum is the Toshogu Shrine....it was draped in tarp for renos....otherwise it was good. There was a flame whose origins are traced back to the atomic bombings in Japan and it is a peace memorial.- we stayed at the Keio Plaza Hotel for 6 nights in the Plaza Premier room, 38th floor, good views, good clean rooms, large size for Jap standards. The hotel also had a free shuttle to Disney (at certain times only)- temple of the 47 ronins: if you're interested in Japanese history and know of the story of the 47 ronin, then do take the opportunity to check this place out...easy to get to on the subway. My 6 yr old really enjoyed the place and especially lighting incense at each of the 47 tombs. It is called the Sengakuji Temple.- Tsukiji fish mkt: a must see, worth the trip for the fresh sushi and the yakitori stall. Also, great to see all kinds of fish they sell there. Also a good place for buying rice crackers, dried fish, Kobe beef and sushi hunks.- Oedo Onsen Monogatari: great onsen, seems like the women's side had a lot more pools than the mens side...very nice outdoor pools. The outdoor pools are nice when you have the nice evening cool breeze amid the hot pools. Very relaxing after a long day of walking. The admission fee is also cheaper in the evenings. If you are like us, where time is limited and we don';t have time to travel to Gunma or Hakone for the day trip or overnight trip, then this is your very best bet, even my kids loved it, and asked to go back again. (read my review of this onsen).- the Asakusa temple was also under tarp for renos."
40,“A large city”,"I was in Tokyo from 29 April to 05 May 2009. I flew in from Chitose Airport and landed in Haneda Airport. One thing to note is that you have to return the luggage tags to the service staff, after you have collected the luggage and exit the area. Umbrella can be carried onboard as opposed to my experience in Melbourne, Australia.I have two options of travelling to my hotel at Higashi Shinjuku. I opted to travel by the airport limousine to Shinjuku city terminal that is just outside Keio Mall and then a 710 yen taxi ride after that. The other option, is by the Tokyo subway, which you may have to change to different lines to reach the destination. My journey was mostly via highway and a non event.The area around Shinjuku Station, is a mass of shopping centres, namely Keio Mall, Odakyu, My Lord, Lumine and a horde of others. There is also good rail connectivity from Shinjuku Station and even to JR lines. Overall, this area has all your shopping and eating needs on a moderate cost regime.Disney Store has an outlet in Sibuya. As it is more spacious, you really see the crowd. It is another of those district in Tokyo that is self contain as far as food and shopping is concern. I actually tried one food outlet, where you are given 45 minutes of all you can eat dessert.The teen display are in a place called Harajuku. It is good for a one off visit. The one happening street - Takeshita, can be so pack that it is shoulder to shoulder. Nothing spectacular about Takeshita Street. It is a one street that is crowded in Harajuku. Small cafes and shops dot this street. If you walk through this street, you may have to walk back in order to move to another destination. I tried two side streets and it leads to a dead end, so there is a concern when a stampede starts for whatever reasons. Also, don't assume that you will see teen girls that dolls up, like a window display, the can be very few and nothing at all. Nothing really to buy in this area, more like an addidtional feather on the headband.The Tsukijishijo Station, is a place to go, if you want to visit the wholesale fish market. Go early, i.e. way before dawn to see the real stuff of people doing the deals. Remember that it is a fish market and so it is wet and they have this small vintage carts that moves around to transport the goods. As an afternath, the crowd seems to like the sushi shops that is at the perimeter, so expect queue of up to 20 deep. Among the sushi shops are small shops selling stuffs that are related to the place. They have large hooks, knives and confectionery in these shops. Worth a visit, I mean, see the auction, eat sushi and buy tidbits, thats what I did.The Yasakuni Ninja Shrine is one place to see one aspect of the Japanese culture. It goes beyond the Japanese war in China. There are two paid sections within the ground of the shrine. Do viist them and also to help them by spending a few ""yen"" at the cafe.The Emperor's Palace is within walking distance of the Yasakuni Ninja Shrine and so you may want to combine the two destintions. You should walk back in the direction of the Yasakuni Ninja Shrine gate and the subway station and turning right, into the park will lead you to the Emperor's Palace. Along the way, I saw a gymnasium, which was having judo competition. Went in for a while to soak up some culture.At the entrance of the Emperor's Palace's garden, you will be given an entry token, which you must give back on your exit. The Emperor's Palace's garden is large and beautiful. In the midst, is a cafe and I bought a wonderful wafer ice cream, so you may want the same option. At the other exit, is a subway station, so you can be on your way. Overall, you can finish the two destiantion within one morning and leaving elsewhere for lunch.Odaiba is an over hype place. Thats my opinion only. Nothing to shout about in Venus Fort, although a salesman was trying to interest me in buying a pair of shoes that will will show different shades of grey. The amusement park, ferris wheel and car showroom makes up the other portion of the area. I, actually took a light lunch there, complete with ice cream.Do scour literature on the different district of Tokyo, as some of them, may have nothing of interest to a tourist. Among the large and good areas are Ikeburo and Uneno, Akihabara and Asakusa. They are recommended to visit. In the middle of no where and in a place called Kasuga, they have a roller coaster, supermarket, cafe and DIY store in one cluster. This is one example of trying the unknown.Bento, which is food in a multi compartment tray, is probably, the cheaper of your food and I, thought that it was good. I bought one set at the shopping mall that is connected to Ikeburo Station. It was freshly made infront of me and it was a good decision. Do try them, as the locals are big time on this stuff.Tokyo Hands, is one place, that you should visit. It is about 7 storey high at the one in Shibuya and within each floor, they have three sections, namely, A, B and C. I bought slim carbon laced chopping board that is also anti bacteria.Street food is fun and I bought a fried pancake that is filled with redbean and it was good. Yakitori is another local choice. At Asakusa, they have a machine that turns out pastry at 3 per 100 yen. I, just bought them and surprisingly it was good.Be careful of the expiry date, when you buy food in Japan. Some don't have long shelf life. Also note those in refrigerated display, which may need careful handling.A word on train travels. 1 yen and 5 yen coins are not acceptable on trains. Always buy the ticket from the automated machine that is closest to the gates, as some stations have multiple line and you may buy the correct fare to the destination, but from a different company. Refund, is not an issue and they don't ask you, why?. When changing lines, you may actually get out of the station and walking on the street to the other line as in my case to Asakusa. Just don't be alarmed and follow the directional signs. In short, trust the Japanese. If you change your mind about the destination, no problem, just keep travelling and when you reach your destination, simply top up, the fare, if it is insufficient. In all, the rails are friendly.Currency exchange may be a problem for some nationality. I changed mine at Mitsui Sumitomo in Shinjuku. Note that the same bank, but at a different location may not have the same service. As an example, Mitsui Sumitomo in Asakusa don't do currency exchange. Many currency are not accepted for exchange, so be forewarned. As an example, Malaysian currency won't do any good at Mitsui Sumitomo in Shinjuku. The conclusion is to change your currency at the airport or to sign your expenditure via credit card, like VISA.Shop keepers in Japanese may not be Japanese in racial stock. Higashi Shinjuku is, like Korean town, with a few Chinese and Thailand outlet. Don't ever eat at the last Thai restaurant that is diagonally from E hotel. It was a rip off. This particular restaurant is at basement 1, with a steamboat restaurant on the right of the entrance at Basement 1. I also found a lot of Chinese in Asakusa and Akhibara. The Indians also have some IT shops at Akhibara. I saw a Nepali run shop that sells ""prata"" in Shibuya. In short, if the shopkeeper does not look Japanese, they are probably a foreigner. A tell tale sign, is when they they converse to their staff in non Japanese language.In all, Tokyo, is quite dirty, at least in comparison with Sapporo. You may find the homeless, like the one I saw, just metres away from the Keio Mall, in Shinjuku. The Japanese were nice people and will try to help you, if you need some answers, but be good at interpreting their hand signals, gestures and facial emotions. The city is not that expensive as I envisage, althought I saw a half million yen kinomo at Keio Mall.I like Tokyo and will visit the place in a couple of years time. I am still enjoying all the food and tidbits that occupies half my luggage and report here that every single one is good. I love their cakes, ice cream and chocolates."
30,“Arigato Gozaimas”,"Japan has four climates and during my vacation I just experienced the winter season. And at this time the Philippines is experiencing hot weather.Img_2157Their main mode of transportation is the train system. They do have bus and taxi but less people use it. They have provided maps all over the station so that people will not get lost. Of course, for short distance, they use bicycle.They are very organized such as that they have the right lane reserved for people who are in a hurry in the escalatorHindi rin uso ang singit sa kanila. They are very patient in waiting for their turn.In a train, before people get in they let the others embark the train first.They always provide hot towel for cleaning of hands in the restaurants.They provide mouthwash in their lavatory.There is always tissue in their restrooms.The tourists are well provided with maps in amusement parks, zoo, museums and gardens.The McDonald’s and KFC’s value meals allows you to choose from all the drinks such as coffee, cocoa, pineapple juice etc with added charges.PeImg_2177ople are allowed to perform in the streets, whether they will sing, dance, acrobat, etc.You can leave your things anywhere and for sure no one will get it.In the grocery store, it is self-service.

It is actually difficult to determine who the girl is because both have long hairs.Guys shave their armpits and eyebrows.Haagen_vendoVendo machine anywhere. Haagen-Dazs is available in a vendo machine.So many Coca-Cola products available such as Ginger Ale, Vitaming, Corn Soup. etc.They are workaholic people. Can you believe it that the rush hour in this country is 9pm – 10pm?There are a lot of pachinko slot that even men in suit plays.Disney Sea can only be seen in Tokyo, Japan.The only sad part in visiting JAPAN during Christmas and New Year is that they don’t really celebrate. Unlike in the Philippines, you can really feel the spirit."
50,“Opposites Attract”,"From vertiginous buildings to miniature trees, Japan is a land of surprising contrasts. And its iconic capital, Tokyo, showcases these extremes to dazzling effect.A country famed for being unfailingly polite, Japan shrugs off formality and inhibition after-hours for rowdy drinks at intimate izakaya (shot bars), and abandons etiquette at local karaoke establishments.Behind the flashy neon facades hide a multitude of Alladin’s Cave-style treasures. Thai restaurants, complete with tinkling water and lush greenery, lurk in non-descript office block buildings, sixteen floors up. Traditional Japanese ryoken (inns) nestle together behind mega shopping complexes. And exquisitely adorned Geisha shimmy through swathes of grey-clad early morning commuters at Shinjuku station.Without a companion versed in Japanese, the average traveller may find Tokyo bewilderingly impenetrable. But look ‘lost’ enough and invariably some kind soul will take pity on you and come to your aid, speaking always in immaculate English.At once understated and brash, Tokyo’s charm is in its opposites. The city manages to feel both reassuringly familiar and fantastically alien, and is the perfect destination for finding your own parallel universe."
10,“Shocking experience in Tokyo”,"I had the most unbelievable experience in Tokyo in what is technically my first visit there. I was at Gaspanics Club with a mate dancing when my handbag was stolen along with my passport, money, two cellphones, some cash and a camera. I could not believe it as I had heard Tokyo is safer than Singapore. I told the security guys but they could do nothing. I hope this is a warning to all to not get complacent and that crime rates are rising in Tokyo. I have travelled all over the world and have not had even a dollar stolen from me. And to think that this happens to me for the first time and in the most unlikely place - in Tokyo!"
50,“Sushi and Samurai Await....”,by far one of the best places to visit in the world..... food is great... the night life is crazy... and.... the its the real city that never sleeps... ;)
30,“Shopping - Especially electronics”,"Just back from Tokyo and as I like my electronics/clothes shopping I'll wade through my experiences with you.1) Electronics - Most things (laptops, mp3's etc) do not work over here. They only work on Japanese operating systems. Some of them have been configured to work on Windows OS but you will find these are a third more in price - which negates the whole point in buying them from Tokyo2) The Japanese have amazing mobile phones which they even watch TV on. Unfortunately the network they use over there is not the same as ours - its light years ahead. So mobiles are a no go too3) Its not all bad though. PSP's there are £100 at the moment so about £30 cheaper than here. The PSP is a global portable machine so when you turn it on select english. I bought a japanese game (they come out early there) and that plays in English4) Cameras - Go to Akinhabara. One of the big stores will do. The japanse are so polite even if they're English is rubbish they will still try to help you. This doesn't always help though so here's the lowdown. Cameras there are a good 15-30% cheaper. However, these are the japanese ones. International phones are the same price or maybe more. Whats the difference? Intl ones come with an Intl warranty, manual and are in English. Japanese ones only come with Japanese warranty, manual. However, you can change the settings on all of them (other than Sony) to English. So thats your best bet. i got an ace Nikon camera. Warrantys are pants and within 2 years I'd want a new one anyway. Also, who reads the manual. If you ask nicely they'll get you an English one (I got one). Re. sony they make all there 'to export' goods in Europe now so there is no need for the japanese products to have English menus.Laox the 'duty free' place for tourists is as you would guess a rip off. Go to Yodibashi (I think). Softmap is good too. Basically go where the japanese go. Tourist places are much more expensive5) Clothes - Ginza is full of rip off designer shops. Why buy stuff from there when you can get it here for cheaper?6) Uniqlo is very, very cheap there. Cheaper than H&M here so pay that a visit. Other than that Shubiya has some trendy places7) Conclusion - you don't go to Japan to shop. Go to the states if you want to go shopping ;-)"
50,“Tadaima (I'm home)”,"Tokyo was the most alive city I have ever seen! It is truly the city that never sleeps! The club district Roppongi is always moving with some type of activity, and there is ever y possible type of bar/pub from Irish to karaoke, dance/electronic to jazz, anything you can think of, and there are some that most would have never considered!The electronics district Akibahara has miles and miles of stores with nothing but gadgets. The Ginza shopping district has some of the finest stores and shops in the world from all over in one centralized area!The train system to navigate throughout the city is extremely easy to use, and trains run at the least every 10 minutes, and the bus system in the city is very easy to use too!I recommend any Japanese restaurant, especially the small ""hole in the wall"" noodle or gyoza shops to experience a bit of authentic Japanese culture & customs."
50,“Tokyo for thrifty travellers!”,"No! Tokyo is not a budget busting city! This is, of course, if you are prepared to forego the western idea of huge hotel rooms! I've taken tours of students, adults, family and friends here and we have discovered the many secrets to holidaying in Tokyo within a budget. Firstly, forget the western idea of large hotel rooms. Honestly, they are such a waste of space - and the only time you really should be in your hotel room is to collapse into their wonderful baths and then into bed. So here is the first big tip - stay in business hotels. These range from 50 - 100 Australian dollars per room. And that is very economical for a couple or twin share. Breakfast will set you back $A5. These hotels are always near railway stations - our favourite is the Grand Central Hotel in Kanda (that's one train station from Tokyo central) It is close to Ueno (for the markets and zoo), and Akihabara (electric city) In addition, it is one street away from the best food street you could wish for. And now for the second tip - don't eat like a westerner! Along this food street, you will find hand made sushi (our all time favourite!), donburi (a meal in a bowl - for around 6-10 Australian dollars) and the best bars in the district. Food allowance is about $A30 per day and that is more than enough."
50,"“Tokyo, One Of the Best Places to visit.”",An amazing place to visit !
50,“Out and about in Tokyo”,"I've only been to a few big cities in my life, but I must say that so far, Tokyo is my favorite. Unlike other cities, you can walk around and feel completely safe because it is one of the safest cities in the world. Plus, the public transportation is great.My outing in Tokyo found me first at the Harajuku district aka The Fashion District. If you dress like a lunatic here, you're a comformist. here, you'll find everything from gothic brides to things that are just unclassifiable. Even Gwen Stefanie dedicated her whole album to this place.Right by Harajuku is a place called Yoyogi Park. If you are any type of artist, this place is sure to inspire you. Artists ranging from bands to dancers to stand-up comedians show case their work literally side-by-side. As you walk through the park, the music changes. There even was a dancing painter.Those were definitely my top two highlights. Make sure to check out the Meiji Shrine as well as Shinjuku and Akihabara."
50,“Tokyo”,"Tokyo is not any more expensive than New York City. It is so easy to navigate with their high tech subway and rail way system. It was so easy to get around to whereever you wanted to go. Every thing is so efficient and everyone is so polite in resturants and hotels. It is a cash society and if you plan to charge in any eating or drinking place, expect to pay a lot.Otherwise if you do like the locals you'll come out ahead and feel good. Don't eat at the hotels, lots of places outside. Enjoy.we plan to go back soon."
50,“Food is too good :P'”,"Firstly, its not expensive like what most people think. I had tepanyaki, okonomiyaki, italian, chinese and also went to an organic food restuarant and all these restaurants were reasonably priced. Just like what you would expect to pay in Sydney. The food tastes great!!And secondly, not everyone in Tokyo dresses up like killer-fashionista's. You might see some punk, goth and manga style in Harajuku.I stayed at a friends place in Tamachi which was a vibrant neighbourhood with heaps of restaurants, opened til like midnight everynight! Down the road was the Tokyo Tower, and costs 820yen to go up the 333m tower (well worth it).My short description of the neighbourhoods are as follows, Shibuya (happening city+cool shopping/rest), Shinjuku (CBD), Harajuku (bohemian), Otemesando (designer clothing), Ginza (designer clothing), Asakusa (Shrine/souvenirs), Akibibara (Electronic Town), Roppongi Hills (Red Light District w chic & trendy rest/shopping).I love Harajuku, they sell bazaar-like clothes and most things are unique. You can also get crepes here and it reminds me of Rue Moufettard in St Germain, Paris (narrow street + crepes).Taxi is expensive and most drivers dont speak english. Purchasing a metro ticket from the machine is also difficult because its not in english (major stations are ok).I've tried coffee in different places e'day and the best you could get is at Tullys (which is comparable to Sydney Starbucks)."
40,“Tokyo with Children”,"I just returned from a 2 week trip to Tokyo (14-23 Jun) and I'm writing this review here as a way to thank all the people who so kindly provided advice to me before my trip.Persons involved: Myself, my hubby my 3.5 year old boy, and I was also 2 mths pregnant at the time of the trip. I'll try to be as organised as possible. Let me know what you think of my review.When?14-16 Jun (Wed-Fri)Where? RIHGA Royal Hotel near WasedaThis is a fantastic hotel. My husband was speaking at a conference and got to stay there. We got a special conference rate for Y28200 for a double room including breakfast for 2 adults. The service is simply worldclass. The porter was very patient and even explained how to use the phone, eg dialing from room to room (as he knew our friend was staying in the next room). When my boy fell sick on the 3rd day, the conceirge took great effort to find a paediatrician nearby for me and even helped me explain to the taxi driver the location.Where did we go?For kids who love sea creatures:a) 1st day we went to Sunshine City Aquarium. You have to get a map to reach there. The map in the TripAdvisor website is a little misleading cos' it looks like the building is right next to the train station. I didn't have a map but was extremely blessed to bump into a very helpful Japanese lady who walked me (about 15 min) all the way there. Always get your directions right first, cos' the building is so big and we wld've missed it if I didn't chk out that it is in the World Import Mart Building.The aquarium is quite small, but conveniently located (Ikebukuro station) so if you dont' feel like travelling far, it's ok. There are a quite few entertaining shows (seal show, diver feeding ). All commentary is in Japanese language.b) 2nd day we went to Shinagawa Aquarium. It is must bigger and reminds me more of Singapore's underwater world at Sentosa. There is a glass tunnel where you can see the sea creatures and a huge tank with 2 very fat sand tiger sharks (makes you wonder what they were fed with!!! hehehe)Quite good as they have a variety of creatures, incl a very sleepy octopus, dolphin show and tank, variuos types of lobsters which my boy loves.As the hotel is at Takadanobaba, it is about a 1.5 hour journey to the aquarium. Can be very tiring for the child (and pregnant woman!) so, do start your day a little earlier so you can go back to nap in the afternoon.Note - if yuo're having lunch at the Dolphin Lagoon restaurant, you don't ""queue up"" for a seat. Instead, there is a notepad where yo uput your name and number of pax. I missed this and ended up standing there foolishly for about 10+ min (and nobody to ask cos' the waiters are so busy and the Japanese didn't speak English....).Day 3 - my boy had a slight cough and stuffy nose and the medicine I brought had leaked! argh.... do pray hard that your doctor speaks some English, or ask the conceirge to help with some translation first. It's a good thing the doc spoke 7 words I coudl understand - body temperature, water intake(ie drink more water), Polaramine (medicine I'm familiar with) and runny nose. NOTE that unlike Singapore, the pharmacist and doctor are separate. We had to walk about 10 min to get to the pharmacist! And don't forget to get the receipts from both sides if you want to make your travel insurance claim!Food at Takadanobaba - plenty of small eateries / takeout counters. These are specifically for the students and cheap and good! I got 2 thick slabs of Unagi on rice with pickels for only Y650. My hubby got his katsu don for only Y350 (take out). There is a little soba shop about 5 min from the hotel with soba less than Y500 (standing room only, so our boy had to stand on the chair to eat but he was quite delighted....) My advice, however, is only eat ebi fry / tempura at places where they freshly fry it. Pre-fried ones are cold and soggy.17 Jun - Tsukiji fish market. Nearest station is Tsukijishio. From station exit (there are signs on where's the market). turn left and turn left. You'll see a huge place with plenty of trucks. Don't worry. Just walk past all the trucks to the inside where you'll see the market next to the docks. Go as early as you can. We reached at 9.30am after breakfast and quite a few stalls were already closed. Very fascinating how huge tuna is! My boy loves sea creatures so he really loved the market.Contrary to what I interpreted from a travel guide, there are no rows of eateries there but only about 2-3 sushi places with super long queues. We tried the one next to the vegetable stalls. Very very fresh but expensive. Y2600 for 7 piece nigiri (mixed) set. Everyone has to order a set, which I cldn't as pregnant women shld refrain from eating raw food. So I ordered 3 pieces of anago (cooked river eel). very expensive - 3 pieces for Y1400, but it was the best and softest I've ever eaten. Well worth your money!Transport from Royal Hotel to a ryokan hotel near Tokyo Station was a big hassle. No lifts and plenty of staircases. We had to carry all our stuff and the stations are HUGE from one exit to another. Be prepared to walk walk walk. I was tired out ....Ryokan hotel near Tokyo Station - i don't wish to name the hotel, but just be VERY VERY careful when you book such small-time hotels. The photos on the net look so new and clean. The hotel is a SMOKING building and the ventilation is terrible. The corridors are dark and dingy and the sheets didn't smell very clean. The exhaust from the restaurants don't work so the rooms smelt like salted fish ( a real pain for pregnant woman like me!). People walked along the corridors smoking and I had to use cushions to cover the door entrance! My hubby hates smoke and after 1 hour in the room, he went out to search for another hotel. We moved out in 2 hours cos' it was simply unbearable. The hotel still charged us Y12,000 (nearly S$170) for cancellation charges even though we told them I'm pregnant and my husband is recovering from a critical illness... i guess it's their policy. In any case, we had to go.Next stop - Yaesu Terminal Hotel. We were lucky to get a non-smoking room there as it was the last room. We were thankful but be warned that the Double room is really like a capsule hotel. We paid Y16900 for the room w/o breakfast. expensive, but what to do - location and it was clean and smoke free!!!! There is a queensized bed with about a foot-length space around the bed, plus a bathroom that looks like the airplane bathroom. It was super cramped. We got kicked by my boy all night so the next night, my hubby slept on the floor! We chose the location as the return journey from our Mount Fuji tour ended at Tokyo station. Otherwise, I wld recmomend that you stay somewhere else near train station, but not Tokyo station area. very expensive.Sunday 18 Jun - Asakusa and Ueno . Asakusa is a sheltered shopping place. The prices for all the wares are standard across shops (the only place with ""discount"" is after you check in at the airport - no 5% tax, that's all) .I love the mochi and nicely packaged biscuits, etc. Ueno is not sheltered and it was raning. They sell more fresh produce like fruits and crabs. Quite ok for adults to roam, but my boy was quite impatient... I don't think many kids like shoppping. Our conclusion was that, besides aquariums and Disney, Tokyo is not very suitable for children!FOOD - There is a small restaurant near Yaesu Terminal hotel (turn left from the restaurant and left again at the junctino. It is at the basement and called ""Sky Dog / Heavenly Dog"" (Tian1 Gou3 in chinese). Very cheap and good! most Jap stalls specialise (ie ramen only, curries only) but these guys sell nearly everything - and every thing tastes great!!! We went there 2 nites - only Y2300 for about 6-7 dishes. we were stuffed!btw, Takashimaya / Daimaru, etc, have 50% discount off food prices at their basements after 8+ . great time to pick up breakfast for tomorrow.Monday - finally hubby and I felt like we were travelling cos' we went for the Mt Fuji/Hakone tour with Sunrise tours. very well organised. Just be warned - if you don't pay a ticket for your child, there is no seat on the coach and the travelling time there is about 3-4 hours. We were blessed as it was ""offpeak"" season and the entire back row was empty, so we paid for 2 and got 5 seats! The tour guide was very good - spoke excellent English. We were vety blessed as we managed to see the peak of Mt Fuji from the 5th station. When we left, a huge grey cloud covered it and from then on, it was covered.... !The tour is worth it, although the time spent is quite short, but there is suff time to take photos, have a snack and browse thru' souvenirs. Lunch was a decent western meal and after that we proceeded to Hakone where we took the Ropeway. Very fun and i loved the mountain top.We stayed at Hakone Prince Hotel which is next to the lake. Altho the hotel is clean and the view is great, be warned about dinner. Maybe as it was June (offpeakseason), all the outlets were closed!!! (they close at about 3pm) The only places open were a Chinese restaurant (which they have to bring you to by bus.. quite far I think), the Hakone Sakura restaurant and Potomac cafe (at the Annex). We didn't realise the Potomac was open and ended up at the Sakura and paying Y5000 PER PERSON for the buffet, which was not fantastic at all. Really , it's a monopoly there so please be warned about dinner. If you pack dinner during lunch (eg sandwiches) it would save you a lot of money. Well, at least we got good service and a good view. sigh...Breakfast not provided, so good thing we had some leftoverbread (essential to have these with a child - he's always hungry!). We enjoyed all the rides in the Hakone free pass. It's very easy to use. Take the free bus to Tokendai, enjoy the 15 min ""Pirate Ship"" ride to Hakone Machi, enjoy some early lunch there. We ate at the 3rd eatery from the left (there is a row of them near the boat station). The smelt, rainbow trout and bass are all delicious as they are caught from the Lake Ashi itself! Very fresh!. Make sure you note the timings of the ship properly so you won't spend too much time there if you dn't want to).Then we took the ship back to Tokendai and took the cables / ropeways all the way to Odawara. (all the rides are joined, so no worries)Food - Along the way, we stopped at MIyanoshita cos' I read from one of the Forums that there is food here. Really, dont' bother, cos' the sushi shop is quite far away and the day we went was Tues - the day it was closed! There are no other food shops except a very expensive bakery (operated by the very expensive Fujiya hotel) and a small soba shop near the train station. We had walked down a very super steep slope (and of course back up!!) just to look for food and were so disappointed the only eatery was actually right next to the station. They serve decent soba and desserts. Tastes extra nice if you have just walked up and down a 45 deg slope pushing a sleeping boy in the stroller....There are many more eateries at Odawara and cheaper bakeries there. Take your time to walk around as there are quaint little shops and eateries. We even found one where they were having half price sushi. Of course not as fresh as the Tsukiji fish market, but still very good. You have to look out for those shops which leads upstairs and have the ""half price "" sign (in Japanese. Those who can read Chinese / kanji would have no problems).After the shinkansen ride (very fast and comfy), we slept at Hotel Yaesu Fujiya that night , so that hubby won't have to zzz on the floor anymore! HOtels are quite ok with you leaving luggage when you make day /overnight tours. It was expensive Y25200 (with discount on weekday) w/o breakfast, but worth the night's sleep!21-22 Jun - Disney Sea and Disney land.Getting there - very easy. Just take train to Maihama station. You may be confused as to why there are several platforms leading to Maihama station. Note that there are ""limited express"" and ""express"" trains going there too - have to pay more of course. Don't worry about the platforms, just follow the signs to Maihama (and Disneyland, which they state) and you won't miss it. If yuo're not sure, just ask any Japanese ""Maihama""? They will point to yuo. We were on tight budget (esp after paying so much for hotels!) so we paid only about Y260 for a normal train ride. Note however, the train is quite infrequent after 10am. We waited 20 min for it to move off. We went Disney sea first cos' it closes at 10pm (we reached there about 10.30am). For those staying at Disney affliated hotels, you can go straight to the ""Welcome Centre'> For those staying at the ""sort of affiliated"" hotels (eg Palm and Fountain Terrace Hotel), note that you have to go to the Bon Voyage basement instead. (which is at the opposite end). We took the Y200 single ticket monorail ride to Disney Sea (since it's quite far to walk) after sending our luggage via Bon Voyage. It's very worth it. Else you have to waste time checking in and the hotel is quite far away.The monorail is worth taking once for novelty. Don't need to buy day pass if you intend to stay at just 1 resort in a day.DISNEY SEA - Really fantastic! This is really more suitable for adults / teens, as one reviewer said. The rides have more variety and the shows are great. As it was off peak season and a Wed, we waited only 5 min for each ride on ave. No fastpasses were even issued cos' of the short waiting time! Food was surprisingly not too expensive. Less than Y900 per pax on average. Kids' meals are very worth it - about Y671 for variety of food.My boy enjoyed Mermaid lagoon - all the kiddy rides and kiddy roller coaster. Really fun, even for pregnant women!We stayed thru' till the Braviseamo show and fireworks - very worth it. You have to stay for it. It was just brilliant and very enjoyable. Note that for the braviseamo show, we actually went to the place 20 min before hand. This was the only one where we had to ""Q up"" for .... already all the best seats were taken and we had to stand at the side. Try to go about 30-40 min earlier, picnic there and wait. The Japs have lots of patience and will wait a long time for good seats!! :)Palm & Terrace Fountain HOTEL - Most Value for Money and worthwhile hotel we stayed in. They are for families, have 4 single beds!! Internet offer - Y16800 for 2 comes with 2 adult breakfast too(all you can eat. The bread is soft and delicious). There is free shuttle bus to Disney resort, but it is about 20 min away from Disney. I highly recommend this hotel.22 Jun - DISNEYLAND . Seems that this is meant more for children. Lots of characters and parades, which the Japanese folks just love! The rides were not of that much variety as compared to DisneySea. But for those who grew up with Disney, like me, you will love hearing all your fave Disney songs and reliving your childhood.Tips - Grab your fastpass and then go for the less popular rides (esp when you see a 5-10 min wait). When the pass time is here, then go for your ride using the Fastpass. Note that during Parade time, a LOT of people will be queueing there and waiting, so that's the BEST time to sit on the popular rides (Pooh's Honey Hunt, Buzz's Astro Blaster Ride). We used this method to ride on the Astro Blaster 3 times! yipee. Also, choose your location strategically. Eg if you want to grab the Buzz ride again, choose a street nearby to watch the 8pm Dreamlights parade (NOT to be missed!!) and right when the last float passes by, run back to your Buzz ride and there's hardly any Q there!! :)Food here is more expsensive than Disney Sea and less variety also, but I guess we all have to eat!WeatherIt was supposed to be the 2 most rainy weeks in the entire year, but we were hugely blessed! God really stopped the rain when we went to Mt Fuji, Hakone and the Disney resort! It is relatively warm during this month. Just a light windbreaker, T's and jeans would do. Note the Japanese really dress up, so anyone wearing T shirt can be easily identified as a foreigner!Transport1. Taxies - although very expensive, the flag down rate of Y660 takes you a fair distance. We only used it for emergencies (eg when bringing my boy to the doc)2. Train stations - Besides the JR Tokyo station, the other stations have no lifts! It's quite a shock to us cos' in Singapore, nearly all the train stations have lifts to the platforms. This was very inconveninet to us cos' we had to carry our heavy suitcases and stroller up and down staircases . The train stations are so big that you can't see one end from another, so no point trying to find the escalator cos 'they may not be in the right direction anyway....3. I cldn't find the discount tickets some of the reviewers spoke of and the train master cldn't speak Englihs, so I ended up buying single tickets. That's fine cos' we didn't travel much each day - no point buying the day tickets which are more expsnsive.LanguageActually most Japanese don't speak English, even at tourist destinations (very very minimal), esp those that are catered to Japanese (eg the aquariums). Disney - no problem of course!Useful to know a few Jap phrases - like Doko Desuka (where is it?) and Sumimasen (Excuse me)Those who can read Chinese would find it's easier to get around / read restaurant signs cos' many words are in Kanji.For kids:- Kids under 4 years old typically don't have to pay for ANYTHING (transport, entrance) so 3.5 years old is a very economical time to travel!- I feel that actually Tokyo city is actually not very suitable for toddlers. There's a lot of walking around so a stroller is a must. Disney and Mt Fuji were better for him. Bring along lots of ""entertainment"" that your child likes. Eg I brought a stack of mazes (cos' he loves puzzles and mazes), blank paper and markers cos' he loves to draw and a small magna doodle for the coach or plane ride."

50,“Lovely Area of Tokyo”,"The area of Bunkyo-ku in Tokyo has a wonderful small-town feel to it. It is made up of mostly students (as the University of Tokyo and Bunkyo Gakuin University are located off of Hogo Dori), families, and older residents. Its location makes it somewhat centrally located and very easy to get to anywhere you would like to go in Tokyo, but immediately at your fingertips close by is the Ueno Station, Ueno Zoo, the beautiful Shinobazu Pond, the Nezu Shrine, and the Tokyo National Museum. I stayed at the ""Sawanoya Ryokan"" the first night I was there, and was very impressed with my very first Japanese-style Inn. I wish they had had a room available for me the entire time I was visiting Tokyo. It was extremely clean and comfortable, and the staff spoke decent English - which is hard to find in Tokyo. It was also very reasonably priced ($44USD/night). I also stayed at the ""Hotel Edoya"", which was more of an American type hotel, having both ""western"" rooms and Japanese-style rooms. My western room was very comfortable and clean as well. The area that this hotel was in was closer to the Akihabara area which has more action going on, but is still did not have the crazy action-packed surroundings of other districts. I felt very safe in this area as well (I am a young woman); one evening I took a 25 minute walk back to my hotel from the subway station a little after midnight and never once felt that my safety was in question. I loved this area of Tokyo and would definitely go back again. I would highly recommend that anyone not seeking the constant action and late hours nightlife of somewhere like Roppongi or Shibuya stay in the Bunkyo-ku area. Even if you are seeking more action, just hop the subway and it's not many stops away!"
50,“Tokyo Ciudad Muy Moderna y Ordenada”,"En este año, Abril 2013, fuimos con mi amada esposa a Tokyo, fué también un hermoso viaje, una ciudad bella, super moderna y ordenada, su gente muy culta y amable."
50,“Unglaubliche Stadt”,"Diese Stadt muss man einfach gesehen und vor allem erlebt haben. Wer noch nicht in Japan war, bekommt hier einen ersten tiefen Eindruck in die Mentalität der Japaner und Ihrer Lebensweise. Ich war zutiefst beeindruckt von der Präzision, Organisation und Sauberkeit, welche in Tokyo herrscht. Hier „kann man von der Straße essen“, so sauber ist es. Echt unglaublich. Rauchen darf man nicht mal auf der Straße, sondern nur an ausgewiesen Plätzen, welche teilweise schon ziemlich skurril sind. Kommt man in Narita an, ist es am besten, wenn man den Shuttelbus in die City nimmt. Dieser kostet einfach 3.000 JPY und bringt einem fast in jedes Major Hotel. Taxis sind unbezahlbar. Insgesamt muss man sagen, dass Tokyo und insgesamt ganz Japan extrem teuer sind. Beispielsweise zahlt man im Supermarkt für eine Dose Bier 2,50 EUR. Günstig ist dagegen das Metroticket für Touristen. Dieses besorgt man am Flughafen, ist zwei Tage gültig und kostet nur 980 JPY. Tokyo besichtigt man ehe mit der Metro, welche eine unvorstellbare Größe hat. Aufpassen muss man vor allem, welche Linie man wählt. Es mehrere nicht zusammenhängende, für welche man wieder zusätzliche Tickets benötigt. Ich war schon in jeder Großstadt der Welt, aber so was habe ich noch nicht erlebt. Man braucht erst mal einige Zeit, um sich vollständig zu orientieren. Zum Glück ist alles in Englisch ausgeschildert. Sobald man den Dreh hier raus hat, kann die Stadtbesichtigung beginnen. Tokyo ist riesig und es dauert seine Zeit und die Hotspots zu erreichen. Tokyos neues Wahrzeichen ist der Sky Tree. Schaut unheimlich cool aus, ist aber leider vollkommen überlaufen. Ich gab am Schluss auf und begnügte mich Bildern vom Turm. Wer rauf möchte, sollte diese am frühen Morgen und vor allem bei gutem Wetter machen. Der Blick auf den Fuji ist Weltklasse. Ich hatte von meinem Hotel „The Westin Tokyo“ nur am ersten Tag das Vergnügen. Die restlichen Tage war es leider zu bewölkt. Weiterer Höhepunkt ist der Imperial Palace, welche das beliebteste Photomotiv der City darstellt. Nicht missen sollte man den Tsukiji Central Fish Market. Wer allerdings die Tunfischauktion besuchen möchte, muss extrem früh aufstehen. Mir reichte der normale Markt. Wichtig ist hier, dass es sich nicht um einen Touristen Markt handelt, sondern um normales Business. Als Besucher möglichst nicht im Weg stehen, sondern das rege Treiben mit Abstand betrachten. Hier sieht man so gut wie „jeden“ Fisch der Weltmeere. Eigentlich traurig was die Japaner hier alles rausholen und dies täglich. Wer gerne Fisch isst, muss trotzdem hin. Vin den vielen Tempeln kann ich vor allem den Senso-Ji empfehlen, wobei die anderen auch ganz sehenswert sind. Nicht verpassen sollte man das legendäre Shibuya Crossing bei Tag und nachts. Hier kommt man sich vor wie am Times Square. Wer Museum liebt sollte auf jedem Falle das national Museum und das War Museum aufsuchen. Da erstgenannte ist for free. Er noch Zeit hat, sollte auf jedem Falle die Tokyo Bay aufsuchen. Hier hat man herrliche Blicke auf die Stadt und die Rainbow Bridge, samt kleine Freiheitsstatue. Shoppingcenter findet man hier ach zur Genüge. Die Freundlichkeit und Ordentlichkeit der Japaner haben mich bewegt und ich komme definitiv wieder."
50,“多样的东京”,东京是一个非常适合自由行的城市，既有都市的喧嚣，也有古城的宁静。三天可以看个大致，三周可以更加深入，但即便住上三年，你还是觉得东京有这么多的变化，有这么多可以看，可以转，可以玩，可以让人安静，也可以让人疯狂的地方。另外，日本人大多数都非常害羞，不会主动与陌生人交流，但是当你需要帮助的时候，他们会特别细心周到的提供给你帮助。
40,“Tokyo per turisti”,Tokyo potrebbe non sembrare una destinazione turistica ma non è così.E' vero che le attrazioni di carattere storico possono essere in misura minore rispetto ad altri luoghi ma la città ha molto da offrire al visitatore.Ogni quartiere ha le proprie peculiarità che lo distinguono dagli altri e che sono da scoprire.Non vanno sottovalutate le distanze: Tokyo è veramente immensa.Il trasporto pubblico è efficiente e facile da utilizzare anche per gli stranieri ma può creare un pò di confusione che l'operatore non è unico.
