30,"Obscure, Random, a Trip in Time","The Museum of Jurassic Technology is unique, to day the least. Wandering through a narrow maze of dimly lit dioramas and exhibits that showcase obscure heroes of technology from ancient times to mid last century, this is most certainly a learning opportunity and definitely a trip back in time to museum technology and etiquette of 30 years ago with its Do Not Touch” and “No Photography or Cell Phones” admonition. But still, the opportunity to celebrate dogs in space, 1930s mobile home technology, and the origins of medieval medical superstition makes the place a must-visit. And did I tell you about the miniatures? You would not believe...",lakewrites
50,"Difficult to Describe, but fascinating and worth a visit","Interesting exhibits from micromosaics made of butterfly wings that must be seen through a microscope, to exhibits of foklore, myth, and more, -- all presented in very interesting ways.

50,My cup of tea,"Having read the reviews, I was anxious to visit. This museum is perhaps not for everyone but it was certainly my cup of tea. To Begin with I should mention the no photo policy but where else can you buy viewmaster slides of exhibits? Essentially if this idea appeals to you this is your spot. I should mention that I am the proud owner of one and purchased the micromosaic slide.The museum itself is well put together with impressive showcases. There are these nifty “glasses” that you look through at some exhibits that show imagery. I found it to be a celebration of unknown scientists, engineers and artists. It was comforting to see their efforts lovingly preserved and displayed. There were some parts where additional information would’ve been helpful but all in all it is awesome for the right person. And yes they have tea and cookies.",LSQRD1

40,Nice low key attraction on a hot day.,"Took my 3 kids (9, 12 & 14) here as a break from the beach. The place kept them interested for a couple of hours. Entrance fee is super reasonable. Its a nice, quite museum that is much larger than it appears from the outside. Probably better for the inquisitive child, not so much for the high energy/short attention span child which my youngest is. Very nice outdoor area on the roof where one can have some teas and cookies on the house!",EasyTravellerLam

The name helps to imply that these are technologies that seem ancient to us now, but at one time were cutting edge. I'd originally thought it was going to be a collection of old phones and computers -- it is so much more beautiful and entertaining! The design of the place makes it feel like you're exploring an ancient relatives' old house who loved natural history and science.My only issue is that the upper floors may not be easily accessible for someone with limited mobility (at least I didn't see an elevator, but I didn't ask) and there are a few levels with steps. I have visited many museums in many cities of the world, and this is probably the most unique one ever.",RJFS

Expect to spend a decent amount of time wandering the halls and discovering the exhibits, and definitely keep your exploring pants on as you head to the roof where a very refined surprise awaits you ...The less you know the better in this rare case. Just go my friends and be bold.",Roberto Serrini

50,A really interesting surprise,We visited the Museum of Jurassic Technology during our honeymoon and I couldn't be more surprised. This is a really unique place and you realize it the moment you get through the front door. It's unusual and it gets more and more interesting during your visit. I absolutely recommend it. We opted for this smaller gem and we still don't regret it. Go see all its beauty for yourself :),Marianna_e_Salvatore
50,Not at all what you'd expect,"What a find. The exhibits are very off-beat and interesting. It is a leisurely stroll from room to room, with funky items to see. There is a gift shop. Do be sure to come when you can go upstairs to the Russian tea room. The owner is from Georgia, hence the Russian theme, so many interesting trinkets all around. Be sure, also, to go up to the roof for the sweet garden and view.A nice afternoon and something entirely different.",oma664

40,"Difficult to describe, and even harder to rate","I think reviewer Cavydad probably said it best: imagine if PT Barnum had a museum of curiosities. I referred to this place as a ""mockumentary"" museum. The ""museum's"" ""exhibits"" are not necessarily either historical or authentic. Many are carefully crafted art pieces designed to evoke the feeling of looking at rare artefacts. Some may in fact be authentic artefacts. The collection is definitely quirky, ranging from the bizarre superstitions of white people, to trailer dwelling history, to obscure people. As other reviewers have noted, many of the rooms are excessively dark, which adds to your feelings of strangeness, but is also annoying, and the museum is a disorienting labyrinth designed to just keep you turning into this or that undiscovered space, with no concept of what lies ahead or behind.Is it good? I'm still asking myself that question. I can tell you it is popular! The place was packed on the Sunday before Christmas, mostly with young creative types. (Is ""hipster"" derogatory?) The creatives appeared completely sucked in by the playful weirdness. Auntie and I are art lovers, but found the museum a bit harder to connect with. In the end, I think I admire it most as a complex and astonishingly sophisticated form of personal expression. To me, it was well worth the price of admission, just to marvel at the fact that someone not only created the museum and amassed the objects within it, but that they have created it as a successful business. The museum is unlikely to interest you if you do not find at least some joy in seeing others perform complex expression.TL:DR: If Burning Man appeals to you, you will like this museum.",DonnaSPDX
40,Interesting,"The museum has several galleries and an eclectic assortmentof artifacts. The building is a two story labyrinth and aguide map would have been helpful.All the rooms are too dark, even the lobby is dark.I understand the concept of creating atmosphere andpreserving fragile documents, but I think in thiscase they should consult a professional lightingtechnician.We were pleasantly surprised when we entered one galleryand found a lady serving tea and cookies to the guests.We also enjoyed the birds in the courtyard.This museum does not have its own parking.The best choice is to park on the street on Venice Blvdbetween Bagley and Cardiff and use a parking meter.Buy two hours on the meter.",Emerald1125

Count on getting disoriented numerous times. Think, Alice walking through the looking glass, but in a good way.This is one of the better curated museums I have ventured into. Imagine the Louvre and Getty on steroids. Not formal, yet extremely formal. Every exhibit is well thought out and it is entertaining and educational.",Cavydad
40,Very intriguing. .. and pretty unusual,"Imagine an eclectic museum that's been around for some 30 years, with exhibits on random topics you'd likely never see anywhere else in the world. In this very dark, multistory, multiroom place, you'll see art on the head of a pin, learn all about how RVs came into being, discover how to do hand string tricks and much more. It's recommended you watch a short introductory film just to the left once you go inside to discover the history of this museum, as well as the evolution of museums in general. There's even free tea and cookies on the second for you can enjoy there or take up to a small rooftop garden. There's no way to absorb all the trivia in these displays in 1 visit. I recommend a return visit, which I am planning to do. The fee is a reasonable $8 for adults and $5 for students, teachers and senior citizens.",Elaine P

50,A Museum of Museum Craft,"First off this is not your typical museum, for those people expecting a typical museum, you will not like it. The point is not necessarily the objects on display but the display itself. The displays, the galleries, the garden, and the overall vibe are impeccably done, all contributing to a general aesthetic explicitly designed to mimic really, really old museums, the dark, dank ones with placards drier than the Atacama Desert and musty dioramas of animals frozen in time.I mean, this is a museum with an entire room dedicated to a (highly fictitious) history of mobile homes, augmented with what's ostensibly collections of artifacts from what the reader can tell are really just trailer park bums. This is a museum with a entire exhibit dedicated to superstitious folk remedies, with a diorama of a human mouth biting down on a duck's beak, right next to open-faced mouse sandwiches. So go to the Museum of Jurassic Technology not for education, but for sensation, to immerse yourself in a smorgasbord of curios and anomalies, to soak in the strangeness, and leave not feeling enlightened, but very, very confused.",Chicago52

10,Museum of Random Crap,"Now I know that the easiest way to make a fortune is to raid my parents' attic for all their random crap and then put a placard on it. Seriously, when there is an exhibit devoted to things that were hoarded in trailer parks, you have a problem. Also, could you consider installing a freaking light bulb in your bathroom??? Valuable lesson learned: Anytime you are told to turn off your cellphone and no photography in a museum, you know it's going to suck.",Elise P
40,Surreal place with peculiar vibe,"This is not a museum per se but rather a collection of random things with varying degrees of authenticity. It functions sort of like a joke museum where different discoveries from different time periods are exhibited and the visitor is left to ponder about their significance within their time frame. The most surreal part of the visit was a random dog appearing which walked up stairs to a room about dogs used in the Soviet Space Program with their paintings and stopped and turned back. However, it was afraid to descend down the stairs despite going up smoothly and had to be carried outdoors, after which it disappeared. Overall, a good visit for those who like thinking, conspiracy theories or creepy stuff but also interesting for those who just want to have a look at how ancient discoverers thought about their discoveries and how that reflects on our knowledge today.",yny579
50,Most Excellent and Unique Distraction,"I came here with a few friends who'd come before, but kept the nature of this place hidden from me (and I had not checked Trip Advisor reviews prior). It was a marvelous and refreshing surprise indeed, after perusing the first few exhibits, to discover the anti-Museum purpose of the Museum of Jurassic Technology. Very clever, witty and imaginative approach. I had a great time appreciating all the fantastical detail put into creating and describing each item on display... to the degree that this place could truly qualify as an art museum. Enjoyed it much more than the LA MOCA that I had visited earlier in the day. Certainly a worthwhile experience I hope to repeat again next time I come to LA and with a fresh batch of unsuspecting friends. Having complimentary tea in the Rooftop Tea Room was a marvelous capping to this enchanting experience.",Barzinji

40,A museum like no other...,"We had no expectations after reading about this kitschy place...just wanted to go for a drive and do something different. Judging by the displays, the owner must be fond of everything Russian and who also seems to be a huge fan of Napoleon Bonaparte as there were many displays of these things. One favorite was viewing amazing microscopic miniature sculptures. Fascinating maudlin displays of old medical cures filled one room. There are tons of things to see as you wind around the dark hallways. It’s an eclectic collection of weird stuff. It is dark and somewhat stuffy inside...might be too hot in summer. It was a relief to climb up the long stairway to the tearoom where they served us a complementary cup of tea and cookies which you can take outside and enjoy the atrium and the doves (be careful here, as the birds fly and perch right above your head where you sit).We had way more fun there than we expected to, just because it’s so different. If you are feeling playful go there, just don’t expect to see anything ""Jurassic"". I would love to know why the name.",Marian s
30,The Medical Section Is The Real Reason to Go Here!,"We decide to give this museum a go because wanted to try something different while on our vacation and this place seemed promising.

10,Tourist trap,"I went in with an open mind and expected it to be a decent commentary on museums and truth. Instead it was a rundown compilation of vaguely interesting oddities and fake exhibits with longwinded, poorly written descriptions. It was the humor of educated adolescents.

50,A deconstruction of museums is more fun than it sounds!,"If you’re the sort of person who loves museums as curated catalogs and displays of history and culture, you will be fascinated by The Museum of Jurassic Technology, because it’s not really that, but pretends to be. Conversely, if you’re not a fan of visiting museums because you find them dull and stuffy, you will probably also enjoy this museum, albeit for different reasons, such as it not being a museum of technology at all. The Museum of Jurassic Technology, while being a legitimately beautiful repository of art and media, sets out to deliberately disorient its visitors with its displays and the information that it offers about them, some of which is clearly absurd, inaccurate, not relevant to the items being displayed, or makes very obviously biased and subjective arguments and accounts of the displays’ origins and their “meaning.” This reminds us that we generally trust museums as institutional resources of verifiable knowledge, and can be surprised, amused, bemused, or even angry when they are clearly trying to trick us. The museum plays with our ideas of the museum with exhibits like a collection of “official” state-commissioned portraits of Soviet cosmology program dogs, exhibits about “sciences” that don’t exist, or films of historical events where the voice of the film’s narrator and of the translator coincide and make both of them hard to distinguish, thus rendering the history incomprehensible. The tone of the text describing the exhibits is fanciful, playful, and not especially concerned with seeming realistic. I enjoyed the museum as I would an art museum rather than a museum where I would learn about history or science, and it is in this spirit that the visit is most enjoyable, since you can never be sure if what you’re seeing and reading is true or a conceptual art joke. Fans of Dadaism, surrealism, abusurdism, experimental and avant-garde art and writing, as well as creative people with good senses of humor, will be able to have a good time feasting their eyes on the beautiful exhibits (which do feature remarkable paintings and sculptures as well as whimsical and strange texts). You’re also able to unwind on the roof after you’ve made your way through the museum, where atriums and peacocks provide a tranquil view, and tea and cookies nourish you after the agreeable exercise of visiting a museum that doesn’t really concern itself with anything but delighting the senses. Most children probably won’t enjoy this museum, and people who don’t like the sort of art and comedy that I described may want to skip it and head to the Getty or a “real” museum instead.",Thea F

From the outside it is very unassuming and there is a lot more hidden within than you'd expect, I think it took us about 2 hours and that was without taking some time to relax with some free tea and biscuits up on the terrace. I think the price you pay for the amount of time it takes to wander through is very reasonable though and I hear they're always changing exhibits for those that want to keep returning.",PeepJC

This museum questioned the very fabric of what a museum is. Without giving away too much detail, I definitely laughed out loud at the videos, audio and written descriptions of the various ""collections."" I did get a bit bored halfway through as some of the exhibits are kind of drab, and it all seems a little too random. When I go to museums I usually get enthralled in the stories or history, so in this case it didn't really grab my attention for too long.I would definitely go through the entire museum and check out the tea garden upstairs.Four out of five stars for the uniqueness of it all.

I'm pretty sure this isn't the planned reason for its existence though!Cheap to get in we actually spent a good hour creeping around the dimly lit rooms not sure of what would crop up next. Trailer park memorabilia and half a stuffed dog yelping in a glass box? You got it. Aminiature Goofy on top of a needle and three expired mice on toast? Yep they have that too.A lovely lady gave us a delicious cup of tea and cookie as we ended our visit and I bought a great book and a beeswax candle copy of a lady's horn that had grown out of her head.Highly recommended and a must see for those after something off the beaten track.,JonathanDownes
50,Great odd museum,"Before you go, you should be aware that it is not an ordinary museum. It is kind of sarcastical, or satirical about ordinary museuns, and I think that the ""Jurassic Thecnologology"" refers to superstitions, as if they were used as technology to solve things.

The Wilsons eventually received a well-deserved MacArthur Foundation grant (genius grant), which they put back into the museum. It is essentially ""a museum about museums."" A bit strange at first, stay with it and enjoy the experience.

There are lots of cases that you have to look at very close from beautiful butterfly wings to a rat between 2 slices of bread. The lighting is non existent and some cases remain empty but between the painted pin heads and the furry dog like creature that howls when you get close its a great hour to roam. I think its $5.00 and includes a visit to the upstairs tea room and the red headed Russian lady and her dogs that hold court. It is without a doubt like stepping in a twilight zone. When you get out you can hit the In and Out burger next door! It is for one who is very open minded and likes the bizarre because not a lot makes sense. I loved it.,jstevens S

50,Museum of Jurassic Technology is where art and science overlaps.,"This is a museum made for nerds, misfits, introverts, pot smokers, psychedelic drug users, artists, scientists, book lovers, writers, emos, occultists, sexual deviants, haters, people who enjoy early David Bowie and Talking Heads, people who've had childhood trauma that has been treated with drugs or/and therapy, and folks with a dark sense of humor. You should be someone with an active imagination. At one time in your life someone should have described you as ""weird"". Above all, you need to have a deep curiosity and willingness to learn about things you won't understand from a brief glance. Some exhibits are laid out in a story format that requires your persistent attention to get all the way through and often doesn't have any big pay-off aside from the narrative itself.If this doesn't in any way describe you it's better to skip it. If you're looking to take a date here who doesn't have any of the above qualities, skip it. If you have a short attention span, skip it. If you obsessively take selfies wherever you go, skip it. If you follow professional sports, skip it. If you drive a BMW or Audi that you purchased yourself, skip it. You're probably too normal for this place, and that's ok. Don't try to force it or fake it, you'll just wind up not enjoying it here and will resent those who do.The Museum of Jurassic Technology shouldn't be taken seriously starting with its name. There are no dinosaur bones or computers here. If anything it resembles a large, but fascinating antique shop filled with odd treasures in dimly lit rooms. Were I forced to describe this place in one word it would be ""obscure"". If I were given another word I would say ""random"". None of the exhibits have any relation to anything you already know. For example, one of the first exhibits you'll encounter at the entrance is about Geoffrey Sonnabend and his theories of forgetting. You watch a video documentary on a plate of see-through glass describing his theories, you see his desk, and his books while in the distance speakers play the haunting voice of a woman singing a song from the early 1900's. You then go off into sub-exhibits about a few people he met in his life and how their lives connect to his through chance encounters in South America. You see their pictures and belongings, read about their successes and interactions, get a small glimpse of their lives and how they died. The end. Famous people? No. Important people? Not especially. Are these people even real? What does this have to do with anything? It doesn't really matter. It's just a story played out in the form of a multimedia exhibit. In a way it's kind of like installation art.Other exhibits include ones on superstitious folk remedies, soviet dogs who were launched into space, a Russian theorists' early conception of what space travel would be like, microscopic art, cats cradles, rotten dice, Napoleon's library, miniature staircases and mobile homes, and many, many other oddities. There's a tea room on the 2nd floor where you can have tea and cookies either inside or outside on a shaded patio that doubles as an aviary. There's a small movie theater up here too that appears to be showing aerial views of nothing in particular, it's a good meditative space. They have a nice, clean bathroom. There's also a guy outside that plays an odd instrument, who has a small dog that doesn't seem to like me.Despite it's modest entrance on Venice Blvd, once you get inside it's very extensive so make sure you give yourself enough time to explore. I would suggest that you eat beforehand. My wife and I spent more than 2 hours here and didn't even see it all.If you have kids don't bring them here unless they're introverted or weird. They'll probably get bored. No pictures allowed.",Jason H
50,Just go.,"One of, if not the, best museums I've been to. The experience is amazing, unique and thought-provoking. The atmosphere is truly something magical. The less you know the better, go and experience it for yourself. Entry is cheap and 100% worth it. I spent a few hours in there.",Julie L
50,Amazingly funny and random!,"My daughter, who lives in Culver City, showed me this amusing, intelligent, toungue-in-cheek museum.

50,Completely Bizarre,"I LOVE this place and can't praise it enough. It's probably the weirdest place I've ever been. It's sitting on Venice blvd and by the front door, you'd never know what's inside. It's fun to walk around for a couple hours and have tea upstairs. It's sooooo interesting and will keep you captivated for a long time.TIP: Don't look the place up before you go. It'll spoil it for you. (I didn't look it up as directed by my friend and I was so surprised).",lindsayzdz
30,Low point of our trip,"I get it - this museum is some kind of parody. But a lot of its content is so obscure and bizarre that you are left scratching your head wondering where the joke is. Some parts of the museum are genuinely funny, but generally in a very subtle and somehow unsatisfying way. That said, I still enjoyed the visit on the whole - it was only a low point for us because the rest of our trip was so good!The museum consists of a number of rooms, each with a different theme, as well as a tea-room and rooftop garden, both of which were quite pleasant. You are not allowed to take pictures, so don't bother with a camera. If needed, you can leave your bags at the front desk while you explore the museum.",Dan B
50,"Myth, confabulation, and unexpected truth: Unique small museum with a huge cult following","Truth or fiction, reality or myth? You decide.The world divides into two groups: the many wonderful people who visit this museum and are totally baffled and turned off by its blurred line between confabulation and reality, or the devoted fans who are totally charmed by its brilliant obfuscation, challenging originality, and dry humor. Get in the mood by watching the sleep-worthy introductory video. When I first visited this place, over a decade ago, it still had the dusty, musty smell and look of the old-time natural history museums that inspired it. Audio exhibits often do not work; some exhibits are non-sequiturs. It is a parody of museums? An original contribution to that genre? A wonderfully inventive and layered spoof? Do not assume anything: a carved crucifixion on that tiny apricot pit, bats who can fly through lead. Do stink ants exist? Or would your great grandmother prescribe a dose of Mouse on Toast? A great introduction or follow up to the museum is to read Lawrence Weschler's book, ""Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonders,"" which delves into the amazing truth, partial truth, or occasional complete falsehood of the various exhibits on display at the time it was written.My advice: The museum itself is tiny and crowded, and only open certain days of the week. It is more comfortable to visit it alone or with one or two other people. Many exhibit rooms are small and dark, halls are fairly narrow, and the second floor exhibits and tearoom are up a flight of stairs. I would not recommend this for very young children, families with strollers or backpacks, or anyone who needs a lot of help to stand or walk. Street parking is limited to one hour, so be prepared to move the car or feed the meter. The gift shop, which you encounter on entering the front door, is worthy of your time, as is the rooftop garden and dovecote. No reservations, but make sure it is open the day you intend to go!",cucinista24
30,Strange but glad we went,"This is a dimly lighted, maze-like collection of strange things. There is an eerie 3-D movie, microscopic mosaics made from butterfly wings and our ( me and my 5 yr old) favorite exhibit, a collection of miniature staircases. $8 for adults, kids under 14 free, tea and cookies on the rooftop terrace included. No photos allowed. Staff very friendly.",Sheree B
50,A Crazy Faux Museum For Artists Of All Ages,"A hidden gem on the west side of LA, this is a must-see for any artist, writer, or scientist visiting LA. The artists who fabricated the MJT have taken one idea to the nth degree. That idea is ""A museum composed of fake exhibits."" Each area of the MJT presents a weirdo exhibit you might imagine would be in a museum like ""world's smallest shrunken heads"" but the heads are smaller than a grain of rice and you realize it's impossible for the thing to be truly real. That's the biggest reaction to all the stuff in the MJT: ""Wait -- this can't be real."" But then you get the jolt/joke because you are looking at very real, non-digital objects that artists have fabricated to make these fake exhibits. The whole thing is remarkably well executed and exactly the kind of nutty, ""custom-culture"" fabrication jokey idea that LA art does very well. In Disneyland or Hollywood, nothing is real but in The Museum Of Jurassic Technology everything is very real, hand-made, and plain impossible.",WaltMorton
50,questions the concept of a museum,"This is a great spot to go to as long as you go in without any expectations of having a traditional museum experience.

50,Thought provoking impulses for the unusual,"I must see when you're in LA! It is a very weird place all together when you enter that looks like it emerges from another time in the past.

I am definitely going back to visit a second time as 3h were simply not enough to explore the whole museum.",Marc H

50,A memorable and mysterious experience,"In fact, I was there in 2009 but the visit was so memorable I decided to write a belated review for this exquisite place.I went there with locals, otherwise I'd probably never have found it. Dark, mysterious, confusing... I still haven't found any museum like it. I particularly liked the theatrical setting, and the apparent randomness of all things displayed.The small book shop was worth a visit too. I bought '100 Suns', a photobook about the testing of Nuclear devices in the 50s and 60s.If you're inclined towards the unconventional, do visit the Museum of Jurassic Technology.",immorissal
50,Let Your Inner Nerd Shine!,"Inconspicuously located in the Culver City/Palms district of Los Angeles, this mysterious den-like museum refers to itself as ""an educational institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic."" Detailed information on the actual contents of the museum is quite vague and leaves one wondering just what is this place? This is a provocative little haven of curiosities and rarities; scientific, historic and artistic in nature.Completely fascinating.A few logistics first. Street and free meter parking were pretty easy to find on a Sunday afternoon. Admission is a donation of $8.00 per adult (well worth it!) with varying discounted costs for other visitors. Uniquely stocked gift shop to peruse at the completion of your visit. Additionally, if you are looking for somewhere to escape the heat, this is not the place. No evidence of air conditioning except for upstairs in two different rooms. It was rather stifling the day I visited which, admittedly, did slightly take away from my overall enjoyment, though not a deal breaker. Be a good egg and show respect for their repeated postings that prohibit any photographs from being taken. This is a very small and peculiarly offbeat museum, so it only seems decent to follow their rules and let others visually experience it for themselves.Tales, spells, folklore and history galore.Make sure to spend a little time indulging on tea and cookies in the Tula Tea Room and then stepping outside to the secret rooftop garden, complete with a columbarium and birds. Whimsical and celestial vibe up there for certain.Arouse your senses, awaken your brain cells and nourish your intellectual and cultural inner nerd. You won't be disappointed.",Sally M
40,Very Interesting!,"Went to this museum with my son and husband. My son is in the film school at LMU and he absolutely loved this museum!

20,Why? Am I too dumb to get it???,"So....we went today 29th July 2016...rocked up paid our $8 entry and were...amazed, disappointed, confused, underwhelmed, surprised...but overall I felt very very odd.What is there is an eclectic range of artefacts (few with any provenance, few with any explanation) that are strange, peculiar and with little thematic relevance.Maybe it's more fool me...it's supposed to be like that? Who knows? I certainly don't.The staff there were great though...extremely helpful.Oh yeah, there's free tea and cookies....we didn't but I guess you could?!?!?!There was a cool dog enjoying the cool air sprawled out on the floor...unfortunately for everyone that was the highlight of our visit.Oh yeah...teachers and students get in for $5 instead of $8...I guess whether you want educating or teaching in this instance will be two very, very different things.",martin n
50,Where I bring every out-of-town visitor,"The less you know about the museum in advance, the better the experience. On your way out, pick up a copy of Weschler's ""Mr Wilson's Cabinet of Wonders"" to begin to figure out what on earth it was you just saw.",debora s

This is the place of the odd, strange, ridiculous, laughable and is there a snake oil salesman, please, we really need one.It is called ""..Jurassic Technology"" and I have yet to figure out why. The items on display (2 stories of a small building) have nothing to do with either.There are displays put together of things such as cat cradles and how to make one or ten, you may even get to see a video on how to do that. You will find dark little corners of stuff and you will look through a microscope and have no idea what you are looking at despite the explanation of it and regardless of your science back ground.They have needlepoint and little mice (dead) on toast next to a fake pie. There are old items from trailers and just really odd things.They have a painting of a dog dressed as an astronaut.It all reminds me of an HBO series called Carni'val which was dark, filled with murder all under the tent of a rip off circus. But you won't get taken here. It is what it is, the fare is reasonable and now and again they have this man playing an accordion.Some have suggested this place for a great first date. Be careful with that, unless your date as a sense of humor, a good one, she or he will think you insane, likely dangerous and want to go home before she is turned into a white mouse on toast.If you have an hour and are in town, go.

50,"A fun and odd, run-down museum to get lost in","If you don't have a taste for esoterica, an interest in confusion or if you take museums seriously, this is not the place for you. If you do like those things, and don't take museums too seriously, and like dark, musty corridors and microscopes then this is it! The place for you! And if you're a teacher or student, you get half off admission.This is more of a non-museum than anything. With it's mix of real and false artifacts, broken exhibits, rooftop garden and hidden treasures (the needle point sculptures are amazing) this is a space to move through without getting to hung up on details. Don't read all the descriptions or take too long in any once place. The museum is best processed as a whole. Hit every room, drink the free tea and eat the free cookies. If you are lucky, you might come on a day when the rooftop accordion man is playing music. It's a great place to get lost in alone. It's also a great place to come to with a friend so you can together try and figure out what is going on and what it is you are looking at.

40,"Oh good, David Lynch made a museum","I've been sitting on writing this review for awhile. I love American oddities and the Museum of Jurassic Technology is definitely a noteworthy one. The museum contain a varied array of curios --- all of them fake nonsense. There are long-winded videos fabricating a story from nothing, paintings of cosmonaut dogs, mystical origins of the cat's cradle, a collection of LA trailer park artifacts, nonsense wisdom, a live dove aviary, stand-alone zaniness (stuffed fox head with a hologram projection of a man making strange noises), and much more.I don't really know what the intention of the founders was and I would love to know. The employees seem to take this museum of completely fabricated nonsense seriously. The atmosphere dances between hipster and murderer's basement. And the patrons didn't seem to think it was all too funny. It's as if David Lynch, Douglas Adams, and HR Giger got together and conceived a museum. So is this ""a museum of museums"" as some suggest, is it a test of gullibility, is it just a joke and nothing more, is it an endurance test, is it about storytelling, is it some sly hipster statement of society? I really don't know. I do know that I marveled at the museum as a whole.I had about 90 minutes and it was not enough. When you first go in, there are a lot of long and meaningless videos, some upwards of 30 minutes. I first tried to dig through this stuff with the idea that it would all connect to some larger joke. Don't make this same mistake I did. I soon discovered the museum was much larger than I thought and I didn't have enough time for the more fun stuff here. If it seems boring, keep moving. There is a lot of fun, silly stuff in here. But there is also a lot of wandering videos and stories that are closer to an endurance test than an actual funny piece. Go enjoy, make your own determinations, and don't get sucked into the dull exhibits.",tumbleweedchris
20,Must miss museum,"The people that ran this place were friendly. There were a lot of visitors, and they seemed to be legitimately interested.The exhibits here ranged from uncorrelated disassociated dioramas and narratives, with mementos mori, and cultural artifacts of all sorts. The audio accompaniment to the exhibits come across as if I had walked in on some doctoral dissertation on some historical topic I was interested in, but don't fully understand and further, is never fully explained.There are some things to see here, and it really might be something. Upstairs there was a two-room exhibit on cat's cradle knots with a room of holographic representations of how to tie these knots and placards identifying three women practitioners that, while seemingly unrelated to the other exhibits, introduces some surprise and delight. There was also a small theater with 3-D black and white movies and an accompanying soundtrack. Something about the dread audio put us in mind of a David Lynch film and also, too of Salvador Dali's house in Figueres, Spain, but there is little cohesion and any delight was quickly smothered in dark reminders and dark entries.The different exhibits could very well be intended as an odd and insightful commentary on the compulsive drives of humanity as individuals, as a mockery of pseudo-science, or perhaps as a trenchant take on the insanity of our species as being teeming, driven, animals blessed and cursed with an intellect, but it falls short in this regard, too. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was an unwilling participant in a long, drawn-out, intellectual, inside joke. We really tried to get it, but for us, the MOJT was a disappointment.",Tony B
40,Weird wonderful and DARK,"This museum is not about what is in the display cases, or what wonders of the ancient world they have on display, nope, none of that! It is a journey into themes, notions and stories, many of them described through quirky with a capital Q displays, wired up microscopes to view miniature art works, a collection of cures and curses of old and all of it presented in a warren of small rooms dimly lit, no strike that, in the dark!.

50,A museum whose subject is museums,"Even after you watch the introductory slide show, you will be no closer to knowing what Jurassic technology is, so don't worry.Understand that this place is not so much about giving you information about actual things, even though, some of the things in it are undeniable (either it's a sculpture of the pope that fits inside the eye of a needle or it's not). Many other things are eminently deniable.For example, I don't think you are meant to succeed at digesting the ""scientific discoveries"" detailed in the Delani/Sonnabend Halls (something about the fragility of memory). I suspect that Googling Prof. Sonnabend will lead you in circles since all references begin and end with the MJT. I think some people try too hard here. It's better to just let it wash over you. Incidentally, those broken exhibits have been that way since the museum opened. They are intended to be broken.The subject of the museum is not Jurassic Technology, by the way. Instead, the subject is what makes a museum a museum. Why do we prioritize certain things as worthy of exhibit and not others? Why not have an archaeological exploration of trailer parks? Why do exhibits have to be about real things? What exactly is real, anyway? And why do we so lightly allow a museum to exert authority over us. Why should we assume that what we will see is true or merited or artistic? The museum raises these questions. Even the people who don't like it and find it confusing in the end are actually having the intended reaction. Why put your trust in any curator that he or she will lead you down the right path?",FGrantWhittle
50,You either love it or you don't...,"How to describe this place? It's quaint, thought-provoking, bizarre, humorous, gothic. It's a small museum of delicately beautiful, deeply detailed displays that might be based at least partly on fact. What is a museum anyway, other than an interpretive take on artifacts?

Crazy. Creepy! You will not be disappointed.",twomartinilunch

There is no continuity, poor curating and even poorer lighting. (Be careful...) That said, I loved a few of the exhibits. The historic figures carved into the eyes of needles and visible only via microscope, the tiny mosaics made from shimmery flecks of butterfly wings and the history of Cat's Cradle string games were all fascinating. And on the roof, there's pigeon breeding and live sitar music. (I am not making this up.) This ""museum"" was put together by people who were either intent on challenging the definition of that word or were just looking for a place to store a collection of some crazy crap.",ivanabhip
50,An unforgettably unusual experience,"We didn't know what to expect going in, apart from hearing it was walking around David Lynch's house. As you move through the museum, you start to wonder what's real and what isn't - is it a hoax, an art installation, or a genuine museum of quirky artefacts? In a way it's all three.

It is full of exhibits that are at once quirky and unexplainable -- and seem too odd to be true. Some of them may not be, but it's hard to tell which ones. Are the portraits of the Russian dogs shot into space after Sputnik really from life, or from someone's imagination? And why is there an exhibit on them? What about the musician who creates miniatures out of human hair and dust that are small enough to fit on the tip of a pin? Or the bat who flies through walls? Why is the museum so dark, and yet so definitive? Absolutely worth a visit.",JAT-DC

It is simply presented, with no judgments. If you also make no judgments, you will enjoy it. Do not miss the roof garden, a slice of Morocco.",KCV999
10,Not Worth the Time,"We brought some guests that were visiting from out of state. We live less than 2 miles away, so thought it would be worth our time, when we had a window while near home. Even at minutes away, it was not worth our time. Exhibits such as dioramas of trailers, walls of 16x20 photos of cosmonot space dogs, and decomposing dice, are not the most interesting attraction in LA. The only interest was the Eye of the Needle carving, but not so much to make it a worthwhile visit. It is a small street front building that strings trailers together to create 'rooms.' I now know why I have never had one LA friend talk about it as a must see for visitors or ourselves. There are so many really great things to do in LA city, LA county, and our neighboring counties. If you are visiting, don't waste your precious time here.",IreneDJ2
50,Awesome attraction,"This is a beautiful, strange, small museum. I read about it some years ago in Lawrence Weschler's Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder. It is sort of a museum about museums.

The Museum of Jurassic Technology resolutely will refuse to help you answer these questions. This is as it should be. You must think for yourself. You may ponder these questions whilst enjoying the tea room or the rooftop aviary. Last visit I found a book in the library about Napoleon's march on Moscow I enjoyed. I've been here about 20 times in the last 15 years. Nuff said.P.S.

It's hard to say what it is about, other than obscure curiosities throughout History...BUT, for me, the awkwardness became wander when reached the top floor of the tiny building, where you get complimentary tea and pastries/cookies, and can enjoy quiet, magical time in the rooftop which is a beautiful aviary! It's designed as a cloister, and you might get lucky and get to listen a musician play a weird/old instrument (they actually hold concerts). Lovely.",McJuls
40,Uniquely incredible experience!!,"I read up on the museum before I visited. This is an incredibly unique museum that I'd recommend to all. It had amazing microscopic artworks, bizarre beliefs (e.g. eating a mouse pie would stop kids from bed wetting... or was that the mouse sandwich?), cat's cradle string figures, beautiful smoking pipe collection...just to name a few.I took public transport travelling from Orange County on 2 buses and a MetroLink. 3 hours in total each way costing ~$22...learning about the public transport in LA. There are bus stops directly in front of the museum as detailed on their website. Google maps helped get me there.The museum seems small from the outside but there's plenty to see. Staff estimated that it would take 1 hour to go through the museum but I took my time going each exhibit, reading, watching and listening to a lot of information; leaving after ~3 hours.It is dark and eery. Some exhibits take a while to understand how they work (e.g. the Delani exhibit requires you to press start as it lights up photos one by one clockwise). Some other exhibits have videos played in loops. There were a handful that I just didn't understand or ""see"".A little disappointed that several audios were not working, like the exhibit about the bat that can fly through solid objects. Unfortunately I had to read about it on the website. There were some that were not available for various reasons. It was also difficult to hear audio of some videos due to low volumes or distracting locations etc.Either way a unique museum of oddities and curiosities for sure!!",WatsonAU

50,The Real and Surreal,"We asked our LA-based friends which local museum was most unique and they took us here. This place is both a museum and an art project. It is often difficult to tell what is real and what is surreal. For example, there is an exhibit on the Russian rocket pioneer, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, next door to an exhibit on variations of cat's cradle. My favorite was a room of bizarre letters sent to the astronomers at Mount Wilson Observatory. If you go, be prepared for a weird and wonderful experience. Oh, and don't miss the tea service on the second floor.",Alan N
50,Very interesting!,"We went here on a Sunday afternoon. The museum is a few doors down from In n Out. The museum does not have parking, but you can park on the streets around the museum. We parked right in front of In n Out. The museum can seem small when you come in, but it is arranged in a way that actually makes the museum big. The lights are dimmed down, so take your time in the lobby so that your eyes adjust and you can enjoy the beginning of the museum. Please watch the video right next to the shop. Many people don't understand what the museum is about, but if you watch the 5 minute video, you will be able to appreciate the museum better. It tells you the why of the exhibits. We had a lovely time and our kids (12 and 9) really enjoyed the museum. Don't miss the 2nd floor, they have a tea room (free tea) and a bird garden along with really great exhibits.",lxjuarez
40,Unusual Museum,"This was my second visit and my wife's first. I've never known how to describe this museum. It is odd by normal museum standards. I really just tell people that they have to visit themselves to understand. It is a physically small museum crammed full of mostly small exhibits in small room and corridors. It is two-story (half the building) with a rooftop tea garden on the other half.I can't describe the exhibits. The museum takes everything seriously although some of the exhibits seem insignificant. One room is filled with models of early trailer parks. An exhibit covers superstitions and wifes' tales. There is an exhibit on Russian space dogs and another of scientific discovery.

What they display here is pretty hard to explain. It's weird. It's awkward. And its just feels a little ""off"" from what you are used to.Probably a cool place to visit if you are the creative type. It is worth the visit just to experience their awkwardness.",Hiro F
30,It's definitely interesting,"I visited the Museum a while ago with a friend of mine. I'm not sure what I expected, but I was a little ... confused by the randomness of things. Of course, I think that's the point - and, like my title says, it's definitely interesting. The very best (and possibly overlooked part) is the rooftop terrace and tea room (it has limited hours) where there are beautiful places to sit, watch and perch - among the birds. There are literally birds flitting about everywhere. It was beautiful. If you want to be slightly confused (or - simply like oddities), visit the museum. More importantly, don't forget to take time on the roof.",Allison M
50,"A cabinet of wonders, Indeed!","Those of little imagination, curiosity or humor should not apply. Go to the beach. For all others, this IS a cabinet of wonders, much along the line of those of the 16th and 17th century, the epitome of which is the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Irony oozes out of many exhibits. The term ""eclectic"" hardly describes the place. Richard Feynman's concept of ""Primacy of doubt. Not a blemish on our ability to know but as the essence of knowing."" lives here.See a woman's horn, a large cat's cradle exhibit, coincidences in abundance and top it off with tea in the rooftop aviary. Extreme enthusiasts should purchase Pulitzer Prize finalist Lawrence Weschler's ""Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder"" for way more background. In any case, Just Go!",Hewitty15

50,A Cabinet of Wonders on Venice Boulevard,"I never quite believed that the Museum of Jurassic Technology was real until I visited it. The museum is a work of art, with gorgeous, meticulously displayed objects and miniatures, and perfect, spooky lighting. The extensively documented exhibits cover a world of offbeat phenomena. Here are just a few:• the mysterious South American Deprong Mori, or Piercing Devil which locals believed to be a demon, but which we learn is actually a species of bat that uses echolocation to fly through solid objects.• the Stink Ant of the Cameroon, which according to the notes that accompany the exhibit, “is one of the very few to produce a cry audible to the human ear.”• Folk remedies including the uses of bees, urine, saliva, duck’s breath and dead mice.• a macabre horn which we are told “had grown on the back of a woman's head.” and• GARDEN OF EDEN ON WHEELSSelected Collections from Los Angeles Area Mobile Home and Trailer ParksThe exhibits are a seductive mix of fiction, fact and might-be-fact. If you can quit worrying about which is which and accept that you are on shaky ground, a few hours in the museum will leave with a younger soul and a more supple mind than you went in with. If I had time to see only one thing in LA, I would chose this museum.",Larry S

50,This is my favorite museum of all time.,"I feel strangely defensive when I see negative reviews of this place. I spend a ton of time in museums and I won't hesitate to tell you that this is my very favorite. In the world. I flew all the way to LA just to spend my birthday there one year. Am I insane? Maybe. But trust me: it's not claustrophobic, it's not a waste of money, it is TOTALLY life changing...etc, etc. Don't believe the haters. Get there as quickly as you can.It's like walking into a dream world. You get to suspend real life and try to figure out what is real and what is imaginary. It's dark and cozy and comforting and eerie. And after walking through and seeing all of these beautiful and wonderful things, you get up to the top floor and it's an aviary with giant greyhounds and they serve cookies. It's like David Lynch threw a party with your most benevolent nightmares. And it's amazing.I recommend reading ""Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder"" if you want to get really deep on this place, but that's probably for superfans only. Otherwise just let it roll over you.",Ashley R

The place is very small with lots of little rooms and is very hot, dark and claustrophobic.

One after another, they take the visitor on an uncanny journey. The slightly uncomfortable feeling one gets is part of the experience, and is to be welcomed.What is being offered at the Museum of Jurassic Technology is an experience like no other—and the eccentricity with which it's executed is essential to its charm.

The top floor has a tea room, a small theater, and a charming little garden with birds.Warning, there is NO air conditioning and the museum gets very warm and stuffy when it is hot outside. They have hand fans for you to borrow while you walk around the museum.

I was a bit disappointed in the first room we went into as some of the displays appeared to be missing (there were signs with descriptions, but no artifacts) and a number of displays were under construction, but the rest of the museum seemed to be much better curated. Overall, it was a fascinating place to visit and I'd definitely visit again and recommend it to others! The favourite part of my visit would probably be the aviary, bees, and knots.

It really help me reflect my own and our human race's existence and value.... This museum opened up a new world of interesting history for me to read about.

The hushed tomes of a museum with exhibits that make you marvel - science that borders on science fiction. But it is very real and leaves you in a quiet awe. something just under the radar, slightly odd, tinged with shadow, is it real, is it not, but still absolutely fascinating. Look, this place is not for everyone, but if you wear a lot of black, or love the weird and the wonderful, or are interested in old science then spend an afternoon here.

I think $8 is the perfect admission price, and you'll never forget your visit here.The tea and cookies upstairs were a nice touch. Also really enjoyed the rooftop garden/bird area. My favorite exhibit was the section devoted to ""cures for ailments"" from history. Also, the microscopic art was pretty amazing.The worst thing you could do is show up expecting anything - show up, be surprised, and enjoy the experience of walking around. You don't even need to read the displays if you don't want to, but sometimes I found that really interesting too, so it's your call.Would not recommend this to people who are uptight, take museums too seriously, or like everything presented to them in a nice, orderly fashion.",Jim R

My favorite part of the museum is micro sculptures. Little sculptures made and with a size so ridiculously small, they fit inside of a head of a needle! There is a lot to read, a lot to see. Take it slow for best experience, go in some rooms two times maybe three. This museum is good for small groups of 6 or less. I would not go alone as it is best to have a conversation on all of the items inside with a friend.

The whole place is essentially a creative writing and theatre lighting exercise. You'll either love it or just be kind of confused by it.It's mostly dark and cramped inside.

Is This Performance Art, and I PAID to Be Part OF It?","I'd missed going to the Museum of Jurassic Technology for years, and finally made a grand effort during a recent visit to L.A.Bad sign: One GPS system brought us to the alley behind the Museum. The other kept pointing out the Museum, but not accurately. We found parking on the street because the lot in back is tiny.It was worth the visit just to know that I'm not likely to make any effort to go back.It's a museum because there are ""exhibits."" But as other reviewers have said, it MUST be art.Or, tongue-in-cheek.Or, a psychotic rage.Or a racket.Well, they got some money out of me for admission, I will say. Nice work if you can get it.I thought I got a guiding clue just after entering from the ticket desk/Gift Shop, where there is a short film showing in a corner that identifies itself as a ""Theatre."" I watched what I think was a pseudo-grandiose perspective on the Museum and its ""collection,"" referencing great museums, and which I hoped set a tone for my tour of the museum.But it didn't.I mean, I can handle ABSURD, and I love WEIRD, but this place was beyond me and those in my party. I just couldn't get a handle on it-- or even a good LAUGH!Mystical?So it's a collection of STUFF, but I will say that everything is very well displayed-- so it LOOKS like something.ALERT: It's VERY dark inside, and because it's a very small place, passages among displays are tight, and you may find yourself touching others you didn't intend to touch. Or thinking that you just put your arm around your wife, when it wasn't your wife. Honest, honey.Even though the place is small, it's easy to get lost because of the dark, and the lack of any kind of ""flow"" or progress of visit. I'm guessing that the disorientation was planned, but maybe that's what makes it art.Or not.I WOULDN'T bring children here. Just too bizarre in a scary way. And hard to find your way out. I can't imagine that it would be possible to use a wheelchair, either. You'd have to check.I wouldn't be surprised if one day, comments such as mine would be part of an exhibit at the Museum.During my recent visit, I got to the top floor and there were portraits of what were allegedly Soviet Cosmonaut dogs.

I spent most of time there wanting to reach for my phone to check certain claims and artefacts to see if any of it was true (as some was certainly plausible), but I found it hard to really delve into any of it when you know that it's likely to be fiction.My husband and I kept turning to each other in disbeleif trying to work out what we had stumbled on and we're still not sure, but it's only $8 entry for something that was at the very least, quite memorable.The corridors are crowded and many of the exhibits are broken and/or dusty, but is that intentional?

30,"If this is a barometer of hip, then I'm square.","Our kids have lived in Culver City for the past 5 years, and we have passed it countless times. It's on the seedy side of Venice, and looks like an abandoned Masonic building. It is mentioned in a strangely large number of guide books on LA, so we jokingly said that it would be on our bucket list for things to do in LA.Today was the day. Too early for drinks, and not feeling a movie. Out for a walk on a cold day, and the door was open.As others have said, it's hard to describe. I think it's a bit like the Emperor's New Clothes: everyone getting into how heavy and intellectual it all is, without having a clue what it's about. And maybe that's the point.Bizarre Biblical passages and ancient prophecies mingle with quotes about evolution, extinction, and the End Times.Who created this Palace of Puzzling Perspectives? (That's the kind of language one uses in the MJT.)SERIOUSLY. Who is behind it? Is it a joke or not? Is it Biblical fundamentalists? Strange old Masons? Hollywood Hipsters who are pulling our legs? Futurists who are planning for the next planet?The uncertainty is a large part of the mystique.We were shocked at the number of people touring this strange, dark place a couple of days after christmas.Bottom line: This is one of the weirdest of the weird in weird LA. If you're bored and want to get off the usual tourist trek, by all means go.Please be advised that it is extremely dark and very unsafe for older individuals. And kind of scary for kids. If you're between 17 and 60, you might find something to intrigue you. The microscopic paintings, the ""Eye of the Needle"" exhibit, and a few others are very worth seeing. The price is $8 for an adult, $5 for over 60, and free for kids under 12.There's a tea room upstairs, and a bird sanctuary.Definitely more entertaining than the movie we contemplated... and not as expensive.But it's a freakshow for sure.",katya3d

Oh yes, also the odd wolf- or dog-head in a box thingy that barks at odd intervals. And not to forget the Ricky Jay dice room.

You are not allowed to take pictures so I have none to share, not that they could communicate the atmosphere of menace and smugness. I appreciate that a certain group in the art world feels that this is an incredible installation piece presented as a museum. However, it is far too much work. The absolute highlight were the miniature borzoi and whippet when you reach the tea room. I say nothing of the doves in the Moroccan courtyard. I speak not of the mice on toast. I am silent as the grave about the endless documentaries. If you are in LA and really feel you need to do something outre then perhaps this will meet that need.

20,"An elaborate joke, better read about than visited.","Regarding the Museum of Jurassic Technology, I have good news and bad news. On the good side, it is highly original, unusual, esoteric and occasionally intriguing, presenting the visitor with arcana seen nowhere else. On the negative side of the ledger, it is very narrow in its appeal, as well as bafflingly cryptic, annoyingly disjointed, occasionally misleading, often boring, and rather meager in content. The main exhibits on offer when I was there — about a bat called the ""Deprong Mori""; a neurophysiologist and memory researcher named Geoffrey Sonnabend; the Russian philosopher, futurist and techno-visionary Konstantin Tsiolkovsky; and a portrait gallery of dogs used in the Soviet space program — had little or no connection with each other. An introductory film promised that as one went deeper into the museum the exhibits would go further back in time, but this was not at all true.Above all, everything was just too darn dark. This was true in terms of both light and sound. The exhibits were so poorly lit that it was often difficult to see them clearly, or read what little written information was provided. To get the full story of an exhibit, one had to pick up a phone and listen to a recording. But these were close to inaudible, one was in German, and ... all ... were ... very ... slow ... paced. Zzzzzz.SPOILER ALERT: READ NO FURTHER IF YOU STILL WANT TO VISIT THIS PLACE.Actually, and as its name warns, the Museum of Jurassic Technology turns out to be in large part a hoax, an elaborate joke, played on the visitor who comes with expectations of seeing the normal sort of museum, one that deals with scientific and historical fact. The aforementioned Sonnabend and Deprong Mori exhibits are complete fictions, but their stories are presented in such a deadpan, pseudo-scientific style that for a while the listener is taken in.But to appreciate the joke requires a long process most people will probably not wish to endure. The visitor must come unawares, with his ""normal"" expectations, and then be willing to invest several hours (as well as the $8.00 admission fee) listening to the slow recorded narratives, and finally realize at the end that it was all an elaborate put-on.Personally, I got bored and frustrated much too fast to even get close to the joke's abstruse punch line, much less enjoy it. And on the whole I regard the time and money I spent there as wasted. Rather than visit the Museum of Jurassic Technology, I recommend reading this article:http://scholarship.rollins.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&context=specsIt will give you as full an understanding and appreciation of it as you would get by going there, without such a waste of time and money.",Taylor K

I have to say, this is the only museum I've ever seen like this. It's weird, it's puzzling, but days later you'll wonder how the heck those items were created (i.e. microscopic mosaics out of butterfly wing scales or a painting of the Pope in the eye of a needle). Then, you'll wonder how they even found those items. If you're looking for something unusual that will make you think, definitely make this tiny museum a stop.

In this case, ""Jurassic"" really means ancient, (now) discredited but once popular extraterrestrial theories, and the simply bizarre, such as the Latin American who did scuptures the size of the head of a pin, which need a strong magnifying glass even to see. The museum is cramped and dark, and it is often, in the gloom, difficult to read all of the explanations.

I just know that we shouldn't have saved this museum for the afternoon of the last day of our trip to L.A.The museum looked small from the outside, similar in size to the Museum of Death, so I thought 1.5 hours would be enough. Big mistake! Before coming everyone told me not to read about the museum before visiting, so I listened. But read this -- give yourself over 2 hours! I could easily spend four hours in here.The collection is very heavy on long audio recordings, plaques to read, and just so much strangeness to marvel at. I barely got to look at the upstairs. And I never even got to have tea in the peaceful-looking courtyard. I particularly loved the memory cones, Ricky Jay's dice (loved him on Deadwood and he was the reason I heard about this museum in the first place.) and the letters to the Mt. Wilson Observatory.It was a really inspiring, weird place and I know when we come back to L.A., revisiting this place will be among the first things we do. Also props to the gift shop for carrying fiction by Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges. If those authors ring a bell with you, than you can kind of understand a context for the museum.",scifigirl
40,very original,this is probably what museums were like a hundred years ago (or more). A real collection of oddities with no common theme to the place from what I could tell. It does have unusual hours so check to make sure they are open and don/'t expect a big sign telling you that you are there. Google map it. Good location for lunch afterwards.,hikingdude
50,TRULY WEIRD,"This museum, open only three days a week, is worth the long walk from downtown LA. We saw a collection of eccentric letters to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, an exhibit on Laika and the other Soviet dogs that went up with the cosmonauts, and a nice piece on Athanasius Kircher, an 18th century Jesuit who was among the last polymaths of the post-Renaissance.Highly idiosyncatic.There is a tea room on the second floor, and an open courtyard just above it.",constanttraveler71
10,Only in LA....,"Hard to know whether to take this ""museum"" seriously. I suppose the intentions are good but the exhibits lack coherence. It's kind of like what you'd get if a bunch of loopy potheads went through a bunch of attics and pulled together old letters and other forgotten materials that might be of interest to family and friends but kind of presumptuous to put on display and even charge admission for. Plus the air is close and unpleasant. To be sure, there were a few items that could hold the interest of some but overall the appeal this place holds for some visitors is, alas, lost on me.",DrJerryLosAngeles_CA
40,Weirdly charming,"I won't lie -- it was pretty strange. But in a very charming way. The exhibits are totally random but put together with loving care, taking everything very seriously and giving you tons of information, like the narrated slide show about the violinist who made miniature figures that fit into the eye of a needle. I mean, what!! But there's a comfy bench to sit on while you watch the slide show, and you can view each miniature through its own magnifying lens. It's a low-light, velvet drapes kind of place, but not cheesy. Respectful. I think my favorite random exhibit was the room of oil painting portraits of the dogs in the Russian space program. If you're in the right frame of mind, the museum is kind of wonderful. Take the Expo Metro line to the last stop in Culver City, it's just a two or three block walk from the station.",edwardsmom24
50,Very Interesting,"I have probably passed this museum several times, not realizing it was there. It is very interesting - lots of odd exhibits. For example: there was a room on cats cradle. They had videos showing different designs and how to create them. There was a room with microscopes with designs on the slides of the microscopes. All the exhibits were very unconventional. On the roof is a small garden with pigeons, even nesting pigeons and a person can sit and drink tea out there as well.",warsblade
50,Absolutely Fascinating,"This was the coolest museum I have ever visited. I watched a video about it in one of my first year fine arts classes, and have desperately wanted to go.

There was an intro video to watch before you explore the museum, which I found confusing. Some of the exhibits were interesting, I just wish there was more explanation about each piece and how it fit into the museum. The part I enjoyed most was the architecture of the building, and the top patio level where there is a kind of bird sanctuary.

40,"Pretty wacky, quite fun.","Firstly, while I enjoyed this, I would say it isn't for everyone. It is weird, but not in a creepy way. We took our 13 and 15 year olds. My 13 year old son thought it was boring because there is way too much reading, and he is right about that. Don't come if you aren't prepared to do a lot of reading in very dark rooms. My 15 year old daughter was fascinated by the (literally) microscopic art and the exhibit on cats cradles. I really enjoyed the tribute to the Polish guy who thought we should all live in spaceships. As I walked around I was trying to figure out what the heck this museum is all about, and I guess it could be summed up as a tribute to the obscure, with some fun modern art (or exhibits, if you like) thrown in. The Jurassic Technology stuff is just a bit of fun. Do see the slide show, which explains the ""origins"" of,this museum. Don't be put off by the entrance of this place, as it might seem closed but isn't. You must visit the top floor where free tea is served from a samovar, and have a look at the very pretty roof terrace and dovecote. The two large Afghan dogs in the tea room are real!, which was a bit of a shock, as I at first thought they were on display, given the wackiness here. There are some excellent restaurants nearby, and the museum is open late, so this is a great option if you want to extend your day of sight-seeing.",lindagaf

That's this place. I can't decide whether to give this place a single star because you leave it thinking, ""What was that all about?"" or several stars because of the audacity of the totally unique nature of the place. As others have mentioned, scales from butterfly wings used to make flower and bird artwork on microscope slides. Sculptures that fit on the head of a pin. Taxidermy that has clearly seen better days and is all the more scary by being badly illuminated. There's lights on things but often they are pointed in the wrong direction and nobody seems to have noticed that in the past couple of decades. It does make it very difficult to see some things and I suggest you bring a small flashlight. There's a room with a new form a mathematics that's either the equivalent of keeping the cure to the common cold in a locked safe or there's a good reason nobody has ever let it loose on the world.

There are 3D images of x-rays of flowers. There are microscopic mosaics of butterfly wings made into still life pictures. There are vectographs, 3D images that are prints you view with polarized 3D glasses. Tula's Tea Room on the top floor is filled with auromas and sounds from a distant land.

It's an eclectic collection of oddities: some of which are archaic or lost ideas, items that don't fit the mold for traditional museums (cat's cradle), or just unusual (micro-miniature mosaics). This museum is certainly interesting and worth attending at least once. My biggest issue is that it's a bit rundown. Exhibits are missing information plaques, headsets aren't working, some areas are so poorly lit, you can't tell what you are looking at. The other issue is the information plaques or lack there of. If you find them they are so wordy that it takes a while to understand what it is all about.

Wilson - ""No one may ever have this knowledge again"" - get the T-shirt. If it still mystifies after you've been there - check out Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonders. Great book! The whole thing got my synapses firing along new paths, for sure. (No doubt, it's weird - just go with it.) I tell people that once they've been, they are officially artsy.

30,"Worth going to, but not what I hoped","The sheer strangeness of this place makes it worth a visit but it wasn't as interesting as I had hoped. It's a weird destination and defies straightforward description. To me, it's an art installation about museums--but this doesn't sum it up entirely. Another reviewer called it a 'cabinet of curiosities' and I'd definitely agree. There are exhibits on superstitions (my favorite, probably), 1930s trailer culture, and the dogs of Soviet space exploration, among many others. Some of the exhibits are more straightforward and some seem to be primarily about subverting patrons' expectations about museums--for instance, at least one exhibit appears to be deliberately ""out of order."" This is becoming a rambling review, but it's a rambling place.On a practical level, be aware that it can get crowded on weekends and it's very dark, cramped, and labyrinthine. Some of the lighting is so dim I literally could not read the exhibit captions (and, paranoid that I am, I wondered if this is just part of the museum's schtick as a critical meditation on the museum-as-social-construct.) It's not well marked but if you go to the very back of the first floor, you will find stairs leading you to more exhibits and the tea room, where tea is served rather randomly and cookies are available. Go through a mysterious doorway, and there are more stairs to a lovely little courtyard on the top of the building, with lots of finches and doves.I felt kind of guilty for not enjoying this place more. It's worth seeing once and I think it's culturally important as an examination of how we think about museums, but it just wasn't that interesting, in the end. There was also a strong, self-conscious hipster vibe the day I was there, so it didn't feel particularly welcoming.",Karen G

40,From Questionable to Extremely Interesting,"At first I thought we got ripped off here. If you go in and start on the left side of the museum, most of the exhibits are poorly maintained and really just not terribly interesting. I was pretty bored for the first hour. There were some stories about Iguazu Falls in South America, which I found compelling, since I've been there a couple of times, but otherwise I don't think much of what was displayed will be of much interest to people.The exhibits also didn't always work properly; they don't seem to be very well maintained. After getting to the tea room upstairs, which was okay, but again nothing great, I was ready to go home and call it a bust.Then we discovered the other side of the museum - much bigger and suddenly quite impressive. While the exhibits still weren't all in the greatest of shape, the displays of miniature stained glass style art, holographic floral imagery and especially the last thing I found, which was micro-miniature characters in the eyes of needles... suddenly the whole visit was worth it. Some of that stuff was really impressive and I can't believe I haven't seen it anywhere else.I think the general idea of this museum is things that were impressive feats of ""technology"" (use that term loosely) at the time, which never caught on. For example, building a viewing bridge across the mouth of Devil's Gorge at Iguazu... pretty cool idea, hard to execute, ultimate failure and never attempted again at any waterfall. Same with the needle characters, micro-art, trailer parks, etc...What's funny is that the museum is a bit of a caricature of what it's presenting. I feel like it needs an overhaul and better upkeep. But I guess part of the charm is that it's also a bit of an extinction in the works at the rate that it's going. The way they present the exhibits use a lot of interesting ideas which have been very well surpassed, technologically. Dropbox movie ""theaters"" and 3-d viewing glasses were probably cutting edge 25 years ago, but now they're simply an abandoned novelty.Cool place - check it out and don't give up too soon.",Jeremy D

Right off the bat, the rods in my eyes were thrown for a loop because its SO dark!! Little tiny boxes with completely random objects in them. The parts of the exhibit that are lucky enough to have signs AKA novels next to them just tell some longwinded story, without actually telling u what is in the little box or bowl or magnifying glass. Homage exhibit to trailer parks and items collected from yard sales? Odd. Half the museum dedicated to some guy that the website should have told u to research before entering, and half of the exhibits were broken.

The museum had attractions from paintings of dogs that were sent to space to items found in trailers. It seemed like a bundle of random items/facts from different time periods, locations, and beliefs all put into a few dark rooms. The readings were hard to understand and generally uninteresting. Any paintings, art, or other attractions were not interesting to learn about or seemed pointless. Despite this, the ""museum"" was packed with people yet we could not figure out the appeal.

If I compare it to other museums I have visited throughout the world, I can't think of anything else that is like it and perhaps this is the attraction to others who have enjoyed it. I would guess that people who love this place are fans of the TV show ""Oddities"" and the like. Exhibits include things about the history of museums, pseudo science, some obscure science items, art, even mobile homes. The place is very narrow and sprawling - surprisingly bigger than it seemed from the outside. The place is kept very dim and a number of the exhibits seemed in poor repair and most seemed to have no relationship to one another.Personally, when I go to a museum, I expect to either informed or entertained. This place mostly failed on both accounts. If you approach it as a ""real"" museum, the displays are poorly presented and often explained in rambling fashion. On the other hand, if you approach it as a timepiece of a late 19th century ""gentleman's collection"" or sort of travelling show that I imagine might have shown up at carnivals, then it is a bit more interesting.On their website they state that the museum ""is an educational institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic."" Since the Lower Jurassic was more than 175 million years ago, well before man was around, this immediately smelled of hucksterism, but there is no real sense when you go there that this is how things are being presented.Overall, no one in our group (who admittedly are pretty scientifically minded) enjoyed the place - many left early and the best they could say about the place was that is was ""weird"". If that's what you're looking for, you very well may have a better time than we did!",dfinkel78759
50,Our new favorite museum,"From the unassuming exterior it was hard to know what to expect. But this museum was unlike any we'd been to before.It focused on curiosities such as the Dogs of the Soviet Space program to my favorite room, the room with objects of folklore and superstition- the Tell the Bees room.Would recommend this to anyone. Admission was only $5.",David B
50,Just go. It's phenomenal.,"I just assumed dinosaurs when I heard the title. Wrong. It's the most incredible museum full of ancient technologies and folkplore. You won't be disappointed. It's completely magical. Be sure to visit the ""Tell it to the Bees"" exhibit and sip some tea in the tea room!I believe the suggested donation is $5, which is quite a value. Check the website for hours, though, because they're odd.",osbornclaire
40,"At the Intersection of Natural History, Farce and Mystery, you'll find the MJT","You enter the Museum of Jurassic Technology through an unassuming storefront on busy Venice Blvd. The small gift shop inside the door gives you time to adjust to the dimly lit museum space. The requested donation is $5 per adult and that gives you access to the deceptively large exhibit space that extends both up to a second floor and out into an adjacent building.But what exactly is this a museum of? On this first visit, I had no particular expectation of what would be inside. I only joined some out-of-town friends who had the MJT on their must-visit list.The displays--a mix of natural museum-style dioramas, artifacts, artwork, audio guided presentations, film, sculpture, letters, photographs, and more than a few unique items--left me constantly questioning whether what I was viewing was real, a parody, a mystery, or just something designed to evoke exactly these questions in the viewer. In that sense, a visit to the MJT provides much more of a surprise than a visit to a traditional museum or gallery.I'm sure more than a few visitors leave disappointed (or maybe just confused about it all), but our group found the 90 or so minutes we spent exploring well worth the effort. Whether before or after a visit, you can read about the MJT (and the history of similar collections of curiosities) in the brief book Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder by Lawrence Weschler. I didn't read it until after my visit, but it provided the context that I couldn't quite grasp while wandering through the Museum.While street parking nearby was tight, the Culver City garages across Venice Blvd on the nearby side streets of Cardiff and Watseka had plenty of available space.",cb4444
50,a most stimulating experience,"This is a fascinating experience, one that is both a meditation on the history of natural science as well as the history of natural history museums. Anyone who regularly visits natural history museums or is interested in the vicissitudes of intellectual culture needs to visit this museum.",dieWelt1
50,Interesting place to see very unusual and strange artifacts,"It's interesting to see a perspective of what people in the old days can think of as strange interesting technology, and this museum represents that.I was there on Dec 9, 2010.They have drawn very small micro sized sculptures on a small needle that you use to thread. Also Microscopic art designs which you have to have a microscope to view. They also have a section dedicated to antique R.V''S AND trailers.They also have a section where they take strange objects and turn them into medications for the sick. Which is all in the back of the museum. Some of the stuff is very funny, and amusing to look at and some is wierd. This museum is very small but there is a lot to read, some of the interactive features in this museum don't work. Its a old green looking building from the outside, but inside its interior design and decorations are very eloquent. Make sure you visit all exhibits, some of the exhibits are hidden in the very back , its a total maze inside, make sure you look at the map and know where you are going. They have free tea and cookie on the second floor, The teapot they used to give the tea is from way back in the 1800's, very old amazing device that still works like new but looks very antique. The second floor also has a section on the first dogs that the Russia space has flown to outer space, Also they have a exhibit on puzzles and strings. I definitly would recommend this museum to any one interested in looking at strange artifacts and strange inventions during the old days.",fawadk
