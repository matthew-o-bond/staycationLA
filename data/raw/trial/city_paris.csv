50,“Paris Bling!!!”,"The 4th of July and all it's fireworks is a pretty big deal everywhere in the US, and being from Texas I know what a REALLY big show looks like. Gotta say that seeing the Eiffel Towel all lit up at night is every bit as exciting and wondrous!! We drove by the Tower on the way in from the airport in the afternoon and to this first timer to Paris, I was in awe of just what a magnificent structure it is. Hard to believe it's man made and the story of it's construction is quite the tale. We were there several times over 4 days but nothing beats the experience of spending an afternoon at the sidewalk vendor's site just off the grassy parkway. We enjoyed some wine and people watching and then moved to the grass itself for a perfect view and photo op. We had the perfect spot! Paper cups, a blanket and another bottle of wine and we were set to enjoy the show. Other than the bomb squad temporarily clearing the area due to an abandoned backpack (evidently, someone was a couple bottles of wine ahead of us and must have just forgotten it)we enjoyed the hour or so before it was dark. The city is making an effort to be more ""green"" so we had heard that all city light displays were cut back some. Tower lights were only at the top of the hour and only for about 15 minutes. We were there when they started to twinkle on and it was magical. Seeing the whole tower sparkling was surreal. I was expecting lights but not ""blinking"" which just added more excitement to the whole experience!! We never did wait in the long lines to go to different levels but don't feel like we missed a thing!!! This is a stay up late and don't dare miss it kind of event!!!"
50,“Le plaisir de PARIS”,"Ah, the pleasure of Paris! Going to Paris is like visiting a mausoleum, the grandeur of oh soo many historic monuments is a memorable souvenir. Having visited the city of light on nearly a dozen occasions, its easy to think of it as a familiar friendly place. Though the art museums and the Eiffiel tower are the sites most tourists flock to, its the casual locations and wide bridges that make the city truly a pleasure to be in and stroll upon. Topping the list is the Bois de Bolougne , a carnival-like feel near the Arc de Triomphe . Its a park where kids of all ages can enjoy rides, sit atop ponies, view animal exhibits and just relax on antique iron and wood benches. Les bouquinistes, the book lined stalls along the bridge is where one can go to see the wonderful antique books and drawings of past ages.The zoo is also a great place to visit and the near by weekend bird market is a fun place to see many feathered creatures echoing songs from gilded cages along the pont. The best part of the city is lolling at the quaint outdoor cafes and bistros lining les Champs Elysee and watching the whirl wind of people and traffic activity go by.While its nice to visit the huge monuments and museums of Paris, the real pleasure of Paris is in the sweet, simple activities of la ville."
40,“Right on Metro stop”,"The location was great for access to the Metro, literally a one minute walk. It was about 15 minutes then to the heart of Paris. The neighborhood was very international, so the morning coffee and croissant nor the afternoon beer or wine had the Parisian feel. Also, many prostitutes hung out in this area. They did not bother me but certainly took from the ambience of the neighborhood. The apartment was what I expected, small by American standards but fine. A living room with TV (and CNN in English), a bedroom, a small kitchen, a small bathroom with a nice shower, and a hallway. The washer/dryer was hidden! It was definitely worth the price."
10,“Paris city myths Demistified...”,"Paris is well known as romantic and fashion capital of the world, however unfortunately from our experience its a myth.Its injustice from our end, if we try to generalize whole of Paris through our limited exposure, but based on in-person experience and what we learnt from fellow travelers recently - we are mostly sure that below points noted are true to certain extent.This city is now well known for Pick pocketing, Stolen mobile phone sellers,ill mannered people,dirty areas, street fights and overly crowded areas.Just to visit Eiffel tower its not worth spending hard earned money, this city will spoil your holiday mood.We met above 50 aged couple who was on holiday visiting places in Europe , they were disheartened ,unhappy ,because their wallet and Hotel booking tickets were stolen which was kept inside handbag. we ourselves were carrying bare minimal items and our hands were always inside our pockets - it was like, we are walking in worried, overly cautious and keeping vigil all around, I am sure noone likes their holiday to be this way !!Similar stories would be there by many people ,which most of us do not know about Inside Paris city.Please choose a better city for your holiday , don't follow the flock blindly .We have visited most of European countries - and we will definitely rate PARIS as the least friendly and safe city.Its high time, Paris government takes real, on-ground action to retain the charm of this wonderful city."
30,“little boring due to heat”,it was very hot when i was here ... totally sweating. many people trying to sell there stuff... so i was little exhausted... else if the weather was fine then there s no problem
40,"“Wrought-iron spire, Awesome”","The wrought-iron spire of the Eiffel Tower piercing the clouds, the broad Arc de Triomphe guarding Paris’ most glamorous avenue, the Champs-Élysées, the gargoyled Notre Dame cathedral, lamplit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau cafes spilling onto wicker-chair-lined terraces are indelibly etched in the minds of anyone who’s visited the city – and the imaginations of anyone who hasn’t (yet). But despite initial appearances, Paris’ cityscape isn’t static: there are some stunning modern and contemporary icons too."
10,"“Didn't go there, turned around and went elsewhere”","This isn't a review of the Hotel Monte Carlo. Sorry if you were expecting one.Me and my wife (of the time, ex now) went to Monte Carlo by car. 5 hours of traffic just to get into the city from the highway to the city.It's nothing like you see on the tv, it's rundown and just full of traffic. Didn't see any Ferarris or Lamborghinis like you see on tv.Avoid like the plague, watch it on tv."
40,“Exploring Paris”,"Love love love Paris. Walking around like a flaneur. Just looking and taking in the sights. Eating great pastries, having good food at a restaurant that I found that I liked by looking at the menu."
40,“discover”,"beautiful city, nice people, food too expensive, nice museums, nice parks. Excellent Metro system and buses. Must speak french, at least some or you are in troble."
10,“PARIS: never wish to go back again!!!”,"Me and my husband had been there for 4 days on a short holiday trip, all the way from singapore.every day we had very bad experiences one after the other.Day 1: took a TOUR via ""Viator "" for river Siena cruise. Started at 7.15pm.. We asked if we can grab some food n come they said u ll have vending machines in the boat n u can eat there.. We went there to only find coke n water. We were hungry by 10.15 pm..!! Grabbed french fries n got into the bus that was gonna take us to night illumination tour. They came rushing to us and said u got fries ? We said yes..!? Pls get out . Or throw your fries in the rubbish!! Wow wat a beginning to a 4 day trip..! The taxi driver who took us from airport to hotel was just furious I dunno why..! And this bus incident was a cherry on the cake!CLEANLINESS: the metro stations stink! There is urine all over.the seats are filthy n dirty.PEOPLE/ LOCALS: super rude. Unfriendly . Paris runs on tourism industry and still people are so frustrated and have a frown face to everyone to visits their country!TRAIN/METRO: we took a train from Paris to Palace of Versalles. We thought we ll take a train and go as it's quiet far from the city. In the train cops come in and select tourists and ask tickets. We showed them n they said we need to pay penalty of 69euros ! The ticket we had was only valid in Paris they said. But while tapping into the train it worked n no such info was written anywhere ! We felt cheated as they knew that tourists will not be aware of the fees and they can be asked to pay fine inside the train.People say if u go to zero point...u will definitely go there back again..!! We made sure we don't get even close to the zero point so that we don't have to come back to Paris again!!! Please don't waste your time n money on this city. Go anywhere but Paris..Leave the frustrated French alone ! They don't like visitors."
50,“Romantic Indeed”,Visiting the Eiffel Tower anytime of the day brings joy and excitment. Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world with history in every corner of the place.
40,“Amazing & Beautiful Paris”,"Loved Hotel location, walked to major icons or used Metro or RER train & did Hop-on Hop-off bus to visit other Parisian Sights."
20,“just eiffel :(((”,"ıf you want to spend a lot Money for waiting in the queues for hours and hours, visiting every place with thousands of people come and visit paris.people are rude.you can't travel safely by metro after 9 pm .you have breakfast in best brasseries with homeless(they smell awful) you pay every thing more than it worths.every corner is captured by gangs.you can't watch anything because you have to keep an eye on your bag every minute.police is very rude ,unhelpful and insensitive.you can visit a lot nice cities by the Money you will spend for a paris holiday.think twice.this is the most unsafest metropol I have seen in europe."
10,“Missed the Louvre”,"Didn't get to see the Louvre. Plane delays caused late arrival. But I was struck by how grimy and black most of the buildings and monuments were there. Paris is an indescribably dirty city. Dog poo everywhere, not unusual to see a man urinating in public."
10,“Paris in a day”,"Took the tour to Paris in July, It was hot and crowded. The Eurotrain to Paris was great, fast, smooth and comfortable. The tour bus we had in Paris the air conditioner was not working and the windows wouldn't open, it was hot. Lunch on the Eifel Tower was good, not much time to see much more there. Had to hurry up so we could go on the Sein River cruise, again it was very hot. We then went to the Louve museaum had 1 hour there befor heading back to the train station. Was able to go to the guift shops, thats all, never saw any of the museaum. At the train station had long lines to clear customs, tour group got on the train about 20 min. before the doors shut. The Paris tour should have been at least 2 days. Did not see much due to the fast pace of the tour. Took 2 tours with Premium tours and for the almost $1000. spent on the tours it was MONEY WASTED. Will not book anymore tours with this company."
50,“Lovely paris”,Enjoyed a lot with family my kids had a great fun This is a lovely place weather is cool and days were long during our visit there are great historical places museum arts fashion theater it is really wonderfull and a great placeand
10,“Be careful in Paris as full of thieves”,We did bus and boat trips.They were very good and you can see all the main attractionsBe extremely careful as Paris has many thieves including pick pockets who will rob you of anything they can.If you are travelling on your own I suggest to you although Paris is a very pretty place I am afraid your safety would be at risk.Pick pockets are aged from as young as 8 years of age so be very vigilant .Be extremely careful at money machines as a lot of people are being robbed there as well
10,“BE CAREFUL IF VISITING PARIS”,To everyone who intends to visit Paris.I have been here for three days and have witnessed five people getting robbed of there wallets and handbags.Several different styles by mostly young people and in one case a boy of around 10 years of age.If anyone stops you to ask you to fill out a questioner or asks for money do not stop as once you have they push you over and steal from you. Another one is they drop a ring or money on the ground in front of you Once you bend down they push you and take your wallet or bag. The police can not handle the situation as they have this happening every day Be very careful or better still stay away and holiday in a safer country.If we all do this then maybe the police will act and get rid of these scum
50,“Paris Subway and Train System maybe the best in the World”,"I recently came back from Paris and found that the Paris local train system (which is really beyond local) maybe the best in the world and nearly the best bargain. A one-way fare with unlimited stops and starts in sort of one direction is 1.75 euros. That is for two dollars you can get one and off any train bus in or around Paris. After all that travel you go get back and go in the opposite direction (this is where you pay the round-trip fare), to get back to your hotel etc. The system is based on many many buses available, the 12 or so different subway routes, and in addition the three RER routes (A, B and C) which generally go much longer distances (like the airport, wine regions, Versailles etc), and the T Trains. So much for so little price. There is absolutely not a single stop in all of Paris that is not covered by the system. A one day unlimited pass is about 17 euros and they also have 2 and three day unlimited passes.Unfortunately, the one problem we encountered was a scam at our George V subway start where the station Information employee and cashier absolutely participated with a young guy to scam us out of 35 euros. Here is the scam. The employee leaves his post (behind a glass window), while a guy then poses as an employee with an official looking badge, and offers to take our cash in exchange for two one-day passes. What we get is a single direction ticket. The tickets, whether a single direction ticket or a unlimited one-day or two day pass is the same size and look virtually identical, except for small lettering in one corner of the ticket. Each ticket is about one inch by two inches. It is not until much later that we found that we were scammed. We went back the next day at the same time and found the same gut and the same employee doing the scam scam on a single female. Fortunately, I stopped the scam and approached the employee who. I asked that he call the police and all I got was his middle finger. I am attaching his photo. This activity and this particular employee should be stopped. Hopefully this review will help others know that only employees behind the counter and the machines/kiosk are the only places to get tickets. Employees do not come out and should not come out from behind anything to help and they do not take cash. The cahier will only take credit or debit cards and the machines take everything."
40,“Great location & apartment - could be better with small improvements”,"This apartment was as described and appeared in photos and was a great base for our 4 nights in Paris. We arrived in Paris by train at Gare du Nord from London, and although instructions on how to get to the apartment by train were provided - we opted for a taxi and are glad we did - it would have taken us a while to work out the trains, platform changes and a fair bit of walking with our luggage etc. It cost approx. 17 euro and took us about 15-20 minutes to get there. We tried to contact the owner upon our arrival at the train station (as instructed to) with no luck and then again when we arrived at the apartment. We had no idea how to access the apartment and stood waiting outside for some time until we were able to get hold of him on the phone - he explained that he was unable to meet us and the cleaner who was still cleaning, would let us in. She only spoke French and after much confusion, finally threw us the key out the apartment window, over the top of the restaurant below so we could enter the building. I'm not sure how we would have got in had the cleaner not been there? On the phone, the owner told us we had to pay the cleaner 80euro cash and this was in our terms and conditions. I could not find this in our booking confirmation details - but have since found it in the initial quote provided by the owner some months ago - this requirement should be mentioned again once the booking is finalised. The apartment is in a fantastic location - approximately 15-20minutes walk to the Eiffel tower, many restaurants, a couple of supermarkets, pastry shops and train stations close by. The apartment was a good size for our family of 4 - it is directly above a restaurant which could be noisy at times, and the traffic from the road is also noisy with windows open - however I think this would be typical of most Paris apartments. The WI-FI worked well - after deciphering the handwritten instructions on the post it note. Some items were lacking including extra sheets, pillow cases and toilet paper and there were no instructions on how to use the TV. The owner met us at the agreed time on our departure date and returned our bond in cash. With some small improvements including extra clean sheets, pillowcases, towels, toilet paper, instructions on how to use the TV and some maps or information on the nearest supermarket, recommended restaurants etc this apartment could be fantastic."
30,"“Beautiful city, unfriendly people”","What disappointment when I visited! The city and all it's attractions (Louvre, Eifel tower, Montmartre and everything else was unforgettable and very impressive. However we got robbed in our hotel and not even the police were interested to help us causing us a lot of inconvenience and extra costs. My second visit ended up with a very heavy traffic fine and the third with 24 hours on the airport. Sorry Paris, unless there is NO other way, I do not think I will visit soon."
50,“Wonderfu lParee”,"we liked everything we saw. The parks, monuments, museums and architecture were spectacular. we disliked that we only had six days to stay in Paris."
10,“Many cheaters are in Paris”,"Not a good place for tourists as many cheaters are there specially from romania, armani..they have their gang n they will show some games by making their frnds win n insist to play...many ppl lose money in that from 100 euros to 1500 euros..which can spoil ur whole trip...Europe has much better places to see...avoid Paris"
40,“Maybe the greatest city in the world! But...”,"I've visited many of the world's great cities: St. Petersburg, London, Berlin, Rome... but nothing quite compares with Paris... The architecture is incomparable...although, hey, those other cities have there own share of magnificent structures. . While in France I picked up a magazine that included an Ad for a production that, more or less, said ""How to become Parisian quickly."" It stated that one could learn ""arrogance and rudeness"" in quick fashion and fit right in. My wife and I found some very nice people in France. We attempted to speak French and that, I think, in addition to feeling sorry for us, caused them to, perhaps, like us a little more than without the attempt at the language. But there were those that just seemed to like to be rude. We found the lack of public restrooms, throughout the country, to be a dilemma. The food is great, the prices are high, the experience is extraordinary. We visited in early May thinking we would avoid the crowds--not so. Long, long lines almost everywhere. The Paris Metro is an engineering marvel and very efficient. Everyone should visit Paris and France at least once."
50,“lovely great city”,"like every thing in Paris you cant' find any thing you dislike its reral attractive city its real trip in romantic and history and culture and enjoy in GREAT ART,,"
50,"“great location, good value”","We got an offer so the price of rooms was very reasonable. this is a great location right by the RER for the Airport or Gare du Nord.Our room on 2nd floor was bigger than most Parisian hotel rooms - our friend on the 5th had acres of room, plus it had clearly bee updated style wise. Didn't have breakfast, so can't comment. Pleasant and helpful staff.We will stay again."
40,“Good Place”,"It's located within 50m of Luxembourg RER station, which is pretty convenient if you were coming from either of Paris' airport. All rooms are facing the street, so you may experience some noise during the night, quite bearable though.Rooms are small, or let's say 'standard size' in Paris. But very clean, and well equipeed, with mini bar, water boiler & hair dryer."
50,“Park strolling & picnic lunch”,"Grab yourself a selection of cheeses, deli meats, fresh tomatoes with a baguette from the many local markets around Paris and head to the park. Stroll around absorbing the Frenchness until you find a place to sit and eat torn pieces of baguette & cheese. When satisfied walk some more until you find a quaint Parisian cafe, do pay the extra to sit outside, people watch with an espresso and delicate patisserie listening to the romantic language of the locals."
50,"“Use the Metro, watch your bags and try to speak French.”","Paris is very expensive especially drinks and food in restaurants. Search out supermarkets and bakeries if you are on a budget. Buy a carnet of Metro tickets 10 for 13 Euros, you can go everywhere by Metro. However if you need to change lines, the walks are very long. Wear comfortable shoes and keep hold of your bags. Outside main tourist attractions there are numerous scammers and people trying to get you to sign on their clipboards whilst they try to then mug you. Also on the Metro beware and try not to sit or stand too near doors. Do not flash mobiles, expensive cameras and handbags try to blend in."
30,“Dissapointed in Paris”,"We visited Paris, La Rochelle and the Normandy Coast.Paris is a great city with a lot of great history and sights to fill our 10 day stay.BUT too many people in the hospitality industry are rude and don't give damn.In comparison to London England where people go out of their way to assist you and serve you.If you you can only visit one country, make it London."
50,“Paris is beautiful”,"Took a train from amsterdam to paris. The best way to see europe! Everyday in paris was wonderful. Museums, maroons from hermes and brunch with the eiffel tower view. Friendly people and amazing night life. ""Take me to the other side"""
50,“The gardens are the key.”,"Visit one of the beautiful Parisien gardens for a view of typical family life. Luxembourg Gardens or the Tuileries are perfect for people watching. Grab a baguette or a gelato and enjoy, although you very rarely see the Parisiens eating other than in the many cafes and restaurants, which might explain why they are so slim! For a special treat watch the children guide their model boats around the lake in the Luxembourg Gardens. Above all, take the time to slow down and take it all in."
40,“An evening in Paris”,"Paris can easily be done by foot. There's so much to see, that it's much better to walk .You can take the metro to places that are far off . But most places like Notre Dam, Eiffel Tower , Louvre museum etc all can be done by walking around. It's a wonderful city and if it's your first time then definitely walk around to see it's beauty."
20,“Over rated but you have to go.”,"We had two & a half days in paris which is enough. We walked every where and got to see all the major sights which were amazing - arc de truimpe, the lourve, notre dame, eiffel tower etc.My highlight was going up the tower, very impressive. My low light was all the pushy rude tourists and all the smokers.When you are in Europe, Paris is a must, just dont get your hopes up its not as glamourous as everyone thinks."
30,“Decent brasserie style food in fantastic street full of merchants”,"Rue Daguerre is one of my favorite street in Paris and a place where some of my closest friends live. This street is packed with nice restaurants, brasseries, bars, wine & spirit shops, butchers, fine grocers and bakeries. This street has it all and if I would go back to live in Paris, it would be one of the first place I would look at along with the streets surrounding the Canal St Martin in the 14th district/arrondissement.Rue Daguerre is nice and the food is correct, but beyond that, you come here for this street ambiance, one of the rarest street of Paris that kept its old school Montmartre pre 2WW feel.The street is a must see, and Rue Daguerre is up to its name."
50,“Great a table outside at a corner cafe and take a breath”,Go to the left bank of Paris not far from the Church of St. Germain des pres and find a small café. Bring a newspaper and have a coffee and just smell the smells and hear the sounds and relax and let paris enter your blood and brain.
30,“How to do Paris on foot.”,"The see Paris you have to do it on foot.Most monuments are close by however, what seems close is actually far away.Just because you can see it does not mean it is close, especially if you are on foot.The way Paris is situated on almost flat land just adds to this effect. One ends up saying ""it looked so close-by "", Particularly large monument like the Arch de Triumph. So take a taxi when in Paris if you can find one."
10,“Warning About the Velib Bike System”,"When I was recently in Paris with my boyfriend we kept seeing the Velib bicycles and we eventually went to their website and signed up for a one day ticket to use the bikes, for 1.70 Euros each. We had to give a credit card and were informed that if the bikes were not properly retuned we would be charged 150 Euros. At no point - not on the website - not at the station - were we informed that we could only have the bikes out for 30 minutes before we started to incur extensive fees. We were shocked to receive our credit card statements and see that we were each charged $47 Euros. When I went back to the website I had to dig around to find these usage fees. They are not stated upfront at all which is super misleading and uncool. As they say, when something seems to good to be true, it probably is."
20,“Paris Visit : to be aware”,We visited paris from 16 th 19 th Aug 2013. We were 2 adults and 1 child of 16 yrs. I felt that I should write a review indicating the following:1. We brought Paris museum pass each costing 39 euros (total 78) We had to wait in the queue for over 2 hours at Versailes to enter the palace. We could not gain entry to Noter Dame due to the crowd. Visit to Louvere was a struggle to enter.The museum pass is an absolute waste of money. It gives access to 60 + museums as advertised but practically due to overcrowding you can not see more than 1 museum. I felt that this is day time robbery of innocent foreigners keen to see paris. I would strongly discourage to buy this.2. Over crowded and long queues. Some are very dis organised.3. Poor English speaking officials at gate. They don't understand us and we don't understand them!4. Train stations smell of urine and really dirty. We went by euro star to Gure De Nord : urine smell every where.It could be due to each entry to toilet cost 1-1.50 euros!5. So many beggars -We sat at a near by café but was constantly interrupted by people asking for food!! In a park when we left the bench a man looked into our discarded rubbish inside the bin and took the none used ketch up packets!6. The walking tour at Notre dame (pink coat) was positively good. The girl who took us around had a very good knowledge in history and had excellent communication skills.I would praise this girl who took the group around on Friday the 16 th 5 PM on a walking tour.7. Overall comment : Paris is crowded in summer avoid if you can!.
50,“Don't worry”,"It used to be, don't wear shorts and don't wear jeans. Paris has loosened up. Jeans are in. Shorts are everywhere. Its not like New York, don't look up or they know you're a tourist. Just relax. I have had no experience of alleged arrogance by Parisiennes Everyone is helpful and friendly."
50,“A wonderful hotel in a very nice location”,The hotel was perfect for our stay. My family of five stayed for four nights in this lovely hotel. We had adjoining rooms and were very comfortable. The hotel was very clean. We were very close to Luxembourg Gardens. There are nice cafes close by and a train that goes to the airport for only 9.5 euros.
50,"“Aaah, Sweet Paree, never a disappointment!!!!”","Our first half day began with us walking to as many places as humanly possible. I think Ethel said 'I walked all over the world the first day in Paris'. We started off by visiting the Eiffel Tower, Shops and cafes in the Latin Quarter, an un-expected street fair, and the best bakery in Paris on the left bank. After much walking, looking, picture taking and tasting, we headed back to our quaint hotel (Le Littre) for a good night's sleep.The next day was full of more sight-seeing and a drop of shopping. We visited Notre Dame, an elegant and awe-inspiring church built during the 12th century. The amount of detail given to churches built during that time is understandable as to why it took so long to conclude their task. These weren't construction jobs, instead they were artists fulfilling a life's desire. Speaking of artists, we went to Montmartre, a haven for painters and sketching and Sacre Couer. On to the Champs Élysées, a ride by the famous Shakespeare and Company book store, an attempt to walk to the top of The Arc d' Triomphe, and a boat ride on the River Seine.I used to wonder where the less beautiful neighborhoods were in Paris. Now I know, I had a visit to Da Hood!!! There are so many flea markets in Paris, so I've always wanted to visit one, which I was able to do this time. In reality, it was about 50% junk and 50% amazing. The amazing portion included beautiful antique furniture, jewelry, handbags, scarves, perfume, furs, coats, jackets etc, etc., etc., I cannot articulate the experience-was amazing!! My very good friend from Denver, Kay Van Horne and her niece, Julie, just happened to be in Paris during the same time as me. Julie was our guide to the flea market. We had a great time visiting the flea market with them. They were big fun.For the first time ever, I did some traveling on the Paris Metro. It was pretty easy. However, Paris neighborhoods are so rich with architecture and history, it's much more satisfying for me to walk. You do cover much more territory on the Metro. Next, on to the Louvre Museum. The Louvre is an incredible venue. Even if you never saw the Mona Lisa or Venus DiMilo, you'd have to appreciate the beauty of the building. Massive red walls, detailed, intricate ceilings, and lighted archways make it an energetic place to explore. We ended the evening having dinner and going on an evening walk with my sister's relatives by marriage, Pam and Jerry, from San Francisco, who just happen to be in Paris while I was there. That was fun!!!I can't believe I was lucky enough to have 2 people here while I'm visiting-makes more for a little adventure.I'm on the train as I write this, on my way to Nice, hoping again one day to return to one of my most favorite cities in the world, Paris!!! All I can say is Aaah!!!! Sweet Paree, never a disappointment!!!Debra Glenn"
20,“Amazing city- not so amazing people”,"PARIS- a city filled with grandeur for the rich and the (wannabe) beautiful, for every other human being, a frowning face behind a miniature cup of coffee is what comes to mind. Is it worth visiting ? Sure. Is it worth visiting more than once every 30 years? Probably not. We took our Nephew here as graduation present- he took 4 years of French in High School. Sadly, we found time and time again that Parisian attitude is matched only by the utter lack of humor- and the overwhelmingly waif of carcinogenic cigarettes being blown every few feet into one's breathing space. To say that the stereotype of the French being stuffy, rude, and utterly inhospitable is exaggerated would be in itself an ironic understatement. In the various countries I've visited (about 10 now), I've never encountered a people so downright unhappy- and happy to make anyone crossing their path just as 'Les Miserable'. Dr. E (my wife) and I truly gave this culture the old college try, reading up on how to fit in, preparing for a 5 day excursion into the city of Napoleon, using all the hints and suggestions we could find (Rick Steves, Fodors, et al.) learning a dozen phrases each week- hell our nephew wven spoke conversational French, however, no difference. We were cursed at from the moment we boarded the A line metro to Disney at Valle de Marne by a black woman on her very unhappy way to a very unhappy job- my nephew had made the error of trying to talk to her and let her know how excited he was to visit. Eventually I was forced to insist in this woman's face that she find another seat on the metro- I received some choice French curses at that. Later, after coming back late the next night we made the mistake of trying to walk to our hotel room without getting the ""permission"" of a security guard on a power trip and were excoriated for being ""estupido Americans""- mind you this was a STAFF MEMBER of Disney- an AMERICAN company. The calmer we were the more insulted this guy became, again apparently just walking around as an American made us targets for some kind of ""Napoleon"" complex. The next night when we tried to use our eurail passes we were tersely informed that those kind of passes no longer worked in France or for virtually any trains with speed or comfort. We ended up being extorted out of nearly six-hundred Euros to get a first class ticket (the only kind left of course) to NICE - ""nice"" eh? It made no difference that we were polite and clearly had no idea as the customs and were trying our best. Unable to use the euro trip tickets we had made months in advance through the Eurail site, we watched $1310.00 euros literally flushed away for nothing. When we asked about refunding he eurotrash pass- we were told it had already been stamped, so we were out of luck- by the same lady all too happy to ""sell"" us the nearly 600 euro tickets: coincidence? An expensive lesson learned from people with no visible compassion in 5 entire days. Getting shafted from the supposed ""officials"" there to help became amusing after a few times- so we looked to COMPLETE strangers to explain things to us. Once we did, things got a little better, but the die was caste in our minds about what this city is.As for the Parisans themselves, we found them neurotic, depressing, pouty, and downright hostile- possibly mentally unstable in some cases. It isn't that America is free from such people- it's just Paris seemed to revel in the narcissistic tortured ""artist"" air and the shallow female presentations of flesh and flaunt along the streets. Champs Elysse was a virtual meat market of adolescent exhibitionism. I won't even guess as to rates of lung cancer among the throngs of young people puffing away their lives to present an ""image"" of urban sophistication- if only they could see and smell the way they come across to people with true educational achievement and credentials.Not everything was a bust. There were some very worth-while moments: climbing the spiral stairs of the Arc de Triumph, seeing the Eiffel Tower lit at night at its base, and seeing the sprawling gardens at Versailles come to mind. But these moments of inspiration were simply outweighed by the sheer ugliness of the residents contained within the architectural beauty of this metropolis. Rude seemed chic, patience was a vice, and the wisdom of kindness to others seemed completly displaced by a type of pseudo-intellectualism obsessed with trend and gaudy fashion.Perhaps MOST surprising to us was the un-impressiveness of the food. Yes, there was a good crepe at Versailles and a good chicken at Vale de Marne, but we kept asking ourselves: ""where's the world famous flavors?"" We purposefully stayed away from touristy eateries, consulted tripadvisor, however we were simply underwhelmed again and again. It also didn't seem to matter how much or how little we paid. If the MOOD of the chef was good that instant toward us, the food was good- if we happened to eat during an emotional negative time, the taste suffered- sometimes in the exact same restaurant. Compared to America, perhaps a few of Paris's restaurants could survive- maybe as alternatives to the steady and satisfying variety in ANY of America's culinary gems in any of its 300 cities. LITERALLY EVERYWHERE we at our next week in vacationing in Italy, decimated our experience in Paris. We now joke Paris went 0 for 10, while Italy went 10 for 10. Truly, we concluded that just about anywhere outside of the city limits one can get better food at a cheaper price. Saying one had ""French"" food in Paris is just hype- something to talk about at one of the endless parisian outdoor cafes while dining on smokes and lithium. Oh yes, and that goes DOUBLY for the quality of the wine- I'll take a California Napa blend, or an Italian Chianti, any day over a pretentious Bordeaux.Ultimately, it's not the food, or the attractions, or the mythos that earns a city a reputation. It's the people- how they approach life itself that gains fame or stinks up a place. And after our hugely dissappointing experience in Paris, we concluded this city is RIPE to have an overhaul top to bottom. For any traveler reading from our experience do you and yours a favor- SKIP through this city in a day or two, hit the major sites QUICKLY, interact AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE with anyone of authority, and then QUICKLY HEAD SOUTH TO ITALY. The Italians have the food, the history, and quite frankly the intelligence to want Americans in their country."
20,“Beautiful architecture... The people? Not so much...”,"Observations about France in 5 days.PARIS- a city filled with grandeur for the rich and the (wannabe) beautiful, for every other human being, a frowning face behind a miniature cup of coffee is what comes to mind. Is it worth visiting ? Sure. Is it worth visiting more than once every 30 years? Probably not. You might say the attitude is matched only by the utter lack of humor- and the overwhelmingly waif of carcinogenic cigarettes being blown every few feet into one's breathing space, body odors, and nose picking. To say that the stereotype of the French being stuffy, rude, and utterly inhospitable is exaggerated would be in itself an ironic understatement. In the various countries I've visited (about 10 now), I've never encountered a people so downright unhappy- and happy to make anyone crossing their path just as 'Les Miserable'. The misses and I truly gave this culture the old college try, reading up on how to fit in, preparing for a 5 day excursion into the city of the Napoleon, using all the hints and suggestions we could find (Rick Steves, Fodors, et al.) learning a dozen phrases each week- no difference. We were cursed at from the moment we boarded the A line metro to Disney and extorted out of nearly six-hundred Euros to get a first class ticket to NICE - apparently unable to use the euro trip tickets we had made months in advance through the Eurail site. And that was from the supposed ""officials"" there to help! Getting shafted on travel plans in this city after spending months planning really put a bad taste in our mouths- but I'll get the food later.As for the Parisans themselves, we found them neurotic, depressing, pouty, and downright hostile- possibly mentally unstable in some cases. It isn't that America is free from such people- it's just Paris seemed to revel in the narcissistic tortured ""artist"" air and the shallow female presentations of flesh and flaunt. Hardly impressive to anyone living outside the Parisian delusions of ""living.""There were some very worth-while moments: climbing the spiral stairs of the Arc de Triumph, seeing the Eiffel Tower lit at night at its base, and seeing the sprawling gardens at Versailles come to mind. But these moments of inspiration were simply outweighed by the sheer ugliness of residents contain within the architectural aesthetics of this ancient metropolis.Perhaps MOST surprising to us was the un-impressiveness of the food. Yes, there was a good crepe at Versailles and a good chicken at Vale de Marne, but we kept asking ourselves: ""where's the world famous flavors?""

Compared to America, perhaps a few of Paris's restaurants could survive- perhaps as alternatives to the steady and satisfying variety in ANY of America's urban culinary gems. Truly, we concluded that American dining now FAR surpasses anything the French make- saying one had ""French"" food is just hype- something to talk about at one of the endless parisian outdoor cafes while dining on smokes and lithium. Oh yes, and that goes DOUBLY for the quality/price of the wine- I'll take a California Napa blend any day over a pretentious Bordeaux.Ultimately, it's not the food, or the attractions, or the mythos that earns a country/city a reputation. It's the people- how they approach life itself that gains fame or stinks up a place. And after our jaunt we concluded that Paris is RIPE. Our summation: Take a trip to Italy if you want to experience the best the EU has to offer, and leave the Parisians to their pretentious ways."
10,“Travellers beware”,"Paris is a beautiful city, be very careful when you are visiting the tourist attractions in particular the Eiffel Tower and The Louvre. Pickpockets are everywhere in particular Roma travellers, keep your handbags and cameras close to your body and do not make eye contact or get in to conversation with These people as they try to distract you while an accomplice will try to take what they can from you. On the metro also, African and European immigrants intimidate sole female travellers, be aware of your surroundings at all times."
30,“Good Choice”,"I stayed with my Mom and my 6 year old daughter for 9 nights the first week of July. I loved the location next to the RER station and having Luxembourg Gardens next store to our doorstep. There were many nice cafes and restaurants close to the hotel. The Japanese Sushi Grill next store was excellent and reasonably priced. The room was fine and as the week went on, I found that the staff was more and more helpful. Sometimes it seemed like we were bothering them, but other times they were cheerfully helpful. The area felt very safe. Storage was an issue in the room, but that's common in Europe. The breakfast was uninspired by the end of the week, but adequate. My only real complaint was the smell. From a non-smokers perspective, I felt like I could smell smoke often... possibly in the rooms carpet? Not sure, but the smell was tough and they never seemed to give us any wash clothes. I'd probably not stay here again, but would recommend the hotel to someone wanting to stay in the area in this price range."
50,“What to Pack for a Trip to Paris in July”,"July is the time when Paris see maximum tourist who travel to Paris from around the world to enjoy the pleasant summer days and amazingly unique beauty of the city. However mostly it's a warm day but you cannot predict the weather of Paris in July so if you are traveling to Paris in July you should pack your bag smartly. To assist you more in this task here are few suggestions that can tell you what to pack for a trip to Paris in July.Pack for all weather: You may not like this idea but this is the fact that you have to accept. July is a rainy season in Paris and you may find a temperature difference of 20 degree in day and night and sometime you can see this difference in day time also after heavy rain. Predicting weather condition of Paris in July is almost impossible so doing some over packing is not harmful.Pack cloths that you can layer: As said above, in the month of July weather changes very frequently in Paris and it is possible that when you leave from your hotel you temperature is low but by noon it becomes hotter and in evening it is quite cold again. So we suggest you to pack thin cloths that you can layer and you can get in comfortable condition by removing or wearing few layered cloths.Keep an umbrella or rainy wear with you: We understand you may not carry rainy wear every time with you but if possible keep it in your backpack else you can carry an umbrella with you. It can become useful for you in case of sudden rain that you may see in Paris during your vacation in the month of July.Pack Open toe and Closed toe Shoes: On a hot sunny day you may like to walk in park or anywhere else in an open toe shoe but it is also recommended that you shall pack a good pair of comfortable walking shoes because weather may get cold anytime and it will be very helpful for you in your vacation.Pack hat, sun glasses and other sun protection: In July days can get very hot and sunny, in that condition you may need your hat, sun glasses and sunscreen lotion. You may need them when you enjoy sunny day in any beautiful park of Paris.Pack an extra Bag: if you are interested in buying anything from Paris then July is the perfect time because this is the time when you can get sales in France. In this country government allow sales only twice in a year and July is one of those two times so this can be the perfect time for those who love shopping.Other than above season tips it is also suggested that you should not pack bright color clothes because many native people do not wear bright colors. Navy Blue and black can be perfect color along with any other light color combination and they are more formal so when visiting places like museum or fine restaurants try to wear some formal clothes to respect native people."
50,“Walk down rue Cler and rue de Seine”,"Two great streets to stroll down and view open markets of flowers, cheese, meats, chocolates and baguettes. Several cafes are there for lunch or dinner.There is a lovely soap store on rue de Seine called 'Lothantique' . It smells divine and was great to bring gifts back home."
50,“Easy to become a Pariser”,"You easily falls into the Paris atmosphere, and will feel like a Parisian yourself. My wife and I have visited Paris several times, and we will be back again. Paris is the city where all everyday stress and rush seems far away"
30,"“Paris is a beautiful city, but the citizens are not very friendly”","I went to Paris with three friends and I don`t remember where we stayed, but it was cheap. Of course we did all the tourist stuff like visiting the Eiffel Tower, Basilica of Notre Dame. Some areas of Paris are not very clean. I did like the food, especially the crepes. Many ( not all ) Parisians are very unfriendly, won`t help you if you are lost and need directions. If you are fluent in French, they will treat you great. Yes, it`s a beautiful city, but I won`t be going back because of their rude behavior."
50,“How To Enjoy A Week In Paris”,"Plan only one location to visit each day. For example, The Louvre Museum can/could take 2-3 days. The Eiffel Tower 1 day with outdoor dining 1 block away, The Arc de Triumph and the Champs de Elliesse 1 day to include visits to the shops and have lunch. Citi Isle 1 day, etc. This will be relaxing and much more fun than trying to see everything in 3 days. Enjoy."
40,“Get lost on the metro!”,"I don't know what this is, but the title caught my eye. We became a Parisian in one hour because we got hopelessly lost on the metro/train system trying to get to Versaillies! Made for a GREAT story when we got home!"
30,"“Great location, reasonably priced, accommodating staff”","Elysa Luxembourg is very well situated. we only stayed a few days, but were able to walk to notre dame, le tour mont parnasse, chatelet les halles, le pantheon, and roue mouffetard. it is also about 50 meters away from an RER stop, making travelling around paris very convenient. the room was a bit smaller than i had expected, and we didnt have a shower, just a bath with a shower head. besides that, the bed was comfortable and our neighbors werent too loud. basically, if you are going to be walking a lot in paris and only want to stay in your hotel to sleep, shower, and change, this place is great. we never tried the breakfast because there were so many other options right around the corner. accomodating staff, able to converse in english and french. free wifi is also a plus! definitely recommend elysa luxembourg"
50,“Walk through the pages of No Worries Paris”,"I recommend reading about this city before you go. Prioritize the things you want to see and according to your stamina, get on the metro and get to your first stop early."
50,"“Finally, biking in Paris!”","After years of looking longingly at the locals putting around on these impossibly stylish bikes, Americans can now rent them too! Although Americans have been and still are hampered by our magnetic stripe credit cards which do not work on the chip and pin required Velib kiosks, you can now sign up online to pre purchase your daily, weekly, annual Velib passes!Of course you have to be careful on your international web roaming fees - you can find a free wifi spot at a nearby McDonald's or at your hotel.Paris is a crazy busy place to ride a bike so be careful and don't tell everyone or else we'll have a city full of Americans crashing about :)"
10,“Where not to shop”,"I went to the shop Egle Bespoke on Rue Mont du Thabor - right off of Rue du Castiglione. I had been in there before as they have highly unusual and high quality scarves, etc. This visit, however, was one of the rudest disdainful experiences I have ever had.The salesperson obviously had a ""rendezvous"" with a friend and could not wait to throw me out - incidentally, i was making a purchase for an expensive shawl. He also kept calling me Lady to which i informed him in french and english was one of the lowest class forms of addressing a woman and it was close to Hey Mec or, in english, Hey You.I have tried to contact the owners but they are quite adept at hiding. Stay away no matter how beautiful the goods are.Remember you are the client and doing them a favor."
50,"“Vintage Atelier, 52 rue d'Argout, Paris”","'Room Service' is a tidy beautifully laid out boutique selling brilliantly chosen vintage and new clothes, jewellery and shoes.The owner truly susses your style and size immediately and makes great suggestions without feeling being pushy. Great prices too."
50,“Great Hotel in Paris”,A well appointed hotel right across the road from Luxembourg gardens.Rail link direct to CDG airport.Helpful staff and great location
50,“explore by walk”,"You need to forget the metro if you want to see all the hiden gems in Paris.Take a map and walk around the city from Louvre to Eiffel tower its only 15 minutes walking.About same to Notre damme cathedral,Arc de triumph is next and have a stroll on famous champs elyzees ."
50,“PARIS BY NIGHT”,"As Paris at night looks beautiful, one must take out sometime and be in leisure in the evening. I would suggest post dinnner should be ideal as sun sets there after 9. The significance of this trip is the illumination of Eiffel Tower which looks amazing. Then comes the cruise on river Seinne which gives a spectacular view of the city fully illuminated. Try carrying a pokcet umbrella as it might rain sometime. Take a walk on the streets which gives you a real time experince of Paris with locals and other toursists around. You can even go Champs Elysees. With its cinemas, cafés, luxury specialty shops and clipped horse-chestnut trees, the Champs-Élysées is one of the most famous streets and one of the most expensive strips of real estate in the world. You can see and experience the night life of Paris here."
50,“WALK!!! FEEL FREE”,"if you walk on the side of the Sena and let your heart feel what is Paris, just shut your mobile, feel the french people and seat in a cafe and let your life pass in front of you...just dream..feel and be in peace... that is Paris. have the experience of Lenotre cafe ..."
50,“Paris....more tha just a city”,"I have been married to the same lady for 43 years and during this courtship I have tried on occation to take her to Paris. We did make the trip in May of this year and let me say it truly is more than just a large city. Yes, I like most have read about, seen many movies, and watched travel shows exuding the vertues of the great city. We found a lovely hotel in the Montemare area of the city, an area where one can choose from a number of places to eat in all price ranges, buy fresh fruit, fish, and all sorts of items from the local merchants to enjoy as one wishes in any manner they feel. Walk the the streets and feel the life this city has, I mean you have to really just take some time each day walking and truly feel the city. Paris is not like the big citys of north America or many in Europe, it is one filled with a people who appear to love life and friends. We would go out for our evening meal and as we walked the streets considering our choices we watched and listened as the locals gathered in the night air to visit with friends,laughing and enjoying just being. There appear to be an number of places which seem just to open to the streets if you know what I mean, all of the store fronts are open with people seemingly spilling out onto the streets sitting around small crowded tables having a glass of wine and just living. During the day we as with most tourists travelled to the various tourist sites taking in all that there is to enjoy and having a wonderful time. The hours slip by the sites many and the river walk one to behold. Yes there are times when it is crowded and the sites, as expected, are busy, but the most memorable times are those when we just took a moment out to watch people. One afternoon it was cooler and we found ourselves in the Latin quarter, here on a busy street we found one of many small cafe shops,( now I had heard and read that the cost of cafe at a table is $$$) this was never our experiance. We sat outside under the awing with everone else, enjoyed a cafe and pastry for under 10E. It is not about the cost it is about the enjoyment of every moment. The locals go about their day much as we would but I watched as they just stopped to enjoy a cafe, sat at a table occupied by others, and just seemed to join in on smiles and local chatter. Paris is all you read about a beatiful city, one of lights and love, but much more than that to me it is a city where the people embrace life to the fullest. We felt there love of life as the evening air was filled with people laughing, enjoying music from improv groups which just seem to appear from no where. On our last day as we made our way to the Train station one cannot help but notice as the city workers are out attending to the streets the shop keepers are washing and sweeping the store fronts, they still find time to say good morning. I had read of how rude people in Paris can be, let me say I never met one person who did not smile and accepted that I did not either speak or understand french. They love their city and the city can love you if you take the time to just feel it""s heart."
20,“Repetto shoes shopping experience”,"The store on rue des Francs Bourgeois in Paris, France is not that friendly. Employees will only greet who they want to greet. The shoes themselves, especially the ballet flats, don't provide much cushion and sole support. I've worn a pair for a day at a time."
50,“Best Mocarons ever..”,Love to eat Mocarans here...best ever and a location was great is on the Champs-Elysees street
50,“Palce of Versailles and beyond”,After viewing Palace of Versailles take a 2k walk past the gardens to Mary Antionettes houses. They are beautiful.It's worth the walk. A train is also available (cost)for those unable to walk the distance.A wonderful place to visit.
50,“Great Paris Shuttle Service - Airport Shuttle by Dean”,"My experience with this shuttle service was excellent. It was my first trip to Paris. I was alone, travelling for business and had one free day to see anything and everything besides my hotel and the inside of windowless meeting rooms in the hotel where the conference I was attending was being held. I mentioned as much to the driver, who met me inside Orly airport with a name plaque, and he offered to give me the whirlwind tour. I was dropped off at my hotel and picked up again an hour later and I had one of the most enjoyable days sightseeing in recent memory. The driver turned out to be very knowledgeable about everything from historic sights to restaurants and shopping. He was patient and polite and I felt like I was well taken care of. The prices were very competitive, both from airport to the hotel and for the tour, and I was not asked for payment in advance. This service came highly recommended by a colleague who has used them for several years for both personal and professional travel to Paris. I would not hesitate to recommend them to family and friends or business contacts based on my experience."
30,“Wear a scarf - Male or female - warm or cold weather”,"How do Parisians seem to get so much mileage out of a scarf? They have so many stylish way to drap and wrap and all make an average outfit look stylish. Also, ditch the white trainers (Nike's, Reboks, etc.) They truely mark you as American."
50,“Wonderful apartment in the Marais!!”,"My husband and I spent 5 days/nights in this apartment, and were very, very pleased. It is in a great location in the Marais, close enough to several Metro stations: Hotel de Ville; Des Halles; Rambuteau, and we also took the bus directly from Hotel de Ville to St. Germain des Pres.The street has several restaurants and shops within a block. We tried the Moroccan restaurant just east on the same side of the street, L'Arganier...it was awesome! The lamb tagine with lemon and olives is to die for. We took enough home to have it again the next night...one of the nice things about having an apartment!We also found a nice bistro, Bistrot La Station Rambuteau that had terrific cassoulet (confit of duck with white beans...a classic French dish to die for!). ..something we both love, and this lived up to my hopes. It was fabulous, very authentic. We nearly went back a second evening, and the only thing that kept us from it was just the thought that with so few days in Paris we should try something different. This was one of our two best meals there!Definitely recommend!!There are a number of wine stores nearby, and like most of Paris, you are tripping over wonderful boulangerie/patisseries and bistros. Bon appetit!The decor is lovely, and the apartment is very nicely done. It is a studio with a very clever use of space in creating a ""stacked"" WC under the bath/dressing room. Everything was nicely appointed, and the owner had provided an excellent assortment of information.It is nicely situated on the first floor of the building. Our only complaint was the cigarette smoke smell in the hallways, and very heavy cigarette smell in the stairway. We would have taken the stairs instead of elevator, but the smell was stifling.Note that the apartment itself did NOT have any cigarette smoke; I am very sensitive to smoke, and it was perfectly fine!Our only difficulty was in regulating the temperature. It was January, and we had to open the windows occasionally to cool it, even though we had not turned on the heat. Not a real problem, but we wonder how it would be in summer with no air conditioning. Perhaps someone who has stayed there in summer can comment.We would DEFINITELY rent this apartment again, and recommend it to anyone.Bon Voyage!"
50,"“Paris, a classy city”","Last November I had the opportunity to take my mother (mother-daughter trip) to the city of lights, and found not only the beauty, the architectural, the history, the food, wine…BUT the class of their citizens…this was a very special trip, my mother is 85 years old and never had the opportunity to visit Paris, she has travel to other places but always dreamed to visit the one and only city of lights.I knew that my trip was going to be difficult because I tend to walk fast and go everywhere, but with an 85 year old companion, well…this trip was going to be in slow motion.I told my mom that in my previous trips to Paris, I found that the subways “METRO” was the way to move… fast, convenient and cheap. So with plenty of time we decided to take the adventure everyday and move ourselves in the fast pace METRO.I decided to write this note about the culture of the city because I was so pleased, full of gratitude and embarrassed at the same time.Let me explain…I discovered that the culture in Paris (I’m sure is in all over France) have a tremendous respect for the elderly, the elderly are not considered a burden or a throw away, but on the contrary, they found my mother a person full of life, history and deserving of respect. They went over and above any of their services to make my Mom feel at home and comfortable, from the waiter at the restaurant, the maid at the hotel, the strangers that were fighting to give up their seats in the crowded subway, an 8 year old boy wanted to make sure my Mom was ok in her seat, I have never ever seen that. I have been lucky to travel all over the world and I was shocked and surprised.Many people complained about how the French are rude, before this trip I have been treated rude at all, and now after this past trip I truly believed that we (the rest of the world are rude) not the French.We tent to copy trends in fashion or food…lets copy something that matters …the class and respect of the French people towards the elderly. We lived and a society that if you are over 50 with aches and pains your kids or family members can’t wait t send you to a home for someone else to take care of you…let’s learn how to respect and make the elderly feel welcome, open doors, give your seat up, wait few minutes at the grocery store until they pay, I know we are all in a hurry and we live in a fast pace lives, but few seconds are not going to kill us, maybe if we stop and see the history in front of us we all can learn something….like to appreciate life"
50,“Paris By Night”,"Seeing Paris at night was one of the highlights of my life.This is a must for anyone visiting Paris France.When you see the Eiffel Tower all lit up is one thing, but to see it sparkle with it.s special effects and the beam from the top is a memory you will never forget..Then there is the Domes that are lit up and the Luxor Obelisk, not to mention The Moulin Rouge..But to wander around Paris takes a very long time, so try to get a Tour if you can as there is just so much to see and do."
50,“Learn the Metro”,"The Paris Metro is justly famous. It is clean, quiet and ubiquitous. There is no place it won't take you. So, start by purchasing a carnet of 10 billets and go for a ride! The trains are frequent and electronic signs tell you just how long until the next one. The signage is clear; you won't get lost."
50,“Paris with baby”,"Just returned from a week in Paris with my 8 month old baby. Thought I would share some knowledge as it was difficult for me to find info before our trip.Bring a comfy stroller for your little one. Paris is exhausting for an adult let alone an infant. We considered taking the little flip and fold stroller but, it is tricky for her to settle for a nap inside of the comfy one. By taking her comfy stroller she would sleep for 20mins-an hour plus multiple times a day giving us time to check out a museum, eat a meal in a nice resturant etc... - wouldn't you rather nap in a lazy boy vs. an IKEA chair? -- as long as it folds, your're all good.METRO - not stroller friendly at all! The Paris bus is a fine and simple way to get around the city. Give yourself the time to get around. Buses have reserved space for strollers... it is standard for travelers to get out of that space when a stroller gets on board. Just be sure to get your tickets at the nearest Metro station as the buses do not take cash. Bring a carrier with you and strategize on a day out without the stroller and use the Metro for specific tourist sights.Eat nice lunches! My husband and I have had this philosophy on holiday for years.. save the money on a nice dinner and eat a nice lunch... This way, you can bring your little one and everyone is happy. We went for lunch at a very nice French resturant in St. Germain des Pres we stumbled upon and the staff was very welcoming to us coming in with a stroller. Just remember lunch is strictly 12-2pm at most bistros. Even if you do not understand the menu.. try the daily set menu - it is cheaper and a great way to experiment with French food. Lunch on average is 12-22 Euros per person depending on the resturant for an app + entre or entre + dessert.What's a changing table? Be prepared for NO place to change your baby and you have to think on the fly. I recommend going to Paris in warm weather and simply changing your baby in the stroller or discretely on a park bench if you need to. I did not go to ONE resturant or cafe with a changing table. Starbucks (or places like a Starbucks) are around.. but not plentiful and there are no guarentees for baby changing - even in McDonalds.. there are hardly any large department stores which would have baby facilities.. so this tip is not for the faint of heart. Best advise, practice quickly changing your baby in your stroller before your trip... then volia! baby changing on the go - just be sure you are prepared for any accident emergency.Parisians LOVE babies. Everyone chatted with our baby. She was the star of the show. It was lovely having such a welcoming attitude towards her.Eifel Tower IS stroller friendly. I thought the opposite. You simply need to fold it in the elevator. Then at the top, unfold it and you are all set. There is even a baby change on the top of the Eifel Tower!Baguettes are the perfect baby food. My baby just started solids. I had yet to give her even a taste of bread before our trip but one day I thought I'll give her a little.. she loved it! She simply sucked and chewed on the bread - hardly eating any of it.. however, this is a fantastic time waster while YOU have a meal. Volia!Muse de Orsay. AMAZING museum. Bad for babies. Good point - they let you cut the line with a baby so, do not be deferred with a long line.. once, they see you, they will push you in the front. HOWEVER, difficult to get to toilets in the museum, hard to navigate with a stroller and one floor only has stairs to access.. that said.. one of the best museums I have ever seen. Do not miss it.Strollers on the streets of Paris are challenging but you can do it.... people are very polite if the sidewalk is too small. Simply be polite and others will too.Bring your baby's bathtub. My baby responds well to our bedtime routine... specficially her bathtime. We brought her tub to Paris with her fave tubby toy so she could soothe her way into bedtime. Worked like a charm!Give yourself extra time. Every time I am in Paris, we push a lot into every day.. but.. sometimes things are closed. For example, we went far north of the city to a new contemporary art gallery that was closed just for the day we decided to visit. All was not lost as we found a very local and affordable place to eat lunch.. however, it made a lot of our plan for the day go out the window.Paris is the most beautiful and amazing city. Having my little one made some things challenging but, overall everything worked out fine. The joy of sharing Paris with her (even though she is too young to remember) simply made everything extra special.. Oh, it was nice having my husband share Paris with me too. ;-)"
50,“A magic walks in Paris”,"I went to Paris with my boyfriend, we had very bad flight beacuse it was foggy and we had to go by bus from other city airport in the middle of the night. But it was worth! It was very cold and snowy when we were in Paris, but there was almost no lines to all atractions and not a lot of people on the streets - what we liked most, because we don't like crowd. We visited whole city centre, almost all parks. I personally loved Paris Cathacumbs which I really advice to see! We did go on th Eiffel Tower, but if there is a long line to wait it is not worth, it is just a view and it is so high that You can't see details anyway, so it is better to walk along the streets and see every building from the ground :) I really advice to see Paris for couples, it is very romantic city even in winter time, it has its atmosphere and it is very different from other capitals in Europe. We want to go back there soon :) This time it would be somewhere in Autumn :)"
20,“Nuit Blanche 2011”,"Nuit Blanche is an outstanding event I look forward to every year, featuring art, installations and artists from all over for one all-night event.Good: This year attracted a plethora of faces, voices and exhibitions from around the world - from candle-lit meadows to massive video installations on cathedral ceiling to large-scale dance performances - a collection that can only be described as breathtaking.In addition, the city of Paris put full support behind late night metro services, with plenty of helpful attendants.Bad: In contrast to 2010, where events were held over a very wide area of the city, this year's events were concentrated in the worst tourist areas to be had: Monmartre, Marais and Hotel de Ville - culminating in one huge mess for Nuit Blanche attendees.Hoards of drunken teenagers crowd these areas on Saturday nights, making it almost impossible to walk. They are loud, rude and obnoxious, and in some cases aggressive. The lines/queues were not tolerable, especially for those with young people or older guests. Marais is especially inappropriate for a concentrated gathering on a Saturday night. The exhibits at the top of Monmartre were flanked by gangs of drunkard young people, with bottles flying all over and dangerous glass everywhere, and not a police in sight - ok if you want that, but not for the general public. This to me reflects a very poor plan on the part of the organizers.The worst was when we came back very late (some exhibits should stay open until 7am) many of the later exhibits were closed ealry / well before the published times.That said, it is incredible to see a city turn into a museum. And if you get in early and perhaps pick a few specific things to see, it is a great experience, but on the whole, the organizers need to rethink it, as it is not workable for a full night out.___en francaisNuit Blanche est un événement exceptionnel Je suis impatient de chaque année, mettant en vedette l'art, des installations et des artistes de partout pour une nuit blanche événement.Bon: Cette année a attiré une multitude de visages, des voix et des expositions du monde entier - de chandelles prairies d'installations vidéo massivement sur le plafond cathédrale pour des spectacles de danse de grande envergure - une collection qui peut seulement être décrit comme imprenable.En outre, la ville de Paris met plein soutien inférieur à la fin des services de métro la nuit, avec beaucoup de serviteurs utiles.Bad: Contrairement à 2010, où les événements ont eu lieu sur une zone très large de la ville, les événements de cette année ont été concentrées dans les zones les plus touristiques d'être a: Montmartre, le Marais et l'Hôtel de Ville - culminant dans un énorme gâchis pour la Nuit Blanche participants.Des hordes d'adolescents ivres foule ces domaines le samedi soir, rendant presque impossible de marcher. Ils sont bruyants, grossier et odieux, et dans certains cas agressif. Les lignes / files ne sont pas tolérables, surtout pour ceux avec les jeunes ou plus âgés invités. Marais est particulièrement inapproprié pour un rassemblement concentrée sur un samedi soir. Les expositions au sommet de Montmartre étaient flanqués par des bandes de jeunes gens ivrogne, avec des bouteilles de verre sur tous les volants et dangereux partout, et pas un de la police en vue - ok, si vous voulez, mais pas pour le grand public. C'est pour moi reflète un plan très pauvres de la part des organisateurs.Le pire a été quand nous sommes rentrés très tard (certaines expositions devraient rester ouverts jusqu'à 7 heures), beaucoup plus tard, des expositions ont été fermés ealry / bien avant les temps publiés.Cela dit, il est incroyable de voir un tour ville en un musée. Et si vous obtenez au début et peut-être choisir un certain nombre de choses spécifiques à voir, c'est une expérience formidable, mais dans l'ensemble, les organisateurs ont besoin de le repenser, car il n'est pas réalisable pour une nuit complète sur."
10,“Our Paris Metro experience with kids in strollers”,"We just spent a week in Paris, from Aug. 15 - Aug. 22 2011, with our 2 girls, ages 4 and 2. First of all, Paris is beautiful, even though it could be a bit more clean. It is a little bit expensive.But, we enjoyed our stay, and we wish we had more days. Even with 2 kids, we did manage to see quite a bit. We still want to go back to see the rest, and to spend more time at Eurodisney and the Louvre, see Monmarte and Montparnase. We did the Eiffel tower, rented boat at Louxemburg gardens, saw the Arc de Triumph, walked Champs Elyssee, saw Pompitou Centre, Lafayette, Eurodisney, we visited the Aquarium (great experience for the kids, there is a huge shark tank) and La Defense, saw a little bit of the Louvre and the sourrounding gardens, strolled to St Germain and the 2 islands, saw a little bit of Notre Dame. Had dinner and ice cream at the famous Glaces and Sorbet Berthilon - they are right, the ice cream is great.Our little one was impressed by the Eiffel Tower and Winnie. Our eldest absorbed everything like a sponge and was fascinated by so many things - the tower, the prinesses of Eurodisney of course, Venus de Milo, Mona Lisa, Victory of Samothrace.One useful tip, if you are at the Eiffel tower at night, or if you have a view of it check it out at 10pm - for 5 minutes it sparkles.Am writing the good stuff first because the sights of the city did not dissappoint us. The Metro did. It is impossible to use the Metro when you have kids in strollers. We did it the first day, and then we switched to the bus. First of all, not all stations are accessible by lift, and even if they are you cannot get to all levels by lift. At many occassions we had to use the escalators with the strollers, which was a terrifying experience. Also, at a lot of other occassions, it was just stairs, so we either had to get the kids out, fold the strollers, go up or down and then put them back in, which was upsetting to them, or rely on the help of strangers. The truth is, a lot of nice people went out of their way to help us with the strollers that day. After that we used the bus, which was much better. You enter the bus through the back door, and there is a spot on the busses especially for strollers and wheelchairs. We stayed at Citadines, Les Halles and they had a book with all the bus routes, which they loaned to us. With our 5 day Paris pass, we could use all public transport, and it is a great way to see the city. So, Paris is worth visiting with kids. If you plan to take your strollers study the bus routes, and do not use the Metro. Use it only if you are planning to go to Disney, you would have to take RER, line A (I think). RER are the faster trains. Oh, and at Disney, go as early as you can, there is a lot of waiting in line for the rides and to take pictures with the kids favorite characters. You can buy little books and pens for them so that their favorite charactes sigh them. And make sure to stick around untin 7:15pm to see the parade."
50,“paris......and SEINE BANKS”,I travelled and stayed in paris with my family of 2 kids of age3+...it wsa wonderful experience ... there were hyped things about the communication as we do not speak french ...but to one of trip advisor travellers advice .i learnt a few words in french and it was fantastic from there onwards ...french people are lovely and they will help you out extra mile if you try their beautiful language...during the course they will try to learn also few words of ENGLISH...rest as we stayed in one of hotels near CDG airport..commutation was really an issue with kids that too in budget... but thanks to internet and sites like this one i had perfect commutation...PARIS is divided and very well connected with METRO AND RER LINES ...but you should know the exact zone in which u are residing if u want to use their train network and most important keep a check on last trains timings...rest if u have to commute from ZONE 5(cdgairport And Hotels) to ZONE 1 then i think the best available thing is PARIS VISITE pass easily available from ticket counters.....and please alwys keep MAPS OF TRAINS AND ROUTES AND BUS ROUTES IF u donot want to use much of CABS AND taxis ....we never used it ....IN THE END MERCI (THANKS)...TRY TO GET A BOAT TOUR ON RIVER SEINE IN THE EVENING ONLY .....my personal recommendation and a very good camera.....
50,"“My New Favorite City - Paris, France!”","Ignoring all the comments about the French being rude to Americans, we headed for Paris and found the French people, happy, helpful and a fun to be around. We walked to all the famous sites, took a river taxi and and just simply had a wonderful time.Loved the food, the sidewalk cafes, the relaxed atmosphere and the endless streams of smiling people.Down side: USA money is at a low value in Europe. A Euro or British Pound is equal to two USA dollars. Prices are high for everything so, plan on watching your budget closely. A cup of coffee would cost about $5 and there are no free refills. Hot tea is a better value and you usually get about two cups per pot. Cheese and bread are bargains and make a great lunch with or without a glass of wine. Public transportation systems are clean and safe but you will need to take time to figure out how to use them and you can purchase tickets for multiple days and endless rides anywhere in the system. The Latin Quarter was our favorite eating area with lots of cafes. Everyone was helpful and went out of their way to find someone else that could understand what we wanted if they couldn't.We joined in singing with the singing groups that would usually be initiated by one person and soon, the entire car would join in. Now I know why so many movies proclaim Paris in a romantic fashion...it is that indeed.Caution - there are countless stairs to climb no matter where you go and very facilities for the disabled, wheelchair bound or others having problems with mobility. Nothing like what exists here in the USA. We walked everywhere and our legs were like rubber at the end of a day and there was still at least one more set of stairs to climb but with that said, we loved it."
50,"“Paris,city of light,a magical attrraction”","For many people Paris is the most beautiful city in the world,with the most beautiful avenue in the world the Champs Elysees,with Notre Dame cathedral,river Seina,Tour Eiffel / Eiffel Tower /,Louvre museum,Palais royal,Tuileries parc,Place de la concorde,Arc de triomphe,Madeleine church which is near Opera,Hotel de Ville/ TownHall /,Basilica of Sacre coeur which is situated near Montmartre,famous by many painters from all over the world and spirit of old Paris.At the foot of this,on the Pigalle,among the boutiques,cafes`,cinemas and cabarets it is Moulin Rouge,with every night parade of music,dancing and famous can/can.Must see magnificence Versailles,royal walled town,where the kings lived. About 30 km. from Paris is Disneyland of Paris.Paris has something for everybody,hotels offer accommodation with staff in costume,many restaurants,good food,museums,shops ecc.Paris is city of light and wanderful life."
30,“Shame on you paris metro - the man in charge needs a kick up the bum.”,"This review is about the Paris metro system, not Paris itself.Maybe I have been spoiled using hong kong's, shanghai or Shenzhen's subway systems, but the paris metro is way below the standard I would have expected for a large international tourist city.It's dirty, and covered in grafitti.The trains are old and don't have enough overhead bars for passengers to hang on to.Many stations have stairs instead of escalatorsSign posting is terrible. Subway maps are hard to find.Information is sparse. In the absence of maps or other useful directions it is often difficult to know which line to take.Staff are rarely seen (although a few stations have young guys paid to help tourists.Ticket desks often have long queues.No info to be found on the different ticket types individual ticket, carnet, three and five day passes and others.Signs at platforms offer very little info hard to tell which statiions a train passes through.Confusing names. E.g. Why is it called both gare du nord and paris nord?No easy directions to tourist spots like the Eiffel tower, sacre coeur and La louvre."
50,“Grey Shuttle Paris France”,"A man with a 4 Grey Vans, very proffessional and courtious, we were met at CDG Airport promptly by Jean and whisked away to our accommodation we booked our shuttles prior to our departure from Australia we received updates from Jean and confirmations, he advised that they did a Paris by Night tour for 80Euro for the hour but the kids were to tired. On our return trip to the airport we were met and greeted by Jean in all avery positive and enjoyable experience. Well advised to use if travelling straight from the airport to your accommodation 6 people cost ? 110 Euro ( I am pretty tight with my money ) but money well spent."
10,“Paris the city of pee”,"5 Years ago I went to Paris. Seemed nice and I returned in late June 2011. Here goes. The place is smells terribly of urine. It is littered with dog poo, cigarette butts, rubbish, rude people, scams and in short I will not return. I'm fairly laid back and like to mingle with the locals. Anyone would have thought I was unwell. Service was poor, locals unhelpful, really not a nice place anymore. The bus driver warned us of places that were no go areas, he seemed to point out most of the CBD area. The Rossey bus failed to pick us up at the airport, 3 went past without stopping, the tourists were not happy including me. I leave tomorrow and cant wait to go. The scams of pretending to drop a gold ring in front of you and then have you pay money for it, the tying of string to your wrist by aggressive males demanding 5 euro for the string the fake leather jackets. Overcrowded, smelly and not a nice place to be anymore. Its a shame."
40,“Walk along the Seine”,Easy and cheap. A great many of the postcard 'sites' are along the river. And you can split it into sections to complete at your own pace. Bars and food are cheaper and less touristy a few steps away down a side street.The bridges are all different and works of art in themselvesThe river is busy with shipping - both the famous city cruisers and heavy commercial barge traffic - a constant flow of boats to watch on their way. Also a fair number of private pleasure craft.Get a map (free) from the tourist office and plan your walk - mostly away from traffic.It's a great way to see the exteriors of buildings for free.And you can get the whole of the Eifel Tower in using a pocket camera from the Trocadero
50,“Be sure to get the 6-Day Pris Pass Package”,"This review is of the Paris Pass package, six days of Museum Pass, six days of Transport Pass, and six days of the Paris Pass for attractions, all for E 150 per person.We staggered the beginning dates of our Museum Pass and our Pris Pass so as to give us places to go without charge for seven days.We also walked a good deal the first dday so as to sae our Transport pass for the city (zones 1-3 RER, Metro, & SNCF) for the six of the seven days wherein we planned take thelongest trips.We definitely exceeded the cost of the package with the many museums and attractions which we visited from the Louvre to Versailles."
40,“A city of Romance and roadside Cafes.”,"Following are the do's and don'ts we feel as a couple should be observed in Paris :1) Be ready to walk and read and understand maps (maps of the city, of the metro trains, of the attractions etc)2) Preferrably ask for directions from shopkeepers and speak english clearly and slowly so that they can understand the first time around.3) Not wise to leave your luggage un attended on the road or anywhere.4) Book tickets for popular attractions (Eiffel Tower, Lido Show, Moulin Rouge etc) on the internet before starting to get a discount and avoid queues.5) For the Lido Show and Eiffel Tower, while they say that one has to be formally attired (jacket, tie et al), its not at all true. You may not go in shorts and flip flops, but jeans, shoes and T-Shirt are okay (I had also worn a wind cheater type jacket just to be on the safe side). Its your money after all !!!!6) My wife is a vegetarian. So, the food can be a bit of a problem in case you don't want to travel for food. While there are enough Sub-ways, Mc Donalds and Starbucks etc, there may not be too many in your hotel's locality. Even Mc Donalds does not serve Veg Burger there. There are lots of italian food options thou gh. So, we had a lot of spaghetti and pizzas while in Paris. I eat meat, so the problem was lesser for me. Chicken and fish are freely available !!7) It will be good if one is aware a bit about history, art and wine etc. Will help to appreciate the city better !8) The last cruise on the river Seine (at 10:30 pm) is a must see. The city gets transformed at night ! Its magical. Also, take a two day city tour and go on the yellow and the green line routes. Its the best way to listen to running commentry while seeing the city on an open bus.9) If you like Art, the Louvre and the museum of Orsay are a must see. The cathedral of Notre Dame and the Sacre re Ceur (its a White church on the top of a hill near Monmarte) are also a breathtaking site. Reserve at least 3 hours for the Eiffel tower and you must go to the third level (by lift). Its very windy and cold up there, so be sure to carry a wind cheater and a cap !Have a nice time !!"
40,“Paris is expensive”,"I am not going to lie to anybody, Paris is expensive. Los Angeles and San Francisco are nothing when compared to Paris in terms or living cost. You can go to Paris on a budget, but you won't have good memories of it. You have to splurge more in this city.If you are looking for branded items, such as Louis Vuitton, Longchamp, and other famous French brands, this is the town of shopping mecca for you. Because, you can get really good deals here as compared to shoping in the States.Breakfast at the famous Cafe de Flore is quite expensive, about 60 Euro. Having tea at Laduree is roughly 50 Euro; lunch in a cafe in the Madeleine area and in rue St. Honore is about 60 Euro. This is the price for a family of three people minus alcohol, just water.Paris is magical, beautiful and breathtaking. There are places where you can go where the locals eat, shop, and have gun. But, you must do a lot of research and be able to speak French, at least in a full finish sentence."
10,“Worst City”,I Hated Paris it was everything I would hate though! Overpriced shops with very little things I wanted to buy ( came back with nothing)which is unheard of! Really Expensive to eat out and yet the rudest waiters Ive ever known and was amazed at how unfriendly and dull it was for a city that is supposed to be romantic????Id never go there again and even the food was bland and I also visited Disneyland which had queues that were so long by the time you have boarded the ride you have more or less forgotton which ride you were waiting for! although it was the best bit of the trip.Very hot weather but because it is all brick it seems to absorb the sun so is like an ovenSo disappointing but at least I can cross it off my list.
50,“My favourite place is Paris France”,"Paris is a very romantic city, easy to get around and the Metro train is great. With care you can travel all around the metropolitan area at a reasonable charge. Our longest wait was 4 minutes.The river Seine is lined with wonderful old buildings going back hundreds of years such as Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Hotel d'Ville, Notre Dame Cathedral (free to enter) and so on.A walking tour of Montmartre is highly recommended and a trip to a few of the chateaus is worthwhile. Fontainebleau is huge but not really worthwhile. Versailles is too crowded.Food is reasonable, especially lunch which can be eaten either in a cafe or on the run approx 2.5Euros plus extra for a drink.A trip to Malmaison where Napoleon and Josephine lived was interesting. They close for lunch and we found a restaurant which served le plait de jour which was fabulous."
40,“Highlights of our trip to Paris”,"Recommendations:* purchase Eiffel Tower tickets online in advance (time saver and you will have a scheduled time to go up the tower)* consider a day trip to Bruges (Belgium): we loved it! It also is good to schedule in between heavy walking days since it was a nice break for us to sit on the bus for 4+ hours each direction* consider taking a free tour with City Free Tours (we really enjoyed Chris' Montmartre Tour) - tip him!* Louvre: if you want to get in a group tour, show up at 9a.m. to sign-up. The audio headsets work well if you prefer to self-tour and it includes a ""Masterpiece Tour"" which gives you very detailed instructions on where to walk. Plan on at least 1/2 day to visit the museum. Metro goes right to the basement of the Louvre.* Metro: purchase the billet of 10 tickets as a money saver. We used metro a lot (it's always crowded but the trains are very efficient)Restaurant recommendation: Chez Gladines (13th arr): great food, very affordable, huge servings. Cash only, arrive at 7p.m. when they open and expect a crowd. Best meal we had in Paris and the most affordable! You won't leave hungry but don't expect to order quickly. Order the specialty (waitress will tell you).* Transportation from CDG airport: I wouldn't even try RER unless you are pulling small luggages. If you have to switch to metro you will be frustrated wtih the stairs and the crowd on metro. Glad we took at taxi to our hotel.* Stay in a hotel offering an in-room refrigerator. We stocked ours with fruit, juice, etc. from small markets. The food is so expensive in Paris so travelers beware!* Hotel options: you don't have to stay right in the middle of all the attractions as long as you are close to a Metro stop. We stayed at Paris Marriott Rive Gauche in the 13th arr and got around fine and saved money on the hotel accommodations (purchased via priceline.com - named our price). Just note that wi-fi isn't included in the room rate and the hotel is set up for a maximum of 2 per room."
50,“My favourite place in France”,"I had been in Paris last year and having altogether different experience of culture,hospitality and food.I spent 3 days in Paris but these have become memorable period of my life.People though not very conversant with English but still never makes me feel that I am not communicable.The hospitality and treatment given to me was outstanding and I am very pleased to have company of the people in Paris.Food was excellent and enjoyed good indian food as well at some of the resturants."
40,"“Eiffel Tower, Paris Moulin Rouge Show and Seine River Cruise package.”","While traveling to Paris we wanted to do something special Also because of the language barrier, we knew it would be better to explore with the experts. We booked Eiffel Tower, Paris Moulin Rouge Show and Seine River Cruise package. The whole experience was wonderful. The viator office was easy to locate, it was on a way to the Louvre. There was a little confusion at first as there was more than one group boarding for a tour, made it a little bit chaotic. We first took a bus ride to the Eiffel Tour for a dinner. They got us quick to the restaurant. The food was awesome. Although it felt a little rushed, and they sat us down at a regular no view seats (understandibly, this comes this tourist groups). There was no real time to take pics, but thats ok, because we went back the next day to the tower. After the dinner, we were given a meeting place which is 5 minutes from the Tower at the boats. The Boat ride was a good start for sightseeing and to get some information about Paris, but my audio thing that was attached to the seat did not work. We also got a wonderful view of The Tower on our return trip, with all the lights. What a sight! As soon as we got off, we got on a bus and went to the Show. We did have to wait in line with all the other people, i think it was a good 30 min wait. The room was crowded, and they tried to squezze as many people at one table as possible. It was packed. Our seats were far from good. I had a bunch of heads sticking out in front of me, which made it difficult to see. Oh, and the whole time we were sidding sideways, so my neck started to hurt. But I did not mind. This is something that you just have to do if you are in Paris!"
40,“Great spacious appartment to rent in the Marais Area Paris”,We rented a 2 bedroom apartment from --------------------Very spacious lounge / dining good beds great kitchen / bathroom very secure It was on the 1st floor The curtains did not pull in the lounge room but that did not bother us Not grand but it had a good feel about it / painted floors very frenchIt was a very busy area with lots of night life and noise although it did not stop us from sleeping as we were out walking all dayWe found the price very good /better than a hotel and more like homeWe were 2 couples sharing in our 60s We loved the area with so much history and we could walk everywhere but the subway was just up the street . Supermarket nearby for wine & food Great cafe Le Square across the road for breakfast or dinner if you did not want to cook Also another excellent restaurant up the streetParis has so much to offer I would have liked another week or two there Climb the Arc De Triumph as the view is amaxing The double decker buses are great to get around if you are not up to the walking All the buildings are so beautiful you could never afford to build like this todayA little bit of doggy poo But I love dogs and all animals so it did not worry meCigarettes and lots of smokers but the cleaners were out early each day cleaning the streetsI will be back for another visitThe french people and all staff were very helpful and friendly exceptWe did have trouble getting cabs and some drivers were rudeParis is a beautiful city and I did not think it was too expensive
50,“Paris a fairy tale city*”,"What a beautiful city! Paris is one of my favorite place I've been to. Everything is so surreal, it's like being taken back in the old times of renaissance -vintage beauty and art. There are several attractions that are must see in Paris. Along river Seine, the architecture of the city, the buildings the bridges, the monuments are breathtaking. The Louvre is located right along river and its an ginormous museum, very beautiful. When planning to go to Louvre it's pretty much the whole day thing, counting the crowds and wait times. Also, entrance from the mall is much faster way in. Another famous landmark to visit is Notre Dame, absolutely amazing inside and out, and it's free.Nearby you have Jardin de Tulleries and Jardin de Luxemburg, beautifully design parks as with landscape as well as fountains and buildings. Les Invalides is where you will find Napoleon's massive coffin. Also there is Arc de Triomphe monument, Moulin Rouge(great show but better if you understand French), and off course must see Eiffel Tower. You will find lineups at the Eiffel Tower, its a zoo but the payoff is great. When it gets dark the tower is beautifully lit and it flashes the lights, it's just amazing. Cool place to check out is Catacombs, spooky but quite different from anything I've seen. For shopping, you'll find many souvenir stores along the stretch of river Seine, near Notre Dame and Louvre. There's a flea market north of the city Clignancourt that starts early in the morning and wraps up by the afternoon. If interested in French and other European perfumes, Paris is the place to check it out; for example: Annick Goutal, Frederic Malle, Villoresi, etc. since some of them aren't sold in North America or you can get them in 1 or 2 places for a much higher price. I love the uniqueness of French style, being perfumes, fashion and architecture. When visiting Paris there's so much to see and you definitely need at least a week to explore the city. There's two negative things about Paris; you'll encounter people that do not speak English on purpose and gypsies. However, there a lots of people that will help when you're lost, I found that knowing few words in French is beneficial and people give you a credit for trying. In regards to gypsies, watch out for scams such as signing to donate money, just ignore them and watch your purse, money and passports closely; pick pocketing is common in the crowded areas. I guess when travelling the best advice is don't stick out like a sore thumb with an expensive camera, jewelry and map spread in the middle of the street. You can be in a bad area and not even know it. Paris metro if the great and cheap way to get around the city. Cabs can be pricey and traffic is like in any other big city. Overall Paris is absolutely amazing city to visit and I plan to go back, revisit some places, spend some more time and enjoy the scenery."
50,“Eight days is not enough in Paris”,Take the time to thoroughly explore at least one neighbourhood in this food paradise. I rented a studio apartment in Montmartre for 8 days and it wasn't enough. My favourite cafe Au Lux Bar just three doors up was the first stop of the day. Brilliant customer service & great coffee. The metro is easy to use as are the buses but you will feel the vibe & get the essence of this superb city if you walk. I walked 6- 8kms a day criss crossing the city to see as much as I had the energy for. The window displays from funeral wreaths to food beckon you to step over the threshold to see more. I went in every chocolate shop I passed just to look at the magnificent displays. I found the customer service standards in every place exemplary even when I didn't make a purchase. A peaceful morning in the Pere Lachaise cemetary recharged the batteries whilst remembering the heroes who died for France and the souls who perished for their faith. Be a traveller and not a tourist and you will be welcomed with open arms and of course your open wallet.
50,“Good for everyone.”,"I have been in Paris when I was single with my friends, with my husband and now we are planning to visit it again with our little baby. This city can be amazing for everyone in any occasion. Romantic for couples, really fun for friends and pleasant and cozy for families. I will try to go back to Paris my whole life!Marcela, Rio de janeiro, Brazil"
40,“Exceeded what I expected...”,"Going to France, I expected pick-pocketers, having a difficult time with the language, the food, and the Metro, and the local's negative perceptions of tourists. I WAS a victim of attempted pick-pocketing within the first 4 hours of arriving in Paris! I was sooooo shocked, for I thought it would never happen to me! I say attempted, because a nice Parisian lady on the train and my cousin thwarted her attempt. Me not knowing a word of French and the French's ""no-care"" attitude of attempting to speak or understand English, frustrated me. The only food I liked was the beef burgundy dish 'cause it had taste. Everything else was bland. But the pastries are a must, must, must! And coming from a city where you have to drive everywhere, taking public transportation, especially the train, was new to me.Now, this is what I experienced in the first couple of days. After I got over what I expected and let my annoyance of these experiences pass over, I sooooo enjoyed my stay in Paris! The stories you hear about the Parisian/French people doesn't apply to everyone in France, as I'm sure the stories they hear about the U.S. doesn't apply to all of us who live here. And I feel, people like to share their negative stories in a land that's foreign to them because of their attempt to not understand the local's point of view, anyway.But with that said, I would definitely visit France again! The sights and landmarks are amazing--there's soooo much history and little side stories about each place--from Versailles, to Eiffel, to lessons in French history! And not all French people are not nice. I met some really nice and helpful Parisians. The shopping is excellent, with ""excellent"" prices! LOL But if you go where the locals go, you can get some really nice clothing, shoes, and gifts for a reasonable price. And I thought this was just a cliche but Paris IS really a romantic city! Everywhere I looked, there was soooo many degrees of PDA--on the train, in the park, or just walking down the street. By the time the last day of the trip came, I felt just like one of the locals. I ordered food with confidence, spoke enough French to get by, and could take the metro with my eyes closed. Hope to get back there soon..."
50,“Paris in the spring time”,"We spent a week in Paris early June and found it a great time for strolling. The weather was variable with a bit of clouds and a bit of rain. We sat at terraces for lunch or midafternoon stop. We particularly liked the bouquinistes along the Seine where you can see many unusual old books, pi ctures, and people."
40,“In my opinion the nicest city in Europe”,"I've visit Paris 1 week ago, and it was a fascinating experience.You can find the best museums in the world, sail the Sena, visit Notre Dame, Montmatre, well is just amazing.My plan was to spend 3 days, and at last I spen 7,The city is clean and safe, and french people is really nice.Of course, as all Europe, is not a cheap place but if you never have been is a place you need to you, is just unique, and very romantic!!!"
30,“Beautiful but pricey”,"Paris in June is still the most beautiful city in the world. The cost however (including the weak dollar) is almost ridiculous. A small salad and a beer in an average sidewalk bistro should not cost over $30.00 US. In addition, the lines to get into almost any attraction are crazy. Don't even think about enjoying the Louvre as you stand eight rows deep to view the Mona Lisa or Winged Victory. Versaiile, how about 1 1/2 hours to get in. All in all, I'd wait until the dollar rebounds and perhaps go in the fall or early spring."
30,"“Lots of history, No Ice, Rude Citizens”","We were fortunate to just spend 4 nights in Paris at the end of May 2011.They city is huge, dirty, fast, exciting, confusing, covered in Grafitti busy, and amazing - all at the same time. Between all the famous attractions and tourist it almost felt like a pretend world.After you wander off the main roads you get a better feel for Paris and that makes it much more special.We in a terrible little hotel near Notre Dame which was a block away from the Monstorous Paris Subway. You can get anywhere but pay attention or you are lost.Finally - What is with the Nasty, Rude, Parisians. I mean really with all the tourist that come to Washington DC who don't speak English and much less say ""bonjour"" when they walk in to spend their money... Come on Paris. You people are no more special than any others...Beside the nasty rude people, the only other issue I had, which seems to be similar throughout Western Europe, is that it is almost impossible to get ICE with any drinks... I would have paid someone to fly to the US and to get me a Big Gulp.Everyone smokes everywhere and drinks all the time... breakfast lunch, and dinner. After seeing that it is easy to understand why they are all so skinny."
40,“pickpocket thiefs in the metro system - this time sct.michel - notre dame”,just spend 4 really nice days in Paris - but got my wallet stolen in the metro at sct.michel / notre dame station - So beware.. be very careful - and be sure to hide with your pin code wtih your hand when / if you use the ticket machines at the metro stations. attention !
50,“Wonderful city!”,"I would like to share my opinion about my last, short trip in Paris, France. We have been in hotel Ampere, 4 star in Clean, comfortable, luxurious, contemporary, sophisticated, modern hotel, with intimate piano bar, garden for breakfast, cozy bedrooms, beautiful bathrooms. It is located on Avenue De Villiers, on the Right Bank, in the fashionable, residential area of the prestigious 17th district if Paris. Close to Arc De Triomphe and Champs Elysees. The price is reasonable – if you book 21 days in advance is 120 Euro for double room. I wrote a separate review for this hotel.We visited Tour Eiffel, Versailles palaces and gardens, Notre Dame, La Defense. I didn’t expect so much crowd everywhere. The lines to arrive to the Tour Eiffel and Versailles, were more than 2 hours long. Don’t trust if somebody tells you that there is a way to avoid the lines. You have to wait and that’s it. The same crowd is inside everywhere taking pictures.Paris has extremely well organized transportation system. Even if you don’t rent a car, there is a metro, trains, buses and you reach every point in minutes. The signs are clear and the people friendly to help you. Crazy, fast traffic but you don’t see smashed cars.What else impressed me – all restaurants, bars are with tables outside and all the time they were full. The people sit for hours, talk. The people communicate between them also on the streets, in the stores, everywhere. Something that I never noticed in the US. You can stay on Champs Elysees for hours and this is the only way to feel the friendly, warm, unique French atmosphere. It is wonderful.La Defense is a big mall with stores and also the biggest corporate center in the world. Hotel Hilton and many offices. Beautifully arranged.Another impression – it is a big city – 2,2 million popolation of Paris and 21 million tourists only in Paris, but the city is clean. You don’t believe so many people live there and if they litter somebody cleans after that.Good people, beautiful city – capital of the world and deserve to be visited again and again."
30,"“Paris, France”","The City of Lights is spectacular, possibly my favourite capital city in the world. There are places in Paris that are not that great, dirty, seedy, smelly, cheap and not that safe. However, get hold of a good map, be sensible, be alert and you could have a most wonderful time here. I travelled by metro to the centre to catch a night tour bus showing us the city of lights. The trip ended at 12 midnight and I walked to the metro, got on and travelled back to my destination at Trocadero. No problems. The night before I walked from the Tuilleries gardens (after taking sunset pictures) up past Place de la Concorde, up the Champs Elysses, crossed over the Pont de Alexander and walked up past the Eiffel tower and up to the back of the Trocadero. This was between 10 - 12 pm. Again no problem.Paris has a wonderful bicycle facility. You will need a credit card to register but if you can handle the rather unpredictable French drivers, you can cycle all over the city with ease. Paris is a city you could easily spend a week exploring, there is simply so much to see and do."
30,“Paris behind closed doors”,"I had never visited Paris before and was looking forward to exploring somewhere I had never been to and had wanted to go for a long time. I was looking forward to sightseeing, and spending time with friends who live in Paris.Although I did have an enjoyable week seeing all of the famous sights and other attractions , walking, relaxing, enjoying the food and drink and time with friends, this holiday was not as I expected.The metro, while easy to navigate was really hot and unbearably cramped at times and was so dirty, it made the london underground seem pristine.When we arrived at gard du nord we purchased a weekly metro ticket, and the lady who served us did not tell us that we need to put a picture on the card, and later in the week we were fined 25 euros each and the woman who gave us the fine would not speak any english or listen to what we were saying. When we asked to speak to someone else or have a contact number she refused to help.This was not the only incident of someone being rude, we found this a regular occurence. We are not fluent in speaking french, but made every attempt to speak in French, but if we made any mistakes the people would be very rude and shout or moan, yet if you spoke in English they were also rude, so you couldnt win.The city as a whole was a lot dirtier than expected and everything was so expensive. You would be charged up to 5 euros for a coca cola. We ended up buying lots of drink and foods at our local super-u!Although I am glad I went and saw the sights and saw friends, I am not sure if I will visit Paris again - I am glad I can tick this off of my places I have visited... but I think if it hadnt been for the company I was with this may not have been so enjoyable."
30,“latest trip experiences in paris”,"Just returned to India after a 4 day stay in paris. Just a couple of things for persons who have not visited paris before . The Arc de Triumphe which is one of the important monuments at the western end of Champs Eylsee is a fantastic sight. Only poblem we had was that the lift to the top level was not functioning and we had to climb about 280 odd steps (spiralling) to reach the top.Usually one has to climb only the the last 46 steps as the lift takes you till there.This was a slighly gruelling experience. Well youngsters can however make it easily.Another irritating experience was that nowhere in paris will any restautrant, or shop give you a change for 500 euros. They would say the amount is large and they dont carry that much cash. Even banks dont give you the change. We suffered one day badly on this account and ran from pillar to post and finally got the change from a post office after purchasing some enveloped for about 10 euros.Money changers are not located in all places.Pl therefore take euros in smaller denominations like 50 or 100's apart from the change.There are no public toilets as such as we find in switzerland. You will have to use the toilets at the eating places as and when you eat something.None of the metro stations have toilets unlike in switzerland.Lastly people in paris are less communicative as compared to switzerland.Sometimes they avoid you or your questions. The older people are more helpful.Even the personnel at the information centres are not very tourist friendly. May be the language issue?Neelu60"
20,“arrogant city”,"French in Paris are so arrogant and helpless.Paris is famous in the world.I visited eiffel tower,Cathédrale Notre Dame de Paris,Muse du Louvre.The city is so nice.French food is quite good.Goose liver,steak,French fries and so on.Nice trip for me if you can ignore the arrogant people there."
50,“Enjoying Paris”,"This was my first time to Paris, but certainly not my last. I had a great time and I wanted to share some information for future travelers to Paris. First off I walked everywhere in Paris so yes I never used a Taxi except for getting from the airport to my hotel and also taking a taxi to the train station. One thing you will find out about Paris is you can walk everywhere and see so much. The food is great, the vibe of the city and the culture I found real interesting and the amount to see was fantastic. I had five whole days in Paris so that is why I decided to walk everywhere. If you don't have that much time, then grab the Metro, since it is quicker then walking. Once you get to Paris buy a Museum pass. I can not explain to you how many times when I got to a museum the line was so long, but since I had this pass I went by all these people and right in. If you don't speak french don't worry about it. I learned the basic phrases and then after that spoke english and I had no problem communicating with anyone. Paris is a great city and I really enjoyed it so book a flight and get there and enjoy."
50,“Travelling with an Infant in Paris”,"We have just returned from a 10 day trip from Paris and I was traveling with a 18 month old baby girl. We planned our trip well ahead to help the baby enjoy her trip. Here is the snap shot1. Eiffel Tower and Champ de Mars - Right near the tower beside the seine, there is a beautiful carousal. Your baby will love it. Don't try to climb the tower. The line is long and will bore your baby. Instead let her have fun in the park.2. Louvre - You can take your trolley but obviously baby will not be encouraged with the pictures. So see Monalisa, Venus de Milo and the victory statue and browse through the pictures and sculptures quickly and visit Jardin de tullieries. This park has beautiful fountains with another little carousal your baby will love. Take a stroll and admire the statues while your baby plays with the pegions3. Les Invalides - Here you see Napoleon's tomb. There is a museum of dolls showing miniature figures from the past. Your baby will like it. The chapel and the tomb is beautiful. The garden outside is lovely for the kids4. Notre Damme and Sainte Chapelle - Both these places are very beautiful but may not be very interesting to kids. However there is a flower market near the river on the island where they sell beautiful chimes and dolls for kids. My daughter loved tosee them5. Place de Concorde and Arc de Triumph - Here you can climb to see a bird's eye view of paris and the elevator makes it easy with the kids. The place has a small shop for kids. My kid loved the historic dolls in swords and courtly dresses.6. Versailles - the palace is amazing. Kids may not find this place interesting but it's worth a visit. My daughter was playing with the audio guide while I was admiring the king's extravagance.7. Seine Cruise - this is a beautiful ride but it can get cold and windy on top of the boat. So be careful"
40,“Tips for An American Traveling in Paris”,"My husband and I traveled to Paris for 1 week in May 2011. Here are several things that I found useful during my trip planning and finally when we arrived in Paris:1) Guide Book: we used Rick Steve's Guide Book and his audio tours for the major attractions in Paris - it was very good, and saved us a few euros not to have to purchase audio tours in the museums2) After extensive search for hotels on my part - I mean, serious search including an excel file (my husband thought I was insane), we ended up renting a small studio apartment for much much cheaper (660 euros for a week). The problem with paris hotels especially in May (peak travel season) is that they are super expensive (Average 250 dollars / night for 2-3 star hotels) for super small rooms. We found our apartment clean, more than adequate, and convenient with a washer/drying, fridge, microwave, and small stove.3) In terms of voltage, as long as your electrical cords have voltage 110-240V labeled on them, all you need is an adaptor.4) My husband has an iphone via AT&T and ended up purchasing a 3G data bundle for our trip to paris - super useful. Even though we had a laminated map of paris, sometimes, it was very helpful to pull up the iphone and use google map to GPS where we actually are. Also, we used google translator quite a bit - and that requires internet connection.5) BUY a Museum Pass! - that saved us a lot of times skipping lines at museums and major attractions such as the Louvre, Orsay, Arc de Triomphe, Versailles.6) Book ticket online for Eiffel Tower before you leave home. The line to the eiffel tower was horrendous. Except we have already booked a ticket with a preset time of entry and we just breezed by the hordes of people standing pitifully in line and up the elevator we went!7) stay at a central location: we stayed at the left bank, near st. germain des pres. It was so convenient. We walked to almost everything and rarely used the metro. We only used the metro at the end of the day when we were dead tired.8) Paris in May - beautiful weather but the city is surprisingly dusty. It was nice to have the laundry because our cloth are pretty dirty after a day's walk. Also bring sunglasses for eye protection or else you'll be blinking and rubbing your eyes all day long. And also bring allergy medicine if you are prone to allergies. My poor husband was sneezing like a madman. Fortunately, Paris has an abundance of pharmacies that carries nasal spray (steroid) and zyrtec."
20,“Confiscated Bank of America credit card..”,Just returning from a 12 day trip to Paris and love every minute.. Having been many times we did some research as to the most economical means of having access to money via ATM's. Bank of America was reconmmended .. no fees .. no withdrawal charges if account is tied in with account. All went well and did withdraw money 3 times early on our trip. The 4th time we used it we were not successful ... and the card was not returned for security reasons!! We were not able to get more onfo since it was a Sunday and bank was closed. We used our AE card and all went well. Moral of story .. do not rely on 1 card!
50,“Easter weekend in Paris for first-timers”,"Trip date: Thursday April 21 to Monday, April 25.Thanks in advance to all TA posters - you guys really helped with planning our trip to Paris! Apologies in advance for length, I'll try to balance ""informative"" with ""brevity""!Our flight was from Boston to CDG Paris, with a very short stopover in Reykjavik, arriving early afternoon Friday to CDG. It took much longer to get out of the airport and into the city than we thought it would – bags took about 45 minutes to collect, and then ride the shuttle to the train station, then figure out how to get train tickets to Paris from the kiosk without a chip-and-PIN credit card. Solution? Try another kiosk! :) The line to the teller was very long, so we persisted with the kiosks and it finally worked. Then ride the train into the city, stop at Gare du Nord to make our way to our apartment. We stayed in the 17th, on Rue Brochant, and loved everything about the location! We were planning on taking the metro to the apartment from GdN, but after dragging our luggage onto a squillion trains/metros (including pre-departure in Boston), we decided to take one of the numerous taxis. Problem: we had “only” 20 euros in cash, and had no idea how much the fare would be, and after asking, none would take card. There only seemed to be one ATM in the main floor/area of Gare du Nord – was this just us not being able to find any others? I am thinking it was the only one, if the massive line meant anything.But really, maybe the best advice I can give anyone else traveling to Paris, take the taxis!! They are so cheap, and so pleasant, we never had any problems using them, just a smile and ‘bonjour – sil vous plez’ and off you go. The trip from the train station to the door of our apartment in the 17th was under 10euros, and completely worth not hassling with more public transport. I still wasn’t sure about tipping, we rounded up and added 2-3 euros on top of that, usually, and hoped that was alright. Sometimes five if that was what change we had!Dinner that night (Friday) was at Le Libre Exchange, on the corner of Brochant and Avenue de Clichy, which was excellent. A formula which we followed (even though I planned otherwise with extensive TA reviews!) was to walk until we wanted to eat, and then eat at whatever looked good. We were never disappointed!! What was really memorable about Le Libre was the dessert. On the following night we showed up at about 10:30 for just dessert and coffee – yum. Also, a LITRE of beer. This was the only restaurant we found it at, but really? ‘Nuff said.Saturday and Sunday were full days of sightseeing, and it would be much too boring to give a blow-by-blow detail – Eiffel Tower! WOW! – but really, Paris is now one of my favorite cities in the world. I think it was because it was Easter weekend that there were such massive lines everywhere, but we basically did a walking tour of the downtown area, with no special pattern. We did go to the Batignolles Market which some people have recommended, and I would recommend it as well – but only for its novelty factor. I still was not used to the fact that: markets! With fresh produce, meats and cheese! Are! Everywhere!! You can’t go three store-fronts without walking past a fromagerie, a chartucerie, or any other kind of –erie you like. The Batignolles Market was very expensive, but it is an organic market and I would expect to pay those same prices anywhere. The purpose was to buy supplies for a picnic at the Eiffel Tower, and if I did it again, I would buy those same supplies at any of the smaller stores that line Rue Brochant and Rue des Moines (and elsewhere?).Another thing? Coffee? Why don’t you move to America, please? Every single café makes the best coffee (café crème was the favorite), no matter where you stop. I would move to Paris solely to drink the coffee.Two more restaurants to recommend: Les 2 Coupoles on Ave de Clichy and Rue Fragonard, where we ate on Saturday. My MIL was talking to the wait staff and apparently the chef is from a 5 star hotel? You could tell because it was delicious – and I must say, we were a little nervous from the way three dogs were allowed to frolic freely in the interior, and it seemed like we were approaching the ‘dodgy’ end of Ave de Clichy. But we trusted the menu, and it was a fabulous meal for all of us. Sunday night’s dinner was at Le Moncey Restaurant and Brasserie on Boulevard des Batignolles, and again our magic formula of ‘walk until you see something good’ didn’t fail us. Another really spectacular dinner, every plate was wiped clean at the end. The only rub was we waited about an hour after we finished the meal for the check, I mean: clean plates, no more wine, just sitting there until someone came to check on us. Maybe we were supposed to take longer to eat?!Lunch on all days was stuff we picked up from the markets – bread, cheese, meat, and fruit , and Easter lunch was 4 little Cornish hens pre-roasted (with more bread and cheese and JAM, mmmm). Dee-licious. All breakfasts were coffee and a baguette in the ubiquitous cafes, it really didn’t matter where you went! We did frequent Le Libre Exchange and also Café le Vexin, but only because they were so close to us.See above for all ‘pro’s of the trip :) The only ‘con’ would be a really rude saleswoman in a Latin Quarter café who refused to serve us, for some reason that still befuddles us, maybe because we wanted take-away and it was sit down only.. no idea. This was the only time that the language barrier was a problem, every other time, a smile, 'bonjour', and a hacked attempt at high school French got a smile and an English response!Thank you Paris for your wonderful hospitality! We had a fabulous time, and I will definitely be back!"
50,“All about Paris!”,"My husband and I just recently went to Paris for one week. Although we've been before, this time we saw everything we wanted to see.Hotel: We stayed at the Waldorf Trocadero. In my opinion, great hotel. (Find my separate review for this hotel)Museum Pass: After much research, we bought the 4 day Paris Museum Pass which cost 50 euros each. We bought this at the airport so we did not have to line up at any of the museumes to buy this. If you intend on visiting to a lot of places and not really have your day's planned out, check out the pass. This pass entitles you to visit the ""big named"" museums and most of the time, you get to bypass the huge line ups. When your on vacation, its nice to not have to wait in line for too long! However, when you get to the museums, double check that you are waiting in the proper line to get in the museum. There are generally two separate lines. One is to buy tickets to get in and the other is the ""Museum Pass"" line or anyone with prepaid tickets.What to do: When your in Paris, you gotta see a few things. They are: Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Versailles, Effiel Tower, Montmarte (Sacre-Coeur), and Notre DameLouvre: Is huge, plan out what you want to see first then go find it. Suggestion: If your at the Louvre early, go see the Mona Lisa first thing. It only gets more crowded later on in the day. My husband and I were waiting at the doors before it even opened and basically bolted to go see it immediately once the doors opened. By the time we got to the painting, it was starting to get packed.Versaille: Do not miss your chance to go see this place. It takes ""Palace"" to a whole new level. It helps to bring a guide book, rent a tour guide or listen to an audio thing. We brought our Rick Steve's Paris book and its basically walked us through the entire place. Be warned, bring comfy shoes. There is a ton of walking, especially if you plan on going to the gardens and visiting the Marie Antoinette section.Overall: Lunch and dinner ""can"" be cheap or it can be super expensive if you don't know where to go. If your open to buying a baguette and walking around you can save your money for a nice dinner. There are good price fix menus in the Latin Quarter from 15 to 35 euros. In my opinion, this is a great place for food and atmosphere! Also, if your hotel has a fridge, their super markets are a great place to buy some extra snacks. Beer and wine are much cheaper here.Getting around - Subway (Carnet): Although we walked everywhere, we couldnt walk to certain places and the subway was our only means of transportation. Their subway system is incredible. Buy their Carnets - its cheaper than buying single tickets. My husband and I arrived in Paris at the airport and took the RER then Subway to get to our hotel. It was approximately 1.5 hours long but it was much cheaper then calling for a taxi. For the both of us, the subway ride from the airport to our hotel (in Trocadero) only cost 18 euros. (Thats for 2 people!). Mind you, if you have big luggage, be ready to truck them up and down some stairs.Enjoy your time in Paris! We certainly did!"
50,“The wonderful city bike system of Paris: Velib”,"Of all the things I did in Paris using the Velib bicycles was the most impressive.There are about 1200 stations (with 24.000 bikes) in Paris where you can take a bike and return it later at another station in the city.A week pass will cost you 5 Euros or so.The first half hour is for free, after that you pay 1 euro for the next half hour, then 2 Euros for another extra half hour. So, to keep it cheap use a bike only for an hour or so.Very handy is an Iphone with the app 'AllBikesNow'. If you arrive at your destination it will look up the closest Velib station and tell you how many free spots there are to park you bike. (For this you need to have data roaming on or find a Wi-Fi nearby).I've read some negative stories about Velib (overcharging) but so far we haven't had any bad experience with the Velib bikes.Tip: when you choose a bike be sure you're able to adjust the saddle height, sometimes it doesn't work.On the internet you can find more info: velib.paris.fr which is in French only. :-( or maybe better Wikipedia.I wish they had a bike system like this in Amsterdam, where I live. Would be very useful."
40,“Beware pickpockets/gypsies at ATMs and train-stations in france”,"Great vacation to Paris, France-***however, beware of pickpockets/gypsies at ATMs!!!***Was in the near the Opera house near Opera metro stop and went to a BNP Paribus bank ATM - was accosted by two small in stature pickpockets/gypsie boys. While withdrawing money from the machine, one put a white piece of paper in front of the machine, i pushed it out of the way but he was persistent, then another showed up to help his friend, they tried to press the buttons on the machine, while my wife and i fought them off - luckily they didnt get anything and some people stepped in to help us out, while they were being scolded on the sidewalk, they ignored the other people and gave blank stares. we just walked away after that.Some people say that they're arent any problems anymore, but this is the second time in two trips where i've encountered people like this in France."
40,“Paris by wheelchair”,"Last week I spent five days in Paris, using my wheelchair regularly for the first time. Here’s the situation: I have early-stage ALS, which means that with my cane I can walk short distances (25-40 feet) or climb one flight of stairs, but I tire easily. So my doctors and the local ALS association fitted me out with a lightweight collapsible wheelchair, with four six-inch wheels. Thus equipped, I flew to Paris with my wife, our daughter, and two granddaughters (twelve and thirteen), for a spring break adventure.Paris is not up to date with handicap accessibility. But there is some good news. People in general were helpful and considerate, opening doors and making way on crowded sidewalks. Many historic sites and museums were open to handicapped people at reduced prices, or even free of charge.I steered clear of the metro and city bus system. We used taxis, and the drivers were uniformly helpful – stowing the wheelchair in the trunk and helping me in and out of the cab when I needed a hand.We stayed at a small hotel near the Place de la Concorde, so many tourist sites were near-by – the Rue de Rivoli, the Louvre, the Madeleine – and others – the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Pompidou, the Champs Elysees – short cab rides away. The French have installed curb cuts, and there are some elevators and ramps available at major venues.The bad news is that signage is often confusing or non-existent. And the ubiquitous rough cobblestones and staircases create barriers, or at least major frustrations.Here are some examples, in no particular order:• At the Louvre we had no trouble reaching the Mona Lisa and many of the other great paintings, but gave up on trying to find our way (on wheels) to the Venus de Milo. We could see the Winged Victory from a balcony, but could not get near it.• At the Orsay and the Pompidou we persevered through a bewildering maze of ramps and elevators, finally visiting most of the marvelous moderns.• At Les Invalides, we made our way without difficulty into the cafeteria, but were thwarted at Napoleon’s Tomb by magnificent ceremonial staircases.• At the Galleries Lafayette (the flagship department store with several adjoining buildings) we had an amusing encounter with the fire-rescue squad, which appeared after a telephoned request to bring me down one flight of stairs with a people-mover.• Toilet facilities in restaurants or cafés are often one flight of stairs up or down.• Our little hotel had an elevator, as advertised, but we had to climb three steps to reach it, and it was so small that there was barely room for the folded chair and two riders.• The magnificent Sainte Chapelle is actually wheelchair accessible, but signage is lacking, so I climbed up a challenging circular staircase to reach it. When I arrived, an attendant recognized my plight and arranged for me to descend via an elevator in an adjoining building after I had viewed the spectacular stained glass.• At the Eiffel Tower, wheelchair people can go up to level two, but not all the way to the top.The most heart warming experience was a chance meeting with two French volunteers who had been working for years to have an elevator installed in the Madeleine. It opened only a few months ago, and they were delighted to find it in use by a rolling American. We talked about the difficulties of making historic building accessible, and I cheerfully signed their petition of support for the cause.Along the way I was happily dependent on my family members, who would scout out routes in advance and take turns pushing my wheelchair.Overall the city could use a good brochure (or website) with clear indications of what accessibility issues are being addressed. Much of that information is doubtless scattered across the Internet, but my college French was not good enough to make it reliably understandable. Whatever the challenges, Paris is still a magnificently attractive city. As far as I am concerned “I Love Paris” still applies.• GRM 4/6/11"
20,“*Be aware in Paris*”,"My mother and I arrived in Paris on April 1, 2011, and took the RER train into town to reach our hotel. It was the first visit for both of us to Paris. We were in the Metro Saint-Michel station, ascending an escalator, when we were approached by several young girls. One of them was holding a subway map and saying, ""Chatelet, Chatelet?"" She was pretending evidently that she and her friends were lost. While our attention was focused momentarily on the girl with the map, another of the girls went into my mother's bag and stole a smaller bag containing her wallet, passport, and medications (thank goodness, we were able to find reasonable substitutions for the meds). A few moments after reaching the top of the escalator, my mother realized she had been robbed. As I had seen the girls descend back to the lower subway area after reaching the top of the escalator, I ran back down after them, but of course to no avail. They were gone. When we went to the police station, we met a man from Canada who had been robbed at CDG Airport. We met an American woman who had been pickpocketed at one of the museums. I had heard of certain groups of people using children to commit crimes in European cities, but I thought the problem had been cleaned up a bit, because I had not heard of it happening in recent years. It still goes on, though, clearly. I am just posting this as a warning/reminder to those traveling to watch your belongings and who is around you at all times, even teen/preteen children. Thank you."
50,“Paris - Grey shuttle”,"My friends and I went to Paris this February and for transportion means we decided to use Grey shuttle. Extremely professional and polite driver, excellent service."
20,“Paris... will make your eyes water!”,"Felt totally ripped off in Paris, it's really expensive these days due mainly to £ / Euro. £5+ to get a coffee, and 56 Euros for 4 of us to get the hop on water bus.... We liked the place overall but were somewhat disturbed by the number of homeless and people with mental difficulties, particularly on the metro where on occasions we felt quite threatened. We loved the area around the Notre Dame, it was buzzing at night.I wouldn't rush back."
50,“The City Of Lights-Give it a chance :)”,"Not sure what to expect based on many reviews and experiences of Paris, we went with a lot of prejudices, at least my better half did...Our first experience in a restaurant was fantastic and friendly, then we bought some French jazz and a DVD we were looking for from another very friendly Parisian off Rue Mouffetard. And it didn't stop there, it was like each and every person knew what my husband heard about Paris and rolled out the red carpet! Our entire trip was marked by one great experience after another, by store personnel, boutique owners and restaurant owners.We did a couple of things that may have helped us blend, but I'm sure they are not new or mind blowing to any traveler on this board, we took French lessons for nine weeks before we went, and had a phrase book. We also pretty much dressed up, by American standards, everywhere we went. One singular thing sets French women apart and that is the scarf. They wear them much more than American women and if you buy one thing on the street, get a scarf. In any color or pattern a long scarf that can be artfully wrapped, turned every outfit into a pulled together ensemble.I don't know where the French get a smelly stigma from either...because on at least four occassions I wanted to stop a man or woman and ask what perfume or cologne they were wearing. Another great thing to bring back! I brought perfume back that still hasn't debuted in the US yet. And if you ride the subways during rush hour like we did, you'd notice, and I have to say, also a pleasant experience, as the Parisians were infinitely more courteous and gracious than London or New York by FAR.We also visited the museums as you can imagine they were packed with tourists. But I wasn't going to allow the crowds to ruin my enjoyment of Manet, Monet or Seurat. I had flown too far to let that happen. The Georges Pompidou was oustanding! Completely wonderful inside and out. We spent the better part of a day wandering through that bright airy museum.Of course we ate very well, and for very good prices, the restaraunts on Rue Moufettard that we stopped into were great, most being famed for fondue. I enjoyed every meal and for someone who cannot eat dairy very well in the US it was shocking and wonderful that nothing dairy in France upset my stomach. What a difference! Do we eat cheese in America? I felt like I had never had it before. I was even able to eat fondue and creme brulee... two things I have to skip in the US. One notable place we ate was called Pain Vin Fromage near the Georges Pompidou. Fabulous service and fabulous food, I will eat there every time we go.All in all we have such a fabulous time that it is now my number one favorite city.Go with a little French in your back pocket, a friendly attitude and a great pair of walking shoes.I promise that Paris will smile back :)"
50,“I'm in love with Paris!”,"I have never traveled to Europe so I was very nervous how I would fare in a country where I don't speak the language. None of the worries I had came to pass. Almost everyone we met or dealt with could speak enough English that we were able to communicate (okay-sometimes the meals we ordered were a surprise but it comes with the territory).All I can say is that the city is visually stimulating-the sights, the streets, the food, the hundreds of bistros and restaurants and even the chic hairstyles and clothes of the citizens.Absolute must- the Musee d' Orsay and Musee de l'Orangerie (where else will you see 2 rooms of Monet's panels of his gardens)! I'd easily pick those 2 museums over the Louvre. Also, eat at the restaurant (not the cafe) in the Musee d'Orsay. Get to Sainte- Chapelle before it opens because the security line takes a while. You will be stunned when you walk up the stairs to the chapel and see the windows for the first time. Notre Dame is beautiful but don't forget to walk around the side by the river and the back of the church. We stayed on both the right and on the left banks of Paris and preferred the Left Bank. We stayed at Le Pearl and loved it. It's on a very narrow street but full of nightlife. The whole area is full of restaurants and shops. ( Have a good map with you because it's easy to get lost) Luxembourg Gardens are 3 blocks away. Much to our delight we found a miniature of the Statue of Liberty. Also, the garden at the Rodin Museum is beautiful and has many of his statues surrounded by lovely gardens. Best of all, it was only 1 euro! Make sure you check what days museums are open and plan your trip accordingly. The best thing we did was buy a museum pass at the airport. You can bypass LONG lines with the pass. Also, ask the hotel staff to recommend places to eat. We had several good tips from desk clerks. All in all, the trip surpassed my expectations!"
50,“Montamarte and Moulin Rouge”,"I decided to write this review to clear up something about this part of Paris.I rented an apartment in Montmartre, 5 minutes from Moulin Rouge. Many people told me that wasn't such a good idea and that i should be very careful because that area is not very safe. That the only things i would find is sex shops and fast food places.Well, this is true for Boulevard de Clichy. Also, if you decide to walk around in that area, especially Boulevard Magenta near the train stations towards Boulevard Clichy you might regret it. That doesn't look like a safe area. Although nothing bad happened to us, i wouldn't risk going around that area again.But, going back to Montmartre. The apartment was near Rue Lepic, just 5 minutes north from Moulin Rouge. Rue Lepic has lots of supermarkets, small shops, even a rotisserie, cafes, restaurants, a flower shop. Exactly like I imagined a street in Montmartre.Place du Tertre and Sacre Coeur are 10 minutes away (by foot).And it was pretty cheap: 84 euros/person/3 nights"
20,"“PARIS...! Touristy, Expensive, Fake & Unsafe.”","We just returned from our Europe trip and spent 3 days in Paris in the month of March 2011.We always wanted to come to Paris as it is on every tourist and travellers wish list. The place itself is beautiful with so many tourist attractions,the obivious ones being the Eiffel Tower , Louvre(with the Mona Lisa), Arc de Triomphe ,Latin Quarter , the lovely public gardens(though stay away from the grass as some places it´s banned) and ofcourse the Montmartre / Sacré Coeur and the last the glamorous Champs Elysées shopping spine with the best flagship stores and where Maddona and likes shop and stay with hotel rates shooting up to 4000 Euros a night.Said that, the city itself ,lacks a warmth that such a place ought to have, by that I mean the people. The city is a mix of people and it seems a bit unsafe with lotsa street vendors who look like holligans and the alleys in the evening start takinga deserted look. Above that the city is known for being notorious as many muggers prowl in the night looking for easy prey.If that was not enough the French natives have this stupid thing against English speaking people and they are sometimes really rude. We personally faced one or two incidents where the Information counter guy spoke so rudely just because we did not speak French,for heavens sake if you could learn French in 3 days then all babies would have said ´Merci´as the first word when they were born.The French need to understand that no one wants to steal their language,we have enough to struggle with already,please! If they are so rude,they should understand that most of thier money is coming through tourists who come to their expensive museums and attractions. Grow up fellas.Overall , if you wanna go there once and see the places and attractions just head off without a thought but keep it short and choose your placve of stay in a decent place and learn some phrases in french...Gosh!.. Bon Voyage!"
50,“Great city!!”,"I was in Parisfor only one day. I have never seen a bigger city than that. I can assure you, it is one of the beautiful cities in the world. Nice parks, gardens and locations to visit. Go and check it out yourselves. Remember to take a day and cover the city by walking. You will never forget!"
30,“Advisory: Credit Cards and Sim Chips Needed.”,"In early February 2011 we were in Paris and environs and encountered a credit card problem not related to our accounts.The French Post Office and The Tourist Office of Lille France plus a one-star restaurant in Lille could not accept any of our credit cards (HSBC/MasterCard, Capitol One, Amex, DC, Visa) because our cards did not have a ""sim chip"" encripted in or on the cards.Perhaps someone knows how prevalent this is becoming?Our calls to the credit card companies indicated they are aware of this problem, but apparently the cost of converting the cards is very expensive and it appears we will not see such an addition any time soon. Meanwhile, if not near an ATM one might want to have a stash of cash on hand. We did not encounter any problem at leading places in Paris except the French Post Office! (so far)."
40,“Never Get Tired Of It!”,"This past weekend made it my seventh time going to the City of Lights, and I don't think I ever get tired of it. Each time I go, it has something different to offer. I'm a big advocate of just hopping onto the metro and getting off at some random spot to see what's around there.Of course, you have to do the usual attractions because you can't say that you've been to Paris without doing them. The Eiffel Tower is definitely one of them, along with the Louvre and Notre Dame. One piece of advice is to do Notre Dame early in the morning (say around 0830 to 0930). No one is there yet, and you can definitely take your time. If you're in luck, the choir may be practicing! Eiffel Tower is really good to do anytime of the day, but beware of the lines. The Louvre can be an all day event if you are a big art person, or it can be an hour thing if you're the kind that just wants to see the Mona Lisa and get outta there.There is so much to see in Paris, and enough variety to suit any palette. If you are a big history buff and enjoy anything Napoleon or Revolution, I would recommend going to the Pantheon and the Hotel d' Invalides. I don't remember the exact price, but I remember thinking they both were kind of pricey. However, the tickets at the Hotel gets you into the Military Museum as well as in to where Napoleon is buried. The Pantheon is fantastic because of who is buried there: Dumas and the Curies are just a couple of them.If you are a big art fan, don't forget to hit up the Musee d' Orsay, which is housed in an old train station. It has a wonderful collection that concentrates on the Impressionist Era from the 1890s through early 20th century. When you are done there, make your way up to Montmartre where many of those artists lived and painted at. Montmartre is still a very artistic area, and there are a few ""hidden gem"" stores up there.If you just want to kick back, relax, and sip a coffee while reading a book, go anywhere in the Latin Quarter or up to Montmartre. These are the areas that many students hang out at, and these areas aren't completely swarming with tourists all the time. If you go when the weather is nice, the Tulieries, Luxembourg Gardens, and the park by the Eiffel Tower are nice places to relax as well. Of the three, Luxembourg Gardens aren't crowded and aren't swamped with tourists.The Eiffel Tower is a great view of the city, but I prefer two other places that have, in my opinion, even better views. For a truly unique view, make your way to the Arc d' Triomphe at the end of the Champ d Elysee. When you climb to the very top, you see how the main boulevards of the city make a star pattern. It also is a great view of the Tower. I climbed the arc in December and didn't have to wait in line. I was going to do it again this past weekend (Valentine's Day weekend) and it was a pretty long line. Try and go when its starting to get dark so you can see the city start to light up. If you want a unique climbing experience with spectacular views, go to the Sacre Cour in Montmartre. Set on the highest point of Paris, the Sacre Coure looks out over the entire city. If you don't feel like climbing the stairs up to the basilica, there is a sort of tram/elevator to the left of the stairs, as well as a little train car that goes up the long way around the neighborhood. The entrance is down at the crypt on the left hand side of the basilica. You think you are going to go into the crypt, buy you end up going through the tower, across the roof, up another tower, and go down into the crypt on the other side. Out of all the places to get a view of the city, the Sacre Cour was the cheapest at five euros. However, it is also the only one that doesn't really have actual hours, so its open whenever they feel like opening it.Even though I have been to Paris as much as I have, I really don't have any recommendations as to places to go and sit down to have a meal. I'm a big fan of going to the stands and buying a crepe or a sandwich to eat while I'm walking around. If you are looking for places that are reasonable, stick to the area around the Opera or up in the neighborhood of Montmartre. Food gets more expensive the closer you get to the Eiffel Tower.Learn the metro system!!!!!! Its the fastest and easiest way to get around the city, and its also cheap. The whole system is color-coded and it tells you where each stop is. I suggest picking up a metro map at any of the stops to help make things a little easier for planning your day. However, be careful when the metro is crowded: Pick Pockets work the croweded cars!!!!!! I personally have not had anything stolen, but my backpack was opened twice during rush hour this Valentine's Day weekend. I also had a friend who had all her euro stolen out of her zipped up pocket in the front of her jacket. So don't put anything in your pockets or backpacks that you really want to keep! As long as you keep your hands over the zippers, you should be fine.There have only been two places that I have been disappointed with and they are the Moulin Rouge and the Champ d' Elysee. All the Moulin Rouge is is a theater with a red wind mill on top of it. I had thought about picking tickets up to go and see the show, but a basic package was 100 euros per person. I didn't think it was worth spending that kind of money on a topless caberet. You can do that in Amsterdam or Vegas for a lot cheaper. The Champ d' Elysee was dissapointing because the shopping is ridiculously expensive and you can get the same things in other parts of the city. If you really want to do some shopping, go to the area around the Opera. Its much more reasonable and you can get the same designers.Beware of the scam artists!!!!! They are extremely aggressive here and will constantly hound you if you acknowledge them. They are really big in trying to put stuff into your hands and then saying you have to give them money because they ""found"" it for you. They also ask you if you speak English, then will make you read a sign asking you for money. If you acknowledge them they will follow you. So if someone puts something in your hand, drop it and run away like it has the plague. And, if someone wants you to read a sign, ignore them!!!!!! If you get one that follows you, it is real easy to find a police officer anywhere in Paris, and the scam artist will stop.Don't let the last paragraph scare you away from such a wonderful city. Every city has a seedy side to it, and Paris is no exception. Just stay aware of your surroundings, and you will be fine and have the time of your life. Like I said at the beginning, I have been to Paris seven times and I plan to go at least one more time this year, and I have had no personal problems here. Be smart, but have a blast!!!!!!!!!!"
20,“Just in Case”,"Just in Case fellow travellers like myself don't come across certain information that would be handy a few things we came across that might be helpful to others. Shops are closed on a Sunday altho street markets that sell fruit.veg etc are open. For bigger women like myself (size 14/16) tables in restaurants are compact + very close together, just relax + have a nice dinner, then try figure out how your going to get out from behind the table!!"
50,"“Paris, France”",Not really too much to say about Paris. Except it is worth the money to go there and learn a bit of the language before you go. If you have to skip two or three vacations to go it is worth it. I've been there several times and can help you save money and advise a lot about different things. We plan on going this year.
50,“I Love Paris”,"Everyone should visit Paris at least once in their lifetime. It truly is life altering. It is the most beautiful city I have ever seen. From the moment you first step onto the street you are transformed. The Eiffel Tower, the River Seine, the architecture - it is all so amazing. We have been twice now and each time we go it is harder for me to leave. There is so much to do and see you really need more than a month there to take it all in. The Eiffel Tower at night is breathtaking - especiallly when, at the top of the hour, the lights twinkle and she looks like a huge sparkling diamond. Love it!"
50,“My favorite tour agency is Anderson tours”,"Our group traveled to Paris and loved it! The city is full of light and nice for shopping. Sephora is gorgeous! We scheduled walking tours with Andreson tours and our guide, Gary, was perfect. We visited totally hidden places, like the narrowest street in Paris. So cool!"
50,“Use mass transit and take advantage of bathrooms in Starbucks and McDonalds”,"We had a great time in Paris during Christmas week. The city was beautiful that time of the year with a huge Christmas market down the Champs-Elysees and all the trees lining the street lit up. The food at the stalls were pretty good. We also found a sandwich chain called Class'Croute with shops throughout Paris. The sandwiches were good and reasonably priced. Dinner at restaurants recommended in TripAdvisor were right on. Parisians eat dinner late. Most restaurants away from the tourist attractions didn't even open up until after 7 p.m.If you visit Paris, you have to make use of their mass transit system. Getting to and from the airport and around the city and to the various attractions was very easy, avoiding traffic jams that seemed to be at most major tourist sites. Trains can get very crowded but don't hesitate to wait for the next train because they operate that frequently. Do beware of pickpockets when the trains are crowded. Also, make sure you carry your validated train ticket with you. The police did random checks to make sure you paid your fare. The ticket vending machines are also in English. Most sites are within zones 1 to 3 but the airports and Versaille are in zones 5 so buy your tickets accordingly. We made great use of the Paris Visite tickets that come in 1, 2, 3 and 5 day versions. You can buy tickets for zones 1 to 3, or 1 to 6. We did 1 to 6 for two days to account for the trip from the aiport and going to Versaille, otherwise zones 1 to 3 is enough.I would recommend you take advantage of a free walking tour, Sandemans New Paris Tours, early in your visit to get your bearings. They operate on tips and most people gave at least 10 euros per person. Jenny was our tour guide and she was very good. The free tour is about 3 1/2 hours long and starts from St. Michel.As you explore Paris, we found that unless you were at a museum, public bathrooms were not that abundant so map out your Starbucks and McDonalds. There were a few occasions where we followed signs for public bathrooms only to be either unable to find them where they were supposed to be, or to find them closed.At most major tourist attractions, to avoid lines, buy your tickets in advance."
50,“Paris is a truly amazing city”,"What a place, the history, architecture and culture is wonderful. So many sites to see, one more amazing then the next. A must see if you are going to visit the great cities of the world."

50,“Paris; the city of Romance and the Louvre”,To me Paris is two things: romance and the Louvre. Romance seems to permeate the city. A walk along the Seine at night. A view of the Eiffel Tower. A view of the city from Sacré Coeur in Montmartre. Or nice romantic dinner in some small side street near Moulin Rouge. If you want to spend a romantic weekend with someone then Paris is the right place.To especially appreciate Paris you need to have a wonderful view of the city. Here is a list of places with the best views of Paris1. Sacré Coeur in Montmartre2. Notre Dame’s tower3. Commanding views from the Tour Montparnasse (skyscraper in Paris)4. Arc de TriompheNow I do not need to explain in much detail the importance of the Louvre. Only the most important art museum in the world. I can spend days there. You need to be selective when visiting the LouvreRemember two things though when visiting Paris. There are long lines to climb the Eiffel Tower and to get into the Louvre. Plan accordingly.Also do not forget to visit Versailles when you visit Paris. No trip to Paris is complete without visiting it.
30,"“Paris Trip: Money, Attractions, Shopping, Cleanliness!”","I visited Paris on October 30th 2010 adn stayed for 3 days. I know that the time was not enough to see Paris and everyday we came up with something new. But I think as an experienece traveller I can share some useful tips that I needed before my trip.We stayed at Grand Francais Hotel. The hotel was great. It was small but well decorated. The hotel staff was helpful and nice. Considering that Paris is expensive city, I believe the hotel was a great value and good location. we walked every morning from hotel to the major tourist locations like Notre Dame. The first day we arrived in Paris we left our staff at the hotel. (Chek in time is 1400 so we had some time as we arrived at 0900) We left to have some breakfast and as we were walking I was immediately dissapointed by the dirty city. I heard that it was dirty but I was not expecting that much. In the Bastille square we had a breakfast. It was a very nice moment with nice weather and good breakfast but of course with a price. We paid 55 Euros for 2 people. I think it is a bit too much for breakfast (Tomato Omlet with salad, capucino, fries and fresh orange juice)The Eiffel Tower: the line is huge. I would wait for the evening. it was a bit shorter. for the Eiffel you pay 4.50 euro if you stop at the fisrt level and 13 euro if you want to go to the top. I would definitely recommend the first stop. It was beautiful and you can view the whole city. in order to continue to the second elevator wich goes to the top you have get off from the first one and there is also another huge waiting line. It's not worth it as you can not go outside to a balcony on the top. It is all covered with glass. I loved the first stop as we went outside, see the city, see the tower light up. In total it took us 3.5 hrs to visit the tower. definitely get some snacks with you.As you exit the eiffel you will need to go to the washroom. very dirty. definitely get a water bottle and lots of toilet paper with you. They were dirty.on the way back to our hotel we had dinner at Alfio. Excellent food and wine. We paid 35 euros for two.second day we rented the city bicycle. only 1.5 euro per day but you have to check in every 30 min. they are everywhere in the city so no problem with finding them. You need a credit card though as you rent them from a machine. but be very careful with the drivers. they dont care much.Notre Dame: definitely woth to see it. again if you want to go up to the tower the line is too long. I loved the inside of Notre Dame better.definitely walk along the Seine River. I know people are recommending the Batobus which is a cruise that goes from Eiffel to Champs-Elysees, but I would definitely recommend the walking along the river in the morning. You will see more.we had lunch in the city close to Notre Dame. You will love the streets full of restaurants and cafes. dont waste your time in the lines waiting for towers, enjoy the city, food and the culture.Shopping was not in my list in Paris. Unfortunately I found them a bit rude and not welcoming. I am not a type who goes around asks prices and tries a lot and not buy anything but they acted as if they do not want any tourists. Plus it was more expensive than any other city in Europe.I hope this helps a little...Enjoy your time. It does not matter where you are as long as you know how to have fun!"
50,“Dining in Paris”,"Nine days of dining in Paris has led me to believe that you ""can't"" find a bad meal unless you prepared it. Three meals a days in and around the 7eme left us breathless. Exceptional food and service, in and around the Rue Cler area amazed us in both brasseries and cafes.There were just too many to name. Paris is the dining capitol of the world."
30,"“paris, beautiful, romantic but still need to be aware”","Paris, one of the most gorgeous cities in the world, just a few tips to make you aware. Our taxi driver TOTALLY ripped us off as he went all around our hotels' location in circles. Our hotel was located on a major thoroughfare. I had to speak to him forcefully in french to stop and let us out immediately which he did. We then phoned a friend our street location and they came and took us to our hotel. One member of our party had his wallet stolen via a pick pocket. Many of the tourist spots have signs to warn visitors. The U.S. State Department web site has excellent tips to stay safe. Like anywhere, you must be vigilant. I will write this, the vast majority of Parisians we encountered were friendly, helpful and pleasant."
40,“Loads of stuff to see”,"I was sick with a very bad cold when I visited Paris, but very glad I went anyway.I hired a driver for two 5 hour days and it was well worth it. He described things we saw while he was taking me from one site to the next. He went with me to some things and dropped me off so I could tour others by myself.Must see things: The Louvre as well as the gardens behind it, the Arch de Triumph, Mont Marte (not sure of the spelling) - this is the artists section up on a hill, Notre Dame, The Opera House, The Christmas Lights (if they are up during your visit), the Eiffel Tower, Rodin's Museum, Christina's for chocolate, desert anywhere in Paris."
30,“Defitinely visit atleast once in your life”,"My trip to Paris was for my 25th birthday. Me nor any of my friends had been here yet. We drove from Germany and upon entering the heart of the city were quickly exposed to there frantic style of driving. After getting settled at our hotel in the Opera district we went out for drinks and had many options to choose from. We toured the Louvre, Eiffel Tower (at night), and Notre Dame, all of which were stunning. I found it fairly simple to get around the city and for the most part the people seemed very friendly. I will say however that the amount of liter and filth on the streets and sidewalk really took away from the beautiful architecture. I highly recommend visiting the Sacré-Cœur Basilica where the views were breathtaking. I plan on visiting the city again to see less of the tourist attractions and more of the locals scene."
40,“A Paris to remember”,"My DH and I just returned from a five week vacation to France-(Sept-Oct 2010). We chose to travel this time of year to avoid crowds and the heat. These are our observations and thoughts. We spent the first week in Paris, then rented a vehicle and travelled in Provence for the remainder of the holiday. We are French Canadians matured travellers, therefore had no issues with the language.The people: For the most part, the French were very warm and welcoming. They quickly recognised our Canadian accent and immediately engaged in conversation with us. We discussed everything from local customs to politics, economy, travels, similarities and differences of our respective countries. They all had a good sense of humour and seemed somewhat content with their lives. (Hey, every country has problems...) We did have good laughs with several locals- all in good fun. The only times we encountered abruptness were mostly in some Parisian restaurants. The waiters rush, take orders, don’t smile and have no time whatsoever to chit chat with customers (unlike where we live—In Paris time is money...).Customs: We did have somewhat of a difficult time adjusting to eating schedules: petit dejeuner (8am-10am), dejeuner (12h—2pm) and dinner (7pm-10pm), restaurants being closed between those times. We quickly learned not to walk in a restaurant at 10am expecting a bacon and eggs breakfast-not going to happen. There were however patisseries everywhere selling croissants (all types ), sandwiches, submarines, quiches and the likes all day long. It was amazing to watch everyone at noon eating large meals and drinking wines- lots of wine ( to return to work afterwards...). We got hooked on cafes au lait- so good and expensive though. Our dinner outings were always positive-very good food at reasonable prices.Driving: Driving in France (particularly in Paris) was a challenge. (We would not recommend driving in this city, subway is the way to go as parking is extremely rare and expensive). Street signs are located on buildings, therefore difficult to see. Traffic lights are situated on stop corners (instead of ahead so as to see better). Very difficult to see- had to back up several feet and look uncomfortably up. Paris streets all take off from Roundabouts, something very new to us. We recognised the plus and minuses of this system after a while- had to get used to them. Very few lights in rural France- roundabouts everywhere. Directions signs took a while to read and understand, awkwardly pointing in bizarre directions. Our advice: Take your time, go around and around (roundabouts), get a GPS or a good map, stop and ask for directions, do your best to adapt and laugh a lot at the driving experience. Although rural roads are scenic and slow (relaxed), you do get a sense of local flavour driving through small, quaint and quiet towns. However, if you wish to get to a destination in shorter time, the best and quickest way is to use the toll freeways. The roads are excellent, uncongested, speed is 130 km/hr (75mph).Our visits: (Personal opinions)Paris: We loved this city of lights. It is beautiful, romantic, historic and lively (quite noisy). We used Rick Steve’s Paris guide book to organise our week in this city. We followed his suggested area day tours which worked very well. Our favourite experiences included the Eiffel Tower (and dinner at a restaurant on the Seine by the tower- reasonable prices and a view of the tower lit up at night) -(We reserved our Eiffel Tower pass online, thus avoiding queues), Pere Lachaise cemetery and the Latin Quarter (quaint streets filled with boutiques and cafes, lots of cafes). We spent a few hours at The Louvre (enter through the Caroussel Mall-much faster). The only crowded room was the Mona Lisa area- difficult to approach. You can spend days in this museum. We walked an average of 7 hours each day and filled our days with unforgettable experiences. Other sites are too numerous to list but all worth time to explore. Check the top attractions. We used the subway the entire week ( buy the carnet 10$) – the only way to go. Others prefer the bus system- we tried it a couple of times and it was quite slow. Real estate is hugely expensive in this city. How can the locals afford such prices??? Weather -3rd week of Sept was sunny and warm 23oC.The route from Paris to Nantes via Orleans is very picturesque- all along the Loire- many castles and troglodytes villages ( homes built in mountainsides)—Just amazing.Nantes: Beautiful city with lots of history and heritage sites. Worth at least two days to visit. Check the city website. (We suggest this as we cannot do justice to all there is to see and do there).Poitou area: Lots of vineyards and wineries. Beautiful area and lots of old, little and quiet towns. Poitiers is definitely worth a visit- fortress and several other historic buildings - difficult to find parking.Cognac is a lovely town bordering a river. This is the home of famous Cognac breweries.La Rochelle: This town seems to bring us back in time when the merchant fleets replenished for their long ocean voyages. The city is beautiful with restaurants along the port, several medieval buildings and tons of history. We loved this city- even in the rain.Rocamadour: Probably our favourite destination: The entire city is built along (and in ) a rocky cliff- towered by a castle. This is a pilgrimage destination, and receives millions of visitors each year. We were happy to be there in early Oct- quieter. (Stayed at Les Esclargies Hotel 4*-walking distance to the city). Please check the website...St Emilion: A gorgeous medieval city in the center of wine country. Well worth a day visit. We loved this town. Check its website. Several lovely Chateaux B&B’s nearby.Biarritz: South West town by Spanish border. What a lovely seaside city- larger than we thought. Beautiful to visit on foot. The views are amazing. (Stayed at Le Grand Large 3*- wonderful hotel with a view and close to everything).San Sebastian (Spain): Very beautiful resort city in all its authentic Spanish splendour. Worth a 2-3 days visit to truly appreciate its beauty, history and the beach. (It was rather cold in mid Oct). No custom stop from France to Spain.Montpellier: A very large and beautiful university town. Quaint streets, tons of cafes/restaurants, the largest town square and amazing shopping mall, boutiques and historic sites. Well worth a couple of days to visit. Easy access to downtown by tram.Sete: Set a day aside to visit this seaside town. Indescribable gem situated on the ocean 25 minutes south of Montpellier. Would be an ideal summer or long term vacation area. 3rd week of Oct-weather was windy and cold, 13oC.This resumes the destinations of our vacations. We enjoyed all of them, wouldn’t change a thing-except to travel in the earlier part of September as to have warmer weather. We are so very happy to have visited this country and interacted with the people. Wonderful vacation!OH PARIS !!!!!"
50,“Paris - the most beautiful city in the world”,"I would like to dedicate this tripadvisor evaluation to the city of Paris and its beautiful characteristics. There is only a few cities around the world that offer what I would describe as a generally amazing place. A written guide (booklet) can of course provide an insight to a city and highlight places which should be seen but simply walking around aimlessly in Paris and absorbing the vibe, the culture of the inhabitants, the language, the pride, etc...is something everyone should have done at least once in their life. I strongly recommend the 3rd arrondissement as a starting point."
50,“So much to do in Paris”,"My husband and I are in our middle fifties and recently returned from a 10 day trip to Paris. What an amazing city it is. It is never ending the things you can do every day and getting around on there Metro and RER systems was a breeze. The people were fantastic and very warming to us. The food, the cheese and the wine was the best ever. It has it all. It's so romantic you never want to sleep and end the day. I would recommend a vacation here if you like culture, history, romance, great food and wine, friendly people, great shopping and non stop action this is the place to be. We fell in love all over again in Paris."
50,“Mind blowing experience”,"Whatever place on earth you call home, Paris has been and still is a favourite destination.I'm listening to Aznavour's La boheme as I'm writing this; it sort of fits . This September,in lieu of our silver wedding anniversary, my husband and I explored Paris our own way :-a thorough research before leaving, including most Trip Advisor reviews about Paris;- a very conveniently situated self catering studio rented via an excellent emerging agency Glamour Apartments;- well planned sightseeing walks with a two hour siesta at noon to recharge our bodily and digital batteries ( there is so much beauty in Paris that any memory card needs downloading twice daily);- the first week in September was the perfect weather for walking.The highlights of this visit include: a classical concert at sunset in La Saint Chapelle, discovering Paris fountains and waterways,having our cutout portraits done by a genial "" silhouettiste "", Alex.Paris is the experience of a lifetime, enjoy it!Katie,56."
50,“France without fear”,"We've been in Paris for three weeks now. All talk of problems with the strikes are vastly overblown, and we feel well-protected at large venues. What a wonderful city to walk about and experience."
50,“My amazing Paris !!!”,"Paris is chic,enchanting and romantic !!!I was so deeply impressed by that city,that i can hardly put into words what i think of it !I had a wonderful time!"
50,"“inexhaustible, still inexhaustible”","however frequently you go to paris there is always something new to delight you even if it is only new to you. au cloche des halles, rue des coquillieres , provided the most exquisite onion tarte at a reasonable price in a really pleasant intimate environment, we went to verlet the posh coffee and tea supplier between louvre and opera, and had a lovely quiet experience , bringing home some great beans. on the way back to the hotel we discovered the hidden (to us) grounds and fountain of the grand palais. the restaurants in the louvre provided the worst food i have ever had the timidity to pay for, i suspect the staff are demoralised over the cuts. three steps forward, one back.you may know all this stuff already, but we did it for the first time with a three month old baby, and somehow the magic was just the same as when we had been courting."
40,“Lovely City”,"Spent four days in paris, got cheap flights and accomodation stayed up in Rue de Provence behid Lafayette S.C. really good location but very basic hotel, borderline hostel but it was fine for the money that we paid but I defo would not pay any were near the 155 tariff that they said they usually get a night..Paris is a city with so much to see and it can all be done in four days, you come home exhausted but it was great, the downside and it really is something which could be stopped in the morning, the cig butts line the streets of Paris and it spoils the apperance of such a fine place. Could the please put up cig trays so that people can stop and put there cigs into.Highy recommend a vist, bring plenty of money and be weary about 'sitting' down to eat they only display take away prices, it can easily double...."
50,“Paris in the Fall”,"My husband and I celebrated our 20th anniversary in Paris in late Sept - early Oct. What a wonderful trip... Paris is truly the City of Light and also Romance!!The Fall weather was blustery and rainy so we had to cuddle up under my mini sized travel umbrella alot. On a rainy day the Louvre Museum is a great way to while away the day staying dry in the midst of incredible painting and scuplture.On a clear day we visited the Sacre Couer Basilica (Sacred Heart Cathedral). It is a splendid all white stone cathedral and we took the walking tour of the towers giving a 360 view of the surrounding Monmarte district. Tre bien!!Takashi Murakami had an exhibit of large scale sculpture at Versailles when we were there. He is one of our favorite contemporary artists from Japan so it was incredible to see his bright shiny pop art styles juxtaposed with the Rocco décor and historical stone sculpture, a real treat! It's up through Dec 12th, not to be missed.Paris J'Taime!"
50,“Enchanting Paris”,"Visited Paris October 7th-13th 2009 - I was apprehensive to go after several people told me how rude the French people were and how dirty the city was. NOT so! I have nothing but wonderful memories about the lovely French people. They are polite and were very helpful if anyone noticed that my husband and I looked lost. The city is lovely. I adore the small stores, the parks with families and the streedside cafes. Our hotel was great. The Hotel Grand Francais in the Nations area. Nice and and very affordable. If I had more time left in my life I would go back. Go to Paris!"
50,“Charming”,"For me Paris is a city of great flavour, atmosphere and people. All buildings are so charming and beautiful. Lots of parks, trees and these lovely street lamps make this place completely unique. Transport in French capital is very easy and accessible. There are 16 lines of underground and 5 lines of RER which allow us to get for example to Disneyland. There are 2 main airports: Orly and Charles-de-Gaulle. Beauvais is a bit far, but low cost carriers like: Wizzair and Ryanair fly there.I enjoy Paris each time I there."
50,“Romantic around”,"Paris, a fabulous city with wonderful people. The excursion was a bus, managed to visit several cities in France: The State of Monaco, per unit, Cannes, Versailles, etc. .. Paris looks like a white, clean the ship sailing into the blue sky. Visited the Louvre, the great! Independently sezdil on metro to the Eiffel Tower. Climbed the Eiffel Tower. In 22 hours the entire tower began to sparkle, from the top is very beautiful. Do you like the Montmartre, in a large beautiful icons, check out this very nicely. Paris attracts. In 2009 again visited Paris. Wandered around the city, visited the wax museum, an impressive ... Paris, nice city, quietly opened with new diamond facets. Every time visiting Paris learn something new ... original. About Paris can talk endlessly ... Guides in 2008 were very good, and in 2009 not very much, as lucky. In Paris must still go."
50,“My Paris trip”,"I have just returned from USA, and arrived at Paris Appartment, this appartments are specially for Tourist, and well equipped and magnificent and I have never experienced such incredible system before.They provided all necessary things in the appartment. The appartment which they have alloted me was Effile tower facing. Here I must mentioned in French they call ""tour effiel"" pronounced ""tourafil"" .Anyways view from my appartment window was awesome, I can see Effil tower and River Siene. this river passing through centre of Paris city.I found perician are very busy in their life but also cool and co-operative, You will surely face problem many places if you dont know little french word. I would suggest to learn few word of French so that would be easier for you to travel within the city.Transportation in paris city is very easy and fast excess. You can have one temporary travelling pass and get excess to Metro train, city bus and bicycle.Weather was so nice and Street were very clean, I appreciate perisian traffic sense.Shopkeeper were very helpfull and always ready to for demostration of their profuct.I love Area like Saint Micheal and Chatele.If you wanna do your shopping you must go to Chatele area and i prefere to walk to enjoy paris.Overall, I would say... Once you have visited Paris, every time Paris will be your first choice.-Asif VOHRA"
50,“Paris”,"We loved Paris, the sub way system is fantastic, we traveled the entire city of the sub ways."
30,“The other side of Paris”,"Although Paris is a beautiful city I feel it is overrated. I traveled to Paris July of 2010 with my husband and granddaughter we had high expectations. Yes, the museums are amazing, and there are many beautiful buildings however if you travel outside of the center of the city to where the real people live you find a lot of cramped apartments, dirty streets and many immigrants living at poverty level. The city is expensive for travelers, a three star hotel is really a one star by our standards in the US.We had a terrible time with bedbugs , which I had never experienced before and I pray never will again. We found the locals to be cold snobs , not to glad to have American visitors or our dollars. We really have to do something about the value of the dollar!We used the public transportation system which is fabulous if you can get someone to help you. The bus drivers where rude and unwilling to help even in the heart of the tourist areas.The food is good but the portions are very small and again terribly expensive. The service at most restaurants was miserable by our standards.however the hot chocolate was amazing.Watch out for the pick pockets at most tourist destinations.I guess everyone has to see Paris at least once in their lifetime. I certainly will never return. There are so many other places to see and visit . Some of of my favorite places in Europe are Gibraltar, Venice, in the USA , Alaska and San Francisco, and in Canada, Toronto."
40,“travelling alone to france”,i was much suprised how well i got along even though i didnt know the language and it seemed that not many people there seemed to speak english. but i was treated well and i had a great time touring the city
50,“Ohh Paris!!!!!!!”,"This past Spring, a few friends and I took a side trip while visiting the UK to head to Paris, France. It was amazing! The sights, the restaurants and the peopel were all amazing! My favorite part of the trip was going to the Moulin Rouge show. That is an absolute must, as well as going to all the big attractions. One tip, if you are going to the Eiffel Tower at night make sure you go before midnight. At midnight they turn the lights off. We had just settled to take our pictures over the bridge when all the lights went out. It was not funny at the time. Also try going on to the side streets in the less touristy areas for great restaurants finds."
50,"“""Girls Only""”","I had the opportunity to visit Paris, France with my sister and our 5 daughters this past May. We were there for ten days and could have easily stayed another week. It is just like all the pictures you see with the beautiful little streets lined with ornate apartment buildings covered with flower boxes and rod iron rails. I loved the little flower shops, bakeries and fresh markets on every corner. It is very clean and organized. It was very easy to get around. The subway system there is AMAZING. We had a fabulous little all zone transportation pass which allowed us to ride the big RER train in and out of the city to our condo at the disney resort, and back and forth to the airport. We could also use the public buses and the many subway lines all over the city. The many museums and churches were were able to see were beautiful, old and very ornate. My favorite activity was climbing the 422 steps to the top or Notre Dame where you were able to view all of paris from every direction. I hope to be able to return someday and see the many things we did not get a chance to visit, and just to walk the beautiful steets for a few more days..."
50,"“Paris, via river cruise to Normandy”","It was our second visit to Paris and hope to go back many more times. August is definitely the month to go because most of the Parisians are gone on their vacations and the traffic is greatly reduced which makes for an easier and more leisurely visit. The Metro is very easy to use. Knowing just a little French helps. Just by saying bonjour brings a smile most of the time. Since Paris is broken up into arrondisements or areas it is easiest to visit a few at a time. There are so many quaint nieghborhoods, parks, and cafes. So much amazing history and architecture! I highly recommend a trip to Paris! From Paris we traveled the Seine to the Normandy Beaches on a river cruise. Loved every minute. Each morning the scenery had changed and we were in a new town or city.Happy travels!"
50,“Paris for a Month”,I lived in Paris for a month while attending a language school. It is a wonderful lively city with lots to see and do! Buy some comfy shoes and plan on walking a ton - because you can walk between almost all the big monuments. Plan on spending a great deal of time and money on food - it's sooo worth it! Paris is the food capitol of the world and once I ate there for a month I understood why.
50,“Impeccable”,"I travelled to Paris in August recently and it was so amazing, every square inch of the city is so incredibly designed and crafted. Its sets such a romantic atmosphere, that I felt even though I travelled solo on this one.I stayed in an area called the Marais which was really beautiful. Some amazing shops and places to see and to eat. Not to mention it was fantastic in terms of accessing the rest of the city. Near the Line 1 of the metro gave me access to so many places in including the lourve, the tuillerie gardens, place de la concorde, the arc de triomphe and La Defence.The metro was a great way to see the city and for a great price too. I bought a 5 day pass for 50.00 which they call Paris Visite and I felt great value for money in buying this.One of the things you will do in Paris is a lot of walking despite the good transport be prepared for a lot of walking. One could spend hours walking along the Seine not a care in the world.The Lourve was great. Such a grand designed structure, even whilst queuing for it under the magnificent but baking sun, one can really take pleasure in the architecture of old times that represents the main construct of the museum full of statues and turrets, then there is also the fountains and glass pyramid that show off the splendor of modern architecture as well. Then the interior is sight for sore eyes, you could spend a full day marvelling at all the fabulous pieces of art. Albeit being a magnificent work of art, the Lourve was not the most beautiful piece of work in the place and I challenge and encourage each Paris visitor to find your own favorite lourve art.Another museum that is a must is the musee de orsay. Houses some of the most astonishing works including Van Gogh is one of the most amazing collection as well as stunningly beautiful works I have ever seen.The Eiffel Tower was fantastic, magnifcent view of the city and is a must for any person. However I must acknowledge my complaint to those souvenir sellers whom I felt rather harass than sell the products. On that note I would also advise staying away from any people with UNICEF logos and anyone who tries to get you to donate to charity, believe when I say that they expect contributions of more than just loose change.Versailles is a must, an absolute must and one my favorite parts of Paris, the inside, the decor will blow you away and then the gardens themselves will walk your legs off and will put your camera into retirement - (bring lots of batteries for your camera and a good SD card) Such a beautiful and tranquil place and so large.What else??, theres so much to see, you will need a least 2 or 3 days to see everything you want to and even then its not enough because to conclude this - Paris is Unlimited."
50,"“A dream come true .. Weeklong vacation in Paris, france”","Trip report - ParisTravel dates : sept 15 - sept 23, 2010Travelers : two adultsOur trip was booked on expedia as a package of flight  and hotelWeatherWas 60-80 degrees fahrenheit each day.  No rain, sunny everyday.  Locals said that the lack of rain the week we were there was atypical though, but the cool temperature was very comfortable and was very glad we weren't there in summer as the hotel room not have air conditioning.  HotelWe stayed at the hotel saint christophe , 17 rue lacepede, 5th arrondissement.I emailed the hotel ahead of time directly through their website about 1week before we got there to confirm our reservation and I received a polite response from the hotel within only a few hours. Note: my note was mostly in English, punctuated with polite 'merci's and 's'il vous plait's and the response from the hotel was in perfect english.  The desk attendants were very warm and friendly, sot it was never a chore to provide the expected greetings of 'bonjour' and 'au revoir' as we entered and left the hotel each day.  The room was small, as I expected, but spotlessly clean.  No smoke smell in the slightest ! The bathroom was a good size, and nicely pressirized shower, got hot fast and stayed hot even while i soaked my sore muscles from all the walking we did!  The best part of our room was the tiny balcony, with a view of the top 1/5 or so of the eiffel tower.  Thought it was about 3 miles or so from the hotel, it was our first glimpse of the tower and we felt lucky to see it each night before bed :)The room was on the 6th floor,  so the road noise was minimal.  I am a very light sleeper, and even sleep with a white noise machine at home, but I had no problem sleeping through the night in a our hotel room.  Very quiet neighborhood.  Seemed to rally quiet down to almost no sounds after 11:00 pm.They offered breakfast each morning for 8 euro per person, for coffee, croissants, juice, cereal and yogurt.  Overpriced, but we used the time to plan each day's plan. And again, english speaking servers if you needed something, but I used my high school french on them and it was good enough.  The hotel was about 3/4 mile south of notre dame cathedral.The only bit about the hotel that was a bit strange was the key system.  I had read other posters on tripadvisor talking about it but I'll mention it here.  The hotel asks that you leave your room key with them while you are out of the hotel.  They keep the keys on a wall near the desk, and you can take and leave your key as needed. Unfortunately the new yorker in me kept thinking....I could be taking other peoples room key couldn't I? But since the wall of keys is at the front desk, and i almost always saw hotel staff at the desk, i have to assume that they keep track of guests... I must add here that I never found any problems with any of my room belongings missing, or anything like that at all.  They do lock the doors after 10:30pm (you can call a phone number to be let in after 10:30) but I liked the idea that non guests couldn't get in late at night. Walking toursA couple of day itineraries if you're interested in what you can fit in day.  Note that im 40 yrs old and my husband is 35.  We took a cab for about 10 euro from notre dame at about 10:00 am to the eiffel tower (13.50 euro to go the top per adult) and went to the second observation deck, chickened out of going to the top!  Line took about 50 minutes, but the day was clear and the view were amazing.  Afterwards we sent postcards from the post office underneath the tower.  We then walked across the port d'iena bridge to the gardens across the street.  After buying some nutella crepes (so good) we walked to the arc de triomphe, then east down the champs élysées for a little shopping. After a 25 minute wait to get into louis vuitton for my favorite kind of souvenir, we then walked to the port alexander iii, one of the most beautiful bridges over the seine.  We then crossed the bridge, and walked along the left bank until our tired feet took us to the cafe Des beaux arts for lunch....best meal we had on the trip, sliced duck with pepper gravy and dreamy mashed potatoes that were nothing like I hada tasted before...husband got lasagna of all things, but that was also excellent.  Very friendly service, english speaking waiter.  We then continued along the left bank until we approached notre dame, which served as a great landmark for our route back to the hotel.  Once back at the hotel, we walked only two blocks east, to rue mouffetard...a street almost completely made up of restaurants..lots of good choices there for dinner...and easy on the feet after a long day!Another day we walked from our hotel to the louvre, spent about 3 hours in the museum then walked along the river in no rush. Grabbing bites and just taking in the beautiful scenery and collecting occasional chocolate treat, drink, souvenir or the like.    Another day: walking from our hotel to the pantheon, st. Etienne du mont church, and the Luxembourg gardens.  There was no charge to enter any of these sights. The luxembourg garden was gorgeous, where folks just bring picnic lunches, or a good book, purely to relax.  A good day to unwind and recover from a case of sensory overload and tired feet.Another day: versailles.  Go there, do NOT miss it.  Only 45 minutes by train from Gare austerlitz, and the line to Versailles has versailles as its last stop, so no worry of missing your stop on the way there.  Versailles tips: get there early, you can walk to versailles from the train station.  You can  buy tickets to Versailles and the gardens in a ticket office right across the street from the train station, 25 euro per person for both the chateau and the gardens.  Then when you walk to versailles, about 5 minutes' walk, get on the line for ticket  holders.  Once inside go through the chateau first as it can get very crowded later, then leave plenty of time for the gardens, they are massive.  The fountains come on at about 3pm, and it gets even more gorgeous..they have classical music piped in as you stroll around, it's just wonderful!!!Another day was spent walking around notre dame, saint chapelle church (large sections of glass are covered for renovations but still beautiful), the conciergerie, and streets east towards the place des Vosges.  Another must do: boat ride the seine at night.  We used bateaux Parisienne, which is located right next to notre dame. Only 12 euro per person, well worth it for an hour long ride, which goes from notre dame to the Eiffel tower and back again.TransportationWe took the Rer line from CDG airport, found English speaking folks at the ticket counters.  Train was 9 euro per person one way.  The line we took didn't stop at the posted stops, and fortunately we realized this early on.  So we decided that since the notre dame station had a lot of connecting lines, we'd get off there and cab it to the hotel.  Since You are underground in the train as you Approach Paris, you don't see any landmarks until you come up the stairs from the train to the street level.  Once we came up the stairs, and Notre dame was right in front of me, I will never forget the feeling I had of pure awe, it actually brought me to tears, but in a good way :)We walked all but a cab from the train station to the hotel, and one ride to the eiffel tower. As we wanted to walk around on foot to see everything, we walked th rest of the time.  My feet were certainly sore eaCh day but it was well worth it.  The night before we were checking out we Overheard another couple asking the desk clerk about a shuttle service to the airport.  We then asked as well.  For 16 euro per person, a minivan takes you directly to cdg.  Well worth it, especially considering that there was a possibility of a transit strike the next day, so train service may not have been an option.    Walking: bring your best shoes, and slip in some dr. Scholls gel inserts and it ll help.I have just done a sort of brain dump here, email me at driedman@ verizon.net if you have any questions.  I'd like to collectively thank previous posters on tripadvisor and was inspired to add this review since I felt very lucky to read other tripadvisor forum posts while i planned my trip. "
40,“The French”,"I was in Paris this August, the French are not real friendly. Some were, most were not; I don't know what their problem is? But I guess I really don't care!I was in Paris to see the Eiffel Tower and the beautiful museums. Which I did, and really enjoyed the ones I seen, not any real favorite. Seeing the Mona Lisa was one painting I wanted to see and the Thinker by Rodin. Saw both and some other real nice art work.I also enjoyed the sidewalk cafes, and they were cheaper than the restaurants and No Reservation needed.Our Hotel was the Best Western Tour Eiffels, was okay. The Elevator was real SMALL!I tried the 1664 beer was good and I can buy it here in Colorado.All in all it was good, you make the most of where you are.Gary"
50,"“paris by night, and the latin quarters”","a weekend to longchamp the arc de triomphe with my sisters, and a night in paris it was simply wonderful , the eiffel tower was twinkling the city is busting with life , resturants are cheaper down the side roads ,we found one that was very good 10 euros for a three course meal ! it was such a beautiful place , people where friendley , its a must to go there ,!."
10,“airport transfer”,A transfer to Charles de Gaulle was booked with Paris transfersfor 8.30am At 9am they said they would be there at 10am. Then another cll said that the transfer wuld be there at 11 so get a taxi. This created stress as taxis were difficult to get. Do not book this servicee as they are very unreeliable
40,“Need something in Paris? Go to MONOPRIX!!”,"So, I had my first ""lost baggage"" incident on my first trip to Paris France (Thank you Air France!).My luggage was left behind in NY, while I was at the CDG airport.I was going to be living around the Champs of Elysees, known for fashion and Ohh~LaLa with the tennis shoes, jeans and t-shirt I wore on the 15 hour flight here. yay.The airline let me know that they would reimburse me up to 100 euros per day. So me and my friends looked all around the internet to find a place for very necessary items (undergarments, hygiene items, etc...).We found MONOPRIX!! Right on Champs Elysees. It has clothing, make-up, a grocery store, so much more. We ended up coming to this store a few times during our vacation.So, if you need some food, some undies (cute too!), a bottle of wine or a greeting card, go to Monoprix.I did get my luggage 3.5 days into my 5 day trip.TIP: Don't travel Delta or Air France and ALWAYS have more than a 2 hour lay over in between transfers when traveling internationally so they have time to get your bags onto your plane.And one more tip! If you are around the Champs Elysees, stop at LADUREE for a Salted Camel Cafe and a L'Ispahan dessert. Mind Blowing Tastes!"
50,“friendly people”,"I had heard that the French were not friendly to Americans and would not speak English just to be stubborn. We didn't find that at all! Everyone was very helpful and spoke English. In one restaurant where no one spoke English, they were very nice even though there was no English menu. We had wonderful food and an adventure!"
10,“paris”,i went on your website and it was terrible i cant find anythink i needed so i rate it 1 star you lucky you even got that
50,“better than new york”,"my partner and i have just returned and had a fantastic time, visiting the regular sight seeing spots and more. food great drink great hotel lenox montparnasse, fantastic location, will return at christmas. much more to see and do than new york and i thought that place was fantastic, loads more choice of bars too."
50,“Lover`s City”,"This is a unique city, as a bright street lamp beckoning to her lovers from around the world, a treasure house of fashion and love - that here in plenty of quantity.But the capital of France is not only a city of lovers, it is also a living history.Birth of Paris began with the island Cité. Now on the island flaunts Notre Dame, Victor Hugo and of the same name sung by the modern musical. Like the Eiffel Tower, it is a symbol of the city, his business card. None of the tourist does not miss the opportunity to admire a creature of medieval architecture.Tours to Paris takes all, one way or another wants a full breath to breathe the thick atmosphere of the events that occurred here at different times. Anyone who wants to walk through the quiet streets and a cool corner of your eye to catch the Fab Four - D'Artagnan with his faithful companions-musketeers. Anyone who wants to look into the Louvre and drown in the enigmatic smile of Mona Lisa. Anyone who simply wants to step into the streets of the city, which has become home to hundreds of men of genius.All builders and architects, from ancient Gaul, brought a look of its own characteristics, not worn for centuries. You can walk past the modern buildings around the corner and find yourself on the banks of the Seine, near the old cozy cafe where every day for centuries served the world's best French croissants. Transitions so suddenly, what they are breathtaking, but they did not spoil the overall impression.After a shower of epochs is desirable to walk or ride (because of huge traffic jams make it more convenient for public transport), memorable places in all of Paris. And them there just a huge number, because every street, avenue or lane can be proud of its long history. Still, the main places for sightseeing tours in Paris deemed Versailles, Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, Disneyland, La Défense, Luxembourg Gardens, Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Notre-Dame and Place de la Concorde. Can not do in this kaleidoscope of attractions without the world's first zoo opened in the distant 1794, museums, theaters, amusement parks and shopping. The latter, incidentally, became another symbol of the new capital of France and is clearly dominated by some of the Parisian streets. Galeries Lafayette and Peta, that area of the Opera, will never be left without attention, not only women but also men. To relax after sightseeing and shopping, there are plenty of comfortable hotels, among which are the Royal Elysees, from which there is an exit directly to the famous Champs Elysees. Paris is considered the heart of France, a country of love, romance and champagne. Once having been on tour in Paris, you'll want to come back, even after throwing a coin into the fountain. After receiving the charge of an amazing atmosphere of a comfortable and of a mother from the first minutes of the city, it is simply impossible to avoid its further attraction. He calls and calls peaceful rhythm of the songs singer, floating above the sleepy rooftops ..."
50,“Favorite city in the world”,"Everyone should visit Paris at least once.The city, the people, the attractions, the food ,and the wine,are beyond compare. And the weather in September can not be beat. I would suggest renting an apartment and become part of the neighborhood. Learn a few French phrases and you will bewell treated. Do some homework (like Rick Steves etc) and your trip will be memorable indeed."
20,“People are rude in general in Paris”,"Yes, it's a big city with stylish people and lots of brand labels, but, people are quite rude in general! No matter how big of a smile I put on my face with a very polite tone, whether it be the sales lady at Chanel shops or the server at a cafe, they are all rather rude and unfriendly. I guess coming from a North American country, I'm too used to dealing with nice people, I didn't enjoy the people contact in Paris that much.Streets and roads are hard to find because Paris is an old city, so it was rather difficult to find directions, unlike newer cities with easily cut streets. Street lights are quite limited as well, so be careful when you walk on the street with a small group at night.Also, Paris airport is a bit of pain in the butt, because signage is not clear. Should you plan to get a tax refund prior to your departure, make sure you get there at least 3 hours in advance. My plane departed at 11:30pm, I got there at 8:30pm, stood in the tax refund line up for 2 hours, we just made it in time, couldn't imagine if I didn't go there earlier, I probably wouldn't be able to get my tax refund."
40,“trip to paris and nice france”,"I would just like to thank all the people that answered my many questions about paris and nice. It was all very, very helpful. Our trip was wonderful. The advice we received regarding metro, ref and just about everything was of great help. This is a wonderful web site. Thanks again."
50,“Left Bank Food & Wine Walking Tour with Wendy Lyn of The Paris Kitchen”,"How do you make a trip to Paris even more memorable? Have Wendy Lyn give you a food tour of Paris.We tasted our way through the 5th and 6th neighborhoods best bakeries, cheese, chocolate, and wine shops while learning Parisian history and what sets apart these particular shops from the usual fare.Wendy is an encyclopedia of Chefs and Restaurants and is happy to share her insights and knowledge. Do this tour at the beginning of your trip and eat well the remainder. A 5 star tour and a most memorable day in Paris!"
50,"“Definitely ""the city of lights""!”",Paris is definitely everything you've heard of and more. You will not be dissapointed from the place. But you shouldnt spend less than a week there if you do want to visit all the tourist sites and feel the parisian culture.
50,“Paris in a week”,"Landed in Paris and received a first hand look. There was a demonstration and we had to hoof it to our apartment. Walked through the city which was excellent. Spent a week in Paris and did not see everything we wanted to see. What a great place. So much history , so much food, so much wine. Had a great time. Sitting in a cafe and watching the world go by is a great past time. The Metro is fantastic and a good price. History is everywhere and the Parisiennes were very friendly and helpful. This is totally opposite from what I was expecting from past reviews. If this is Paris I love it. I will have to return to finish what i started."
50,“Shopping capital of the world”,Great place to go to buy designer brands and perfume
30,"“Not our favorite stop, but we would return”","Paris is a city. We were traveling with my father-in-law, my husband, my daughter and her husband and my son. Most of us live in a rural area. Based on what we read, we knew that we were not going to drive once we arrived. We only had about a day and a half to see the city and most of us had never been there.We stayed in the 14th district at a Best Western. The area was nice and had residential services, in particular we were in need of a laundrymat and we did find one.Being short on time we took the hop-on hop-off bus tour, it was a convenient way to see as much as we could in a short time.We saw long lines at many of the popular sites but we were told that there are tickets available to shorten the waits. I would have liked to have gotten back to see more of the gardens, etc. but time did not allow. We went to the Lido at night and took the subway. We found that while there are many entrances to the subway, not all of them sell tickets, but the hotel clerk did direct us to an entrance that sold tickets.Again, not being fond of big cities, this was not my favorite stop but if I had more time I probably would go back and see more of the “famous” and not so famous sites."
50,“Romantic Paris”,"We recently visited Paris with the entire family and absolutely loved it. Very exciting city with so much to see: Eiffel Tower, Seine, Notre Dame, Sacre Coeur, Louvre etc. etc. A weekend was not long enough to visit everything we wanted."
50,“My Apartment in Paris”,"We just returned from a two week stay in France. 10 days were spent in Paris. We stayed in a delightful apartment in the 7th, which we rented from a company called ""My Apartment in Paris."" They were very professional and helpful. We did all our business by email and it worked out beautifully. Someone met us at the apartment when we arrived and showed us around. I would definitely use them again."
10,“Rail Travel from Bercy station in Paris France”,"We just got back to our home in Omaha, Nebraska from our trip to Paris and Rome. After five days in Paris we took the Rail Europe Train #227 at 6:52, with a Comfort Sleeper, on September 5th to Rome Italy out of Bercy station in Paris. The station is terrible and all the trains were old and ours was almost horrible. No help with luggage to board, rooms very cramped, no dinning, no bar, no meals. We were informed there was a mini bar three cars away. When I went there it was a room at the end of the car (long line) with two people serving hot beer/sodas, packaged sandwiches and crackers. Had to beg for ice packets and they would only allow one plastic sack per person to carry the “treats.” The sandwiches were terrible and the beverages warm. In addition, the bathrooms were filthy, no toilet seats, and they ran out of toilet paper. Never take this train!We spoke with some people in the compartment next to us who came in from London through Saint Lazare with a good experience. They were also very disappointed with the train and station. Lots of stops and it was an hour late. We were warned by the conductor to be sure and lock our cabin door before going to bed. The service and conditions were very bad. We were glad to get off this train."
50,“Really is as good as they say..”,"Paris, the only problem I had was the fact I had to leave. 3 days simply wasn't enough and I must return as soon as possible (I don't think 3 months would be enough)..Every corner held something grand, and the city was alive with history and charm. I've been to many European capitals and this is amongst the best.Paris, for me, differs from other cities only because it feels more open and structured from the cities I've seen so far. With the wide main streets it almost feels like the Architecture of an America city (Yes, I realise that Paris is older than any US city before you start moaning).The main area is also ALOT cleaner than I've always been led to believe. One thing which is true however is the prices, they are higher than the Tower. It can be very expensive to have anything from the tourist Area (I payed over 10Euro for 1 pint for example).I'm not going to write a guide about ""what you must see"" because there are millions to be found. All I would say is it's fully recommend and definately in the top 5 cities of Europe for me."
40,“HISTORY TOUR”,"There is so much to see in Paris that you need to be a bit organised to make full advantage of your stay there.It is important that you find accomodation near a Metro station as the trains go everywhere you need to go in Paris. We stayed at the Lenox Montparnasse which is a nice cosy joint with excellent staff and close to 2 Metro stations.You can't see every museum so you just need to pick the best. Once you have seen plenty of art and sculptures you will probably have had enough so there is no need to go to any more.If you go to the Lourve you can do & see enough there with art and sculptures to last you the whole trip.Les Invalides is a must see as well as an L Open bus tour, Notre Dame, Arc De Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Sacre Couer, Pathenon, Seine river cruise and much more if you have the time.The place is alive with cafes, pubs and restaurants, no shortage of places to eat and drink.For shopping the top labels there is Galeries Lafayette which has everything you would want although you will need to be cashed up.Enjoy the ride, it's definitely worth a visit."
40,“Amazing City”,"Paris is an amazinbg city. So big and spread out. The Eifell tower is staggering to see in reality. I did a tour on Fat Tyre Bike Tours which I thoroughly recommend. It tours the Eifell tower and ends up with a boat tour of the Seine river. I found the people quite nice, as opposed to what most people say. I did however find it quite expensive and dirty."
40,“things to consider while in paris”,"Hop on very limited stops Car Rouge, from viator only one route, it doesn’t stop in important places such as the entrance of les invalids,Buy water at grocery stores is cheaper, watch before buying the museum pass as most of them kids under 18 don’t pay and other kids until 25 or 26 don’t pay eitheralso watch out for restaurant offering fixed price menus, sometimes not worth it since offer is very limitedbe prepared for the arrogance of most french !!!worth using public transportation is reliable and reasonable"
50,“FISSA SHUTLLE THE BEST”,we have used the servic of fissa shutlle and it i sa great compagnyvery nice driver efficient and not so expensivefissa shuttle+ 33 6 81 58 85 69fissahuttle@hotmail.fr
50,“must-be-there for everyone”,"Paris is a beautiful, lively city. You can go sieghtseeing, shopping and enjoy the nightlife. I think the district Montmarte is the most beautiful but also the district st. germain is great.One more tip --> explore Paris at night ;)"
30,“My super duper cheap trip at Paris”,"First of all allow me to start by telling you that if you are used to the great service of the tourism at Mexico, do not expect this at Paris. Though it has a lot of wonderful things at historical things the service is not their greatest feature.The hostel I stayed was basically but well located and good attention provided from the owner's daughter. Du point de neuf hostel, just four to five blocks away from Notre Dame and the Louvre and the subway is only a block away. Has everything you need a neat and clean room and a convenience store just around the corner and the best bakery I could find there where the quiche was delicious and cheap!The walk through Paris is something that you will always remember, the combination of the old with the new and the colors is unbelievable, everything just seems different. At Notre Dame I don't recommend you to pay for the inside tour , only to climb the top. Everything they sale in side is not that much worth it... there you may find a lot of the guys that try to sell you tons of souvenirs for 1 euro or 2. They're quite pushy and they speak in different languages.If you're under 26 the louvre has special promotions Sundays free or from 6 pm to closing free you can take advantage of this promos to do more than just one visit because it isn't enough even if you rush trough the paints or sculptures or halls that you want to see if you do it fast forward you won't enjoy it.I do recommend to buy the trail/bus/subway pass for students because that means that you can used for a week as many times as you like and that will save you a lot of money to enjoy.Versailles is something worth the view the gardens and fountains are amazing. Also the Sena Tour is very pretty the take a few minutes in front of the most important place for you to really look at them.Remember to visit the official Paris website there you can find a lot of info of the promos and attractions available in the season of your trip and make the most of it."
40,“renting an apartment from LODGIS”,"The apartment rental agency LODGIS has been wonderful in assisting me with rentals on a number of occasions. I have been very impressed with how they are able to guide me along every step of the rental process- and in English, since my knowledge and use of French is limited. I would recommend their service to anyone, as I certainly do with friends and co-workers. Any traveler who would like to experience Paris and just about feel like a Parisian should not hesitate to contact this agency. They will do what they can to satisfy your needs for a pleasant stay among a wide range of budgets."
50,“Apartment Rented through NY Habitat was fantastic!”,"We stayed in apartment PA - 3773 in the 5th Add. for 8 nights in March, 2010.It far exceeded our expectations. Everything about it metour needs. Location: incredible, Cleanliness: spotless,Neighborhood: made us feel like real, upscale Parisians.We'll be back!"
50,“Night life in Paris”,"The trip was great! The dinner and the cruise were great and it was really nice to have a little time after dinner to explore the Eiffel Tower. Magical evening at Moulin Rouge with the lots of champagne and spectacular show. Cruise very enjoyable, especially towards the end, when Eiffel Tower lights were switched on and the Tower was all sparkly."
50,“Tour of Paris”,"We did the Sandemans Free Tour o Paris. We met at 11 am at Place de St. Michel where we met Jake our tour guide for the day. The tour was excellent!!!!!!!!! The guide spoke loud and clear and he new his stuff. The tour was the best tour I hve ever been on so much so that I felt compelled to write this review. Jake told us fact after fact and made the history of this beautiful city come alive. Totally recommend tis tour, EXCELLENT!"
10,“Beware of Metro ticket scammers.”,"Paris would have to be the most overated city in the world. It is dirty the people are rude and as for the Metro, it is the filthiest thing we have ever encountered. Beware of the scam artists that work the Metro, they can see that you are having trouble with ticketing and within seconds they offer to help , next thing you've been taken advantage of and you find you have paid 20 times the price of a ticket , they use their credit card and then tell you the price, most travellers are none the wiser and hand over cash to these thieves, so it is not just the pick pocketers you have to be aware of it is the "" helpful "" ticket scammers."
40,“Some Paris FYI stuff...”,"I had probably read 100+ websites trying to assemble the ""perfect"" Paris adventure... lol. End results, you need to go on vacation to Paris for a full year to see it all! Since I like to cook (big savings), and wanted as much space for my money as I could get, I decided on trying a short term apartment. Reviews at some sites all tended to be positive which raises a quick brow with me, I did find a ton of apartment reviews here, (and they were honest reviews as some were negative). http://www.waytostay.com/testimonial-en-109.htm, It seems they also have reviews on many other cities also. And the second FYI I can offer is ParisTravelMap.com an absolutely great place to do a quick search for local info. I probably used it daily while I was in Paris. (Which is also where I found the above apartment reviews)... It was actually the less stressfull travel planning I have done to date."
50,“Original Visit of Paris”,"I am a Parisian and like to share some tips to visit Paris differently (I read an interesting article in the newspaper today - Le Monde :- www.cultival.fr/en/unusual-tours : to visit what goes behind some famous monuments:Eiffel Tower, Opera, Lido's...)- www.parisiendunjour.fr : to visit Paris with parisians (free); this association is member of Global Greeter Network. The visit should be scheduled at least 2 weeks before. Register on the website.- www.promenadedessens.Fr : customised tours- www.natureetdecouvertes.com => activités . Unfortunatly the web site isn't translated in English. But they offer many original visits and activities. You can ask for informations in the shops (list available www.natureetdecouvertes.com/magasins).I hope this information will help you for your trip in Paris.Enjoy your visit.Louise"
50,“Sigh My favorite place in the whole world!”,Yes I admit that Paris is the most beautiful city I've been to.I was there for 3weeks and I still don't think I've had enough.The food is exist! (the non-touristy areas that is) My Suggestion: Mr. LapinI liked Musee d'orsay more then the Louvre in terms of Paintings but the Louvre has much more to offer in terms of architecture and Statues.Club life is EXCELLENT!!!! I went to a club underneath a bridge with a view of the Eiffel tower and it was amazing! Had such a blast!Walking tours are super fun!Transit is cheaper in terms of other European countries and easy to use!
50,“Paris Shuttle”,"There are several shuttle companies with similar names I just used paris-shuttle.com four times over June and July all with great results. I used the service with the hyphen between the words paris and shuttle I think that made a difference.The first time my daughter was traveling alone and she booked her ride on line when she got to CDG airport she shared the van with other travellers it was a little longer but she got a tour of the city and when she arrived at her destination to a locked door the driver helped her find her way in. I used the same service and booked my ride on line and when I arrived with my husband the driver was waiting with a sign at the baggage claim we paid 38 euros we had booked a group van but we had no other passengers so we ended up with a private car, The next time I called them one hour before my sister was arriving in Paris- she had forgotten to book a car. The person who answered the phone said it was too short notice but when I told him I did not know what else to do he helped me out and had a car waiting for for her and my daughter. He charged them 60 euros. The fourth time I booked a shuttle for 6:30 am I worried they might not show up on time but at 6:30 on the dot the driver arrived and we were at the airport in thirty minutes.The private van for four cost 70 euros.I found the drivers and cars at www.paris-shuttle.com to be reliable, and clean would use them again- just remember the hyphen in the spelling."
40,“Paris in July”,"Our family--nine of us ranging in age from 10 to 73--spent a week in Paris in early July. July is not the ideal time to visit this wonderful city but we needed to accommodate the schedules of school aged grandchildren. The temperatures soared into the 90's making the long walks I had visualized impossible. The metro stations were breezy even if the trains were not. We spent more time than we might have in museums, strictly for the air conditioning. We're a family of museum-goers in any circumstances, but we neglected some of the joys of outdoor Paris in order to escape the heat and humidity. Should others find themselves in a similar situation, we recommend the Pompidou Center. The Louvre is very crowded as is the d'Orsay. One strains to see the works of art and struggles through moist mobs to progress through the rooms. Don't miss these splendid institutions---just don't expect much relief from the weather. The Pompidou on the other hand had large, cool spaces in which to enjoy the art and the view of Paris from the sixth floor can't be beat. The younger members of our group visited the catacombs. They raved about the experience---and about the chilly underground caverns. There was a wait for tickets but it was along a shady path. The waiting line for the climb to the top of the Notre Dame towers was also in the shade. The nearby Isle Saint-Louis offers Berthillon ice cream at a number of shops, a most welcome and delicious treat in a very hot city."
50,“PARIS VACATION”,"We went on a weeks trip to Paris in May 2010 and stayed at Hotel Elysees. We visited all the important places leisurely and it was a memorable trip. On the outskirts, Miniature France is a must see for kids. The hotel is located very close to "" Arc-de-Triomphe"" and very convenient to move around on foot also."
20,“Beware the additional tours at Paris Information booths....”,"Landing in Orly, we went to the information booth by Door G. A delightful young lady helped us with our Paris museum pass and our transportation pass- Paris Visite. Both were excellent investments. The transportation pass works on buses and metro and we definitely got our monies worth on it! The museum pass is a must because it saves hours on lines, which are large in Paris.However, we were also sold a tour of the Eiffel Tower that we were quite excited about. ""Les Coulisses de la Tour Eiffel Visite Insolite"" for 43 euros for both of us. We felt that it would be fun to have a personal tour of the tower with a history lesson. We could enjoy VIP treatment. Well, when we called to make our reservation they did not have any openings until July 21. We purchased the ticket late on July 11 and were leaving early on July 15.Sadly, there was no way to get a refund. We were very unhappy and are pursuing reimbursement. Warning: Do not buy your additional tours at the Information desks!!!! Go to the vendor directly! If we had, we would not be $60 American short.Wish the very friendly and helpful young lady had checked on the availability of the tour or that the computer system could have kept track so that the ticket would not have been sold in the first place. We were told by phone to go back to the place at the Orly airport to get a refund but that would have taken 3 hours away from our three day visit. We decided to pursue the refund stateside. Wish me luck! Je ne parle francais!"
50,"“Walking, Wining and Waltzing in Paris”","Paris has got to be among the most beautiful cities in the world. but the best way to see Paris is by walking this beautiful city.We (wife &I) were in Paris in Jan (a cold time but thankfully it wasn't raining) which allowed us to walk all over.We stayed on Rue de Ecoles which is central to a lot of place of historical and cultural importance viz. Notre Dame, Pantheon, the Gardens of Luxembourg etc.Tho a long walk, we also walked all the way to the Bastille and from there to the Camps Elsyees.The coffee and the wine of Paris are the two most important things to remember savoring. Though the bread is from heaven and beyond, we focused mainly on the wine and coffee... and you will need a lot of it if you are walking the city.Of the museums, tho the Louvre is an immediate favorite; we also suggest you to check out the Musée de l'Armée Museum and the Invalides (Napolean's final resting place). Keep the museum part (if you are not a history freak) to a day as there are other things to look for.Sainte-Chapelle, Catacombs are other must sees in Paris.Long story short -- love the food, the wine, the coffee and the sights. Walk as much as you can and stay in 5/6 zones of the city.Have fun!"
50,“Apartment in Paris : parisrentalhome”,For my first time in Paris i choosed to stayed in one apartment. This was a great choose ! This location is in the heart of Paris five minuts by walk to go everywhere. The owner was very kind and he has 2 apartments for rent. You can found it on the website : parisrentalhome.
40,“PARIS: THE CAPITAL OF THE EXTREME WORLDS”,"Yet back from Paris, Ille de France.I would resume my impressions in two ideas: a huge attractions park and are we in Europe??? The first is because of the big amount of attractions, museum, shops, restaurants and millions of tourist, you can never be bored in Paris even if it rains. The second is cos a trip through Paris metropolitain seems as if you be in Africa, Magreb or Asia, but not in Europe, the French capital is home to people from all over the world, i think more than a third of total population on metro Paris is born outside so if you count their descendents that also are not european looking, more than a half are not western looking people. I really like, but sometimes at midnight in metro or certain areas it makes you feel more unsafe even than in the Bronx, and that is true. Read about Paris disturbs or Paris gangs. Central Paris, the area of 9 kms east to west from Bercy to Port Dauphine, and 6 kms north to south from Montmartre to Tour Montparnasse, that really is where a tourist would move to see every all attraction Paris have to offer, is a very safe area, i feel even calm in many streets, althought is full with tourist you can get a bank and sit everywhere, you can enjoy callm in a little street back form the Champs Elyssees, or even you can sit and see in Le Tulleries or Champs de Mars. Really is a calm city, a city to relax and enjoy the sight, the spirit. If you go there in a more urban way, dont try to get the urban ambience of new york city or london, even madrid and barcelona owns more urban impact, Paris is relaxed althought the traffic jams, but no people running everywhere as in all the other majors cities i meant, no. No huge skyline in central paris, cos the highrise are all in La Defense west of the Central City, all Paris is homogeneous so sometimes can be boring in arquitecture. But if you try La Defense, you will se a huge highrise area, but i felt more impact with de City of London and Canary Wharf. If you want extremeley calm in the middle of the city you have huge of places, try Vosges Square in LE Marais, a quariter full with old hotels and mansions, and alternative shops, very calm, and the heart of the gay life in Paris. Well, I would resume Paris as I begin, an extremely park city with many attractions and many well-dones girls, and boys, and well-dressed french, Gulf Persic rich men and women, an people from all over the world trying to get the last model of a Louis Vuiton shoes, and in the other hand a PAris full with workers, blue collar people thrying to survive in a city very expensive and very hard, what i felt in paris was not very middle french class, so they live in the western suburbs of haute-seine."
50,“Paris vibrant & very French”,"A monument or statue on almost every corner, fountains, wonderful art, the Seine, iconic images of Eifel Tower, Notre Dame, The Louvre to name a few, even some of the metro stations are unique and interesting. Pere Lachaise is well worth a visit. Louis Vuton, Chanel, Jimmy Choo, shops and The Paris Ritz (we spotted Kate Moss outside when we went) Taxi's are cheap, Tabac's are generally seedy but add to the city's immortal imagery, do take a trip on the River (bateau's depart from Eifel Tower river side) Latin quarter comes alive at night and is pretty safe, pickpockets and thieves doing the old I have found a wedding ring trick are about they will go away if you ignor them, locals do not even make eye contact or look at them a good idea also cross the busy roads with care or even better cross when the locals cross as I find that the average Parisian driver will mow you down regardless if the little green man on the crossing islit or not. For newcomers take a bus tour and get familiar with the place. Metro easy, cheap and safe (even at night) Dining can be expensive but so many cafe's you will find something to suit your pocket if you are a real cheapskate there are McDonalds's dotted about, Quicks the Pizza place etc,watch the Parisian way of life, elegant, unique, quirky, sometimes aloof but always stylish .................... try a few words in French and smile it will help .."
50,“Grey Shuttle”,"Based upon prior trip advisor reviews I decided to use Grey Shuttle to take us back and forth from the airport. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service. Prompt, courteous clean and reliable. It was very easy to make arraignments and the price was reasonable."
10,“vactioninparis.com”,This company will ruin your Paris vacation!
20,“inter-shuttle private shuttle servie”,"I just recently returned from a 10 day trip to Paris with my mom and sister. For transportation to and from Charles De Gaulle Airport we decided to take a private shuttle. I read several positive reviews for inter-shuttle and decided to use their service.I was very pleased to see that they were right there waiting with my name on a board when we picked up our luggage. The driver was very helpful getting our luggage to the car and loading it. It was a long drive into Paris because of the traffic, but the driver was pleasant and easy to talk to. I also liked the fact that we didn't have to pay any money to the company until we arrived at the hotel.When we arrived at our hotel I asked the driver about confirming our return reservation with him and he said yes that he could do that and assured me that he would be back to pick us up on the date and at the time that we had just discussed. He even repeated back to me the date and time and I said ""Yes, that is correct."" I also told him that there would be one more passenger with us and asked him if I had to call or was this the confirmation and he indicated that this was the confirmation. I was happy that this was taken care of and didn't give it another thought.On the day of departure we were ready to go with all of our luggage in the hotel lobby. We waited for 10 min. past the time that they were supposed to be there to pick us up and no one came. We had the hotel desk clerk call the company and she was told that they were on their way and were about 2-3 minutes away. We waited for another 20 minutes and finally the hotel desk clerk asked for the number and called again. When she called the second time the company told her that there was no reservation because we had not confirmed it and so they had cancelled it and no one was coming. We ended up having to call a taxi and my daughter almost missed her flight because of their mistake.When I got back to the states, the company sent me an email indicating that it was MY fault that they didn't come because I hadn't confirmed the return reservation with the driver. They claimed that I told the driver that I didn't have all the information that I needed at the time they dropped me off and that I was going to call them to reconfirm. THIS WAS A LIE!! I responded to the email and told them that they were misinformed by their driver and they have yet to respond back.If you are looking for a shuttle company to take you back and forth to the airport, KEEP LOOKING!!!! I WOULD NOT USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN. You need someone reliable to get you to the airport on time and do not need the stress of wondering whether or not this company is going to show up!!"
10,“Paris Shuttle”,"Paris Shuttle (recommended by easyjet) is the most unreliable and worst transport company I ever used. When I arrived in time at Paris in the evening, I called them and they told me they don't have any driver and that's it. I had prepaid the travel and although they told me they would reimburse me, I did not receive anything back. When I called them on their hotline and complained, they put me on hold. Never received any answers to my e-mails to them either.So in addition to the taxi expenses, I paid for a service I never got."
30,“Dissapointed - Not at all romantic”,Was very excited as it was my 21st birthday present from my boyfriend. Was supposed to be a romantic getaway although nothing there is romantic. Stayed in a poor hotel and everyhwere was very busy. Very expensive also. Although the food and cafe's were lovely and would go back just for this one restaurant on the street where we stayed. My boyfriend also asked me to marry him there. He did plan it for the eiffel tower but it was impossible. It is also full of people trying to sell you the same things.
50,“Paris - A Romantic City”,Paris is a perfect example to be called as Romantic City. View of Heart symbol down in the garden from Eiffel tower is bearthtaking experience. Right from getting down from CDG Terminal to Novotel Hotel we thouroughly enjoyed the drive and each and every road magnifies its romance. Jewel on the crown for Paris is really the Louvre Museum (correct me if the spelling is wrong!!!) where you can see the Romance and Mystery Smile together.And not to miss the Napolean Square and the Cruise in the Anderson River. And obviously the World famous Opera famous glittering in the night. And add to all the Dancing Lights at 12 Midnight in Eiffel Tower is a great experience.And not to forget the generous French Govt to gift the Statue of Liberty to USA.Overall Paris is a place to visit if you are a Romantic person.
50,“A magical place to be...”,Paris is a wonderful place to have seen at least once. I personally think more than once. It is just as magical as the movies present it. You can walk for hours and not get tired. You will be fascinated by all the shops and the food. The Eiffel Tower is not that great but if you go when the lights are on at night is more beautiful. During the day it just looks like an iron monument.
50,“Grey Shuttle airport transportation”,"Jean Michel (the owner of Grey Shuttle) met our party of six persons at the airport. He took us right to our hotel in a new VW van. He was informative, charming, and clearly loved his city. Jean MIchel was waiting for us the next morning at our hotel, to return us to the airport. I could not have asked for easier transport to and from CDG. The price was better then most shuttles I had researched. I would highly recomment Grey Shuttle."
50,“Welcome2France Apartment was Fantastic”,"Our seven night stay at the Tour Eiffel apartment in Paris was perfect. The apartment is very spacious, well decorated, and equipped with more than you need for a wonderful stay. The pictures on the website do not adequately show the amazing view from the wall of windows in the living/dining room. The two balconies provide either a view of Seine/Eiffel Tower or the sunset over the rooftops. Each room has a huge window so the apartment is airy and bright. The neighborhood has great cafes and shops plus several metro and bus stops. The building and neighborhood is very safe.Staff is fantastic to work with when arranging the rental. They also greeted us and explained how everything in the apartment worked. We used the transport and Noel was on time and a great driver through heavy Parisian traffic. Honestly we could not find anything wrong with the apartment. We hope to return and highly recommend the apartment and Welcome2France.."
40,“I love Paris in the spring time”,"We have all heard the song I love Paris in the spring time. Well Paris is the place to be in the spring, this spring has been very cold. I could hardly believe it was colder than London but none the less Paris is always worth a visit. We have been a number of times but this time we used Eurostar from St Pancrus in London, A great experience the only way to go and will in the Future always. We booked into a Parisian hotel, Quality by name,it was just off Paris Nord station sounds sus I know , It was being renovated with not to much inconvenience was very comfortable and well worth the 119 EU per night including a full breakfast for two. We purchased 11 metro tickets for 9EU and did all the traveling we needed over three days, used the last one the morning we left. Visiting the Louvre, Concord, Eiffel Tower, Invalids, Triumphal Arch, and Shamps De Elisa. great visit. Done it before will do it again."
50,"“Paris, je t'aime!”","Day 1:We landed at CDG in the afternoon and bought a 2 day museum pass and 5 day Paris visite pass at the tourist information centre. (in hindsight should have bought a carnet of 10 tickets). We decided to take a cab because our hotel was not on the RER line and the cost of the Airfrance bus for the 3 of us was equivalent to the cab fare. After we checked into the Best Western Bretagne at Montparnasse which is a very convenient and functional hotel, we crossed the road and jumped into the metro at Pernety. Got off at Invalides, strolled down the streets, soaking in Paris, across the beautiful Pont Alexandre where we were accosted by a middle aged man asking if we had dropped a gold ring – a trick that didn’t work on us. The other ruse is to show you a couple of Euros and ask if you’ve dropped it so that you whip out your wallet and he/she whips it from you! Our next stop was for an hour long ride on the Seine with Bateaux-Mouches for 10 Euros each. It was relaxed and picturesque orientation to the city. We walked across to the Eiffel tower. At 6:30 pm the queue moved very fast. The ride to the top is as steep as the ticket price of 13 Euros (not covered by the museum and monument pass), but worth the experience of being packed like sardines in a series of elevators and not getting your pocket picked. The exhilaration comes from the view and the whipping cold wind! You can also buy a flute of champagne to “heighten” the experience! That was just about enough activity after a 10 hour flight and we bundled ourselves back to the hotel.Day 2:We had booked a day tour to Champagne through Viator – Paris Vision. We took the metro to the Paris Vision office at Rue de Rivoli as per their precise instructions, were loaded onto a bus and here’s a word of advice – walk very quickly and get seats on the top berth! The drive took about 2 hours. The first stop was at the Notre-Dame de Reims which is being restored and has the most unique figures on the outside - a beheaded bishop carrying his head in his arms, creatures climbing out of their coffins – more interesting than the beatific angelic statues. We had lunch at a small cafe just across the road from where the buses were parked. On to the Mumm cellars where we had a very interesting tour beginning with a short video about the grapes used, the map of vineyards and the process. The gentleman who showed us into the cellars was very informative and handled all our questions. The store has a collection of all their products and we picked up the demi sec for 25 Euros and a set of 6 glasses for 13 Euros. The next visit was to Moet & Chandon which was similar to the Mumm visit in format but they each have their own identity. The girl who took us around the cellars was not as well informed as the gentleman who poured out the champagne for us. The store has some excellent gift sets, all reasonably priced. A trip worth taking. How much did we have to drink? Mumm’s the word!Day 3:9:30-11:30 Armed with our Museum Pass we visited Musee de Rodin. Oh what magnificence in a beautiful garden setting!11:30-13:30 We walked to the musée de l'Armée and l'Hotel des Invalides which are side by side. We had lunch at the cafeteria there – don’t order the coffee – the price is not displayed and it costs 4.50 Euros – as much as the wine!13:30-14:30 Walked to Place de la Concorde and on to the Louvre.14:30-20:30 The Louvre – you save a lot of time if you have a list of favourites, but it is also wonderful to be swept away by something you didn’t expect as I was with the Rubens Room. We had chosen a day of late opening and staggered out, satiated.Day 4:9:00-15:00 Took the metro to Cite.Sainte-Chapelle : a gothic chapel famed for its stained glass with stories from the bible. Classy souvenir shopping - rose window pendant in gold and fleur de lis pendant and earring set in silver.LaConciergerie : former palace and prison where Marie Antoinette was held.A surprise festival of baked goods was going on under tents in front of the Notre-Dame where we managed to get some amazing food at very low prices, straight out of the oven! We had to change our picnic spot to the river bank on account of some very aggressive pigeons!Notre-Dame Cathedral (we stayed for mass) and Tower : a 387 step narrow climb to the top to make eye contact with the gargoyles and look out for Quasimodo! We froze in a queue outside (with no shelter from rain) for more than an hour because they only let people in small batches. But the view was well worth it.15:00-21:30 Walked to Musee d’Orsay and dived into Van Gogh (which draws you with its intensity), Renoir, Degas, Delacroix, Manet, and oh – Gustave Corbet’s “The origin of the world” which left pre-teen visitors aghast and agape and nudging each other! Another late opening choice which we did not leave satiated only because we couldn’t get enough of it!Day 5:Montmarte: Metro to Abbesses and on the funicular (covered by pass) to La Basilique du Sacre Coeur. From there we rambled on to Place du Tertre and watched the artists at work. None of us wanted to get our portrait done for 50 Euros so we walked down, past windmills, bought posters and coasters (a la Toulouse Lautrec) and wend our way to the cafe featured in Amélie, Café des Deux Moulins. The bar tender was very sweet and gave us a paper table mat as a souvenir!As you go down-hill in Montmarte, so does the aesthetic sense! We soon arrived at a street lined with sex shops from end to end. This marked the end of our Montmarte expedition and we dove into the nearest metro and headed for Arc de Triomphe. We walked down the Champs Elysees and shopped for French perfume and found a statuette of Marie Antoinette and a Parisian Lady for my doll collection. Took the metro to Galeries Lafayette which is worth the visit for the beautiful building and the interesting pavement vendors. We could only view the Palais Garnier from the outside (we saw a model of it in the Orsay) but our quest for the Phantom of the Opera could not happen.Day 6:Took a cab to the airport at the unearthly hour of 5 am. Lesson to be learnt : cab rates move from 0.9/km to 1.4/km at these hours, especially steep during the weekend ! So we paid about 78 Euros on our way out as opposed to 51 Euros on our way in! Ouch!Well the cab to the airport in Rome was 50 Euros in and 50 Euros out even though we left at our favourite hour viz. 5 am!"
40,“Discover Walks”,When joining the group for a Discover Walk bear in mind it is actually not free. The guide reminds you at least three times per walk a tip of 10 € is expected to be given.
10,“OMG!!!”,"I was in Paris last week on holidays, i did all the tourist things that Paris had to offer and i have to say my first impression of Paris were not good. The city was dirty, all the tourist attractions where just very ordinary as if the city had neglected all maintenance to them. For example at the Eiffel tower there was an 1hour wait to get tickets and while i waited i was harassed by gypsies and people trying sell things to me. It was also very baron. No kiosks, or updated buildings for the customer service people. The Louvre was the worst. Everyone was taking photos, when clearly there were signs saying it was prohibited, and the staff didn't even care. At the sacre cur i was ripped off by an African (sengal) man after he tied string to my hand..... i wasnt happy, i was more disappointed that it was all happening in front of a very holy building. The list goes on.Overall it was very disappointing. I guess dont believe the hype. I think Paris really need to lift their game i felt like i was in 1999 in Paris."
50,“Paris Pass”,"Paris is a wonderful place to visit. Le Moulin Rouge show is excellent. Don't miss Versailles!I'm going again soon, and would like to know if anyone has experience with Paris Pass."
50,“Wonderful restaurants on Ile St. Louis”,"We've been to Au Lys d'Argent on Rue St. Louis in the middle of Ile St. Louis many times. It's probably our favorite Paris restaurant. The gruyere cheese galette is magnificent and others are very good too! Great management in a charming little place.Another one that's wonderful is Le Relais de L'Isle on the same street. We had the fixed price vegetarian meals and they were quite good.I recommend Berthillon and Amorino? for ice cream.One place we do not recommend is Les Gourmands de L'ile. We have always found Parisians to be charming and polite and lovely to deal with, but I suppose there are always a few everywhere who aren't going to play nice. We stopped in and had cold drinks on a very hot day and ordered tap water in addition. The tap water never came, so we asked again. The manager or waiter said, ""We only bring water with food, not drinks."" We paid 8 Euros (about 10 dollars) for those 2 drinks. We had dinner later across the street at Le Relais and noticed the same man periodically coming outside for a smoke or cell phone call.Silly man; he lost two prospective customers and any of you who will take your business where people are gracious."
20,“Orly Airport”,"Just got back from a wonderful 1 month trip in Europe, only to discover that our bags had been ransacked and a bunch of things stolen including expensive olive oils, balsamic vinegars and liquour. The culprits must have been the people who search baggage in Orly airport as we had no damage to our bags, which were locked with TSA locks. This was a very upsetting end to our trip, and has made me lose faith in Orly airport. What can a traveler do besides lock your bag unless you ship all your gifts home individually...Not happy."
30,“Paris Attitude rental agency”,"When travelling to Paris this May, we used ""Paris Attitude"" agency to find a short term (2 weeks) rental property in Paris. They did their job for 35% of the rental amount and the apartment was decent, in a good location and trouble-free, but I cannot say the agency does much for its fee. We had to contact the owner directly and arrange a meeting to get the keys. The agency also tried to sell us a strangely overpriced renters insurange, which we did not buy. They are slow to respond and not very good to get a hold of the landlord to confirm availability, so the service they provide is quite basic. Still, they have access to a good choice of inexpensive apartments in good neighborhoods and are able to find a good match for the requirments. They don't beat the others on service, but are very good on price."
50,“New Paris Tours”,"Hey fellow travelers had some extra time in a new city for myself and took the free 3.5 hr free intro tour with this company. What a great time informative and friendly. About forty people showed up for the tour so they broke into two groups we had Mary Ann from Ireland very friendly and easy going. I was the only American so it was even more fun mixing with the different travelers. Make sure you're ready for the weather it's been kind of chilly lately. The 3.5 hours went really fast but tons of information all the hot spots around the island and then towards the arch de triumph. Gives you a real good feeling of the city and what to hit when on your own. Obviously they talk about their other tours but to be honest I was tempted by the bike tour, it would cover more ground in same time period. I only had one day this time and it was well spent. Put on your walking shoes and have some fun.Jim"
50,"“Paris, From the Top”","Visiting my daughter in Paris while she was studying abroad there, was the trip of a lifetime for me. While she is not a museum fan, she showed me many incredible views of the city ""from the top"". There were steps to be climbed, most of which were of the spiral variety. Elevators to ride, one of which came to a crashing jolt, cobblestones to the heavens, steep sidewalks to lovely cafes. Even a gerbil like escalator tunnel on the outside of a museum.So, to see the sights of Paris, see them from the top. You will be starstruck as you take it all in from the summit of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triumph, Sacre Cour in Montmartre, The Pompidou Center and the tower of Notre Dame.There are many views that I have not mentioned, so discover some of your own and be delighted in what you gaze upon in this most lovely city."
50,“Meeting the French - Pastry/Chocolate Tour”,"My wife and I just returned from a week in Paris, and our favorite event was a 3 hour walking tour of patisseries and chocolateries put on by Meeting the French (the name of the tour organizer and also the name of the web site). We walked through the streets, led by our guide, Adam, and visited some of the biggest names in chocolate and pastries, including Pierre Marcolini, Patrick Roger, Pierre Herme, Poilane and Gerard Mulot.Along the way, we were given different tastings, told the history of the various establishments, and, of course, had the opportunity to buy the pastries or chocolates that we saw. It was fascinating to learn some of the intricacies of chocolate, and how the region from which the cocoa bean comes makes a distinct difference in how the chocolate tastes.Adam was extremely friendly and spoke better English than many Americans I know. The best part was that he clearly had a passion for chocolate that was really contagious, and the different establishments all seemed to welcome him with open arms, which made the tour even more fun.The size of the group is limited to 8 people (and, according to Adam, is frequently only 3 or 4) so you get lots of personal attention. It's a bit pricey (90 euros, so approximately $120, depending on the exchange rate), but we found it to be a refreshing change from the cattle call of the typical tourist attractions, and made us feel like Paris insiders later in the week when we returned to sample more on our own.Of course we only experienced one guide, and I'm sure that the guide various from day-to-day (Adam was a student, and this was a part-time job for him), but based on our experience, I would highly recommend this tour!"
20,"“Paris, the French can keep it!”","While it was nice to see the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, etc., this city is expensive to the point of being ridiculous. The other problem we had was with pickpockets, they are everywhere and you have to be on your guard at all times (who wants to worry constantly on vacation). We did not find the French people to be directly rude but they don't go out of their way to help either. Throughout the city there is a lack of translated information to guide you around. While the Louvre was very nice, the grounds around the Eiffel Tower could have been cleaner and better kept. This might be a fine destination for some but when I compare it to other cities I have been to both stateside and abroad, Paris ranks at the bottom. If you are looking for a European vacation, and this is only my opinion, put your money where it will be better spent in London, Berlin, Munich, Barcelona, etc."
10,“Skip it when traveling to Europe”,"I just completed a trip to Europe which contained 2 days in Amsterdam, 2 Days in Paris, 2 Days in London & 6 Days in Ireland. Everywhere the people were friendly and outgoing except Paris. If I had to do it all again, I would not have went to Paris. What a mistake. They do not like us and show it in the way they treat you. When you try to speak in French (a gesture you would think they would appreciate...that you are trying) they look down upon you. Really not a good place to visit. It's a shame too because they have some great places to see."
50,“Useful tips and prices”,"Here are some useful tips for you about Paris, public transportation and entrance fees.We arrived to Orly Sud and decided to take OrlyBus to Paris Center which is one of the cheapest ways to get in but the most tiring of all. The bus is big and fast (35 mins in the middle of day) and gets to one of the central metro stations. But from there you will need to take another metro get to your final destination. We love Paris metro, not as complicated as may seem but they have stairs everywhere and not tooo many escalators. So if you have many big bags it can be challengind draging them up and down while changing lines. The OrlyBus costs aroung 6.40 Euro / way / person, the metro ticktet is 1.60 / way. It is good for changing lines within the metro system.If yoa are not really into museums then don't buy the 1-2-3 days travel card. It is expensive and it is not worth it, only if you use the metro all the time. But why would you go under the ground when there is so much to see??Walk as much as you can, and if you are tired, buy a boolet of 10 tickests,which is only 11.60. You buy 7 and get 10. During 3.5 days the 2 of use used up only 22 tickets. But we DID walk a lot.The sights which you should not miss:Eiffel Tower: is 13.20 Euro up to the 3rd floor. It seems much but worth it. Buy your time stamped ticket online on the Eiffel's official site and save time on the ticketing queue. But don't be surprised if you need to queue from the 2nd to the 3rd floor. It is an acceptable 30 minutes waiting on the elevators.Notre Dame: no entrane fee, only if you want to climb to the bell tower: 8.00 Euro / person. Closes around 6.30 pm. Saint Chapelle: must see: 8.00 Euro / person, but a breathtaking monument. And if you kepp your tickets, you can get 2 euros off from the one-hour long boatride. Louvre: we did not visit it. You need more time than 3 days in Paris to squeeze it in your schedule. Go and see Musee d'Orsay, which is open until 9.30 pm on Thursdays. It is a Must! 8.00 Euro / person. Go and climb to the Arc de Triumph at night. it closes at 11.00 pm and you need to climb many stairs but the view from it is not comperable. 9.00 Euro / person. If you decide to go on a cruise, do not hesitate. It's original price is 12.00 Euro / person, but you can get 1-2 euro discount coupons around the Notre Dame. The live guide is OK, but better to have your guidebook acompanied with it to understand more.Students and young ones can get extrememely good discounts: under the age of 18 most places are free of admissin fee- but not sure if only for EU citizens, but you get huge discount also btwn 18 and 25. Just don't forget an ID with birthdate on it :DIn any case, parisians are nice and helpful, but be polite and smile. This is the clue to them."
50,“Fantastic!”,"Beautiful city, full of life day and night. Attractions and monuments are phenomenal at night and in the day. Public is friendly and we had no problems with language. Learning a few key words will take you far before going there. A site see must and a travelers heaven!"
50,“Autumn in Paris”,"We went to Paris at the end of March with two teenage daughters & it was the most wonderful experience. The city is beautiful, french people are friendlier (been there in the summer) & we had no long lines or crowds to deal with.We visited for four days & walked and walked and walked! The best way to know a city.Top recommendations: ""Chris"" the free tour guide of Montmartre. His guide was the most informative, funny, and full of stories & legends of the area. His tour is only on the wkends so we rushed from the airport on a sunday just so that we could make it to his tour. The girls also liked the Eiffel tower, Louvre, the Latin Quarter & most especially the Pantheon (who would have known!). There were lines at the Eiffel tower so instead we went to the tower at Montparnasse which offers a real beautiful view of Paris. There was not much going on around the Montparnasse area so we walked to the Latin Quarter which is a mini village in NYC. Thirty years ago tourists were allowed to walk around the Sorbonne & check out the old classrooms, etc. Unfortunely, this is not allowed anymore so we just settled for a quick view of the Patio where students mingle. (Girls wanted to visit & get a souvenir but ""no more"". They don't sell souvenirs like they do in the states). The Monet museum was also a highlight! Beautiful place, quiet & no crowds. It is in the suburbs so it was a diff. pace & nice to see that part of Paris.Low recommendations: You don't need to reserve van/car to pick up at airport. These companies charge per person. We paid a regular cab from the hotel to airport & didn't pay half of what we spent in the van rental. There are tons of taxi drivers @ airport. We did a bus tour but maybe a double decker w. open views would have been better. It was a sunny but cool day so we went for the closed tour. It was ok but hard to understand the interpreter. By the time she was done explaining a landmark, the bus would have sped off already. The girls loved Versailles but due to weather (cold & rain) the only tour you get is inside the palace. (It reminded us of the Breakers in RI) We also did the half day tour but if we had visited in the Summer, a full day tour would be best & I'm sure the gardens are gorgeous then.We stayed at Crown Plaza Republique & it was nice, clean & very central to everything. We highly recommend it.When paying at restaurants always double check yr bills. We were overcharged on several occasions. & you don't have to tip. Tips are always included in the total of bills. Also, you are charged more when sitting at a cafe. If you stand like a lot of the locals do, you get to enjoy the ambiance, gossip of the locals & pay the minimum.Paris is one of those cities that in any season are beautiful. Now that we walked it, next time we'll know where to go to just sit, relax & enjoy it!!!"
40,“Wonderful city”,"My wife and I visited Paris for 4 days in early April 2010. Firstly, although this might have appeared to be an ""off peak"" time, every place we went to had lots and lots of tourists, like ourselves. We hit all the main spots and I will give some what I hope will be practical useful information on some of them :Eiffel Tower : We booked tickets on-line for a timed entry.This saved us about 45 minutes queuing to buy tickets but thereafter having a booking made no difference. It took us 90 minutes to get to the top starting at 8:30pm.Notre Dame : A visit here is in two parts, with two queues - one to get into the Cathedral and one to climb to the top of the towers. Get there early in the morning and decide which queue looks most appealing !Louvre : Use the Rue du Rivoli 99 entrance, but you will still be mashing through a lot of people to get in. It's vast; try to have an idea of what you want to see before you go. Far better is...Musee d'Orsay : A little quieter with a wonderful collection of ImpressionistsSacre Coeur : In Montemartre - go there !Restaurants : Vesuvio a stones throw from Arc de Triomphe on Champs de Elysses and Le Deux Palais near the Cite metro stationEating out isn't too expensive (reference prices in Ireland) but watch out for the drinks, these are expensive and will inflate what you might expect the bill to be. A Cappucino €7.50 in a place where a nice meal is €14.00 !!"
50,“Greyshuttle”,"I was extremely worried about getting a shuttle in Paris. We had five people and four big bags, so too much for one taxi. All of the shuttle reviews were 50% good and 50% bad...not a good percentage! Greyshuttle.com were the only ones without a bad review and I can agree to their service!Very responsive via email. Good info is provided upfront and our transport to and from our apartment were fantastic (new spacious and clean van).Thanks Jean-Michel!"
30,“My visit to Paris”,"Paris, France is very historic. Saw the bridge where Marie Antoinette was beheaded (Pont Neuf). Saw the Louvre and was quite surprised at the size of the Mona Lisa ( about a 12""x 14"") . Ate a very stale, soggy sandwich at the Louvre - food terrible and expensive. We traveled down the Champs de Lyses - a of coffee was about $7 - $10 our money. Other than the history, Paris is slightly over-rated. The Eiffel Tower is historic but not a huge structure like I expected. Bring lots of money if you visit, you will need it."
30,“The French Aren't THAT Bad!!!”,"I’m going to stick up for the French in Paris here, because many people seem to think the French are [--].I've been to Paris twice. The second visit I got lost in the metro with a friend, and found myself asking the same lost-tourist questions as last time regarding connections and directions. Then it occured to me, that the locals must be sick of answering the same stupid questions for me and millions of other tourists on a daily basis. It’s so overcrowded and uncomfortable in their metro – let’s give them a break!Another thing, if you ask a local a question and they don’t understand they’ll likely say “what” instead of “sorry I do not understand, can you rephrase?”. When we Canadians hear “what?!” its so blunt that we mistakenly interpret it as rude. However, most French are nice people and although inconvenient, they’re happy to help, and certainly don’t mean to sound rude.

50,“Paris March 2010”,Sat: Arrived Orly 7 am in the pouring rain. Took a taxi to Hilton La Defense for about 42 euro. Immediately checked in to the hotel.

50,“A Wonderfully Romantic Surprise First Wedding Anniversary!”,"My gorgeous husband sprang a wonderful surprise on me that we were going to Paris for our First Wedding Anniversary!We flew from Manchester with Air France, pleasant flights there and back, comfortable seating and refreshments were more than adequate on board.We took the train from Charles Du Gaulle Airport into the centre, then hopped aboard the Metro to our destination.We found all methods of transport during our stay in Paris to be fine, we had been warned of pickpocketing etc but we saw no evidence of this whatsoever, perhaps it may be as we do not drink or stay out too late, that we missed the areas of low level crime. We found the locals to be pleasant and courteous, if you like us like to attempt the language in each country you visit, you will find them to warm to you more.We stayed for two nights at the Hotel Cecilia, situated a stone's throw away from Arc De Triomphe, which was magnificent! It's a beautiful smaller hotel, serving breakfast in the dining room or in your room. Balcony and view were both fantastic, the tree lined street of Avenue De Mac Mahon was like something from a movie, we felt we were in a prime location, yet far from all the hustle and bustle of central Parisian life!Eiffel Tower was first on our list, and we could not believe the sheer scale of it! You have to be far away in another suburb to get a decent photo of it in one shot. We decided to walk up to the first floor, and it was the best idea and we would reccommend doing so to all, queue is far shorter, and cheaper ticketwise, you can walk at your own pace and plenty of places to rest if needed, and also once you reach the first floor, you then can purchase tickets for the lifts from then on! This enabled us to see the tower in full glory, from mid afternoon in the sunshine, to the sun setting, then in the darkness with it's amazing light display - on the hour every hour - make sure you watch out for it! The queue for the final lift up to the very top lasted for quite a while, but it is worth the wait! Those who are a little feared of heights like I am should be fine up the tower, I suffered no wobbles and it is such a huge landmark complete with gift shops, restaurants and snack bars on the levels, you forget just how high up you really are!Another tip for the Louvre Museum - go below ground to the Metro station, and find the local Tabac. Purchase your museum tickets here, and this enables you to walk straight into the museum missing out the large queues at the main entrance, thus enabling you enough time to start your mad dash to find the Mona Lisa !!Notre Dame is magnificent, well worth a look inside and walk around and take note of all the different areas, lots to see and read about.For those of you like me who may not be fond of local cuisine such as frogs legs and snails, also those on a budget or those who like us were constantly on the go sightseeing, you must try the local chain Quick ! Similar to the old school Wimpy, lots of choice for both meat eaters and veggies alike, and very very tasty!Weather can be unpredictable - we were dressed for wind and rain, and experienced 5 mins of that on our last day, the rest of the time warm and sunny, so big jumper wearers, take a t-shirt to change into!Departing for the airport, we used the Aerobus, it leaves from the next street along from Ave Mac Mahon, and costs about 5Euro each and takes about 20 mins by coach to get to CDG, comfy seats and you get to see another side to Paris, which we like.To sum up, Paris is a fantastically romantic and historical city, and we loved every minute of our stay, so much so we are planning to visit again soon!"
30,"“Paris - nice buildings, shops galore expensive alcohol but worth a look.”","Went to Paris last week 14th March 2010. I had not been for 40 years so it was all new to me.I stayed at Hotel Splendide (invalides quarter) which is a small hotel with 72 rooms I think. I was on the 5th floor and got there by lift which arrived soon enough. The hotel is fine and the breakfast was OK but not tremendous (Cost £12 per day for continental) Rooms were partly original but had alll mod cons and I had no complaint.Paris centre is not as big as London. The river Seine has some boats on it but they are merely taxis to Notre Dame etc. They do not make enough of the river.What to do when you get there? There are the usual sights and churches/statues/ historic monuments and museums if thats what you like. To be honest I am not a great one for museums but I looked around the museum d'Orsay to look at some Van Gogh, Monet and Lautrec. I am glad I went but unless you like ""art"" its not essential you go.I was not that fussed on Monmartre or Pigalle. I walked there which was a struggle and I found the area shabby compared to the rest of central Paris.If I were to visit Paris again I would probably just do 3 days and ignore the guide books completely. I liked walking around Marais quarter (small streets), Le Defense (bit like Canary Wharf), Boulevard St Germain (shopping) but I would ignore most of the history, churches etc. I did visit Notre Dame (it is in every guide book) but I was in and out in 10 minutes. If cathedrals are your thing fine but I dont think many Brits would be that keen on French History.There is a problem in Paris with alcohol and food. Lager is 7 euros a pint thats about £6.50 today. Wine is £20 -30 a bottle, a meal for one with gin and tonic and half bottle of wine and coffee at a reasonable restaurant is £70 - ouch but don't let that put you off!Macdonalds is only £6 for a big Mac meal and there will be cheaper restaurants if you know where but drinking is expensive.If you are a shopoholic then Paris is great. Galeries Lafayette is like Selfridges and Au Printemps is like a good Debenhams. Don't walk the whole of Boulevarde Haussman just do half it gets tacky towards Place de Republique.I would probably miss Monmartre too its a bit shabby too.Highlights for me were the Boulevarde St Germaine, Le Marais and the small shops and bars down side streets like St Domininc and north of the Louvre.There is a scam near the Louvre. A gipsy will come near you and pretend to pick up a gold ring. She will ask you if its yours in the hope of reward. This was done to me 12 times in 4 days - just say no they arent offended! It was a bad scam when you first see it when the same woman does it to you 6 times - its pathetic.All in all I would say if you want to visit Paris go for 3 days and walk the streets - you will get sore feet and when you rest at a cafe be prepared to pay £4 for your coffee. Le deux magots had the best coffee (St Gemaine) and you got hot water, cold water and a chocolate for £4.There are plenty of restaurants. The best place to stay would be somewhere near the Louvre eith Rive gauche or Rive Droite. The Invalides was a little too West for me and I seemed to walk East all the time."
20,“Not so good first impression”,"Single guy travelling to Paris for the first time.Firstly I must say that I had no problems regarding the staff and personnel in the hotel, restuarants and attractions. On arrival I exited from Gare Du Nord having taken the Eurostar (which was excellent) and was surprised by the number of street beggars and alcoholics wandering around trying to get cash from passers by. The area was a little seedy and unkempt but fortunately the hotel was clean and tidy. Groups of intimidating looking blokes hanging around street corners and in door ways did not fill me with confidence. The smell of urine around an abandoned post office building was totally off-putting.Many of the Metro stations also had a strong smell of urine, were dirty and graffiti was common. There were also plenty of tramps around on the platforms which is something of a shock to see but I suppose inevitable in a large city environment. I'm not meaning to be heartless about that, it's simply an observation.My biggest fault with each tourist spot was the amount of aggressive gangs of street-vendors trying to sell their wares. (The base of the Sacre-Couer Cathedral being the worst) On one occasion I was grabbed by one of them and really had to struggle to get away. The vendor then shouted something to his mates and I thought for a second that I was about to get mugged. I left the area as soon as I could. Overall my first visit to Paris will certainly be the last on my own and I would not recommend it for single travellers. Or maybe I've just been unlucky. I didn't make myself obvious as a tourist (no camera or map on show) and I can speak basic french to get me by. I'm wondering if others have had similar unnerving experiences in here. I've had nothing like this in places such as New York and Barcelona or even in London."

50,“City of Lights...and much more!!”,"My daughters and myself spent a week in Paris, we had a wonderful time, the only bad experince was being ""mugged"" in the metro!! Beware of kids, that was who mugged us!! Just be careful of your purse and don't get your wallet out in public especially down in the metro!! Other than that, we loved Paris...and took the metro everywhere!!"
50,“City of ligh”,"Its my first time to europe. And i don't think its a bad way to start to your euro adventure than in Paris.My advise to non-french speaking traveller is to at least learn the basic of french. Believe me, it helps. Well most parisian speak english, others won't be bother if u try speaking english when you strike a conversation. If you don't know a word of french...Always remember how to say "" ""Excuse me ma'am/ Sir, do u speak english' in french before asking them anything. Among french people that is an act of putting in afford to speak french. They would generally, be happy to help you on direction. Overall, french people are quite friendly. If you are going on a tight budget, don't be too worried there's alot of Turkish, Lebanese, Chinese even Vietamese food you could find literally everywhere ranging about 5-8 euros. If travelling around Paris, Rail would be my advise. Not only is cheap, but its fast. Take note the Paris Metro Train produced a 1 day tickets and if you are under 26, Weekends One day ticket cost you 3.30 euros, weekdays 5.90 euros. A single ride ticket cost u 1.60 euros..."
50,“Paris New Years Eve 2009”,"We spent New Year 2009 in Paris, we arrived on Tues29th Dec for six nights.Aithough we visit Paris regulary ,we usually stay in a hotel, but this time we wanted to try an appartment, plus we wanted to be near the Eiffle Tower so as not to have to use the metro after midnight on new years eve. So we booked on the net using a site called appartmentsapart.com. We booked a tiny appartment just big enought for two but very well equiped and within walking distance of the Tower, Metro just around the corner, surpermarkets, open air market and resturants all nearby, plus booking and arrival very easy, so would use this company again.On New Years Eve we took the Metro to the Trocadero, stood there for a while watching the display on the Tower, it took 5 months for the bulbs to be put in place for this display which lasts for about 20mins, we then thought we would walk over the bridge to the other side of the Effle Tower as that was were we wanted to be at the end of the night to walk home to the invalides, but the Police were stopping every one from crossing the bridge, I wonder if this happens every year, so we had to cross the road which was very busy, and make our way to the next bridge and come around that way.I was a bit dissapointed that there was'nt a count down nor any fireworks, none the less we love Paris so will return."
50,“Wonderfull Paris”,"Hi Everyone.I've never written a review but, after spending a few of the best days in Paris, i just had to share! My partner Lee got me a trip to Paris for Xmas,being the planner i am, i spent a few evenings on the net sussing out places to eat, & how to get around whilst there as neither of us had been.I spoke basic french which folks, is a major benifit, i discovered tons of basic english/french phrases you print onto a A4 page on the net for those needing a refresher on their days spent sayin window in french at school ....!I booked 'parisshuttle' a company that specialize in convaying from Paris centre to and from Orlay & Charles De Gaull Airports. It was €76 return, but their service was professional, & pleasent, you are given crystal clear instructions on what to do on arriving/leaving Paris when you recieve your booking conformation. DONT EVEN THINK OF RENTING A CAR!!!!!! Paris driving is dog eat dog - totally bonkers! We were booked in to The Prince Monecau Hotel, 9 Rue Tarbe Adorsment 17 (75017) on a B&B basis, check it out online & it looks exactly the same in reality! The hotel is across the street from Pont Cardinet (train station) the nearest metro is either on rue Cardinet behind the train station, or a tad further down the opposing street, Rue Jaffory/Alabans, (all Rue/Streets are named by a white and blue plaque on the buildings) i personally decided as we had only 2 free days to explore, that the busses (rossiebus) would be better, as i wanted to see as much as poss! we went to Pont Cardinet & bought 2 carnets (20) ile de france tickets costing €23.20 or €11.60 for 1 carnet, these brilliant little tickets give you access to rail, bus, or metro all of which are very reliable. we used 14 of the 20 altogether on the buses while there. The hotel staff i found to be lovley, 2 male receptionists, 1 of which, was so sweet ! the rooms are small folks, but they clean and put fresh linen /towels in the room each day, clean and neat, be aware you will have a tv and channels...but in french - sky news in english is available to keep informed of world events the hotel lets its occupents use the computer/ internet free, just to the side of the reception desk also. We always had nice hot water evening/morning, but remember, an early riser benifits in many ways... the breakfast was continental buffet style cornflakes/corissants/pressed orange juice/tea/coffie/yougert/compot/cheeses/jams, basic but substantial to start your day. I had booked 'Les Cars Rouges' a touring bus company, open top double decker busses that tours around the main attractions for 2.5 hours,€43 for 2 over 2 consecituive days. I rang the manager (Phillipe) because of a late voucher & he was lovley, faxed the voucher to the hotel with appologies of the delay. The bus stops at each place of interest for pictures And you hop on/hop off as you please, theres a bus that runs every 10-20 minutes, so the world (Paris!) is your oyerster!.If you buy tour via internet, on payment you recieve the voucher via your e-mail address to print, then keep for the bus driver, who then gives you a pink ticket and earfones to plug into a station/language of your choice, we set off early round 9.30 or 10 am, we had always taken the bus from Rue Cardinet near Rue Jaffory on the no 53 bus to Le Opera, (busses are efficiant, and let you know all the stops via an announcmet) then went to 15 Rue Scribe to the Les cars Rouges signpost & got on there, the tours worth it, theres so much to see & if your on a short city break you will be moving like a rockets up your neithers to get it all in! the tour cuts the faff out. I had checked out places to eat and chose Chez Clemant, a french resturant, friendly, attentive and pleasing, this is where the french comes in... im a vegie, so id to order a meal not on the menu... Not a problem folks i joke you not, i ate better vegie food in france over 3days than i had in 17 years at home! Chez Clemant at Le Opera is advisable if you want great food french style, plenty of food on the plate & tastes real good, a starterX2, huge gassy bottle of water, main 1 vegie/1fish and a couple of the most delicious cafe noisettes cost €32! not atal bad, in fact we went back for a lunch the following day there, check out how they present their gourmet soup...now its impressive! i got hooked on essepressos there now concidering im a latte lover, it tells you how bleeding fantastic the coffie is, i would fly there right now for 1 (or 5)...! On the last night we ate in The Jean Bart resturant at the end of rue tarbe across form Pont Cardinet, fantastic food, again they made me a 'special' meal of hand cut fries, side and a whopper of a mushroom omelette, Lee had a fish dish that looked like a picture, this time we had a dessert of open apple pie & ice cream (delish) and couple of cafe noisettes of course, €46! a little mention to the two men near rue Jaffroy in their little cafe, which made lovley paninnis & fries for €12 for us both ! I would suggest regardless of your religious beliefs, visit Montremart, and the basilica of Le Sacre Caour, pay the €5 & walk the 300 steps... you'll only understand if you do, i must say i must have been walking around with heart shaped eyes, for despite what i've been told, the True French are lovley, i had ladies and gents in their suits going/coming from work stop, and ask if ii needed directions or help, does anyone do that in ireland anymore..... but i do think it softens the barrier if you speak a fair bit of french, it links up a little bit of a connection. Finally, i left a bit of my heart in Paris... I loved it, i will be back, soon, if only to compleat a wish not fufilled due to wet weather, that is to return to the cobbled streets of Montremare, to where i believe the sprits of the most infamous artists of all time began their lives painting tourists as the seasons changed, and sit for the experience, so i can - this time take a little bit of Paris home with me.... J'adore Paris!"
50,“What a lovely albeit snobbish city!”,"Paris is a wonderful destination although snobbish and an experience or two were not good. Still, it's a nice city with many sights."
40,“Parisian beggers!”,"I and my boyfriend recently travelled to Paris for a long weekend. Whilst we loved Paris and its sights the beggers were something else!I am writing this review to make other travellers aware of the risk they pose... but dont be afriad... just avoid them if you can!Basically there are a lot of street beggers, which are actually moved on when seen by the Police but they will shout out things which does pull on the hearts strings... however they are not my concern.Whilst walking through the courtyard of the Lourve, on our way to see the Notredame an old lady bent down in front of us and picked up a gold ring. She then came over to us, put it in my hand and started to say something- which sounded like a prayer- in french. She closed my hand and walked away. My boyfriend said ""no, no, we dont want it, you found it so you keep it!"" The lady wouldnt have it. She showed us that she had no jewellry and we should have it.The lady then walked away again but came back about 2 mins later asking for money! I felt obliged purely because of the whole bizzareness of the situation!Shortly after we reached the River and a young man bent down in front of us and yes... you guessed it... he picked up a gold ring!My boyfriend immediately flipped and threw the gold ring back at him saying ""no, we dont want it! Go away!""The man then squared up to my boyfriend which absolutley terrified me because he was clearly high as a kite.After I managed to drag my boyfriend away we stayed on the bridge for a second and watched the man as he played the same con on 5 other people in the space of 5 minutes!Beware of this con... It may sound stupid now when you read it but at the time, in the romance of Paris we really did think the first lady was genuine!!!!ThanksDanielle"
50,“What a gem of a city”,"What a wonderful city to visit. We visited in December 2009 and apart from the first day when we were the victims of a gang of pick pockets, had a great time. Contrary to what we had been told, we found the French people very friendly and helpful. We spoke very little French but had no problems in getting around, shopping and eating. The small streets were an absolute gem, charming and filled with wonderful shops. We felt very safe walking around, even late at night. Must do attractions include the Eiffel Tower (but be prepared to queue for an hour for tickets), the Louvre, Palace of Versailles, and Notre Dame Catherdral which is free, unlike the English Cathedrals. Moulin Rouge, whilst not the cheapest night out, was definately worth while seeing. The Champs Elysee is also worth a walk down. There is so much to do and see in Paris, you really need to spend several months there. Food is good, and it wasn't hard to find restaurants providing good quality 3 course meals for between 12 and 14 Euros per head. We loved Paris and will definately visit again."
50,“Paris all in one day”,"We had one week in Paris and a friend of mine who lives there recommended a private guide from one small company. Yeta was really friendly and knew Paris as a back of her hand. As a proper American, I insisted on seeing the world known Eiffel Tower right on the very first day and I was not dissapointed. I will not speak about all the attraction, you can find all of it else where.What struck me about Paris is it's mood, its special and different than anywhere else. The only similar feeling I had was in Prague and here it was even stronger. Paris has charming streets with beautiful cafes, wide boulevards ornamented by stands with little paintings you can buy as souveniers and each part of Paris has something to it. Mouline Rouge, Sacré-Cœur Basilica, The Catacombs, Louvre, Place de la Concorde, Montmartre, Lafayette galeries, I mean each of this places is unique and worth visiting for some specific reason."
30,“new year in paris”,"New year in paris .we enjoyed paris on the whole,but new years eve at the champs elysees was dissapointing ,there was no atmoshpere no count down, and no clock, we expected fireworks or something to mark the occasion but nothing. you must visit sacre coeur at night its beautiful,also visit notre-dame where there is countless resturants at good prices.If on a tour you must do the paris at night tour,"
10,“newmarket paris new years eve 2009/10”,Our holiday started as planned with a cup of tea and toast at home waiting for the taxi but from there on it was very different to what we were told. Where to start with the problems we and all other 40+ people endured. Day 1 very long drive stopped for food etc no big problems. Got to the hotel after doing several tours of the airport and other various wrong turns this is where all of our disastorous but entertaining fun began. Mess up with the bookings not enough twin rooms to be had. Hotel no resteraunt micro meals only and for a four star you think theyd have a cooker!

50,“My favourite place in Paris”,"We stayed in Paris in September 2008. We divided our time between St Germain and Montmartre. We loved both, areas equally, I think a lot had to do with our accommodation. I've loaded some photos of our apartment in Montmartre, leased from the Swell Group which I cannot find listed on this site. In St Germain we stayed at Hotel St Andre des Arts (see seperate review). The weather in September was mild (around 23 C) and rained only once but we were inside at The Louvre anyway.Montmartre was very different to other parts of Paris, VERY hilly which was great for walks, a little bit quirky and wonderfully artistic, it was once home of Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh and of course Toulouse-Lautrec.The boulangerie on the corner is great for fresh breakfast pasteries and there are supermarkets, wine and cheese shops and the subway all close at hand. There is also a cheap internet cafe down the road which was very handy.The area was in recent years made famous by the movie Amelie which captures the quirkiness of Montmartre. The Sacré Coeur is also walking distance and looks beautiful in the pink hues of sunset and holds a brilliant view of Paris.The apartment itself is ROMANTIC and very Parisian, lovely and quiet with delicious aromas wafting up towards the kitchen window. The Swell Group are very professional with unbeatable attention to detail both in service and in the interior decoration of the apartment. They communicated extremely efficiently and precisely, and for our first visit to Paris we were very confident and felt like we new exactly where we were going when we arrived.I had a little trouble opening the front door at first, if i remember correctly its because there is two locks... but you could always check with Swell... I'm pretty pathetic with that kind of thing and when my husband came up the stairs he soon worked it out :)"
30,“Sim card theft”,"For those traveling to Paris, be aware that SIM card theft could occur. I was walking near the Arch de Triumph and was tripped from behind. Unaware to me, a pickpocket took my cell phone, removed the SIM card and returned it by tripping me again. I notified my cell comapny that the card had been stolen but that I still had me cell phone. they neglected to cancel the SIM card, and I received a bill for $10,000 the following month. Be aware that the SIM card is valuable to thieves, even without the cell phone"
30,“New or old scam? Gold ring was just brass ring.”,"Just came back from Paris. I was enjoying the walk along the Seine River when a woman show me a men's gold color ring and said how lucky she found this ring ( that is what I understood) - but she doesn't need the ring, she said, and gave it to me and start walking away. I examed the ring, it has 18K stamps on - looks real, but noticed the dull shine. I was skeptical - few second later, she came back with open hand. She wants money - I pulled out 5 Euro and few change and she was satisfy and walked away.We were talking about the possibility that she works as hotel cleaning lady and stolen the ring from the customer??? It looks real, but less than $10 loss if it is fake.YES, IT IS FAKE - brass ring that is! I did not see this coming - so, remember the basic - if it sounds too good to be true, it is not true!"
50,“Paris- Don't pass it up”,"If you heard that Paris is dirty and not very friendly. Someone was lying. My wife and I stayed in an apartment in downtown Paris for a week. We toured the city, ate, drank, and partied. We found the people very friendly and helpful. We did not experience ""The Paris Attitude"" at all. We had an absolute blast. The restaurants and cafes where just phenominal. We bought metro passes and museum passes before we got to Paris. The best way to get around Paris is by subway or cab. The city is cleaned every night with trucks with huge power sprayers. Just keep your head up when you are touring certain attractions such as the Louvre museum, the gypsies are out in full force and will try to cheat you, pick pocket you, and they are just plain annoying. The best line you can learn for these beggars is""Non Merci"" learn these two words so you can say them with a stern voice and try to get the french accent as well. If you get the accent down... then they think you are from Paris. Oh ya.... that is if you don't dress like a tourist. There are some reasonably priced restaurants and some very expensive ones as well. We found that if you do some walking, that you can find a restaurant for almost any budget. Gregg Davis Canada"
50,“Best way get around”,We spent a week in Paris in June and had a great time. The thing that seemed to be essential was Rick Steve's travel guide. Everything in there from information on restaurants to cool walks to take in each district was great. We saw a lot of other people with them in there purse and pocket. We had a great meal every night using it and did not pay a fortune. The recommended side trips to Verseilles and Chartres let us see things we would have missed without it.
50,“PARIS- onderful city of energy and art”,"So many misinformed people in America think the French, and people of Paris look down upon tourists from the USA. This is so far from the truth. I did not come across one snob in France. The wait staff at restaurants were friendly, quick on jokes. I went with my girlfreind into a Gucci store, and the staff helped the two of us on all the details of getting a customs-discount when we return to America. Also, as a filmbuff, the Parisians have such a great and genuine love of American film. In the Paris Virgin Megastore, I was finding American classic films by Fritz Lang, Welles, and more. I can not wait to go back."
50,“greyshuttle”,"We were a group of 8 adults. Greyshuttle supplied a mini van with driver to take us on three different locations. They were wonderful, driver was extremely helpful, and was on time for each pickup I would recommend them for all your transfers in Paris or wherever they extend their service I would definately use them again."
50,“Great City”,"We were in Paris for only 2 days but I wish we had stayed longer. We absolutely loved it! It is very expensive though. We stayed in other european cities on this trip but Paris was the most expensive one, the cup of tea is $7!!! and coffee $3.The places we've visited were Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame (breathtaking! Don't miss the mass!), Pantheon, Madeline square, Arch of Triumph (huge), Sacre Coer (so-so), Versailles (definitely go there), Louvre (but from outside only :( ). All places were wonderful. The metro is confusing, we've seen many metros but Paris' metro is the most complicated one. Most of metro stations had no escalators or lifts so carrying luggage and stroller up and down the stairs was a nightmare!The people were very nice, despite the fact that we were told that french are rude to tourists, not at all!We walked most of the time and every street and corner were clean and cozy, just loved it!"
40,“Watch out for the scams”,"Paris is a wonderful city with very impressive buildings,but food and drink is expensive in the popular tourist spots.We were surprised by the large of beggars and Eastern Europeans trying on all sorts of ways to get money.A popular one is the 'Oh,look someone has dropped a gold ring'.A girl approaches and 'finds' a ring by your feet and acts all innocently claiming that it is not hers-because it doesn't fit;after a bit of discussion she persuades you to take it because 'who knows who to report it to'!You take the ring at her insistence and after some pleasantries about her country,you walk away.However,she follows you and then comes the 'do you have some money for food'?After a bit of haggling-including offering the ring back,she accepts a few Euros.That evening,after wearing the ring-because it looks impressive,your finger goes green and the penny drops!Next day,another girl tried the same thing at another tourist spot and quickly disappeared when I showed her my 'gold'ring from the day before! Be warned."
50,“One of my favorite places in Europe”,Paris is beautiful and full of so much history. Definitely a must visit city in Europe.
30,“unfaithful”,"Paris is like a woman. Moody, unpredictable and expensive. The Paris I visited last week was unlike all my many previous assignations over the past 30 years. She was fitful, unreasonable, more expensive with less value than ever before. The average waiter was more petulant, less available, often downright rude and very unhappy. A lot of this poor service could be rectified by doing away with the automatic tip. That, however, is a political question. To wit: We stayed at the Hotel Richepanse, a 4 star hotel near the Madlaine. A perfect location in a recently renovated hotel. That was the end of the 4 stars. The hotel is 2 star in its lack of professional staff. Misinformation and lack of same is the staff's hallmark. Services ordinary to a 4 star hotel such as turndown must be fought for. Large and early tipping overcame some of the problems. Again, the hotel is very nice, the location perfect, the staff nice. No way near worth 4 star prices.Prices were expected with the $ on life support, but the endemic cheating and stealing was marvelous to behold. At the sainted Plaza Athenee where you must go, the following occurred. One can enjoy, judge or just view the least valuable , phoniest and egotistical of people at Les Gobelins. This can be done on a budget by ordering ONLY the best chocolate chaude in the world; the chocolate ancienne. One pot at 10 euros is a bargain and more than enough for 2. It was ordered along with tap water. We were told there was no tap water; a sure indication of what was to come. Our chocolate appeared with a small boittle of Evian. We declined the Evian. The check was for 30 Euros which I questioned. The waitress then returned with 10 Euros cash. I called the manager, a stereotypical bloviator, who eventually cancelled the whole check. This from the venerable and oh so haughty Plaza Athenee. The obsequious maitre de looked on with disdain. On my return a few days later I was told by this same Maitre D' that were no tables available. I pointed out that there were many tables and she seated us at the best one.I believe that many of you will love the show at Les Gobelins so go and enjoy but imbibe only of the chocolate chaude.Amazingly, with Thoumieux closed, we had great difficulty finding a cassoulet. That is an amazing statement in Paris. We finally went to DLe Chez Eux near the Invalides which was recommended by Michelin explicitly for its cassoulet. Disastrous, we received the worst imitation of a cassoulet I have ever had to go along with perfectly horrible service. I have even more bad experience which I will spare you dear reader.We enjoyed Chez Dumonet which is really hard to get into, also Florimond, also need to book early. Many middle price restaurants have closed making reservations more difficult and prices higher in those left.She, Paris, retains her beauty as always. There is, in my view, no more beautiful city in the world. The Garnier, Bastille and Theatre Champs Elysee were their usual delights. A tip, do not bother with Maison Blanche on top of the Champs Elysee Theatre. We had reservations but were told on checking before theatre that they close at 10 when the performance is over at 10:30. We at a bistro directly across form the theater on Ave. Montaigne. Do not go, the appellation tourist trap is personified here.Though my love has been difficult, as all my loves are, I will still be true an d hope for the invention of new medicatiins to help her. Then again, too much help might make her un Parisian."
20,“Paris - potential scam - read before you go -”,"Went to Paris for a long weekend and was shocked to find the airport so far from the city. It took 4 trains. Dont lose your train ticket you can be fined. Prices very high. Breakfast 29 euros (£29!) in our hotel. Ridiculous. Open top bus tour brilliant though. Buy a ticket for 2 consecutive days - 32 euros and it takes this long to get round. You will see everything. Fantastic. However, beware of a scam going on - a guy came up to us and asked us if we had dropped a gold ring, we hadnt. He handed it to us to keep and then shook our hands and walked off. He then turned round, came back and asked us if we had some money for food for him (strange he looked well dressed). We gave him the ring back and our bus arrived. The next day EXACTLY the same thing happened with the ring. Different guy, different area. I think they expect you to get out your wallet, having won your confidence with the ring, and then they will run off with it. Beware, your holiday would be ruined. Luckily there are lots of police in evidence everywhere. City really beautiful though. Shame about the rogues and the prices."
50,“The most perfect place for an anniversary”,"My Husband and I have just returned from Paris where we celebrated our 1st Wedding Anniversary and I can't think of a more perfect place. Having wanted to go to Paris all my life I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but it totally exceeded them. I was warned that things were very expensive and waiters and Parisians rude, however I didn't see any of this. Of course with the Euro being as it is things weren't cheap, but I don't think you can go to any major city and for things to be reasonable, and as for rudeness, there wasn't any of that as far as I could tell, people going about their everyday business, but waiters and staff more than happy to help and be accomodating. Getting around Paris is so easy, the metro is quick, simple, and very cheap and at no time did we feel uneasy, even travelling back later at night - though as anywhere, it helps to keep your wits about you as would at home. The buildings in Paris keep surprising you, from the brilliant Arc Du Triomphe, to the Eiffel Tower, but also the beautiful flats that you could imagine yourself living in. Everything about Paris in my opinion is just perfect, and a wonderfully romatic place to spend time with the person/people you love the most. Sitting with a view of the tower waiting for the lights to go up was certainly one of the highlights of our trip, together with the Moulin Rouge which was just breath takingly fabulous. With the Eurostar straight into the centre this is a definate travel hotspot, I can't believe it has taken me 27 years to get to Paris, but I can certainly say it will not be the last visit, If you are thinking of going, set yourself a weekend away, with some comfortable footwear, sensible clothes and go and get wrapped up in one of the most beautiful city's in the world."
40,“Not what I expected”,"Ahhh Paris...the City of Love...Hmm...maybe not. What I expected from first stepping out in Paris was to see the typical French portrayal found in the millions of movies I had watched.... People holding hands and kissing, eating at cute sidewalk cafes, enjoying a cigarette while looking utterly posh doing so. But what I saw was definitely not what I expected. Yes, the French people are passionate, yet what I was seeing was definitely not love. Within the first 3 hours of my arrival, I witnessed 3 fights, and within the second day of my stay, I found a man lying with a pool of blood surrounding his head in the metro station. The streets of Paris are dirty. Homeless people found comfort using the sidewallk as their bed. The Metro Stations are crowded, and although the trains do come by every 2 minutes, but somehow it always seems to be crowded. It is really hot in August!! And guess what...there is no AIRCONDITIONING! If you plan on drinking a nice ice cold soda to ease your pain while you deal with the 90 degree heat, well good luck to you in finding a place that serves ice with your drink. One thing that you should be aware of is that in the month of August, most Parisians close up shop to take a month long vacation in the outskirsts of France. The reason being is that they feel like after working 35 hour work weeks, they deserve a nice long month to recooperate from their oh so hectic schedule. Expect most shops and restaurants to be closed this month, as the shopowners and employees enjoy their lengthy well deserved vacation.Has everyone heard the phrase, ""the French hate the Americans."" I'm not quite sure if this is true, if whether the French JUST hate Americans, or perhaps they hate ALL people in general. I experienced quite a lot of ""Passionate"" people. And what I mean by Passionate is Rude! An angry waiter who yells at us because of the mistakes he makes by serving us the wrong food. A French man muttering, ""insensible"" under his breath, as we stand in front of a Picasso portrait..apparently we were blocking his view of the painting. A metro station employee yelling at us for not using our card correctly... French people are definitely passionate.Not all of Paris is bad. The history, the art, the Eiffle Tower... As you stroll down the streets of Paris, you can't help but forget all your worries and all your problems as you stare at the beauty behind the historical buildings, the wondereful paintings and the cute cafe's on the sidewalks. At 10pm every night, the Eiffle Tower lights up like a big Christmas tree, hypnotising you as you absently stare at such beauty. The Louvre and Versaille contain so many paintings, that you didn't quite understand when you would see it on TV, but seeing it in person, it suddenly all makes sense. At night, the streets bustle with people, and you can't help but be excited with the hustle and bustle of the crowd. The French food...yum! Especially the bread and Brie! And who can hate a place where the wine is cheaper then the soda they sell?So although, Paris didn't seem like the city of Love to me, it was definitely a city I fell in love with."
50,“My favorite city in Europe!”,"Paris is a beautiful, cosmopolitan, city, with a lot of bustle, but friendly people who truly appreciate an American trying his best to speak French, and learn new words! There are so many things to see and do. As an artist, I especially appreciate the combination of old architecture, from a city that is 2300 years old, and ultra-modern architecture, along with French design. The prices now are unfortunately high for Americans with the exchange rate for the Euro, but there are inexpensive ways to eat, including food from supermarkets and food at the Flunch chain of cafeterias for hot food, open every day from 11 am to 10 pm. If you have a chance to go and visit Paris, you should do it.Larrywww.larrycwik.com"
40,"“Beautiful city, not to be missed.”","This is a beautiful city with some lovely buildings and loads of history. The Eiffel Tower is amazing although the queues are very long to get to the top. Its not that expensive at 13 euros to summit and well worth every bit. Arc de Triomphe good as well and only 9 euro but loads of steps to climb. Louvre was the highlight of my trip, you can actually get fairly close to Mona Lisa for photos and videoing is allowed as well.The streets of Paris were very clean, we saw no litter. Metro punctual and maps easy to follow. A book of tickets are better value than singles though. Its easy to get around.Souvenirs are vey expensive, much cheaper in other cities. Eating out was the most costly thing. Soft drinks and alcohol are almost the same price, 6 euros for glass of coke. Some places have set menus which are a bit better value but choice is limited.Locals seem friendly, most can speak English and are helpful in giving directions.A camera, comfy shoes and lots of money are essential for this beautiful city."
50,“Paris in Autumn”,Paris in AutumnI have been to Paris many times but this was my first time seeing Paris in the fall. It was delightful. The weather was in the 60's - perfect for walking around the many neighborhoods. We found that the free walking tours were wonderful. They varied in length from 3 to 4 hours. At the end of each we were asked to give our guide what we felt the tour was worth to us. It was a great way to get reacquainted with the city. I would recommend these tours to everyone.
50,“The Best City in Western Europe!”,"Paris is the best city in Western Europe. Period. The beautiful architecture is everywhere you walk, no matter what arrondissement you are in. There are gorgeous gardens everywhere, sometimes you will stumble across a little garden perfect for reading a book or catching up on your travel journal. There are so many famous sites to see- there is something for just about every person's interests. Crepe stands are a must- I suggest the banana-nutella for a nice snack or dessert. Savory crepes are also great for meals. The city truly does come alive at night and lives up to its name of ""The City of Lights."" Many attractions are open at night and experiencing them in day or night are completely different experiences. Late at night the Eiffel Tower lights up and you can see it all over the city. There is also a great atmosphere to do in the gardens around the tower at night and the boulevard it is on. If you have to choose one city to go to, go to Paris. The locals can sometimes live up to their cold reputation, but that is their culture. Be polite and courteous, and they will act the same towards you."
50,"“My trip to Paris, France”","7 family members, from 2 to 73 years of age, traveled to Paris, France. We had a wonderful time and were amazed at all of the famous tourist sights. We all loved the Louve, well, maybe not the little ones so much. We spent many hours looking at all of the statues, artwork, etc. The Eiffel Tower was beyond belief. It is so huge that pictures just don't do it justice. It is an awesome piece of work. We took the canal tour and got to see it at night, all lit up and even flashing! Notre Dame was breath taking and everywhere we looked there was something interesting and exciting to experience. I really recommend the canal tours because you get an entirely different view of the city. I never expected to see Paris, but I can't tell you how very thrilled I am to have made the trip. I would recommend it to anyone, especially history buffs!I rented an apartment that was quite large by European standards. It had 3 bedrooms and a full kitchen. It was within walking distance of everything and worked out perfectly for us all. It had a washer/dryer, dishwasher, airconditioning, and an elevator! We stayed for 4 days and things couldn't have worked out better and that is hard to say while traveling with so many people! It would have been nice to have a few more days, but we were off to London."
50,“Brief Tour of Paris and nearby surroundings!”,"Spent three wonderful days in and around the City of Light July 2009. Had a five to six hour guided bus tour of the city's highlights upon arrival in Paris including the Champs-Elysee, Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, the D'Orsay, the Place de la Concorde, Place de la Bastille, Palais Bourbon, the Conciergerie, the Opera House, Grand Palais, the Seine, the Eiffel Tower, the Ile's on the Seine and many more wonderful sights. Spent hours in the massive Louvre, entered through the famous glass pyramid, captured the inverted pyramid, saw the priceless works of art, crown jewels and the the most famous painting of all time, the Mona Lisa.Next day ventured outside of Paris to the Normandy region and visited Louviers, Vernon and Giverny. Captured beautiful pictures in Louviers with beautiful lavendar and incredible apple cider a regional favorite. Had lunch on the riverbanks of the Seine in Vernon a quaint Norman village that we had the privilege to see. Seeing a little bit of England in France was refreshing! After lunch we traveled to Giverny and the home of Monet. Entering the water gardens was an amazing experience that solidified why Monet was so inspired by his surroundings! Seeing the reflections on the water gardens, Monet's house was priceless! Couldn't take pictures inside the house but the rooms were interesting and well furnished. Leaving the house and venturing into the giftshop for souvenir shopping was incredible. After shopping we walked down a village dirt road with souvenirs on one hand and an incredibly delicious ice cream cone in the other. I didn't have a free hand to capture the breathtakingly beautiful sight! That view is embedded in my brain forever! After returning to Paris that evening we had dinner at Cafe du Marche near the Eiffel Tower. It was affordable and excellent with an amazing French waiter who was not rude at all, but went the extra mile to make sure that we were well taken care of even providing English menus for us and helping a large party of ten without complaint and letting us pay separately for our meals. This restaurant was a top pick of Rick Steves letting us eat where the locals eat. Thank you Rick Steves! It stays light after 10:00pm in the summer and we walked a few blocks from the cafe to the Eiffel Tower and could see the tower through the Parc de Mars! Wonderful views of the Tower at night! I captured quite a few pictures of the tower above and through the trees and then from the Parc all lit up at night! What a view!!!Our last day in Paris we started with a Metro ride to the Eiffel Tower in the daylight to the Trocadero station which is above ground giving you gorgeous views of Paris. Beautiful neighborhoods leaving you with a ""wish you were here"" feeling! We waited in line to go to the top of the tower avoiding pickpockets, thieves and scam artists for incredible views of the city. Captured the mini statue of Liberty on the Seine and the Arc de Triomphe from the top of the tower. Unfortunately I was picked up by a professional thief and had to cut my time up in the tower short and descend the tower. After a snack at a nearby cafe we headed to the D'Orsay Museum with a few bumps on the road with ankle sprains prior to our arrival. The D'Orsay is housed in an old train station with impressionist art that was amazing! Everything you could hope for and more! Then we made our way to Montmarte!We rode the Metro to the Abbessess exit. After climbing quite a number of stairs, we reached an elevator. The first one I've seen at a Metro station which means you need to take it!!! To understand the change in altitude after exiting the elevator we still needed to climb a long flight of stairs to the exit! One of the last Metropolitain signs in Paris, what a sight! Walking through the streets of Montmarte was amazing. Seeing the steps to Montmarte was something to behold.! To walk up those stairs would have been exhausting and exciting. We chose to ride the Funicular to the top and look out over Paris a spectacular view! Nice souvenir shopping, ambience and dinner! Many artists showing their works. After dinner we took one last look at this beaitiful city from above and then descended Montmarte via the innumerable stairs. We had our last Metro ride back to our hotel feeling happy, exhausted and satisfied with our tour of Paris and nearby surroundings.I loved Paris and would return in a heartbeat!"
40,"“It's called the ""City of Lights"" not the City of Nice People”","There is no question that Paris is a beautiful city. I was lucky enough to spend a week there, and got to see every sight humanly possible...and there is a lot to see. You have the omnipresent Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees, Montparnasse Tower, The Louvre, Notre Dame, the Moulin Rouge etc. My companion and I finished all of these sights with relative swiftness so we got to take a few detours. The best times were spent not waiting in line to go into museums or the attractions, but having the liberty to walk around without a map and feel like a real Parisian. It is really easy to do this because of the metro, you are pretty much guaranteed that wherever you walk to you will find a train stop that can connect to or take you directly back to your hotel or a new sight you want to check out. We went in mid June, the lines were not long but there was a lot of construction going on and we didn't get to see the carousel near the Louvre or the makeshift beach that they put up along the Seine during the summer months. Anyway, this city is a definite must for couples or friends but watch out because if you don't speak French or if you speak French but not fluently you will get looked down upon, even in Mcdonalds. My advice is try to get the basics down so you can order things and not get too embarassed but beyond that, if you speak English well, embrace it because they all know how to speak it and who cares if they look down at you. I didn't have any problems with pickpockets but I did have a problem waiting in line to see the modern art museum when a French guy continually blew cigarette smoke in my face and we got into a verbal fight which quickly turned into him hitting me and my companion. I am 5 foot 1 and he was over 6 feet. Yeah, the French aren't so chivalrous. Also, the guards at the museum did not care at all and did not punish the guy but still let him enter the museum. It probably didn't help that we were Americans. Anyway besides smoke blowing French guys Paris is pretty great, watch out and have fun!"
50,“4-days trip”,"Wonderful monuments and attractions. Visiting the historical monuments was like going back in time, just as how literatures have depicted it - and maybe even better."
50,“Delightful Paris!”,In July I took a trip to Paris France. It was the first time I had visited the city. I stayed at a hotel that I found on trip advisor. It was located two blocks from Notre Dame. My room was small but quaint. I was traveling to see a couple of friends of mine that were visiting the city for a month. I was fascinated with the Louvre. I visited it on three different occassions and still had so much more to see! Notre Dame was amazing. By day I would visit the various tourist sites. The Eiffel Tower was such a site to see! Seeing the city from top of the Eiffel was breath taking. I enjoyed lunch at bistros around the city as I watched people from all over the world viewing the city through their eyes. At night I would walk the streets taking in the view as romance filled the air. It is a city of love! On numerous occassions I would witness young lovers holding hands and laughing. I did not rent a car because their are plenty of means of transportation. Traveling the metro was a breeze. It truly is a magical city!
50,“I love Paris!”,"My husband and I went to Paris for our wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful trip. There were so many places to visit. It was difficult to see them all, though we may have come close in succeding. :) First on our list was the Louve Museum. It was so awe-inspiring to see so many great works of art in one building. After spending around four hours there and only seeing a fraction of the art, we decided we would save the rest for another trip. :) We then headed off to see the other sites on our (my) list. A cruise on the Seine, the Eiffel Tower, a stroll down the Champs-Elysees, Notre Dame and others, though not all in the same day. :) In the evening, we had our choice of French restaurants from which to choose near our hotel. Some had hosts who spoke English others spoke no English. I had to quickly learn to speak more French than I originally knew after ordering the opposite of what I really wanted on a few ocassions!:) Paris can be an inexpensive place to shop if you know where to go within the city. The hotel room was smaller than rooms I am used to, but I knew to expect this. Our room was larger than some I had read of online, and the bathroom was nice. The hotel was also reasonbly priced. The only negative thing I would say about Paris would be the scams, if they can be called such. I had read of how someone might approach a tourist with a fake gold ring and try to con money out of the tourist. Because I read this prior to my trip, I knew what to expect. There are also people who will walk up to you with a postcard which says they are from another country and have no money and need you to give them some. There were many people with the postcards, usually at the main tourist locations. Sometimes, there was not a scam happening, just someone playing music for money or sending a child around asking for money. Aside from this, the trip to Paris was wonderful and my husband and I plan to return again in the very near future."
50,"“Paris - City of Love, City of Lights”","In my humble experience, there are far too many people in the world who would 'love' to visit Paris 'someday' and they really don't think it's possible. Actually, it's very doable! You must begin saving as much or as little as you can. Just a few dollars at a time, and you will find that your travel 'nest egg' will build. Doing a search here on the Tripadvisor forum for 'bargains' will help you to find less expensive accommodations, meals, and sightseeing. It is likely that airfare will make up a large portion of your travel budget, so visit sites like kayak.com to compare air fares. Compare hotel costs on a site such as venere.com, and search here on TA for inexpensive places to eat. Have picnics for lunch and a bigger meal in a restaurant for dinner. Use municipal transportation. Paris is a very easy city to introduce you to foreign travel and to Europe. Sightseeing is very inexpensive...start saving, and by this time this year or the next, you might find yourself having to learn the word 'bonjour'!"
50,"“Ooh, la, la in Paris, France”","My husband and I stayed in a quaint little hotel in Paris for 4 nights and 5 days; it was amazing! I have wanted to visit Paris since I was in high school and was thrilled to have the opportunity to go there. Paris is a city with everything. The art at the Louvre was beautiful, the Notre Dame cathedral was breath taking, the small cafes were romantic, the Eiffel Tower was astonishing, the Arc de Triumph was a beautiful structure, the Chatau de Vincennes which was across the street from our hotel was like taking a trip back to the 1500s. The trip to Paris was by far one of the most amazing vacations I have ever taken! Anything and everything is spectacular in Paris, you will not be disappointed if you visit."
40,“Paris a great place”,Paris was good.TIPS:- Get a credit card with a chip and PIN before you go. Rent the VELIB bikes to ride around many bike trails. Biggest thing I regret we couldnt use! Google VELIB for info on these bikes that are located all over the place. First 30 minutes are free!- ask locals for the best bakeries. ( follow those locals with baguettes to find the good ones)- Pop into Hotels along the way to ask for advice for restaurants. They know local places- transit is good in Paris. Get a day pass or week pass.- Book 1 week in advance on Priceline. We got a 300 Euro hotel for $110 USD per night.- take the transit to/from Charles De Gaulle airport. 8 Euros and fast.- take shuttle if at other airports.Its a big city like others but has hidden character.
40,“Paris apartment living”,"We stayed in a nice Paris arrondisement, 16 e, for one week. It was really nice to get out of the fray for a while and yet be close to the Metro and the RER trains. We could also go to McDonalds and feel at home a little. One could buy three croissants for $2.00 Euros. Communication was really difficult but people were very helpful and kind. We could go to the Trocadero Metro stop and see one of the best view of the Eiffel tower and surrounding very easily. The first view was phenomenal and the night view with a full moon was almost spiritual."
40,"“The most beautiful city, beware of restaurant closures”","I loved Paris it was wonderful. Here are the things I wish I had known before I had gone. Restaurants. There are many many bad tourist trap restaurants. If you simply stumble into a restaurant it is probably not very good. Find the good ones, and make reservations for them. We had a mostly bad food experience there because places were either closed when we wanted to go, full or could not get a reservation. Thinking we will just find some place to eat when we get there did not work for us. Most good restaurants close most of the day. They are open for lunch from 12-2 or so then again for dinner. Most places that are open longer are not very good because they are mainly serving tourists. The French only eat at proper times. Going out with our French friend we learned how differently they treat tourists. At a great restaurant Cafe Constant, we were sat upstairs in the tourist area. Our friend said he had no idea these areas even existed because he had never been sat in such a place before. Up there the service was not quite as good and I think perhaps the food too. It was still great. Excellent sea bass and desserts. If possible I would recommend learning enough perfect French to hide the fact that you are American at least, especially when calling on the phone. I would ask for reservations in French and get a good response then as I spoke more and they caught on that I was not French would deny me. Another great place to act like a local and get food after lunch hours. Cafe Marly by the Louvre. The first day we went to the Louvre on Tuesday it was closed. One guidebook mistake. We wanted to have coffee at cafe marly I asked for a table in French and was being led to a table then as we walked said for coffee only then was lead out of the place to the folding chairs out front in the blazing sun. You see the cafe at that time of day are mainly just serving drinks so no local would say that. Next day we sat on the lovely balcony had coffee and food which was amazing, crab avocado app and the best egg benedicts ever.Beware most cafes have huge portions. Many places are closed on certain days so be sure to check.I would also recommend getting tix for the bateau bus and open tour buses with tix for the sights and museums to get them all day and save money then get a book of ten subway tix. We got the unlimited passes for 5 days and wasted money that way.Most importantly rent a flat rather than hotel. Much more for your money. We stayed in Montmartre at an apartment titled Houdin's Hideaway I believe through gail, on vrbo it was wonderful near 2 subways, lovely area and cute courtyard.Clubs can also be hard to get into, dress your best and say you know someone inside.Lastly go to the Eiffel Tower at night it lights up like a xmas tree and the view is so beautiful with less lines. Take your stroller up with you we almost lost ours in a misunderstanding. It is also worth it to go up to the top of Notre Dame. If you have children go to les jardins des plantes our daughter was able to feed that fawns through the fence and pet them, it was pretty cool for her. Other than that I don't think the French really like to see children out. We took her to a few dinners anyways. We felt like such terrible, loud American tourists. C'est la vie.Be extremely aware of pickpockets, my husband caught a pickpocket mid stride on the escalator in the metro. The pickpocket stopped but the victim never had a clue. The St. Ouens flea market also seemed especially shady. The antique area there was great, with a few good deals. Also some good deals in the vintage shop in Montmartre on rue Houdin where we stayed. The shopkeeper gave our daughter a free dress. Tres gentil. There is an organic market only on tuesday I believe, much cheaper than organic or any produce at the market.Avoir de la chance.I can't wait to go back and do it all again, but better."
50,“Discovering Disney Paris Style”,"Disneyland ParisBy Tamra FrancisDisneyland is a dream trip for every child (and adult) Disney fan. This year I took Disney to a whole new level by visit the European version.Disneyland Paris is easily accessible by bus and train. I arrive by bus and leave by train. The RER station near Disney Village provides a convenient way to travel to and from Paris.Just like the American version, there are several hotel choices at various price points. I choose the Disneyland Hotel because of its proximity to the parks. The hotel literally sits over the entrance to Disneyland Paris. The concierge service is great for stowing luggage. It is amazing to walk a few feet from our hotel and enter the park.The huge lobby of the Disneyland Hotel is beautiful, holding memorable gems everywhere. This is where the princess makeovers and photos are as well. My room is very large for European standards. I have a king-size bed, and couch, a table with two chairs, a TV, and a huge bathroom with two sinks. Robes and slippers are provided as well. While you can upgrade your room to one with a view of Sleeping Beauty’s Castle, I am pleased with a room overlooking the fountain out front. I have a small balcony, and if you stand just right and look off to the far side, you can see Space Mountain: Mission 2.Maps at Disneyland Paris are printed in numerous languages. Watch when picking one up to make sure you get an English version; you will usually see a British Flag. Disneyland Park feels more like the California version than Walt Disney World. Two exhibits are near the front of the park on Main Street. Realistic gas lamps light both Discovery Arcade and Liberty Arcade (my favorite). Liberty Arcade tells about the Statue of Liberty and should not be missed.The pink castle at the end of Main Street catches your eye. Here is Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. One unique feature is the Dragon underneath. You find him by going down some stairs in front or by using the access from the back of the castle. He sleeps but wakes up every-so-often to roar. Catch a glimpse of his glowing heart.Discoveryland is my first stop, and I get a Fastpass for Space Mountain: Mission 2. The Fastpass system works fairly well in Disneyland Paris; it is similar to Walt Disney World, although available for fewer rides. One special treat is that because I am staying at the Disneyland Hotel, I get one Fastpass per person per day to use at any of the Fastpass rides (at the Concierge level you get unlimited passes).One key to a successful trip is to check the holiday schedule where you are visiting. I have not successfully done that, and I am visiting during a French Holiday. The crowds are massive; more than Walt Disney World on New Year’s Day. The parks make an effort to accommodate the larger crowds. The rides are running at faster speeds. The Dark rides - Blanch-Niege et les Sept Nains (Sleeping Beauty), Les Voyages de Pinocchio, Peter Pan’s Flight - are jerky and fast, making the scenes difficult to see. The big ticket rides keep breaking down. But I don’t let that diminish my fun.Many of the rides are bi-lingual as the British are the second-largest tourist group to Disneyland Paris, but some characters speak only French. C3PO in French is hilarious. Hearing Buzz Lightyear talk in French is quite funny. The best ride, I think, is Thunder Mountain Railroad. The cars travel under the water and out to an island. Phantom Manor is fun, but again, with so much in French, I miss some of the story. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril is similar to Disneyland. “Pirates of the Caribbean” stands out. The external theme of the ship on the water and Skull Rock is superb. The ride is laid out in a different order. There is a restaurant in the ride, and dining there is an option. Not to be missed is the always popular “It’s a small world.” The Disneyland Paris version looks like the original Disneyland version.Park hours are shorter for Disneyland Paris. Even though I am there during a Holiday, the Park closes at 9:00 PM. The Studios Park closes at 7:00 PM every night. Disneyland Paris does offer extra magic hours in the morning at the Disneyland Park only. If you are staying at a Disneyland Paris resort or select other hotels, you can enter the Park two hours before it opens to the public. Only a few rides are open, but it is a wonderful time to visit. Fireworks are only displayed during summer months when the parks do stay open later.In addition to the park map, pick up a Programme which shows the performance times. Performances and times change weekly. You can download the Programme online before you leave. Character meets, shows, and parades will delight you and any children you have. The characters seem to be more prevalent than at Walt Disney World. The parade floats are marvelous.As dining constitutes a main focus in France, meal-time should be considered. Breakfast is included with my stay at the Disneyland Hotel. The breakfasts are character breakfasts with optional photo shoots. The photos can be purchased later in the gift shop. If you do not plan to do the character portion, arrive early for the best seats. On my first morning, I am treated to a table overlooking Main Street USA and Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. The breakfast uses the restaurants in the hotel. My first breakfast is in the California Grill area, and the second is in the Inventions area. The buffet meal is plentiful, including eggs, crepes, bread, pastries, several types of yogurt, fruit, meat, cheeses, cereal, tomatoes, tea, coffee, juice, water, honey, jams, and more.Disneyland Paris offers a meal plan called the “Half-board Plan.” You get one voucher per person for each night that you stay to use for a meal. They advertise a 15% discount. For me it was more like 8%. The convenience is that your meals are already paid for. Dining in Paris, even at Disneyland Paris, is an art; plan for minimum of two hours for any full-service meal. Reservations are a must, especially for Auberge de Cendrillon (Cinderella’s) which offers princess interaction and fabulous food – a three course meal. While there is not a ceremony like at Walt Disney World, the princesses and princes visit and spend a lot of time with the children and adults too.Walt’s – an American Restaurant on Main Street is my favorite, though. If you want an all-American hamburger, this is the place to go. The burger is huge. My café crème (coffee) after lunch has a chocolate Mickey floating in it. If you are not using the dining plan, opt for the fixed price menu which is a good value. Drinks are not always included in the fixed price option. Order “une carafe d’eau” (a carafe of water) for the free stuff, otherwise you will be served bottled water for which you are charged.Dinners are more challenging, I discover. Europeans tend to eat dinner late, especially in the summer. Most visitors will wait and eat dinner when they return to their hotel. I am surprise to see the food carts all packing up at 5:00 PM. One night I stop at a sandwich shop on Main Street USA. I purchase “take away” for my room. I get a wonderful looking “Croque aux champignones” (a grilled cheese with mushrooms). It is delicious; so good in fact that I have the same thing two days later at the Walt Disney Studios. I enjoy a brioche Mickey. What I think will be Mickey Mouse-shaped roll turns out to have a chocolate filling. Yum! There is a sweet shop in the area too. The French believe no meal is complete without dessert, and I am happy to comply.One night I enjoy dinner at the Blue Lagoon, the restaurant in The Pirates of the Caribbean. I watch the boats as they pass on the turn. The lights are low, and the specialty is seafood. The food is very good. Other dinner options include numerous hotel restaurants and an array of restaurants at Disney Village. You can even eat at the Rain Forrest Café there. But dining reservations for dinner are must. If you choose to dine in or visit the Disney Village area, you will find numerous shops for souvenirs. Disney Village boasts a tethered balloon ride as well.Tips are included in the price of food in France. In fact, waiters are paid quite well. However, it is appropriate to leave a few coins if you feel the waiter has done a good job. The waiter will never rush you. You have, in essence “rented” your table for the duration of time you wish to use it. You will have to ask for your bill when you are ready to leave. Most of the staff speak English, so if your knowledge of French is minimal or non-existent, you will still be able to enjoy your visit.The Walt Disney Studios Park does not have as many restaurants. I enjoy the Backlot Express Restaurant there. I again choose the grilled cheese with mushrooms and a brioche Mickey. I discover a fixed price menu there. And remember, no French meal is complete without dessert.Disneyland Paris offers two theme parks. While it may take two days to see everything at the Disneyland Park in Paris, the Walt Disney Studios Park can be seen in one day. Park hours here are shorter, 10:00 to 19:00 (10:00 AM to 7:00 PM). Guests begin lining up at 9:00 AM. There are no extra magic hours for this Park. The gate opens at 9:30 AM, and guests rush to be first in line for their favorite ride. I highly recommend rushing to Crush’s Coaster. Crush’s Coaster is a fabulous indoor with black light and outdoor roller coaster where four people ride inside a turtle shell. It is unique to the Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris and a very popular ride. It is my new all-time favorite at any Disney park. There is not a Fastpass for this ride, and on the day I visit the wait is never less than 100 minutes once the Park opened. You “plunge through the East Australian Current aboard a spinning turtle shell.” Sometimes you are facing forward and sometimes backwards. If the line were not so long, I would ride it numerous times.Another popular ride without a Fastpass is Armageddon. It takes you into the ship as part of the movie. Not to be missed on any Studio Park visit are the Rock ‘n Roller Coaster starring Aerosmith (even better than the Walt Disney World version my husband says) and The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. There is an interesting mix of French and English in this Park.The Studios offer some creative and fun shows. The first one I see is “Animagique,” a unique show where Donald travels into some Disney Cartoons. Mickey Mouse speaks in French. Donald talks in English, though. I think his accent is too difficult to translate. Most of the songs are English. The show includes black light and puppets. “Animagique” and “Cinemagique” both flank the front entrance. “Cinemagique” brings to life the history of movie making. Although much is in French at the beginning, the movie portion is done as a silent movie with the titles in both French and English. Both shows are extremely fun and accommodate large crowds.Be sure to catch part of the High School Musical Parade going through the park. The energy is high, and the crowd is enthusiastic. Parade and show times are available on the “Programme.”The most famous show at the Walt Disney Studios Park fills the back. Walt Disney World brought a version of the Moteurs . . . Action ! Stunt Show Spectacular to Florida, but the original is in Paris. Like most of the productions here, the show is mainly in French. The seating is for 4,000 people, though, so when a show is going on, run to favorite rides. Walt Disney Studios Park offers the Studio Tram Tour: Behind the Magic as well.After three fun-filled Disney days, I climb aboard the RER and go to Paris for another adventure."
50,“Wonderful experience”,"I visited Paris in May 2009 and had a wonderful time. The transportation is easy to use and can take it just about anywhere. The Louvre is a major attraction and you definitely need a lot of time in order to try to see all of it. One of my favorite places was Notre Dame. The Eiffel Tower was a great sight, especially at night when the lights flicker. People were nice and the food was great as well."
50,“Peering into Paris”,"Recently returned from a three week interlude in a rented apartment on Rue St Louis, on the Ile St Louis in Paris, France.This trip was deeply rejuvenating in a way I can't recall. It left me with a sense of peace, stillness and joy. I feel so blessed to have experienced Paris in this manner.Rather than rushing through the city, hitting all the ""must-see"" attractions, punctuated with delicious meals, we slowly, carefully and thoroughly explored different districts throughout Paris.The Parisians were incredibly friendly, helpful, and informative, and I don't speak any French. By greeting every person ""Bon Jour Madame!"" and a lot of pleases, thank yous, and a few broken phrases; combined with a HUGE smile plastered on my face, I got along just fine.In addition to the highlights every guide book will mention, we also found particular excitement in:1) Exploring the Flea Market (Marche Aux Puces St. Ouen de Clignacourt). Loads of neat things to be seen from antique Venetian glass mirrors, to antique 18th century golden wood mirrors, to chandeliers that were 50 feet high (that is not a typo) to end tables fashioned from parts of airplane wings & engines2) Parisian Open Air food market - we went to the one on Boulevard Raspail....packed with stands, lots of energy and a vibrant place!! We visited stalls of local fruits, vegetables, cheeses, eggs, meats, wines, herbs, crepes, honey, fish, seafood, and homemade baked goods. Absolutely a DELIGHT!3) Cafe BizArt for live music on Tuesday nights! We were able to see American folk singer, Brandon Pusey perform along with some other performers. Completely free, small bar, and fantastic experience. There are some musicians who appear every Tuesday, and then lots of other professional musicians drop by to ""jam"" together! One gentleman brought a holster of harmonics...I think 9 harmonicas!!! Another brought a fiddle!! Others with acoustic guitar, or electric guitar...Entirely fun & lots of songs in English---That's just a few hours of how we spent 3 weeks, but perhaps gives a flavor of another way to explore the city. Balancing the must-see attractions (and I visited many of those too!!!) with these local venues at a leisurely pace definitely provided me with a unique learning experience and a memorable vacation."
50,“Paris in 2 days!”,"My husband and I visited Paris and Rome for our 2nd anniversary. We only had 2 days in Paris before leaving for Rome and we were nervous about not being able to enjoy it, as it would be short.The trip was incredible. We stayed in a 2 star hotel that was clean and comfortable, within walking distance to the Place d' Itale, one of the major metro stations. The metro was easy to use and fast. We were about 10 minutes from the eiffel tour and the louvre using the metro. It saved us alot of time and money by using the trains.Using Frommer's Day by Day guide, we planned a tour of the city ourselves. We were able to walk from destination to destination using our map, and stayed as long or as little as we wanted to in each area. We were able to see the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tour, Seine river boat cruise, and many other spots along the way. We spent alot of time stopping for coffee or wine at the many outdoor cafes which was wonderful."
50,“Paris....City of dreams”,"I have been to Paris several times and fall in love with it everytime. I love everything about this city: The Eiffel Tower, Notre Dam, walking along the Seine, the restaurants"
50,“Paris in the summer”,"Paris in the summer is just unforgettable. The Sun will not set until 10:30pm and you can still walk in the streets until 1am, 2am, 3am and still see children walking with their parents, old people drinking coffee, eating a baguete and reading their newspaper...young people chatting and laughing on the bridges over the Senna..it's amazing. The energy of the city just gets into you.In the morning, get your baguette and go have your breakfast listening to some live music on the stairs of the Sacre Cour church. It's a great way to start your day.And prepare to walk! Walking is the best way to see every little detail of the beautiful architecture and experiment the city."
50,“The Left Bank was wonderful. Definately staying there again!”,"This was my families second visit to Europe. Both trips were planned by us through websites like Trip Advisor. This trip we stayed in apartments in all the cities we visited, but the apartment in Paris was my favorite! It was on Rue Moufftard on the left bank and I would absolutely stay there again! I think that for my family short stay apartments are the way to go! We got to Paris in time to celebrate Bastille Day and saw the most incredible fireworks show I have ever witnessed!!! Also experienced the ""Running of the Bulls"" in Pamplona, Spain, and all I can say is...WOW what an experience!"
50,“two and a half days...”,"Despite dire warning ahead of the trip of that ""gay paris"" is in fact boring and rude, Paris turned out to be a lovely experience. We had asked for a Paris volunteer guide and he took us on a walk around the sunday market as well as the National Library. It's so open, the skyline's gorgeous anywhere you go, and the public places are so full of people just enjoying being outside and being with each other, it's touching in a way... Definitely a good visit and will want to take my mom with me next time. PS. the metro is so easy, Paris is so small you can get anywhere in 10 minutes"
40,“The Eiffel Tower”,"Paris was part of my 15 Day Scenic Tour itinerary and a visit to the Eiffel Tower was the highlight of this city. Paris at night was illuminated by the eiffel tower's light and the moon shining that evening was a beauty to behold. We went on the Seine river cruise going under the 24 bridges in Paris and I was just mesmerized. It was a perfect night, clear skies...so romantic"
50,"“Paris - A Beautiful, Must Visit Destination”","Paris is an absolutely stunning city with incredible vistas, delicious food and wine, and amazing attractions. Don't miss the touristy, but oh so necessary to visit, Eiffel Tower (but only go to the second observation level - Paris is a flat city and being too high up you miss a lot!), Arc de Triomph (ascend the steps to this for beautiful views of the Champs Eslyes), and Notre Dame (again, climb the 400+ stairs for an incredible view of the city!). You also have to visit Sacre Couer in the Montmatre neighborhood of Paris as well as Saint Chappelle for its stunning stained glass windows. Art lovers should definitely check out the Musee d'Orsay (in an old Paris train station), Musee Rodin (see the Thinker as well as his other sculptures), the Pompidou Center (for modern art), and of course, the Louvre (Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Napolean's Apartment)! If time allows, a side trip (easily accessible on the RER trains) to Versailles is wonderful. As the stories go, Parisians can be a bit snobbish, but trying a little French goes a long way! Also, it seems that virtually all of them smoke - so be ready for that."
50,“Family Trip to Paris”,"The four of us (two teenagers and two adults) spent a week in Paris this summer. We rented an apartment near the Canal St. Martin in the 11th and did most of the usual tourist things. That was all good--how can the Eiffel Tower not astound?--but the best part for all of us was the Velib bicycle rental system. We went all over, night and day, and really felt engaged with the city. Well, there was also the fireworks at the Eiffel Tower on Bastille Day--that was pretty astonishing, too."
50,"“Paris, Je T'aime”","Recently we returned from our trip to Paris where we celebrated our 28th wedding anniversary. I'm ecstatic! I'm completely in love - what a city!It's not that it's just plainly beautiful (I've seen plenty of beautiful cities in my life), it's something in the Parisian atmosphere that makes it special and unique. We've been to Buenos Aires (the Paris of South America) which definitely looks like Paris in some neighborhoods, but it's just not the same. I love everything about Paris: its streets, cafes, museums, numerous ""jardins"", churches, food, art galleries, boutiques, landmarks, etc..I felt like I already knew the city by the time I got there. I had the sense of ""deja vu"" with Paris though I've never been there before.The City of Light is truly magnificent, and I'm not ashamed to say it out-loud: Paris, Je T'aime!We stayed at the rented apartment on the left bank in St-Germain-des-Pres. After reading on TripAdvisor about different rent companies, we decided to go with Thierry Faradji's Paris Best Lodge. The studio we rented was, in my opinion, in the best Parisian neighborhood. Paris is a city for walking and St-Germain is one of the most enjoyable places to stroll. It has it all: blocks lined with upscale art galleries, designer boutiques, fine art museums, numerous cafes, the oldest church in Paris, and so on. Our studio was located within 5-min walk to Louvre, 10-min to Notre Dame, 2-min to Seine and the oldest bridge in Paris - Pont Neuf.We devoted seven full days to exploring Paris and one entire day to the splendid Chateau de Versailles. It gave us the adequate amount of time to see everything we planned but in a relaxed way. We were able to stay for a wedding ceremony in the exquisite St-Etienne du Mont church, relax in the Luxembourg Gardens, do the people watching, sit in front of Basilica Sacre-Coeure listening to the street musicians, and just enjoy every single minute of being in this amazing city. Having said that, we still usually walked 8-10 hours every day.The weather was just gorgeous - very warm and sunny (between 75F and 85F).We climbed everything there is to climb and were rewarded with the unbelievable views of this fasinating city: Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame were my favorite climbs, though Arc de Triomphe and Sacre-Coeure were also wonderful. We did the traditional 1-hour Seine cruise and fully enjoyed it.We visited Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Musee de l'Orangerie, Musee Cluny, Musee Cognacq-Jay, Musee du Parfum, did a tour of magnificent Opera Garnier. We strolled both islands numerous times, visited gorgeous St-Chapelle that looks like a jewel box, spent a couple of hours in the Modernist suburb of Paris - La Defense, visited two historic cemeteries: Montmartre and Pere Lachaise, Palaice de Justice, Les Invalides, Champ-Elysees, Place de la Concorde, Place Vendome, Marais, Latin Quarter, Pompidou Center with it's whimsical Stravinsky fountain, Place des Vosges, Maison de Victor Hugo, and so much more.Are you getting bored? If you haven't been to Paris, I understand these names don't mean a lot to you. But if you've ever experienced this stunning city, it's like having a ""randevu"" with your lover. Just the mention of it makes you exited!For our anniversary celebration we've made a reservation at ""Le Relais de I'Isle"" - currently N5 at the Trip Advisor's list of restaurants in Paris. The foie gras and the escargot were out of this world!The next evening we enjoyed the Firework Show at Versailles. The photography wasn't allowed there but it was truly a spectacle of rare grandeur.Somehow, our first two days of photographing Paris got erased (mind you the best views from the top of Notre Dame, some part of Montmartre, most of night Paris with the magnificent views of Pyramids, and so much more). I feel like it's a message Paris is sending to me: come back and recapture these images. There's also a mystery that I'd like to solve: how in world the Parisian girls look so stunning with no make-up and a hair in a knot? How do they toss a scarf around their neck and have it look amazing? So I'm truly looking forward to revisiting this amazing city. Au revoir, mon cheri Paris! I'll be back."
20,“Eiffel Tower”,"So when we went it was super hot. Despite the heat, the lines to get up the tower were ridiculous. On our walk to the tower, we endured no less than 4 scam attempts, which was cute at first -- and expected in France, but after a while just became really annoying. Seriously guys -- how many times does someone happen to find a gold ring in front of me within the space of 30 minutes.The tower, by itself was of course beautfiul. And would recommend finding a nice setting in the park, on a nice day, and just enjoying the view and the atmosphere. Any restaruant you find with a view -- expect to pay a premium. But if you can just take a sandwhich or a picnic and bring it with you -- it's well worth the view. Especially at night."
50,“Paris - the city of romance”,"This was my second visit to Paris but trust me, every time it feels I am seeing it for the first time.Coming from the hectic US lifestyle, I always stand to admire the carefree laidback lifestyle in Paris. It wants me to make Paris more than a vacation destination. It begs me to make it my home.Take one advice - Don't join the tourist crowd or tours. The best way to live the Parisian lifestyle it get on the subway and explore the city.You get to taste the real essence by joining the daily commuters, visiting the French markets, trying roadside crepes.Top travel advice to Paris-1. Buy the city pass. It worth it and saves you plenty of money. It gets you also to Versailles.2. Do the Eiffel Tower at day and night to watch the lights3. Climb the Arc de Triomphe and walk Champ de Elysees. Do it early evening and savor the locals going about their business.4. With the city pass do Louvre and Orsay museums.Socialize with art students and try your French speaking skills.Bonjour"
50,“Our Paris Honeymoon”,"Paris is one of the best places to go on a honeymoon - the adventure, excitement and romance all add up to a great experience! Definitely check out the classics, like the Eiffel Tour, the Arc de Triumphe and the Jardin de Toulleries. I especially enjoyed the Notre Dame, and walking up the towers for the tour was worth the pain in your legs! The Crypte isn't that interesting though. Other excellent spots are the Musee Rodin, Musee d'Orsay and the Jardin du Luxembourg. The Musee Rodin has a lovely outdoor sculpture display, which is a wonderful way to spend a beautiful afternoon. One overrated place is definitely the Louvre. Too crowded and not worth all the trouble to see the Mona Lisa. Definitely recommend taking a dinner riverboat cruise on the Seine. I also recommend going on a tour of Versailles."
50,“My favorite city.”,"I just returned from my 4th year in a row trip to Paris, France, in September.Paris is my most favorite city in the world. It is full of life and there is so much to see and do and eat!I am never disappointed when I travel to Paris.I stay for one month each September. This year some friends went with me and I acted as ""tour guide."""
50,“Paris”,"A girlfriend and I went to Paris on a whim back in April of this year. We did only go for 2 days but it was worth every minute! April is still a little chilly I did have a light coat with me but also wore gloves and bought a scarf to keep warm.If you've never been to France I would suggest some type of book to help you along the way. The only place we got really confused was the Metro, we almost missed the flight back to the US because we were so lost at the station. We eventully found some Police to help but it was still hard to understand them - hehe.With the 2 days we had we stayed in a quiet and accomadating area off the Edgar Quinet Metro which is in Southern Paris. Nice area with great restaurants and nice people.We did a ton of walking in those 2 days! We did take the Metro to the Eiffel Tower and then just walked all around that area. If you don't have small children or any conditions that would hurt you to take the stairs up the Tower I suggest that. The wait lines to take the elevators up are 2 - 3 hrs depending on how busy they are. When we went it was 20 minutes in line to take the stairs to the 1st level. But I think the lines where pretty down when we went. Then ended up taking the Metro from the Tower to the Louvre and walked up to the Gardens and the Arc de Triomphe then walked back to the Eiffel Tower to watch it at night. We didn't get to do much more than that because of our time but it was great! I loved every minute of this trip and hope to go back someday to explore more inside and outside of Paris."
50,“My favorite place in Europe was PARIS!!”,"I was pleasantly surprised once I arrived in Paris, FR. My boyfriend and I went on 16 day trip through Europe and our last stop was Paris. I loved it. The people were way more friendly than I had anticipated and the city was beautiful. It just so happened to be fashion week while we were there. I was in heaven. You must see a Cabaret and eat crepes while you are there. The Louve was probably my favorite part. I would suggest signing up for a tour guide because they are able to take you to the most important pieces of art in half the time it would take for you to find it. Our guide also pointed out some really unique thinks that I may not have noticed on my own."
50,“Favorite City in the World”,"If you can't find lots of things to love about Paris, then it's not the city's fault. Yes, it's a big city. Yes, it's crowded with traffic, busy people, and the occasional crime (pickpockets, most notably). But, with the immense variety, beauty, history, culinary delights, shopping, and just culture in general, you have to be willing to put up with some inconvenience.I have been to Paris every year for the past six years. This year I am going to Rome instead, and I'm already grieving. I always go in the early spring, when the lines are short, the air is crisp, and the city is just coming alive after the dreary winter. Throw a scarf around your neck, jump on the metro (the best public transportation anywhere), and explore the city. If it's your first time, then do the normal touristy things--there are plenty of them. But go back or stay long enough to explore the quieter neighborhoods and the smaller museums.Don't be worried about the language barrier. You'll get by. Most people working in shops and restaurants speak passable English. Mostly, just soak up the city. Learn enough (by reading Rick Steves or any number of other detailed books--Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, Access Paris) to understand cafe culture, how to use the metro, safety tips, the layout of the neighborhoods, etc., and then just GO. I'll get back just as soon as I can."
50,"“2 days, 2 nights, from Montmartre to La Tour Eiffel...”","2 days is definitely not enough to see and experience all of this incredible city, but you will still have random encounters with Parisians, will be able to see most of the city if you plan well and will fall in love with it if you admire the architecture as I do. And if you are a naive single girl you will be had by some hobo in the Jardins de Tuilrie who will make it look like he'd find a golden ring right under your feet and will ask you to take is he is not allowed due to being a part of some religious sect, but in return will ask for some change...(according to Parisians ""J'atais eu"")..or if you are a single female traveler looking for adventure and romance you will meet a handsome restaurant owner who will be able to decipher that you don't like eating out alone by the unhappy expression on your face and who will invite you to share a glass of champagne with him and his friends...and maybe take you out clubbing and more..And no matter what they say about Parisians...they can be charming and communicative.Definitely, see Montmartre and read the book ""Paris spend less, see more"" by Pauline Frommer before you go."
50,“Paris--exceeded all expectations”,"We were in Paris for 2 nights last week as part of a visit to my son in Germany. I had been here before but it was my husband's first visit and I wanted him to see and do it all. He is not interested in museums so that saved us a lot of time. We wandered around the Louvre area and saw the pyramid of glass but did not go in. We were looking for the tourist office near there which we found out, after much searching and sore feet, was no longer there. It didn't matter though because we were able to absorb much of the Parisian mystique but just walking. We happened upon the bottom of the pyramid made famous in the Dan Brown book so not a total bust. More importantly we happened upon a fun cafe with waiters that were a stitch and tolerant of my high school French skills. The Metro makes everything so accessible and close. We next went to Notre Dame and went inside to view the splendor. Another cafe stop (on a boat in the Seine) to view the church from a different angle. Wandered the Left Bank for a while and another bistro to watch the Parisians and tourists at the end of their work day. Took the Metro to the Eiffel Tower for a night view but there is no bar for just a drink. You must make a reservation at one of the 2 restaurants to sit and view Paris from on high. We decided to cross the Seine and look at the Tower from the Tulleries Garden and came upon an opportunity to take a night boat ride down the Seine. What a wonderful way to see both the Left and Right Bank. Capped the evening off with a small dinner at a restaurant near our hotel. The time difference made it hard to go to bed at night and hard to get up in the morning. We thought pasta and yummy French food might help.The next day's plan was to go on the jump on, jump off bus. What a great way to see the city and hear the stories behind the buildings and monuments. Had lunch on the Champs d""Ellyese pretending to be a Parisian on a leisurely lunch (until they heard my French, which gave us away) . That evening we took the 284 steps up to thetop of the Arch d'Triomphe to see the Paris lights at night. Another wonderful dinner near our hotel capped off the evening. We missed a few things on our list but it was more than I could have hoped for as far as an overview trip goes. My husband enjoyed himself immensely and commented that a friend had told him Paris was a very dirty city and he was surprised how clean and nice it was. I don't think he was that excited about going but he is already talking about when we go back. so I think Paris has another fan."
50,“Paris the City of more than just lights”,"I adore Paris, it has become more than a city to me. It represents everything that is beautiful in the world and elegant. I spent the first few days of my visit getting lost in the streets, stopping into ever cafe and pastry tasting and scouring the flea markets for hidden treasures. We toke a day trip to Versailles in the second week and were speechless, we twirled through the courtyard pretending to be Marie Antoinette at a party. By night we would take picnics of wine, baguettes and brie to the base of the Eiffel tower and just awe at its delight in the cities skyline. There are a million places to go and things to see but if you take Paris at your own pace you will find its magic."
50,“Paris adventure Sept.18 through 26 2009”,"Loved your recommendation for Bike About Tours. Took it the first day and had a great time. Not difficult at all for a gal in her '70's. Rue duBuci is the place to be on the left bank of the Seine. Lots of great outdoor cafes and street music in the evenings. Stayed at Millesime on Rue Jacob - a small fine bouteque hotel -only 22 rooms - immaculate but small rooms, big bathrooms. The Champagne Tour to Eperney was worth the day's journey - about 1 1/2 hour to get there., Your information was our best guide. Thanks. D."
20,“Bang for the Buck”,"The best way to 'do' Paris is broke. If your aren't broke to start with you will be by the end. The hotel chains are doing their level best to offer enticing deals to attract the tourist. Travel companies - especially Eurostar, the easy-peasy train journey from London - are bending over backwards with offers to get you to come. But once you are there prices in the French Capital are just eye-poppingly expensive.So pretend to be broke and you will really enjoy the very best this city is famous for. Stroll the boulevards - its a City best seen ambling rather than walking. Join the lovers on the walkways along the River Seine and round its two charming islands. Sit for hours nurse a glass of mineral water in a famous cafe - you wont be moved on, its a Parisian tradition - you've bought the seat. Your soda may have cost $10 but what the heck.We met a lovely couple over from Ohio for a family wedding. After being gouged for their first restaurant dinner they ate every other meal as sandwiches and sodas sitting in the many parks and squares. And guess what? Parisiens actually talked to them!The pound fell below 1 to the Euro last week and as for the dollar if you look you will weep. Lower sales taxes offered by President Sarkozy's government make the locals feel better but make a laughable small difference to visitors. So lock up the wallet. Forget doing Paris on $100 a day. Dont worry. Be Happy. and you will have probably the best Parisian holiday of your lifetime."
50,“Marché Aux Puces Saint-Ouen”,"I dreamed of finding anqtique chocolate molds while in Paris. We took the Métro to porte de clignancourt and a short walk to Rue des Rosiers - 93400 Saint Ouen. We found the charming stalls I had read about - and I wasn't disappointed. There were several shops with bits and pieces of vintage kitchen ware and then I discovered my paradise:The stall of Pierre Heteau: Alley 1, Stand 37; [--]The shop dazzles the eye with fabulous, high quality, shining copper pots. Everywhere! And to my utter delight, the most complete collection of antique chocolate molds I've ever seen. I could have spent hours pouring over the fabulous collection. Pierre is charming, gracious and patient . DId I say charming??Once I made my choice, one vintage rabbit mold and one very old antique hen mold, I learned he only dealt in cash so he gave me very good directions - moslty in sign language as he spoke no English and, alas, I spoke no French - to a cash machine.Cash in hand it took us a while to reconnect ,as he was enjoying an extended lunch hour(s) at Chez Louisette, located near his stall. Luckily I too had dined there (what fun)! and spotted him. When I finally went back into the restaurant to inquire as to when he would open again, he treated me to an espresso and we departed for his shop.His prices were very good - he even gave me an extra little mold and packed everything very carefully.My only words of advise? Carry cash. He will not steal your money...but do keep a close eye on your heart..."
50,“Paris - a fantastic place for a city break!”,"My sister and I have just returned from a short break in Paris and we had a fantastic time! Firstly, this is the first vacation she and I have taken together since we both married and, as we both rather reluctantly have to now own up to being in the middle-age category(!!) readers will realise that is saying something! My sister now lives and works in New York and I have stayed at home in Scotland. She had to travel to Paris for a short business meeting and was incorporating a visit to Scotland to catch up with family and suggested that I go to Paris with her and we stay over for a few days and see the sights. Although I have visited France a couple of times previously, including a trip to Eurodisney on the outskirts of Paris, this was the first time I had seen Paris itself. What a fantastic city it is. I did some research on line in advance of our trip, including on Trip Advisor of course, and decided to order us each a Paris Pass. Although the pass is quite expensive (we had a 4 day one) in hindsight it is the best thing we could have done. The pass covers you for entry to most of the main attractions, travel on the Metro, RER and buses, special offers and discounts in stores and restaurants, and a couple of special attractions such as a river cruise, a guided tour of the opera, wine tasting, etc. I would highly recommend that anyone visiting Paris, particularly for the first time, gets one of these passes. A definite 'must have' for your trip is comfortable footwear ....... we walked for miles on our first day and, even with the comfy shoes plus a spare pair in my bag to change into during the day (yes really!) we still ended up with really sore feet! That is why on Day 2 we decided to use our Metro pass to get around! The Metro couldn't be easier to use and we were able to hop on and off to visit the attractions on our itinerary that day - we still did lots of walking too though hence sore feet again! I would recommend a visit to the Louvre - it is an amazing place and of course everyone wants to see the Mona Lisa! However, you would need a day to do it justice really. As we were trying to squeeze everything into our few days we only spent a couple of hours there but going back to spend a day there is definitely on my list of 'things to do before I die'! L'Orangerie is also worth a vist and the Museum D'Orsay (which also has a fantastic restaurant where I had a delicious dessert and coffee). Notre Dame had to be seen of course but, be warned, climbing the stairs to the top almost finished me off! I think there are something like 400 steps and, as it is a windy staircase, I felt dizzy by the time I got up there - but once at the top it was all worthwhile as we had some of the most amazing views over Paris. Eating out in Paris is a pleasure - I just loved the 'cafe culture' and everything was just so tasty! We never ate breakfast at our hotel as we enjoyed going out and finding breakfast ourselves at one of the many street cafes - croissants have never tasted so good! Neither my sister or I speak French fluently although we both studied it at school. However, I dug out my trusty French phrase book a few weeks in advance of our trip so that I could brush up on my French. I was so glad that I did that as, although most of the Parisians working in the tourist areas speak English well, I think they do appreciate it if we at least try to converse with them in their own language - and it is such a beautiful language I really enjoyed speaking it a little - although I am sure I must have made a few faux pas!! Oh, and one last thing ......... I have never seen so many good looking men in one city!! My sister and I couldn't help noticing how well groomed the French men are, young and old alike - my husband didn't seem too impressed though when I mentioned it to him! All in all I would highly recommend Paris for a city break. The few days that I spent there have whetted my appetite for another visit - there is so much more to see and do and I definitely want to go back again soon."
40,“you need small change when you arrive at Gare Du Nord”,"We had a great time in Paris, but a couple of tips:If you arrive via Eurostar and want to get a taxi there is usually a sizeable queue. Also, there are normally a couple of taxi queue stewards, who I assume are official, but take your bags to the next available taxi, but then demand a tip in quite an aggressive way (i.e. standing in a position that means you can't close the taxi door!). As we had only just arrived the smallest amount of money we had was 5 euros - so we had no choice other than to give him that, bar driving away with him virtually attached to the taxi......so get some small changeSecondly, we know to our cost - leave PLENTY of time to get to Gare Du Nord in time for your train. Even though our outward taxi only took 15 minutes to get to our hotel (Residence Henri IV), it took 85 minutes to get back, due to complete traffic chaos!! So I would recommend getting local knowledge about any possible parades or protests that may delay your journey."
50,“Great City Break”,"Just got back from 3 days in Paris. A city that has to be or should be on everyone's list to visit at some time.3 days was plenty another day would have been good but don't think I could spend a week there.All the typical tourist traps are worth a visit, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, Arc de Triomphe , Champs Ellesse, Musee du Louvre , River Seine .Also we did the Free Montmartre walk, great experience and a trip up the Montparnasse Tower at night fall was superb."
40,“my favourite place in france”,Paris france is a exciting city. Quite easy to get around using the Metro with all the tourist maps available. The buses travel a lot of different locations but a bit difficult to understand if a person not know the areas and layout of the city etc. Only thing its generally quite expensive In Paris overall but lot of good seafood restaurants around which i thought were good value especially compared for instance to London. Very happy to spend some weekends there and many reasonable priced hotels available . You just have to search. As i have done as i am only a pensioner in England and that is no fortune .
50,"“Paris, Je t'aime”","The first time I visited Paris, it was in the middle of a 'euro trip', where myself and some friends travelled from Brussels to Paris and then onto Rome and Venice.While I had a good time in Paris, I didn't consider it the best part of the trip. However, over the next year or so, Paris was the one city that my mind kept going back to.The city has a way of sucking you in and not letting you go, even if you don't realise it at first. While there, I felt like I belonged, I felt like I had lived there for years - I was only there a few days.I think this stems from the fact that Paris is just so easy going, walking around the city, it feels very relaxed.If you read guides about the city, you'll often hear that the french are rude, and that on the metro you should protect your belongings, cause if you don't you'll get mugged.While I'm not saying you shouldn't be careful, I don't think there's a need to be extra careful in Paris over any other major city and as for the people being rude, everyone I met while I was there were extremely helpful and nice.We stayed at the Aloha Hostel, which was a great base for us. As it's only couple minutes from a metro stop (as are most places).While there the second time, we went to a gig at ""Le Kibélé"", a bar/restaurant with a venue downstairs. The venue is extremely small, but it brought you closer to the artists playing.I've rambled a lot, I know. But if you've ever, even for a second, considered visiting Paris, I'd recommend you stop thinking about it and go for it. You won't regret it. I can't wait to visit again."
50,“Louvre & Notre Dame at Night”,"Since we wanted to totally experience the City of Lights, we visited the Louvre and Notre Dame late at night. It was a wonderful experience and highly recommend it with kids. First of all, the Metro rides were quite safe. We went to the Louvre at 10:00 p.m. Obviously, it was close but it was quiet and we could peep into the windows and thru the glass pyramid. The kids played around the water - with great view of the well lit ferries wheel at Tuiluries. We were at Notre around 10:00 p.m. also - we could still enter the the church and there was a movie on about the building of Notre Dame. This was quite informative. Outside, there were lots of people performing - so all the kids had fun watching the break dancers and the flame throwers."
10,"“PARIS- CITY OF THIEVES, NOT LIGHT”","First let me say I will write a favorable review for the hotel, this review pertains to the less than friendly people of Paris who will steal you blind. We traveled with a group of 22 to Paris for 5 days in Sept. Of the 22, 6 different couples or singles were victims of theft during their stay. Three different members of our group were the victims of pickpockets. Two occurred on the Metro between Concorde and the Louvre (Palais Royal) stations. On both occassions, at separate times, couples were traveling to the Louvre and the Metro was packed with people pushing, shoving etc. which is normal for a packed railcar. One male member of our group had his wallet (which he had placed in his front pocket for what he thought was more security) stolen either while on the car or when getting off at the Louvre Metro stop. Loss included drivers license, credit cards, a great deal of Euros and other things. The second victim of a pickpocket was a female member of our group who, while in the subway, had someone remove her billfold from a zipped purse. She too lost a large amount of cash in Euros, credit cards etc. Both victims noticed the theft after walking just a few paces from the Metro stop. Two ruined vacations and a half day spend calling credit card companies to cancel the cards. One other male member of our group had his wallet stolen from his pants pocket while underneath the Eiffel Tower, which if you know is very crowded at times with people ""bumping"" into you while in line for tickets, food etc. Vacation No. 3 ruined, similar losses as the first two victims. The remaining 3 victims were couples, so it affected 6 persons. Two had multiple items stolen from their hotel rooms including cameras, purchased items etc. The third couple came to see the Eiffel Tower light show at night, were sitting in the grass on the Champ de Mars, they were approached by a male who offered to sell them beer or wine (it is common for folks to bring wine to the lawn and picnic while watching the tower at night. As the couple was distracted by the one purported salesman, the second member of the thievery team grabbed her purse tearing the strap away from her as he fled. Enough vacations ruined here for you to get the message? Invest in a money belt or bodyguard. When talking to others during our visit we learned others too were the victims of theft. Some of our members reported the incidents to the authorities, who basically told them it happens hundreds of times a week and probably even more because most tourists dont take the time to report the thefts or dont know where to go to report it. Basically the attitiude was that they were sorry it happened, but it is so very common that there is not much they can do. My entire groups advice? visit another city besides France, we WILL NOT be back. CITY OF THIEVES IS OFF OUR TRAVEL LIST FOREVER."
40,“Paris”,"At first glance when you arrive in Paris I must admit, it looks pretty dirty and not welcoming at all. However once you get past the numerous beggars and make your way to the tourist attractions, you forget all that and see the absolute beauty there.The Louvre was our first point of call and we were blown away by how much was there was to see. The Mona Lisa was a must see obviously, but be warned that everyone makes their way there and it is very crowded. Also wear comfy shoes as you will be walking miles!! Avoid the cafe and take a bottle of water if you don't want to spend silly money on coffeeNotre Dame and Sacre Coeur were absolutely breathtaking and we spent a long time looking round both. We found some of the tourists at ND to be very disrespectful and noisy, taking photos when asked not to etc. At SC however there was a rather stern gentleman who shushed at people and kept the noise down, therefore the spirtual atmosphere was very powerful.The Eiffel tower is a must at night. We went up just as the sun was starting to set, so we saw sunrise and then the city light up as it became dark. At the bottom we were suprised to see a fantastic display of twinkling lights on the tower which apparently happens every hour.after we had seen Sacre Couer we got the little trailer bus (5 euros each) which gives you a running commentary through Monmartre and takes you to Pigalle.. not for the faint hearted!! Lots of sex shops and bars with scantily clad ladies trying to entice business inside.If you want great food at reasonable prices then go to the Latin Quarter. A lovely place to eat and also walk along the Seine hand in hand browsing the market sellers goods.The metro is very easy to use. The Gare du Nord and the Gare de l'est were a little intimidating due to so many beggars and homeless people, you have to be quite firm.All in all a lovely city to visit full of history and beautiful places to visit."
10,“Premium Tours - Now Tell Me Again What I Was Paying For ??”,"We were supposed to get a tour-provided champange lunch at the Eiffel Tower, but instead ate crappy pizza paid out of our own pockets on the second level standing up at dirty tables. We would have been much better off eating at one of the nicer restaurants on the first level, but they failed to tell us that.The tour guide was a lovely young French lady named Charlotte (see the other review of her on TripAdvisor), but unfortunately she was so soft spoken we only caught about 30% of what she said.At the Louvre we all waited to get started for 20 minutes while she was in the bathroom. When we finally got started, she gave long boring explanations for only 2 exhibits when we only had 40 minutes to visit. So we we finally broke off on our own, tired of being stuck with her.At the start of the Louvre tour she was adamant that we all meet at 5:40 else we would have to find our own way back to London at our own expense. Then she was 10 minutes late herself (I was panicking).When we got back to London, we rode around in the shuttle bus for an hour and a half with a daredevil bus driver. Got back to the hotel very tired and late.Originally I missed the scheduled trip due to a miscommunication with my travel agent. Premium Tours couldn't have cared less. But I was in London with a oncein a lifetime chance to see Paris, so I rebooked. For the tour itself, I was not provided opportunity to communicate beforehand what hotel to pick me up, which would have avoided the miscommunication.Needless to say, I won't book with Premium Tours ever again."
50,“Detailed Trip Report...first time in Paris”,"At the outset, I just need to say a huge thank you to everyone who posts on the Trip Advisor forums. I have gleaned a wealth of information from everyone here. How thankful I am for a community of fellow travelers who are ready and willing to share advice.I never dreamed of ever going to Paris. It was never on my list of places I thought I'd actually have the chance to visit. But...because of my amazing family it became a reality for me! My son who just graduated from college happened to be working at a music festival in Fontainebleau this summer. My husband thought it would be a fun trip for me to join my son in France...so he sent me on a solo trip across the ocean! I ended up spending 3 nights in Fontainebleau and then at the end of the music festival my son & I took the bus/train to Paris and we spent 4 nights there. I am certain that this trip will be one of the highlights of my life.Before going, I gathered a TON of information. My resources:""Paris: Made by Hand,"" Pia Jane Bijkerk""Authentic Bistros of Paris,"" Thomazeau & Ageorges""Markets of Paris,"" Dixon & Ruthanne Long""Best Wine Bars & Shops of Paris,""""Pudlo Paris,"" Gilles Pudlowski""Eating & Drinking in Paris,"" Andy Herbach*this last book was a LIFE-saver for me, as I love to eat but speak no French...this book is a menu translator and restaurant guide.All the books made a world of difference in how I approached what we did and where we went. Plus the first 4 books have fabulous photography! The other item that proved incredibly helpful was my little Paris moleskin book that I bought at Barnes & Noble before coming. It had every map I needed, it's so well-divided into sections to write my favorite places I wanted to go, and it's a great size to tuck into my purse...it has become a real treasure to me! And now it's filled with my journal entries from the trip.We arrived in Paris by train from Fontainebleau and everything went very smoothly except navigating through the train/metro with our luggage was pretty difficult. Lots of stairs and we each had 2 rolling suitcases. We managed it...but it's a miracle I didn't injure myself trying to lug those things up and down the many many flights of stairs. After living and learning through that experience, I made a note to self that at the end of the trip we would take a private taxi back to CDG for our flight home. :)Upon finally arriving at street level I felt as though I had stepped into a dream. I cannot put into words how overwhelming it was to be in such a lovely, lovely place! The architecture, the lovely shops, the bustle of the streets, the beauty all around. It really swept me away. I had to just stop and stand still to take it all in. We made our way from the metro station to our hotel, which was even better than I had expected it to be.We stayed at a hotel that really was more of a bed & breakfast. It had 10 rooms and was *wonderful* in every way. Perfect for my son and me. It was right across the river from Notre Dame and is called Les Degres de Notre Dame. I found it here on Trip Advisor, although you have to email the hotel directly to book a reservation. It was an awesome place to stay because it was so intimate and charming and was in such a great location in the Latin Quarter. Breakfast was included and we thoroughly enjoyed staying there. I won't say much more about the hotel here, as I plan to do a review in the hotel section of TA.Paris Trip August 2-6, 2009-Day One-We arrived at our hotel around 3:00 in the afternoon and since we were just so close to Notre Dame we quickly made our way across the river to hear the Sunday organ recital that is at 4:00 pm. On our walk there we just *had* to stop into one of the many bakeries and grab a pastry. So we each got a chocolate eclair to enjoy while walking. Upon arriving at Notre Dame my heart just sank when I saw the line to get in...but it moved so quickly that it was no problem at all. We had time to get settled and take it in before the free recital began. What a wonderful treat it was to hear such a beautiful instrument in such a majestic place. It was lovely to just sit and be so refreshed after an afternoon of travel. We spent time after the concert to take in all the beauty of the place and get some photos. Then we wandered along the Seine enjoying the booksellers set up along the river. So much to see! The variety of books, art & postcards made it quite interesting to go from vendor to vendor...just wandering and taking it all in. Later in the trip I ended up visiting the book sellers a number of times and bought some fabulous antique postcards. Many had lovely handwriting on them and were just gorgeous. They were only 1 Euro a piece and proved to be some of my daughter's favorite souvenirs that I brought her. She is a Graphic Design major in college and is obsessed with fonts, handwriting and all things paper. I only regret not buying more of them!After wandering along the river and getting over the fact that I was actually in Paris, we went to an amazing place for dinner. I had read about it in the Pudlo guide so we were confident that it would be something we would like. It was conveniently located in the 4th and is named Le Trumilou. Fabulous, fabulous. I had Tarragon Chicken, assorted cheese plate w/ baguette, Cote d' Rhone and Creme Caramel for dessert. We were there with a group of musicians who my son knew from Fontainebleau and everyone was very happy with their meal. Really comfortable place to dine.After our leisurely dinner we wandered our way outdoors in time to accidentally catch the twinkling light show of the Eiffel Tower at 10 pm. It was just magical and I felt so spoiled! We then walked past Notre Dame again so that we could get some nightime photos and then made our way to our hotel. After the climb up 5 flights on the narrow, spiral-staircase we were ready to relax! Yet, there was one more treat in store for us. As we got ready for bed and turned off the light we looked out our window and there was one of the towers of Notre Dame all lit up in plain view. It was our nightlight every night and was a magical view that I shall never forget. I could see it from my bed! And the funny thing is that I kind of assumed it was lit all night. Well no...at 1:00 am every night the lights go out. Not all at once mind you. They go out switch by switch by switch. We laughed out loud the first time we saw it happen! We just never would've guessed it would work that way. :)-Day Two-Our goal was to be in line at the Louvre by 9:30, so we went down for our fabulous breakfast around 8 am. Oh my word. We were treated to fresh-squeezed orange juice...squeezed in a really unique machine right in front of us! The juice was the best I've ever had (and I used to live in Florida!). We also enjoyed baguette, croissants, jams, 2 kinds of cheese, tea and coffee that gave me the best start ever to my day. Nicole, the very kind and helpful hostess there makes a small pitcher of steamed/frothed milk to go with the separate pitcher of very strong coffee. I could mix it just the way I wanted and I just have to say it was heaven. The coffee was over-the-top wonderful. And I'm really picky.So, with just the start we needed to our day we walked about 10-15 minutes to the Louvre. Beautiful walk all along the river in the beauty of the morning. We arrived to virtually NO line at the museum. I was stunned! My son had been there last summer and knew that if we went early we would avoid lines...but we really hit it perfectly. We spent from 10 am to 3:30 there. I won't even bother talking about it. Everyone knows about the Louvre. I will say that it was a perfect length of time for us to take in what we felt we could handle. We did stop around 2 pm to have a sandwich & drink from one of the carts in the food area of the museum. It was good to sit, have a little something and then carry on.Our next stop was a place I was so excited to visit. E. Dehillerin. It is such a wonderful wonderful place for people like my son & me. We absolutely love to cook and this place was a joy to visit. I bought quite a few things there and actually regret not buying more. The quality of the items and prices were so good! And every time I use my crepe pan, my garlic press, my brioche pans, etc. I am reminded of my trip to Paris! It's unlike shopping at any other store because it's meant for professional cooks/restauranteurs. They are happy to sell to the general public, but nothing has prices on it so you have to get some help in looking up the codes and then having a salesperson write up a slip for you to keep track of your items. It was an adventure and I'm just thankful my son speaks French! It was a fun treat to shop in E. Dehillerin.We then wandered our way to different shops that we had learned about in the Paris: Made by Hand book. Astier de Villatte was a highlight and if I ever get to visit Paris again I will save my money so that I can actually buy something the next time I go there! Lovely, lovely shop @ 173 rue St-Honore filled with handmade ceramics, dishes, glasses, jewelry, hand-printed fabrics, furniture, etc. The building where it is was once occupied by a silversmith to Napoleon. Walking down to see the furniture in the basement was an adventure just to see the stairs and the walls and feel the history of the place. We just loved it!By this time we needed to go back to the hotel to drop our purchases from E. Dehillerin and look over our book and decide on a place for dinner. We ended up choosing a really fun place called Balzar, located at 49 rue de Ecoles. It was a little pricey for what we got and our meals were nothing to write home about...but the waiters there were so kind and the ambience was just so much fun that it was worth it. We shared a nice bottle of Cote d' Rhone with dinner and our true highlight was the Profiteroles I had for dessert. They were drenched in chocolate sauce that was made from Valrhona chocolate. I about fell out of my chair when I tasted it. Wonderful!!! Balzar is a hopping place and is great for people-watching. We were glad we ate there. After dinner we wandered for quite awhile all through the 5th & 6th and took in all the sights and sounds of Paris at night.-Day Three-Another fabulous breakfast to start our day and then it was off to the Musee d' Orsay. We stood in line for about 30 minutes to get in...since it was a beautiful summer day we didn't mind a bit. The museum was filled with paintings and sculptures that I had grown up seeing all my life. I was so floored to actually be with them in person that I broke down crying in the first room we went to. Renoir, Cezanne, Monet, Degas, Pissarro, Gauguin. It was just so stunning and lovely. What a treasure. I loved this museum so much. Everything about it was just so refreshing...the size of the galleries, the placement of the art, the lighting, the architecture of the building, everything. We spent about 3 or 4 hours there...stopping for a lovely lunch out on the terrace. It was a great view up there too. Even if you don't want to eat lunch you should walk out on the terrace and take in the view.Next we walked through the Tuilleries and were so refreshed by the beauty of the landscape there. After wandering through the gardens we made our way to the Opera Garnier only to find that it was randomly closed that afternoon. It was not supposed to be. But it was. So, we then decided to just to check out the Church of Madeleine. What a place! It had a very interesting art installation going on there, so we saw that and explored the architecture of the church. It was a nice, quiet place to sit and just ""be"" for a bit. A chance to rest our feet and make a new gameplan for the afternoon.When in doubt, our motto is usually...get something to eat! So, we decided to find Fauchon and learn what all the fuss was about. Oh my! We were sucked in immediately and quickly found ourselves sitting at the counter enjoying 3 different pastries between the 2 of us! It's a really wonderful place if you like gourmet food shops. After Fauchon we decided we should probably check out their competition so we then browsed through Hediard. Again...stunning. We are real ""foodies"", so a place like this is simply a blast to explore. We had a ton of fun there and decided we would have to come back to buy some gifts to take home.We walked around the Madeleine area and then decided to pull out our well-used metro pass and take a ride up to the Montmarte area. Once there we made our way to Sacre Couer, coming in through the back way and NOT up the steps out front. The week previous my son had been there with a friend and his friend had been accosted on the steps. The string-people were trying to do their thing to him (which he was ignorant to) and in the process one of them took his glasses while another of them went for his wallet and ripped the front pocket of his pants in the effort to try and get at the wallet. His friend was pretty shaken up by this...he did end up getting his glasses back by the way. But as a result of that little incident, my son decided he didn't want to bring me to Sacre Couer that way. So...we walked through a really charming and beautiful neighborhood and come around the back side of Sacre Couer. After spending time observing one of their services of Mass, and enjoying the enforced silence and no photography policy (how refreshing!) we went out and relaxed on the front steps and enjoyed all the humanity there. It was truly wonderful. Live music, lots of diversity of people and just a gorgeous time of day...early evening. I could've sat there for hours just enjoying the beauty of looking out over all of Paris. We decided we would make our way down the steps because we were confident in our ability to avoid the scam artists at that point. After an uneventful journey down the long flights of stairs we took the metro to get ourselves in the vicinity of the Arc de Triomphe.We found a charming place to eat that had good food...even though our waiter left a bit to be desired. The restaurant was L'Ecluse @ 15 pl de la Madeleine. We always are careful to order tap water so we're not charged for water, and even though the waiter brought us the normal tap water...it showed up as a charge for bottled water on our check. When he brought out the glasses of wine we ordered, he clearly brought us the wrong stuff. We pointed out his error and with a little discussion he was willing to make things right. My son speaks French, but this man was insistent on speaking English to us. So I'm not sure if he just didn't understand well or what...but in the end at least things were straightened out. It just took a little work is all. After our meal we walked over to the Arc de Triomphe and climbed the bazillion steps to the top. And what a view at night! So glad we did this. If it weren't for all the advice on TA I don't think we would've known to do this. We spent quite awhile up there taking it all in. We went at the very end of the night and it was great. I highly recommend it.After that we took the metro to try and go back to our restaurant from earlier in the trip to enjoy the Profiteroles again. Since we knew the restaurant stayed open late...we thought there would be no problem. So, there we were all ready to go in for our amazing dessert and even though the restaurant was going to be open for at least an hour longer they would not let us come in and order. We were so disappointed! And all we wanted was dessert. But it did not matter. No was the answer. Oh well...at least we tried!! We ended up just wandering the Latin Quarter and landed at a not-so-great place for dessert. I had a crepe and my son had the baba rhum cake. It was just kind of like eating bad diner food...but hey, another chance to live and learn. Exhausted from our full day we plodded back to our room well after midnight and fell asleep before they even turned off the lights at Notre Dame. :)-Day Four-Breakfast and then it was off to Sainte Chapelle to take in the gorgeous stained glass windows in the morning light. Absolutely wonderful! Please treat yourself to this stunning place if at all possible. There is an entrance fee and a security search to get in, but it really is worth the little bit of trouble. If I ever get the chance to go back again I will certainly bring some reading material and just spend some quality time enjoying this quiet and beautiful church. I was so taken aback by the colors and the workmanship and the utter peace that is exuded from this place. All I can really say is WOW.After that we made a return trip to Opera Garnier to catch the 11:30 tour. It was so fabulous. We had a guide who led the tour in English and she did a wonderful job. Her name was Martine and we so enjoyed her! And the Opera House was a fascinating place to tour. I would never have known all about it if not for the tour. Please take the time/money to do a tour if you're at all interested in the place. Just so worth it! What a treasure this place is to the city of Paris.Afterward we made our way back to Fauchon and Hediard to buy gifts for our family back home. We bought various honeys, preserves and chocolate. Wandered more shops, went in search of a few markets I wanted to visit...but due to my error, we got there just after the markets had torn down for the day! So disappointing. We ended up just buying some pizza & quiche to go from a bakery and then took it to a wonderful garden nearby to eat. Afterwards we walked to Luxembourg Gardens and sought some shade for a much needed rest. It was heaven. We napped in chairs near the pond with the toy boats. If I had it to do all over again I would plan to spend an afternoon there with a picnic, a good book, a blanket to sleep on and just do some serious relaxing. It is probably one of the coolest parks we've ever been to. Our time there was short because I was trying to get to a few more shops to buy gifts for my artsy daughter. :) Found just the perfect place thanks to my guide book and ended up buying her some wonderful journals, paper and a little writing book for myself at Melodie Graphiques @ 10 ru du Pont Louis-Phillipe.We then walked along the river again, trying to decide where to go for dinner. But because I forgot to throw the Pudlo guide in my purse we were on our own. We ended up finding a place that was in a cool area, but the food was just marginal. It was Ma Bourgogne in the Place des Vosges. I wouldn't go there again. After dinner we walked along the Seine since it was our last night in Paris. We loved seeing all the people out relaxing and picnicking and playing games. There were really interesting places to sit and lay down by the river and there were lots of fun things going on down at the Paris Plage (the manmade summer beach activity area). We strolled and reflected on our trip, we watched the sunset and walked around under the full moon and were just so grateful for a trip like this. We ambled back toward our hotel, stopping along the way to explore Shakespeare and Company bookstore, and then hitting one last gift shop in the Latin Quarter before climbing the stairs up to our room.We packed all our things and were ready to leave bright and early for the airport the next morning. We had arranged in advance to have a private cab waiting @ 8 am. Our flight was at noon. Things couldn't have gone more smoothly at the airport, except that for some reason the woman at the check-in desk had it in her mind that even though my son & I were traveling together she thought my bags were being sent to a different place. As my suitcases went away on the conveyor belt my son noticed that they had the wrong tags on them, so after a little horsing around the attendant there was able to retrieve them. We had so much time to kill after that, we ended up gathering up the last of our Euros and spent them all at the duty-free wine shop. We really enjoy wine with meals at our house, so this was a fabulous way to use up the rest of our money. The man at the shop assured us that we would each be able to safely carry 3 bottles a piece onto the plane with no problem. And technically he was correct. We could do that. It's just that when we got back to the US, picked up our luggage for customs and then re-checked our luggage for the next leg of our trip...we were not allowed to bring liquids of that size aboard the plane. Since I had never done duty-free stuff before OR travelled with wine I hadn't really thought that through. My bad. So, we scrambled at the last minute before checking our bags and stuffed our wine in our luggage amidst the dirty clothing and gifts. We zipped our luggage shut, said a prayer and sent them on their merry way. We had no idea what mess might await us on the other end of the journey. But at that point, we had no time to waste. Time to catch a flight home.My son's luggage arrived on the carousel just fine. No issues at all. No wine dripping out. Good! Now...where was my luggage? Hmmmm...Well, it didn't end up coming. So they said I should go home and they would track it for me and I could go on the airline website to see when it might come. It ended up being delivered to my home the next morning. At that point I was convinced that is was probably all stained with red wine and that it had been delayed because of a giant mess. I was so worried. But...everything was fine! The story had a happy ending. I was reunited with my luggage and all my gifts for my family. And you can bet that we celebrated with a glass of wine at dinner that night!A few observations and lessons learned:*always carry a refillable disposable plastic water bottle...saves a ton of money and kept us well hydrated for all the walking. easily fit in my bag*never, ever bring new shoes on a trip...no matter how awesome they look with my outfit.*a metro pass is always a bargain in any large city, ours were well-used*despite what people told me about Paris before I went...I found the city to be very friendly, clean, beautiful and nobody hated me for being an American. i felt completely at home there.*it can be done on a budget...meals do not have to cost a ton of money. bakeries, markets, cafes all have inexpensive offerings*before traveling to a country where i don't speak the language i will now make a better effort to learn basic polite phrases in the foreign language. though most everyone in france spoke english when i needed them to...i felt like a loser for not making a better effort.*clothing...people do seem to dress a little nicer in paris. it was refreshing to me. actually seemed a little more modest than in the US. i noticed it more when i came home, that things here seemed more immodest and more casual. also didn't see many men in paris wearing shorts and ball caps. saw them wearing capris though. not something i see much in the US*all the fuss about not going to paris in august because of locals being on holiday...not a big deal. if you can go in august, go in august. paris is amazing.I can hardly wait to return!"
40,“Paris with children”,"I was apprehensive at first but my husband was adamant it would be an excellent choice for a shortish family break with our two children (aged 7 & 5 months).There is so much to do it would take weeks to do everything, we left with a wish list for next time!Eating out is very easy, find a terrace, if it's full ask a waiter and they will advise you on a waiting time, but if you arrive at around 6.00pm most places will gladly accommodate children. Most offering some kind of choice for young ones although we found our 7 year old wanted to order things he hadn't tried before from the regular menu. If you find the serving staff to be a little rude when you inquire just move on to somewhere else, there is so much choice in Paris you won't go hungry, just don't waste your money in Pizza hut or McD's! Life is far too short!The parks of Paris are excellent for Children and what child wouldn't want to go up the Eiffel tower? A word of advice, buy your ticket in advance and avoid the 40 minute queue, visit a boulangerie, buy some fresh sandwichs and picnic in the shadow of one of the most beautiful man-made constructions in the world.Use the Batobus too, it does a circular route of the Seine, stopping at the major sites, you can get tickets for 1, 2 or 5 days, great value, the children love it and it beats the Metro with a pram any day! Staff very friendly & helpful, but remember if you do have a pram there are steps EVERYWHERE in Paris. You will do a lot of lifting.Disneyland is a 25 min train ride out, very convenient and easy to reach. invest in Fast passes for the rides, we didn't and regretted it. 45 minutes is a long time for even the most patient kid. But we will be going to Parc Asterix next time!Buy water & snacks at a 8a huit to save a bit of money and you may even find it won't cost you as much as you thought!"
50,“Enjoyed my time in Paris.”,I was over joyed to get a chance to visit Paris and my Uncle Barry. The city is beautiful and the people seem really nice. I had a chance to catch all the sites and sounds of the city and many surrounding cities. If you go to Paris have a plan of attack for your sites and you will have a great time.
50,“Our long weekend in Paris”,"We enjoyed many activities which we would recommend. We prebooked a tour of Paris on Segways which was great fun and allowed us to see lots of sights - citysegwaytours.com. We also prebooked a river sight seeing cruise which saved several Euros at vedettesdupontneuf.com.Trips up the Eiffel Tower take several hours, instead go up the Montparnasse Tower which used to be Europe's tallest tower at 209m where you can enjoy a panoramic view from the 56th floor and go up to the helipad.The catacombs were fascinating but be patient with the queue since numbers are limited - they shut the doors at 16:00 prompt so do not bother joining a long queue after two or three o'clock.Many tourist attractions are shut on Mondays so plan for this - we headed for the Jardin des Tuileries and took a long lunch in the shade of trees at La Terrasse de Pomone. This is much better than dining in busy streets with a lot of noisy traffic; and they do an excellent sparkling Crémant de Loire which is much better value than overpriced Champagne.Eating in restaurants can be expensive so instead of ""a la carte"" look out for set menus ""plat du jour"" which are often very good value for money, and many still offer choices for each course. These are available both for lunch and evening dinner."
30,“Trip to Paris”,"Paris is perhaps a bit over-rated. It is a nice city in places and with oceans of cultural monuments and museums etc. On the downside there are lots of beggars who inimidate tourists, but especially the 'string men' who loiter around Sacre Cour Church. They inimidate people and I would advise everybody to be firm with them and tell them to go away. The authorities should really ensure that these individuals are kept out of the area. There are also lots of three card trick conmen in operation in that area; dont be a fool and get caught out by them, keep walking at all costs, dont even stop to have a look.We were badly ripped off getting the bus from the city to the airport. We initially got the ""Roissy"" Bus from the airport to Opera, which costs around 9 Euro and is basic. On the return to CDG airport we got the Air France Airport Bus (Le cars) which costs 15 euro for the exact same journey, a very high price. When the bus came to a halt in traffc near the airport, not moving an inch in 24 minutes, I went up to the driver and asked him did he know what was wrong. He wouldnt even look at me and did not respond. This was incredibly ignorant and rude to a customer, i could not believe it. He would only speak to people who spoke french to him. This was the low point of my trip to Paris. I will not go with Air France anywhere again if they can treat customers with such disdain. Overall we enjoyed out trip. However, do stay as close to a metro as possible and in a central location as the suburbs can have very few restaurants and supermarkets for cheap food/drinks/snacks and not much for tourists to do or see."
50,“Paris at night - down by the Seine”,"This is, in my opinion, one thing that is not in the guide books that is worth doing. Go grab a bottle of wine, a blanket and some nice cheese/bread and relax afterdark on the banks of the Seine. In different parts there are people dancing, singing or just chatting. It really is a worth while experience and you get a feel for the 'real' Paris."
30,“Viking Seine River Cruise August 09”,"We have just returned from a trip to Europe, which included a 7-day river cruise from LeHavre to Paris on the Viking Seine. After a long flight, a Chunnel Ride and a train ride from Paris to LeHavre (along with a couple of taxis), we boarded the boat and were warmly greeted by the reception staff.We were escorted to our cabin, which was a Category E, the lowest deck on the boat, which meant our window was just slightly above the water level. It was small and sparse, but clean. We had twin beds, one of which was a ""pullman"" type that folded up during the day so we could move around in the cabin.The bathroom was a typical cruise bathroom, with the triangular shower with a curtain that clings to you once the water is turned on. It was adequate, and our cabin steward kept it spotless.Each day included an excursion, with a guide and the soft-box system with personal ear plugs. This made it convenient for walking in a group, as the guides did not have to yell. Some of our guides' grasp of the English language was painfully poor, and caused us to have to closely listen and attempt to translate what they were saying. For instance, in Normandy, the ""wrenches attacked the bonkers on the lending [--]"", which we translated as ""the rangers attacked the bunkers on the landing beaches"". Amusing, but not very helpful. One guide stood out above all the others, his name was Thierry, and he was our guide for Versailles and our bus ride through Paris. He was fantastic! Funny, informative, very helpful, great command of the English language. Kept us all very entertained with his facts and anecdotes.Other than Versailles, all of the excursions were included, which was exceptionally priced with their current 2 for 1 deals. We saw Normandy, Rouen, Honfleurs, Giverny (Monet's home and water lily gardens), and more. The scenery was exquisite, in the towns and especially along the Seine. Being right near the shore, as opposed to an ocean cruise where you are out at sea, you got a closer look at the sights along the river banks. Also, this means that daily excursions involve walking right off the boat onto the waiting buses or into town, as opposed to having to tender over from an ocean liner out at sea.Our biggest complaint? The food. Adequate at best, some meals were inedible. Breakfast was a plentiful buffet, but one morning I ordered some blueberry pancakes that were on a separate menu. After 10 minutes, I received 2 lukewarm pancakes the size of silver dollars on a dinner plate, with no garnish, butter or syrup. Another time I ordered the vegetarian meal at dinner, and it turned out to be the marinated, roasted veggies left over from lunch that they had then deep-fried in a greasy batter. It was disgusting, and I could not eat it. When the waiter asked how it was, I told him that I normally don't complain about food, but it was terrible, and was not edible. He shrugged his shoulders, took my plate and walked away. That pretty much summed up the dining experience on board.The dining room is set up in rows of tables for 6, so if you are one couple, you just sit with new people all the time. The general concensus amongst the passengers we encountered was that the food was below average to poor. The main dishes were skimpy in portion, never served hot, the fresh fruit was tasteless, the desserts and ice creams were half-melted and the food was for the most part not French! On many nights the item described on the menu did not appear to be what was served. It was as if they were substituting at will, without notifying the staff or the passengers. We have been on ocean cruises in the past, and the dining experience has always been a big part of the overall enjoyment of the trip. By the end of the week, I just wanted to skip the dining room altogether. I am not a food snob, but honestly, this food was one step above hospital food.The biggest compliment? The staff, especially Monique, the program director, who was informative, very patient, helpful and fun. The front desk staff was also great, and very eager to be of assistance. We found that the waitstaff in the dining room was great at the beginning of the week, but by week's end the service waned, and was adequate at best.One last note: we are in our mid-fifties, and we were perhaps some of the youngest people on this boat. Other than a few teens that were with their grandparents, and a few other couples in their 50's, we were surrounded by folks in their 60's, 70's and 80's. There was no night-life at all, the upper deck and the bar were typically empty by 9 at night. If you are looking for a cruise with some entertainment, this is not the one! This is a relaxed, laid-back, slow-moving cruise that caters to an older crowd. It is strictly a sight-seeing and educational cruise, NOT a party boat!Would we take another Viking River Cruise? We would, as we spoke with many other passengers who had taken multiple Viking Trips- they come back repeatedly because of the value, the overall service and the trips themselves, which provide a close and intimate look at some of the most beautiful places in Europe. They all said that the food on this trip appeared to be the exception, not the rule. The prices appear to be the most competative of the river cruise lines. The bottom line? You get what you pay for."
20,“My expectations of a great city were not met”,"We have spent 6 days in Paris and saw nice places but I can't proceed without mentioning the negative aspects we have experienced.Paris obviously has the characteristics of a big city:- big crowds wherever you go, too many gypies and beggars for charity, monuments in need of restauration, quite shabby metro stations and lack of escalators in main ones, considering tourists carrying luggages upstairs. We also found difficulty in buying our last metro ticket at Denfert-Rochereau, with the ticket-booths closed at 1200 and the automatic ticket machine not accepting our cash!!But, above all, the insecurity one feels at crowded places, mainly at the metro. One of our group members has been a victim of pick-pocketing of EUR500 at Odeon metro from three 14-year olds in a split of a second. Metro at Barbes Rochechouart is also a nightmare with crowds of blacks and others, ready to pounce on you as you enter the metro station, to sell you probably fake metro tickets, cigarettes and obviously, to steal.Sorry Parisiens but that's how we felt as tourists in Paris!!! None of us will return there for sure!!"
40,“Paris in two days”,"Okay, I don't recommend trying to see Paris in two days and two nights. But, if you pick and choose your attractions, you can do it.We stayed in Pigalle, an interesting part of the city to say the least. It's near the famous Moulin Rouge and it's known as the red light district of Paris because there are sex shops and cabarets. There are also many good restaurants to choose from. We stayed at the Hotel Eden Opera...which was reasonable (65 euros I believe) and roomy enough for the three of us with a queen size bed and a smaller twin bed. We were on the 5th floor which gave a view of the area...but we also faced the very busy and noisy street. IF you can, book a room on the backside facing the courtyard and won't be awakened @ 6:00AM by the garbage trucks picking up the trash (Tuesday mornings).Since we were awake we grabbed some croissants and headed out to explore. We took the metro (about 3 blocks away) to the Notre Dame Station...then made our way to the Seine and onto the BateauBoats...an excellent way to see Paris. For 12Euros a person, you get a full day pass on the boats, which travel up and down the river like a bus. You can get off near attractions such as the Louvre, the D'Orsay Musee, the Eiffel Tower and more. Then, you just jump back on to go to the next attraction.The Louvre is closed on Tuesdays...so we went to the D'Orsay..which was fantastic and far less crowded than the Louvre. Another excellent museum is the L'Orangerie. It's like a hidden treasure near the Invalides...and it features the stunning ""360 Monet""...one of the artist's last works and one of his most impressive. In two oval shaped rooms, Monet's waterlillies and water garden paintings cover the entire walls. Best of all, it's inexpensive and since few people know about it, you won't be jostled by crowds and can spend as much time as you want admiring the works.One other great highlight is to take the evening cycle tour of Paris with the Fat Tire Bike Tour company http://fattirebiketours.com/parisit's a bit pricey at 36 euros apiece but you get a guided bike tour through some cool areas of Paris...stop for ice cream...and then make your way to the Seine for a boat trip...complete with wine. Imagine being in a boat in the shadow of the lit up Eiffel Tower on a warm summer night with a glass of wine in your hand..and you get the idea.We saw and did more...and did get lost once in the metro, but you can see a great deal of Paris in two days on a budget if you plan ahead."
50,“Driving and Parking in Paris”,"This summer, my wife and I took our four young children to Paris for a week taking our own car through the channel tunnel.Before travelling we did some research about public transport in and around Paris and we were quite concerned about the price. For the six of us to get a one day ""Paris Visite"" travel pass would cost around £40 which does not compare at all well with London Transport where children travel free with their parents.Upon arrival we checked at the RER station (Bry sur Marne) and found that even a return ticket into the heart of Paris would cost over £20.We were very hesitant about taking the car into Paris expecting the traffic to be nightmarish and the cost of parking prohibitive. However, we were pleasantly surprised on both counts.The main A4 road took us straight into Paris in twenty minutes. We followed the Seine in the direction of the Eiffel Tower and then followed the street parking signs. I found a spot about 150 metres from the Tower and read the instructions on the nearby machine, expecting the worst.The instructions explained that I had to buy a special card for 10 Euros from the nearest Tabac. To my delight I found that I was able to park there for two hours for about £2! It was the same story at Sacre Coeur and The Champs Elysee. The card lasted me all week and was easy to use.On other days we used the Louvre Car Park and the one under the Hotel de Ville which was very close to Notre Dame and they were both extremely reasonable.In short, my advice to motorists is don't be afraid to take your car into Paris especially if you have small children. It's a flexible and cost effective alternative to public transport."
30,“Dream Getaway”,"The title says it all!! Paris, France was my first experience in Europe and let me tell you....it's one of those places you should experience at least once in your lifetime. The beauty of the city itself is breathtaking; the landmarks, especially the eiffel tower. If you pay to go halfway to the top of the eiffel, why not pay a little bit more to go all the way to the top. The view from above is magnificent, worthwhile and a rush. A tid cold if you ask me, but that didn't stop me. The lights that the city has to offer at night is a beauty. Take it from me as a hopeless romantic woman, being there really made this dream come true. The Louvre will fulfill your lifetime quota for big-name masterpieces...a big pleasure! There's a lot to see, different districts to explore and with the right attitude and time, you'll fit right in. Take your time to visit Champs Elysées, a lot to see. History surrounds the monstrous city, whatever your pleasure is, I'm sure you'll find it."
40,“Most romantic city in the world!!”,"Paris IS undoubtedly the most romantic city to go to, whether it is to propose on the top of the Eiffel Tower , cruise along the River Seine, or to stand on top of Montmartre Hill & admire the panoramic view ........every where you looked there were couples embracing or kissing. We went for a long weekend - end of November time and it was especially romantic.....with the atmosphere of the Christmas markets..The best attraction is the Eiffel Tower ....which can be seen from almost everywhere in Paris.Shopping is expensive in Paris (with the exception of souvenir buying) - one thing I was not surprised about was paying almost £4 for a cup of filter coffee in one of the many riverside bistros.The metro (underground system) was a very easy method of getting around the city, and covered the main popular tourist attractions ( La Grande Arche de La Defense, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Avenue des Champs-Elysees etc) .A perfect break for a couple or a honeymoon destination!!"
50,“Paris with kids”,"I think my favorite trip to Paris was with my two grand-daughters. Who would of thought that the city of lights could be ""kid friendly""? The girls were 10 and 6 years old at the time of the trip and they fell in love with the city as I have many times! Our guide was a book called ""PARIS WITH KIDS"" and it was full of suggestions of things to do. We stayed at Citadines Hotel in LES HALLES, on rue de innocents, which was an apartment/hotel, convenient location and perfect for us! The first thing we did was take an open-top bus tour to get our bearings and rest up from the long flight. They then walked the marvelous CHAMPS-ELYSEES and had portraits done by ""kid friendly"" artists. The EIFFEL TOWER was a big thrill and it happened that we were there the same day Tom Cruise proposed to Katie! That was almost as big a thrill as the double decker merry-go-round! The next day we spent at GIVERNY, Monet's Garden, which was in full bloom and magical for me to be there with my two princesses! For dinner that evening, we crossed the beautiful PONT ALEXANDER BRIDGE to a wonderful small restaurant on the Left Bank. AU PETITE TONNEAU, means little barrel and is owned by Jenette Boyer, who is also the cook. I have returned to this ""jewel"" many times and have recommended it to many. It is located at 20, rue de Surcouf . Of course, NOTRE DAME was enjoyable, especially looking for Quasi Modo among the many gargoyles! The zoo was fun. As was the trip to BELLEVILLE and following the path of the ""Red Balloon"". Finding Edith Piaf's house in the hilly cobbled street neighborhood amongst the charming shops was an adventure in one of the oldest parts of Paris. And then we found her grave, along with Jim Morrison's and Chopin's, with the help of a Jim Morrison fan that was ""just hanging out"". He offered to show us around PERE LA CHAISE cemetary for free and even sang some songs for us...like ""Come on Baby Light my Fire"" at Morrison's grave and ""Le Vie en Rose"" at Edith Piaf's. What a fun afternoon in the cemetary!!! The next day was a real highlight for the girls. We took the metro across town to AQUABOULEVARD, which is a huge indoor aquatic park and sports center. Most of it is indoors and decorated with palm trees and beaches. There are water slides, fountains, wave pools, hot tubs .....kids love it and it is really hard dragging them away! Our last memorable day was spent at MONTMARTE. We visited Sacre Couer, enjoyed the artists and dined at a ""La Boheme du Tertra Restaurante"".The trip was wonderful! I saw Paris through the eyes of two precious starry-eyed little girls and fell in love with it again! We had a great time with the help of ""PARIS WITH KIDS""!"
50,“Paris and Mont St. Michel”,"I just returned from a wonderful trip to France with my family. We were guided by Christian Mayer of ""American Driver in Paris"" and had an absolutely magnificent time. He picked us up at the airport, took us on a scenic drive, stopped to let us sample some French fare, and offered us interesting commentary along the way. We were comfortable and well entertained the whole time, with plenty of time to visit exactly those places we wanted to see. I highly recommend this tour to anyone and would love to do it again myself.Suzanne"
20,“Pick pocket and passport”,"When we were in London everything was ok until we reached Paris via euro train and need to use another train to the hotel at the outskirt of Paris. My wife and 2( age 22 and 18) children got into a packed train and my wife was helpfully pushed into the underground train. As the train was about to stop the guy in front pocked his fingers at my front pocket and later he dropped the lighter twice. He pretended to search the floor and at the same time with 2 hands pulling my trousers down. Luckily I quickly put my hand over the back pocket to protect my wallet. I later discovered my overcoat pockets were opened but nothing there. Lucky escape. I do not know whether it is necessary to hand over the passport to the Paris - Rome Train conductor > Everybody seems to pass their passport to the conductor. I asked the conductor is it necessary..he just said we will get 2 knocks (we have 6 seat cubicle room) during the night. I said I would wake up if necessary. Losing passport in no joke in Malaysia...take a least one year to be reissued. My son told me that his friend who was in Rome had his passport stolen due to ketchup being accidentally spilled on his shirt and when he opened his shirt his hidden neck wallet was stolen. He had to stay in Rome for one month before his passport was issued. Rome Termini..same story as the kind helper who helped to buy train ticket... when my son was going through the machine to buy tickets...he wanted money of course. Using Taxi in Paris to airport...each bag cost one euro ..our 8 bags big and small cost 8 euros. My son was hungry and need to eat near the Rome Termini..he asked for takeaways one veg, rice and 2 small fish..20 euros. I think to make sure our holidays are pleasant I just to budget losses of 100 euros. ! OMG I never thought such developed countries are that bad...more Tourist Police are needed in touristy areas.kuching, s'wak MaLAYSIA 07/30/2009"
50,“My first trip to Paris- Very Long”,"I had just spent a week in a little village, St. Medard, 12 kgs. outside Cahors and taken the early morning train to Paris.When I alighted at Gare Austerlitz it was baking hot, just like it had been in St. Medard, after lugging my bags up the 2 flights to the Metro I was drenched in sweat, I bought a 3 day 3 zone Paris Visite metro pass for 19.60 euro, this would allow me unlimited metro and bus trip anywhere within the city center for 3 days. (A lot of people on tripadviser.com had recommended a garnet of metro tickets (10) for a 3 day trip, but I used a lot more than 10 trips, even allowing for the transfers).I had to change trains @ Stalingrad for the #2 metro to Pigalle, thank god, like the Japanese, they have vending machines on the platforms,At Pigalle I found my hotel, The Victor Masse on Rue Victor Masse with no problem thanks to Google street view, which is actually a bad thing, because it takes away some of the excitement of unexplored travel, but in this case it was a good thing as I needed a cold shower, pronto.I had prepaid through hotels.com so just handed the clerk my confirmation and he handed me a key, done, no credit card, no passport required, this was the easiest check-in I had ever experienced, straight upstairs (elevator) and into the shower, aaaaah.I was pretty knsckered from the trip and would have loved to lie down for a nap but my stomach thought my throat had been cut so it get changed and head back to Pigalle, which is smaller version of Times Square. Of course there was a baguette shop right on the corner so in I went, a classic jamon w/brie and a Kronenbourg, 7 euro, did someone say Paris is expensive?Refreshed and sated I headed for the Sacre Coure in Montmartre which was only few minutes walk away, as I expected it was pretty mobbed with tourists and hawkers, had I known there was a train I would have saved my knee the ordeal of the massive steps, but such is life. The Basilica is absolutely beautiful, what an architectural wonder.The carnival of street performers at the base of the steps was a little disconcerting seeing as this is consecrated ground but the amount of garbage strewn around, mostly glass/plastic bottles, soda/beer cans and food containers was really quiet disgusting, most of it I’m sure came from a vendor who had a kiosk just off to the side and seemed oblivious to the whole situation. I was thirsty but not about to contribute to this guys fortune, I wandered off in disgust.Around the back of the Basilica where few tourists seemed to venture, I got the most amazing view of Montmartre, I had originally wanted to stay here but had found nothing that I considered quiet right, I had out rightly dismissed “Comfort Inn” but having seen it in person, it is now a candidate for the next trip (this was before I went to the Left Bank).I wound my way down through the winding street of Montmartre and plonked myself down on a bench on Rue Caulaincourt and watched life go by.After a rest I walked up to Lemark-Caulaincourt metro and caught the 12 line to Notre-Dame de Lorette, another fantastic Parisian cathedral, the fresco’s on the ceiling are worthy of Leonardo da Vinci, I then got the metro onward to Concorde for a look at The Champs Elysees, I was immediately struck by the square cut of the trees, such detail, but the Arc was a long way off, so I went back downstairs and took the #1 metro to Charles de Gaulle Etolle, WOW I was blown away by the size of the Arc de Triomphe, there is a replica one in Washington Square Park in New York but it is truly miniscule compared to the real thing, I had no idea it was so big, truly impressive.It was about 5pm and still baking hot, another cold shower beckoned and then out for dinner, it was a very easy trip back to Pigalle on the #2 metro.Showered and changed, I’m ready to go again by 6pm, I want to have dinner at L’Entrecote by St. Germain, the easiest way was the #2 metro from Pigalle to Rue du Bac and catch a bus along the Blvd. St. Germain.I was there by 6:30pm, but they were still only setting up, I was starving, but went for a stroll in search of a café for a cold beer. I came across a suitable looking place on the corner of Blvd. St. Michel and had a couple of Kronenbourg’s while watching the world go by, one of the great pleasures of Paris.After a couple of beers I circled back around to L’Entrecote and it was 80% full, luckily I was able to get a single table outside, it was exactly how I expected it, the waitress merely asked, rare or medium rare, I chose rare with a half bottle of Haut Medoc. Not only was the beef excellent but the frites were also amazing, with coffee and assorted cheeses I was out the door for 50 euro, very reasonable, especially as it’s Paris.L’Entrecote gets quick a bit of stick on tripadvisor.com from what I presume are so called French foodies, bah humbug, this beef was excellent, the special sauce superb and the frites the best I have ever tasted. Some people seem to think that if you open more than one location you are watering down the product and or making it to accessible which takes away from their exclusitivity, bloody snobs if you ask me.It had been a very long day since 5am when I got up in St. Medard, so I decided to head back towards Pigalle and have a nightcap in the little bar by the hotel, Pub Frochot, the only non vice bar in the neighbourhood, a quick cognac and I was tucked in by 11pm, what a great first day in Paris, I could not wait for the morning, I was like a child on Christmas Eve waiting for Santa.Well I must have been tired, I had planned being up and at Notre Dame by 9am, but I only awoke then, it’s rare that I sleep 10 hours straight but sometimes your body just says, enough.Up and showered I was at Pigalle by 9:30, caught the #2 metro two stops and changed to the #5 to Chatalet /Les Halles. It was another glorious day, not a cloud in the sky and already 70 dergees (19C). I was surprised by Chatelet, I had no idea it was a medevil fortress to protect the Île de la Cité. Also I was very surprised at the size of the towers of Notre Dame, I had expected them to tower over the area but they were actually hard to pick out against the skyline.I walked over the Pont au Change, past the Palais de Justice, made a left on Rue de Lutece and then a right on Rue de la Cite (funny these are all good French restaurants in New York) and there, finally, in front of me was, Notre Dame, WOW. The Bells master, the Bells.Upon entering the cathedral, I could not believe they allowed photography, everybody was clicking away, so I joined in and took some great shots of the alters and windows, it really is a magnificent building, I spent 2 hours looking around the place, totally captivated.Time for lunch as I had skipped breakfast, so I strolled across Petit Pont and down beside St. Vernan church, there were a lot of places offering various 2 & 3 course set lunches and 1 in particular grabbed my attention, escargot appetizer and confit du canard (duck) for 16 euro. I was looking for a café that a friend had recommended, La Palette, on Rue de Seine, but I somehow missed it and ended up back near St. Vernan so I opted for the escargot and canard, they were both delicious with a small carafe of red wine.Sated, I headed back over the Petit Pont, I had seen a post office earlier and had written some postcards over lunch which I needed stamps for. I then hopped on a bus along the rue de Rivoli to the Louvre, basically all I had seen was the glass pyramid in pictures, the vastness of all the buildings was overwhelming. It was almost 3pm, although it is open till 10pm on Friday’s I did not have ½ a day to spend in there, tomorrow was my last day and there was still so much to see.From the Louvre I jumped on another bus up to the Opera house, another fantastic building, I could only imagine what it must be like inside and I’m sure the acoustics must be great.It was now nearing 5pm and time for a beer and a cold shower so time to head for the hotel, I caught a train at Opera and changed at Saint Lazare to Pigalle. A quick cold Kronenbourg at my new local on the corner, a cold shower and I was ready to go again just after 6pm.My friend, Loic in New York, who is French and had lived in Paris many many moons ago, had given me list of restaurants and La Coupole in Montparnasse, he described as one of the most famous brassieres in Paris and was across the street from Le Select, one of Hemingway’s haunts.So I headed for Montparnasse, I could be on a double winner here, walking up the street I spied La Coupole on the opposite side but as got closer the wind was taken out of my sails, in front of the name in neon script was “Americana Café”, and it was virtually deserted, no way Jose. I crossed back over the street and sure enough there was Le Select, it had been selected by everyone, there was not an empty chair in the house. There were several more cafes on the block but all less than 50% full, obviously it was Le Select or nothing, so I chose nothing.There was a bus stop just down the street and I stopped to check where one of them would take me and was surprised to see a route right across the city to Montmartre, perfect, it would be a long but entertaining and educational ride.Forty minutes later I was in the northern section of Montmartre and disembarked to explore the neighbourhood., I was on the Rue Ordener and knew if I walked up hill I would be headed to Sacre Cour, a couple of blocks up I came to Rue Caulaincourt and made a right. There were cafes everywhere but nothing felt just right until I came to a small place called Café de la Butte, all the outside tables were full but there was plenty of space inside. I did not even look at what people were eating or the menu, it just felt right.I sat at a small table, there were just 2 girls running the place, 1 waitressing the other making drinks, I ordered a Kronenbourg and perused the menu, I don’t read or speak French but having worked in restaurants for years I know what most foods are but there was 1 special entrée I had no clue what it was, I asked and the waitress, pointing to her midsection and said, veal kidney’s, oh yes, bring it on with more escargot to start and a small carafe of red. The escargot were excellent and the house red the best I had tasted so far in Paris, but the kidney’s were mind blowing. They came with rice and I almost asked frites, but I had a basket of crusty bread in from of me and dipped a piece into the red wine sauce, I was in heaven and the kidney’s just melted in my mouth, WOW, what a find, my instincts were so right, they rarely let me down.This was the type of meal you don’t want to finish but finish it must, I rounded it off with a cognac & café and headed off into the night vowing to return one day.Just down the block was a bus stop and I caught a bus down to Blvd. de Clichy to check out The Moulin Rouge, Friday night and it was wall to wall people lining up to pay exorbitant prices for a glass of bubbly and a titillating stage show, not my cup of tea, I had just left Nirvana.It was now just after 10pm and fully dark, so I decided to make a quick dash back to the Eiffel Tower, to see the light show. The nearest metro station is shown as Bir-Hakeim, which I thought rather weird, it sounds like a terrorist name, but I researched it, and it turns out to be a famous battle site in Libya during WWII, where the French army bought time against the Germans, allowing Monty and the British army to win a crucial battle at El Alamein, which in turn changed the results of the war in North Africa in the Allies favour.The Eiffel Tower looks spectacular at night all lit up, from standing directly under it and then walking backwards over the Pont d’Lena up to the Trocadero, it just keeps getting better.It was now after midnight and time to think about getting back to the hotel before the metro closed down, luckily it was just 2 trains from the Trocadero to Pigalle, changing at Charles de Gaulle.A nightcap at my new local and I was tucked up by 1am. I went to sleep thinking “God I love Paris, those kidney’s were out of this world”.I guess I really walked a lot on Friday, I was in bed by 1am but did not wake-up till 10am, I had wanted to be out by 9, but better late than never. After last nights ezperience at the Eiffel Tower I could not wait to see it in daylight so I caught the metro to Trocadero.It was far more crowded than it had been last night and the lines to get up to the first level were huge, there was no way I was going to stand in that and it was annoying the way there were so many young men pushing miniature models of the tower in your face, I took some pictures and walked over to the bus stop on the Pont d’Lena, the #82 went to Luxembourg gardens which would stet me up for lunch at La Paletta in St. Germain.This seemed like a real good plan until I saw the Eglise Dome of the Musee de L’Armee, I immediately jumped off the bus and was in awe of the structure, this is the home of Napoleon’s tomb. There was a café right there so I sat down had a café and reflected on this amazing building.I was going to wait for another bus and continue to the Luxembourg Gdns. but the sun was beating down and there was no shade so I walked in the direction the bus was going where there was shade and came across St. Francis Xavier, not only another magnificent church but also a metro station, looking at the map I could not be bothered taking 3 trains to get to Luxembourg to I headed back across the river and got off at Champs Elysees Clemenceau beside the Grand and Petit Palais, more awesome buildings and a fantastic view across Pont Alexander III down to Les Invalides, this must be some sceptical when it is all lit up at night. Now I know why they call Paris the “City of Lights”.I caught the #72 bus along the right bank of the Seine, past the Louvre to the Pont Des Arts where I alighted, walked across the bridge and down Rue de Seine to La Palette for lunch. I started with a large Kronenbourg and some moules then surprised the waiter by ordering the plat du jour, which was boeuf tar tar with a glass of rouge. It was a little annoying that they did not have a house wine by the carafe, only glasses from well known regions, which were expensive.As I said, that was a little annoying, what was really annoying was the middle aged well dressed woman who sat down at the next table whom I assumed was French as she quizzed the waiter about the menu but I was wrong. She received a beer first then her food, a frankfurter with frites and she requested ketchup, I was most surprised, but then the real insult happened, her cell phone rang, she answered with an American accent and proceeded to have a trans-Atlantic conversation while eating, how uncivilized and what must the person on the other end thought of all the chomping, disgusting, no wonder the French hate American’s and which is why I was using my best British.The food and wine had been delightful but the experience was less memorable.I started walking around some of the smaller streets of St. Germain/Latin Quarter and came across a restaurant “Le Procope” that claimed to be the oldest in Paris, ( it was later confirmed as the oldest Parisian café in a PBS documentary, founded in 1686. Procope was actually Sicilian),I looked inside and it was a very nice old world dining room and the menu looked very good, the Brochette Boeuf was highlighted and that was what I wanted for my last supper. I would return.Out on the Blvd. St. Germain I caught a bus towards The Bastille, I knew there was nothing left of the old prison but it is known as a very bohemian district, I walked around and found nothing exceptional about it, except for the Spirit of Liberty atop the Bastile monument. I hopped on another bus up to Place de la Republique, I had came very close to booking a hotel here and wanted to see if I had been wrong to change to Pigalle. Although it was quiet picturesque with the canal and locks there was a decided lack of decent looking cafes and restaurants so I think I made the right choice.As the Gare de Nord was on the way back to my hotel I decided to check out the RER for tomorrow morning’s trip to CDG, it was all straight forward, I then went outside and got a bus to Pigalle, this would be the same bus I would get in the morning.It had been a long day and I knew where I was having dinner so I stopped into my local for a couple of cold Kronenbourgs, there were four English lads at the bar who had just arrived on the Eurostar, I gave them a few pointers, but I think they were there more for the red-lights than the historical ones.As previously I caught the 12 metro from Pigalle to Rue de Bac and then the bus to St. Germain getting around was now becoming very second nature.I found Le Procope with no problem but it was a little early for dinner, there was a very lively bar/restaurant next door so I thought I would try it for a gin & tonic.I walked in, ordered a G&T and noticed the guy sitting next to me was a waiter, (black shirt n’ pants, dead give away), hearing my English accent he turned and asked if I was enjoying my stay in Paris, in very guttural French, almost condescending, but there was a word in his question which did not sound right. I was possessing it and trying to say I was having a blast when it hit me, he was a Californian. I proffered this idea to him and he admitted, he was from San Diego, his father German and mother French, they had emigrated to California, but after leaving high school, he had always wanted to live in France, he had now been here 10 years and was considered a great waiter, attitude included.After my couple of aperitifs I went next door to Le Procope, I got a table for one next to a couple who were very chatty, she was from the Czech Republic and he was from Norway, it seemed like a very strange arrangement, but who am I to judge, we got talking about travel and next thing you know she is inviting me to Czech Rep., I would have lot of fun!! I’m sure I would, if my bank balance was as high as she thought.A few minutes later their seafood main course arrived and it was spectacular, a huge silver platter set on a stand above their plates, there were lobsters, crabs, shrimp, mussels, calamari, various filets, just a superb smorgasbord of seafood, it reminded me of a similar feast I had shared with my friend, Steve Whittle in Watson’s Bay, Australia.My escargot followed by Brochette Boeuf looked rather miniscule compared to the feast on the next table. We said our goodbyes over café and I wandered off into the Parisian night. It was now close to 10pm and I had to up by 6am so I walked up through The Latin Quarter towards the river and found a fantastic open air party happening on the Mitterand footbridge, young people had spread blankets out all over the bridge and were having picnics, there were musicians playing and it was a very joyous situation, I was so envious that I had to leave.I caught the metro back to Pigalle and had a final nightcap at my new corner local.Au Revoir Paris, I shall return."
10,“A huge disappointment”,"Having been told that Paris was a beautiful city, I wasn't prepared for what I experienced when I visited there this month (July 2009). The city is full of homelessness, beggars, and is in general, quite dirty. The metro is overcrowded, with wall to wall people (chances of getting a seat are slim). Con artists roam this city trying to scam money from you - I was scammed at the airport and also at the train station on the way home. Beware of pickpocketers. Or .. just don't go! I wish I hadn't."
50,“Some different things to do”,"First trip but found a few not so usual things to do.Pere Lachaise cemetary - for Jim Morrison fansJardin dancing (salsa, tango, rock) in evening,Batobus trips especially in eveningBYO wine & food on pedestrian bridge up from Pont NeufToyota showroom on Champs EFree guided tour - 3+ hours, given by students for tips and a great way of meeting under 30'sFinally best bit Paris Plage in evening"
40,“Use the Passes”,"Spent 3 nights in Paris last week. All that I'd hoped for and more! I recommend buying the Paris Visite transportation pass and the Paris Museum pass. I traveled on my own and these two things made the trip very convenient. The transportation pass I purchased included zone 6 which allowed me to take the commuter train out to Versailles. Versailles was also one of the places included on the Museum Pass. I purchased a 4 day pass and used it to visit: Versailles, Orsay, Orangerie, Rodin, Arc de Triomphe. There are many other places I just ran out of time. The transportation pass also included a ride to the airport. The only thing I spent extra money on was audiotours and food. Transportation pass includes ride up tram at Sacre Coeur. Make sure to look at transportation pass because there are discounts offered for other attractions."
40,“Paris: beware of the 7th”,"I lived in Paris for three years, doing the student thing, so let me tell you something that I wish somone had told me: there is more to Paris than the 7th. I offer this information to people going for long stays as well as people just passing through.The 7th arrondis. of Paris is a place that starts to feel like home away from home or the Paris you see in movies almost instantly. The neighborhood is as touristy as any big city can offer, even when living there. I can't count how many times, someone has mumbled to me in either broken French or English about taking their picture in front of the Eiffel tower (located in the 7th/16th). And more than one annoyed professor/ local has told me that in the 7th, the only French you will ever need is: une bagette s'il vous plait/ merci.As it was explained to me, the 7th is where a lot of diplomats, ambassadors, consulate workers, and any other international official (plus their families) live. Not to mention that the American University of Paris (AUP) is, at least for the time being, still located in the area. So while there is a distinctly French feel to it ( ie the boutiques, the bakeries, Rue Cler's many shops/markets) the touristy, glossy France of pictures, post cards, and romance novels is really all you are seeing. You can find everything in the 7th, at tourist/ international prices of course, so its easy to stay in the area and find comforts and amenities...and never leave.If you came to Paris looking for the big marks like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, etc. then the 7th and other neighborhoods like it, (8th, 16th, and parts of the 15th) are exactly what you are looking for, and there's nothing wrong with that. But there is so much else to see in Paris! And you don't have to miss out on the monuments to enjoy it either. If you want a French-ish experience that still has some level of familiarity, then you have to get out of the 7th.Go visit the busy and sometimes gritty 1st, around Metro stop Chatelet / Chatelet Les Halles where many great bars, smaller shops, and a large shopping center are located. And don't forget the side street rue St. Denis, where some of the best jewelry, unique clothes, and street food for 5euros can be found. But be wary of the area at night as you head up towards the 9th because there can be prostitution and drugs. Go to rue Lombard right off Sebastapol and have the BEST steak dinner at a goth bar called The Black Dog.There are great ex-pat bars around Metro Blanche (where Moulin Rouge is located) that serve great drinks and play music that you would recognize. But be ready for the cat calls and overly flirtatious men, that will not hesitate to tell you you what they think of you as you pass by on the street. The surrounding area, while known as the red light district of Paris(Pigalle, close to Montmartre), is really cool during the day, and if you are willing to look, you can find all types of shops selling anything from Indian clothes to cheap appliances.While it can be pricey, the 4th arrondis is where you can find some of the better specialty shops. There are little gems all over the area and the people watching is great too.Go see the industrial looking Paris of the 13/14th, near Biblio Francois Mitterand (end of metro line 14) at night when all the sky scrapers are lit up. And definately stop by Chinatown and go see the McDonalds with a menu all in Chinese (more the 13th).Don't forget to stop by the 18th, around Metro Chateu Rouge. Known sometimes as 'Little Africa,' the area is always busy and you can get D&G sunglasses for 10 euros. The place can be overwhelming, but in comparison to most or Paris anything there feels cheaper in price. Go down the maze of streets to find bright and vibrant fabrics, spices for cheap, and great ethnic jewelry. There are many produce vendors in the area and kosher/ halal butchers as well.This is just the tip of the iceburg that Paris has to offer. Everywhere you go will have good food and a metro close by so that you can find your way, so don't be afraid to get lost in Paris (mainlym because you are never really lost). As long as you keep your head about you, there is very little to be worried about. Happy travels!"
50,“Best kept secret”,"Bistro Poulbot, 39 rue Lamarck, 75018 ParisDon't judge on the place, a small cafe in the usually expensive environment of Montmartre. Incredible menu with a full list of traditional French dishes, expected, and another with super-creative ones. Book for their ""table d'hote"" in advance if you are around for quality + value + surprise.Soon to be a must !"
10,“Paris France in July:-(”,"We stayed in a lovely little apt. near the Opera House for 9 days but warning..if you aren't fluent in French stay in a hotel...there you will have an English speaking concierge to give you advice and directions. We are friendly Canadians who are not fluent in French but can speak enough to get by, at least in Quebec and found the people to be the most rude of anywhere in the world we've been to. We were consistently given wrong directions (even by police)most Parisians say they don't speak English.Tipping is built in it's called a service charge, and basically you are paying their minimum wage whether or not the service is good it's built in. There's no reason for them to give good service, they're getting tipped anyway. At the first restaurant we were in the waiter said no that's not a tip or a service charge that comes to me, so I tipped him, and found out later I'd been scammed. I was looking forward to French food... it's bland and most restaurants give you what in Canada is a dog bone with your meal or can be purchased separately as an appy for the marrow....they don't use garlic and we didn't find any great escargot at all. The deserts however are works of art that taste marvelous. The bread is hard and tough. The croissants are great and flaky. Also avoid the Chartier restaurant, it's the oldest and very cheap but the people there are beyond rude. We went to ask what time they open as we'd seen a lineup the night before and know that French people tend to eat later. The man who owns the place shoved his wife out the door towards us and slammed the door. She scolded us by saying ""don't speak to French people in your broken French without knowing if they can understand you...it's rude"" OMGosh...""It's rude?:???"" We didn't eat there so I cannot comment on the food.Their bus system is much different than North America so when you get off a bus it's one stop, only for getting off, but if you want to get back on and continue you have to find the stop for getting on and the way home is not the bus stop across the street, it can be around the corner down the street. Bus drivers smoke on the bus, I have photos, and they stop for smoke breaks along the way. To drive a motorbike you must only be 15 and you don't need a license....when watching them it shows, they budge into lanes and race around cars to take off first from a red light. I watched the Titanic while I was there and was struck by the scene when the boat is sinking and people are running up the hallway as the water is coming the rats all ran in between and around the people to get in front of the crowd. That's the bikes.People walk their dogs close to the cars parked on the side of the street so their dogs can relieve themselves against the tires, then they let them do their ""business"" on the sidewalk and continue walking without picking it up, leaving it for people to walk in if not careful. People smoke almost everywhere except for church.The outdoor cafe's are just glorified smoke pits...even Disneyland Paris, (which was a miss with their lame rides named the same as California's but not at all the same) allows smoking everywhere...including the lineups where people are sandwiched together closely, in the winding lineups. Disneyland is for children and smoking is rampant. We went to ""Walt's Restaurant and that was a miss as we were the only Fluent English speakers and the first ones in there (at 11:30) when it opened to avoid the lineups for lunch. We didn't get out of there until 1:45, mind you it took them 40 minutes to take our order, and we had only ordered one large bottle of water, and one ceasar salad with grilled chicken and one chicken dinner. We didn't even get our bread basket until the people that were seated behind us had their drinks and bread. We asked for ours and they said it's coming. The food was so so, the service sucked, we got up to get our own salt and pepper, as the waiter just didn't come by, the other waiter wouldn't help us because we weren't his table. I could speak enough French that the people at the next table said to us, so sorry it's because you are English....do you want to be ordered by us? We thanked them for their offer but declined. That was something I'd never expected at Disneyland. Then when leaving their Visa didn't work, we'd asked if they take Visa when we arrived, so they wanted everyone to go and get money from the bank machine and bring it back. We spent little time there and say give it a miss.TWO DAYS MAX in Paris is much more than enough in the summer. I had wanted to get perfume custom made but never did find anywhere, and the taxis don't know either. Notre Dame is beautiful, as is Sacre Cour, and the market at Montmatre, but the Les Puce was a miss...high prices, and lots of North Amercian style offerings like clothing, cheap and fake jewellry, fake ""designer"" shoes, purses, etc. that you find in any flea market anywhere. We never had any problems but met four, yes you read it right, tourists who'd been pick-pocketed so it's more of a problem than they let on.The Parisians just don't want English speaking people there, and because so many Amercians now wear a Canadian flag pin and say they're from Canada the French are very suspect and don't like Amercians at all. The Americans that we met while there were all friendly and very nice people. At one store I was told flat out you Americans think you are outwitting us....we know you are not Canadians, and we were polite and just replied that she was mistaken but it didn’t matter to us. By summer the Parisians have had enough of the tourists and want us all to leave and, had we not paid for the apt. in full we would have kindly obliged and gone back over to London, where people were most friendly and helpful from all walks of life.We went on a day long side trip to Monet's garden at Giverny, then lunch at Fourges, then over to the Palace of Versailles, being picked up and dropped off at our apt. That was the best part of our trip to Paris and definitely worth the price. I think it was about 189.00 pp Canadian but well worth it. The lunch was delicious but it was at Fourges not in Paris.After 24 hours the beautiful architecture is just another old building as most of them are built with the same Haussman style...lovely but the same. London has many old buildings also but most are different from each other which makes it a more interesting city, I think.I loved the Louvre, but it was very hot inside and the Mussee D'Orsay was also worth experiencing.The metro has no elevators and very very few and far between escalators so, if you have any mobility issues, my recommendation is to take a cab. Also the cab driver who picked us up at the Gare du Nord charged us 4 euros for our luggage that my husband helped put in the car, and that was over and above the listed fare....I don't even think that's legal...and that was after I'd tipped 2 euros, so after trying to argue that the fare showed one price I relented and forked over 2 more euros.Overall I know I'll never want to go back to Paris and would tell anyone wanting to go there, save your stress level and just go to Great Britain and Ireland, or go in May and no later as I’ve been told they are friendlier then…hmmm. In Great Britain and Ireland you will find warm friendly people, wonderful architecture, interesting places with equal history to Paris. We LOVED Great Britain and Ireland and wished we'd have spent more time there and much less in Paris."
50,“Paris and Normandy (Dday beaches)”,"Used Linkparis.com for trip to Paris and Dday beaches tour. Our hotel was fabulous and 1 block from the Eiffel Tower (Hotel Mercure). Travel arrangements were made by LinkParis as well as the tours. Tour guide was amazing and informative. All went smoothly--which is a difficult task given we had 20 in the group! I would highly recommend LinkParis for your next trip!Paris is, of course, the best city ever. Can't go wrong with your visit there. Metro is very easy to navigate, the sites are spectacular and the food/wine delicious! Try to initiate your conversation in French--most French people speak English so can understand you. We would be offended too, if visitors to our country just spoke to us in their native language."
40,“Paris... Je t'aime!”,"Like the song of Maurice Chevalier: Paris... Je t'aime! Je t'aime, je t'aime!That's it. After all that had been said, Paris is always Paris. The Eiffel, la Seine, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Damme, Sacré Coeur, Champs Elysees, Opera Palais Garnier, le Louvre... areas like Quartier Latin, Montmartre, les Marais are reasons more than enough to fall in love for the city.However, there's some aspects that disapointed me: for being the city of light, there's not too much light, even at the area of the Eiffel tower, where there's some streets a bit dark; the information to the attractions and metro are also disapointing - there's not to much info plates, specially at the metro way out, to the more important attractions, and there's a lack of signs of the metro stations. (we had to ask all the time for the closest metro station).Being such a big city, with so many attractions and such a wide metro, should have more informations plates refering to metro and atrractions, inside and at the metro way out and throughout the streets.But after all, I loved Paris."
20,“My suggestions to visitors to Paris”,"A place with plenty of 'must-see' monuments but foresee the problems in order to make your trip efficient.1. Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays but seems to be open until 21:30hrs on Wednesdays and Fridays. Plan a full day for this museum. It is extraordinary.2. Do not trust Paris railway. On my day of arrival in CDG airport, RER-B line took around 2 hours extra to reach Gare-du-Nord due to some security reasons. Trains were plying in the opposite direction.3. I returned from Venezia to Paris-Bercy railway station and took metro-RER-B to go to Gare-du-Nord. It took 1 hour for the railway to tell (verbally; not through public address) that RER-B line was closed.4. Visit to Versailles palace by RER-C was miserable as the line was closed. Utter confusion, I reached place at 16:00hrs by alternate routes. Versailles palace needs atleast half-a-day but I could see only for 2 hours.5. Tourist information counters are seldom seen, even then they are not manned all the time and the information are not sufficiently provided. This is one of the weekest areas.6. It is a long queue to see Notredam Cathedral - topside (main cathedral area is free entrance and no big rush). The top entrance was closed between 13:00 to 14:40hrs. But the queue was still waiting.7. Plan your return to airport suffiently early to anticipate railway hurdles.8. Metro buses are more convenient than railway but one should understand the easy routes.With all these struggles, Paris is a place to visit. Anticipate"
50,“Why did we wait so long?!!”,"paris is hands-down the most amazing city we've been to. My husband and I love to travel and have been all over, but for some reason beyond my grasp we just hadn't visited Paris. Give yourself at least 5 days - you can't possibly enjoy the city in a weekend visit only. If you do visit for just a couple days, I'd say skip the museums (and the long lines) and take a quick tour the first day...then lounge around the city eating and drinking wine. We loved the bike tour - FAT TIRE was the name of the company. Ile St. Louis is a blast during the day and the Montmartre area is fabulous at night. Oh hell, it's all fabulous! ...by the way, I'm not sure where this misconception comes in about Parisians dressing up all the time - we felt over-dressed every night at dinner. Everyone was SO casual."
50,“Paris - deserves its reputation as the greatest cuty in the world”,"We visited Paris from the 28th June to 3rd July 2009 to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. It was the best holiday we have ever had. Paris blew us away.We stayed in an area of Paris called La Marais (The Marshes). We were in an appartment that was over 400 years old and had its own courtyard. To give you an indication of the location:Ctre Georges Pompidou - 2 min walkNotre Dame - <10 min walkLouvre - 10 min walkPlace de la Bastille - 15 min walkLa Defence 20 mins on Metro from Hotel de Ville. Incredible a must see.We didnt go into any museums and that may sound strange but we just walked around soaking up the sights, the sounds and the incredible architecture.I could type for a week on Paris but I cant praise it enough.2 negatives - 1 was Montmartre. We thought it was a dump. Sacre Coeur was stunning but it was over run with ""lucky - luckys"" selling cheap tat. The shops were full of the same cheap nasty crap. We got off the metro at Chateau Rouge and felt really uncomfortable walking around. Avoid it. There are som many other beautiful places to see.2nd negative was the show Moulin Rouge. What a load of over hyped tacky cheap trash. Its like that tv show Eurotrash only not funny and over a €100 a ticket. Ok the women were as good as naked but they were homogenous. The smiles on there faces were set with botox and the dancing was mechanical and over rehearsed. If any one has seen the daily parades in Disneyland Paris well Moulin Rouge is rubbish in comparisson.We went as a special treat for our 10th wedding anniversary and as soon as it started we loooked at each other and shook our heads."
50,“Best Time of My Life”,"I studied in Paris for the semester this pas Spring and truly had the best time of my life. I suggest everyone study abroad somewhere in their college career because it is incredible. I got to meet so many people and experience a culture totally different. The food is amazing in France and I really was able to improve my language skills. It IS a bit pricey in Paris, but it's Europe and it is still worth it. All the sights in Paris are amazing and the museums are the best in the world. Try to attend a soccer match too if possible, that was a great experience as well. The bar/club scene is great as well. They have something for everyone. The metro in Paris is convenient and easy to navigate. I miss it already."
30,“Short City Break.”,"My partner and I recently took a 4 day city break to Paris. We arranged all the transport and accomodation ourselves and that side of things went as planned with no problems whatsoever. Flew from Manchester on Flybe and stayed at the Hotel Francais near Gare du L'Est. Breakfast was not included in the price but we took it as an extra. Convenience and a more than ample spread did it for us.Paris is a lovely city with world class attractions but I am afraid to say it is let down by being one of the worlds rip off cities too. One would expect to pay over the odds for food and drink but what we found was extorsion on the grandest scale. Even the average café and bar were selling small (330ml) bottles of beer for €6 . Don't get me wrong, we did find an Oz bar and Irish bar selling pints for round about €5.Entry to attractions was reasonably priced or in some cases free. Only thing was, once they had got you in, extras were pricey. For example, in the Louvre, 2 less than average sandwiches, 2 bags of crisps and 2 colas came to €21....over £19 in real money!!!Another thing that spoiled the visits to attractions were the illegal street sellers. They will just keep on hounding you if you don't ignore them. The police move them on but they return once the police have left the area.Travel is cheap on the Metro if you ask for Un Carnet at the ticket office. This is a book of 10 tickets for €11. Each ticket gives unlimited travel for 1½ hours within Paris on both Metro and RER lines. They can also be used on buses but only for 1 journey. If you wish to travel further afield to the outskirts of Paris or beyond you will have to purchase the necessary ticket. We found the Carnet tickets ample for all attractions. If the Metro is not for you, the green hop on hop off sightseeing bus is good value with four different routes and stops at all attractions.For the return trip home we left Gare du Nord railway station on the direct train back to CDG. There are plenty of shops in the station and you are well advised to grab a meal deal sandwich etc at one of the cafés before boarding the train as food and drink at the airport is worse than in town. We expected facilities to be like Manchester airport with well priced food and drink and plenty of duty free shops. How disappointed we were when we checked in, to find only 3 or 4 'duty free' shops selling items at least 15% more than you would expect to pay on the high street back home!! Bacardi at €22 a litre (£10.50 at Manchester airport) Would have been as well to buy the duty free at Manchester before leaving and bring it back with us.Overall the trip was good and hope this advice helps any future visitors."
50,“I love Paris”,"Paris was excellent. I went to Roland Garros, the French Open for tennis and it was an amazing experience. The beauty of tennis played on the red clay court is not to be missed if you are a tennis fan. It is surprisingly intimate, especially for a grand slam event.We stayed by the Eiffel Tower and all though I have read many people express that it is not a big deal, it is! The Eiffel Tower screams ""You are in Paris!"" eveytime you look at it. I love to see it lit at night.I love shopping on the Champs Elysees! The shopping was great and was not too expensive even though the dollar is dropping fast. (Oh yeah, thanks mr president...)I have Celiac Disease and have a very special diet. I was completely accomadated without error every place we ate. This is a very big deal because I will become extremely ill very fast and it can be life threatening. (different for everyone and in my case it is life threatening)I brought along a letter in french of offensive foods and gave it to the waiter/waitress or manager/owner. I ate great! The only other city I have been able to do this in is New York City and Sydney, Australia.What is the best thing about Paris. It never changes. It is always an architectural feast and completely pleasing to all the senses."
50,"“Beautiful city, friendly people and amazing service...”","Forget about what you heard about ""Les Parisiens"" . They are lovely people. We've had such great service at the hotel where we were and we encountered such nice citizens. We loved this city very much."
20,“Is Paris simply Unloveable?”,"That was the third and last time I shall visit Paris, with ""bonne chance"".The staggering expense of eating out is simply unreal now. Examples:£10 a cocktail£5 a Diet Coke£40 for a poor meal for 2 (2 bad Salads + 2 soft drinks)£120 for a good meal that would cost £50 in EnglandThe people are ok, the excessive rudeness associated with the French has been largely crushed in Paris, thankfully (but you can still find that in Northern France in abundance). The sites are stunning, but can all be done completely within 3 days and a Metro (Underground) card. On day four? Run for the hills and find anywhere in Europe for half the money, twice the quality in eating out and much better service all round. If the Americans have shown us anything is that great service will get you back. The French have a long way to go, but it has improved.I went to Rome 2 years ago and fell in love with the place. I spent 3 days in Paris and felt utterly relieved to be home last night. The sites barely make up for the traffic, the quality of food, the expense and the dreadful experience in their airports.Conclusion?Everywhere I have travelled in the last 10 years surpassed Paris in every single way. Surely the damming statement?"
20,“My first visit to Paris”,"The tourist attractions are well looked after and clean. It seems that the Parisians have no respect for their city. The streets were dirty. Dogs were allowed to foul the pavements. The pavements were cracked and broken. Nearly all the cars were damaged. When they park they make more room by banging and pushing other cars to make more room. I would never take my car to Paris. Motor bikes rode and parked on the pavements. No body took notice of the green man at crossings. If you step on to a crossing, unlike London, you do not have the right of way.The Metro had very few escalatorswhich was very inconveniant when we arrived and left with baggage. They were not very clean and the seats were torn and damaged, also ,unlike the London underground, the doors do not open automatically they have to be manually opened. We were constantly being pestered by souvenir sellers and beggers who were always being chased by the Police. Every thing was very expensive eg a Coke in our hotel was 5 euros. I will never go back to Paris!"
20,“One of my favorite place on Earth”,"Lots of places to go and very convenient because of their RER & Metro. Lots of tourist everywhere, day time night time the same, French people seems to be friendly but the problem is language, atleast you should know a little bit like Bounjour! ( hi !of hello ) before you can proceed with your english language. Eiffel tower, Seine River, Arc de Triomphe, Musee de Orsay, Musee de Louvre all fabulous and shouldn't be miss when you are in Paris, and of course the Champ Elysees when you want to have a nice high class shopping, cafeteria and some small restaurant is ok but not cheap though. Try to go to toilet even if it's not your natures call because it's hard to find one, and if you are lucky enough at Mc Donalds sometimes it's lock and for customers only. Be careful with your belongings specially to all those crowded area be street wise. Sending postcard is 85 cents euro and stamp can only be available in what they call Tabac or some liquor store. I hope this info helps."
50,“DON'T GO TO PARIS!!!!!!!!!”,"Good! Now that I've got your attention, here's the scoop! Don't go to Paris if you are in love and don't want to become more in love! Don't go to Paris if PDA offends you, it's everywhere! Don't go to Paris if you don't like architecture, art, scupltures, churches or viewing the sacrophages of saints and the Crown of Thorns. Don't go if you expect English translations for all art exhibits! Don't go if you want to just take pictures in the museums and not view the beauty of the art! Don't go if you don't want to have great food and GREAT wine! Don't go if you don't want to experience incredible sights! Don't go if you can't tolerate spontaneous conversations with stangers who are not fluent in French. Don't go if you can't take a picture for total strangers who will GLADLY take YOUR picture after you've taken theirs! Don't go if you don't like to walk and soak up the whole atmosphere! Don't go if you can't say no to beggars, but yes to a mime, an accordianist, or a 20 piece ensemble in the middle of a plaza for a few cents or a Euro. Don't go to Paris if your hate baquetts, chocolate, or expresso. Don't go if you cannot go to Starbucks and go to a local cafe for your morning jolt! Don't go if David, Rodin, or Van Gogh does not bring you to your knees! Just-Don""t-Go!"
50,“Paris - City of Friendliness”,"Contrary to most comments about unfriendly people and poor service in Paris, we were pleasantly suprised on our recent visit to Paris. Everyone we met - on the streets, in the restaurants, at our hotel, at the tourist spots etc, were simply friendly and ever willing to help us. Best of all, everyone we met spoke (I repeat, spoke) English or at least some tried. To us, Paris is not only the City of Lights but also the City of Friendliness!"
50,“My Wife & I Love Paris and Will Definitely Go Back!”,"Paris has so many interesting neighborhoods, each with their own personality. We spent the first week in April there. The temp. was in the 60's F. The trees and flowers were starting to bud and bloom. We found a very affordable apartment through myparisvisit.com 2 blocks from the Louvre and 3 blocks from the Pompidou. Unlike what you always read, the people were friendly and helpful, many spoke English. I think it helps to greet them in French and learn a few key phrases and words. Prices for meals were better than in Italy, and the portions were good sized. The city is safe (didn't get pick-pocketed) & clean (except for my comment below). We got around by metro or walking. Buy the carnet which is a discounted pack of 10 metro tickets. Go by foot as much as you can. That way you really get a feel for the city. By walking you can pick up a crepe for snack, discover a street market, and enjoy the neighborhoods, the shops, and the ambiance. The cathedrals and art are amazing. The best souvenir bargains are at Montmartre and in the Latin Quarter just south of Notre Dame. The worst parts of our trip were that the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, and Versaille were crowded with tour & school groups, so many people smoked (fortunately it is banned indoors), and watch out for the dog poo on the street! Otherwise, we had a great time!"
50,“love paris”,i had only heard of paris being the lovers city .. never believed it ..until i went there .. and i fell in love .. with the city .. cannot explain whats in it .. but it is certainly there .. the magic ..
10,“I'll NEVER go back!!!”,"Went there to see specific sites. Got to see what I wanted, but not without problems. First of all, Paris is a VERY dirty city!!!! There are street peddlers that are EXTREMELY aggressive. On more than one occasion I had to be firm in my refusal of their offers. On a walk down the River Sienna, my wife and I were hounded and followed for about a city block by a couple of homeless peddlers. One was selling flowers, while the other was just walking with him. They both were very aggressive in trying to sell us some flowers. When my refusal became offensive to them on the FIFTH time, one of them pushed me and yelled something in some language other than English, French, Spanish, or Polish. (wife=polish, me=American). This turned into a wresting match that was broken up by HOSTILE AND RUDE French Police. It did not matter that I AM A POLICE OFFICER MY SELF!!! THEY DIDN'T CARE!!!! A fellow Law Enforcement, they were ready to take the word of a couple of guys who were obviously out to rob someone over mine. These guys had me in handcuffs and were yelling at me and my wife. They scarred my wife to death, had her in tears thinking that we were going to jail in a foreign country. All because I defended myself and my wife and I know how to handle myself. I'm not saying that I deserve special treatment b/c I am a cop, NO WAY! What I am saying is that I have no reason to lie. I did not want them arrested, I just wanted for my wife and I to get out of there and away from the area. I had one police officer telling while in the back seat of the police wagon, that the supervising officer on scene hated Americans and did not care if I was a police officer. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO FRANCE AGAIN NOR WILL I SUGGEST ANYONE TO GO THERE. ITS NOT WORTH IT!!"
50,“Dream Holiday”,"This time a year ago, (just got around to review) went to Paris with my daughter (travel agent). Had never been to Europe before but what a location. Managed to score upgrade to business class all the way (and back) - sensational! Stayed 9 nights in the Opera area at Citidenes apartments, which were perfectly located. Would recommend apartments to anyone. Did all the usual things, very cold, but still incredibly beautiful with so many ""take your breath away moments"". Then headed to Versailles for 3 nts at The Westin, just near the gates of the palace. Beautiful hotel, great location, lovely little town but a little frustrating to get around, no taxis, minimum buses and country shopping hours. We were there on weekend which was not the right time for shopping. Palace was superb but queue's of hundreds going in there. Loved the view from the room and the restaurant, which looked out over the countryside, so pretty, people walking their dogs and horses in paddocks, foggy etc, so pretty. Then back to Paris for the last 2 nights at Plaza Athenee. (You know where they filmed the episodes of Sex & The City). What a place, felt like a princess and was treated as such. Want to go back there before I die, beautiful rooms, attentive staff, little stools to put your Louis or Prada on when you sit down, so many delightful touches.Could go on all day, but if you want more detail, let me know. Cheers for now, Melbourne Tish"
20,“Paris - quel dommage!”,"After many years of thinking about it my wife and I decided to go to Paris. We have had a couple of scares flying recently so we went by train. The Eurostar was great; fast, comfortable and relatively quiet. Knowing that our hotel was not too far we decided to walk from Gare du Nord to our hotel we were not, however prepared for the Paris rush hour. On stepping out of the hotel there was litter everywhere, traffic everywhere the noise was deafening and there was a pervading smell of cigarettes and urine. To say that it was a shock to the senses is an understatement. However we made it safely to the hotel and checked in. We did some of the usual tourist things, visit the Louvre, a boat trip on the Seine, Notre Dame, Sacre Coeur but there is only so much you can do in 3 days. To see the Louvre exhibits fully would take at least 3 weeks so unless you have all that time I wouldn't bother. It is also very expensive - coffee and a beer (about ½ a pint) in a small out of the way bar cost €7. A sit down meal in a small restaurant will set you back around €60 - €70. That having been said the food was very good and the service excellent. There is a misconception that Parisians are arrogant but I can honestly say that we did not find that to be the case. Every shop assistant, waiter or attendant we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The people themselves go about their daily business as they do in any big city, everyone is in a hurry and they don't have time for anyone who gets in their way.The Metro is excellent and I would recommend that anyone going to Paris buys one of the season tickets for however long they wish to stay, we found them invaluable. The most disappointing thing about our trip was the litter and dirt on the streets and the beggars who are everywhere.In conclusion while there are wonderful things to see in Paris but the overall effect is spoilt by the state of the city streets, the pollution of cigarette smoke everywhere outside (it seems like 80% of Parisian adults smoke) and the beggars."
50,“Study up ahead of trip”,"Just returned from first trip to Paris with teenage daughter. Reading guidebooks ahead of time was very helpful!!!! American Express NOT accepted much..even when shops thought they could take it, would not work. Would be nice to have a Visa with chip in it to use in subway, etc. Buy metro tickets ahead of need so you don't get to a station that has no attendant and won't take your American credit cards. We had a fab time. Lots of cigarette smoke everywhere. Parc Disney GREAT. All the French folks were very helpful, and many speak awesome English."
50,“CDG to your hotel with public transportation”,"Everything I read before we left on our trip said that if flying into CDG airport and getting to your hotel on the trains/RER was confusing, and that you should just get a taxi. I wasn't willing to pay the 100euros for a taxi, and was very happy with the trains. The RER station was connected to the airport. We bought a one way ticket for all zones (paris operates on a 1-5 zone layout) and rode the train all the way into the center of Paris. Don't take a taxi, save your euros for the pastries. Check out www.rapt.info for more information."
50,“Paris apartment rentals - ParisPerfect”,"We have rented apartments for short term visits to Paris in the past. This has worked well for our family as we had access to kitchen and washer/dryer. This visit we booked through ParisPerfect. While their rates may be higher than other agencies, the service you receive is so worth it. ParisPerfect mainly handles small apartments on the Left Bank, but we rented from them a large apartment in the 4th. The apartment had a grand view, very comfortable beds, well supplied kitchen, practical furniture, and functioning heat, plumbing and appliances. The organization is very professional. They provide you with practical information both relating to the neighborhood for your apartment (bakeries, ATM machines, how to get there from the airport, restaurants etc) and then in general for Paris (guides, cooking schools, museum passes, metro tickets, taxis etc)."
20,“Caution taking Paris Metro”,"Purchased two one way metro ticket s and after entering the metro station threw the used ticket away in order not to confuse it with the unused ticket (they looked the same). Metro authorities at a station (the Eiffel Tower station) spot checked used tickets and because I did not have mine, charged me $25. Be careful to save used and unused tickets until out side of the station!"
50,“Using the Paris Metro”,"The Metro is incredible, everywhere is near one, There is one every few minutes, everyone uses it, it is easy to understand and has great signage. It takes no time to get everywhere. Best advice; Take the Metro to where ever then explore the area. It is one ticket per trip on the metro and buses, whether it is one stop or to the end of the line. It would be possible to ride on the Metro all day on one ticket if you didn't get out of the station. So if you were buying a ticket you say “un billet” (bee yay) no need to say to where. Each ticket for zone 1&2 is €1.5 and it is best to buy them in books of 10 and use them as you go.For longer stays it pays to buy a Navigo card from a major train station (5€) then add electronically a monthly pass to the card (50€) for zone 1&2 (the city) which gives unlimited travel on the metro and buses. You can add more months to the same card later and all can be paid by Visa. This saves money and time as the card is just swiped by waving your wallet or purse over a proximity reader each time you enter the Metro. You will need a small passport photo for the pass. If you need to go outside zones 1&2 only once (to Versailles, for example) a separate ticket will be cheaper than extending your pass to those zones."
20,“Paris is oh so expensive!!!!!”,"Went to Paris at the end of March for a celebration of family birthdays. The trip was reasonable and the hotel was poor but tolerable, but the food......... SOOOOO expensive!How can Parisiens cope with the cost and still eat out? And they do!! We paid silly money (£10 for a cheap half litre of house wine) and £10 for a sandwich and a glass of wine - and we are wise bunnies when it comes to food spending. While we didn't mind spending considerably more than anticipated, we expected to be able to have superb food for the extra cash. No such luck - even using the Great Eats in Paris book and the Trip Advisor Paris guide, we still had very average food for eye-watering sums.Recommended, though, for good grub at reasonable prices - Galierie 88 (in Trip Advisor guide) and Mouff' Tarts in Rue De Mouffetard (Latin Quarter). Stick to the Latin Quarter for more reasonable prices - pity we only found them on our last day."
50,“Awesome Trip to Paris”,"I went to Paris in May 2008. This was a great trip. I fell in love with this city. It was a little on the expensive side but well worth it.We stayed at the Hotel Observatoire Luxembourg[-] The rooms are very small but it is very cozy, very clean and the location was perfect. It is located very close to the latin quarter, where you can find restaurants and bars.We walked a lot but that is the best way to get to know the city.We took the Hop on Hop off bus tour for two days and I thought it was worth it. We visited:Notre DameEiffel TowerLouvre MuseumChamp EliseesCatacombes- This is spooky.Musee de L""ArmeeMontmartre- Sacre Heart ChurchWe did two tours:Fat Tire Bike Tour- Paris Night Bicycle Tour. Meet at the Eiffel Tower ( I think South Tower) Tel: 01-56-58-10-54. This is one of my favorite things I did. I enjoyed and I recommend it. They have another tour during the day and I have also heard is very good.We also took the Castle of the Loire tour. We visited Chambord Castle, Cheverny Castle and Chenonceau Castle. It was awesome. This was an all day tour.Paris is a great city, I would go back in a heartbeat. It has everything, food, wine,romance, beauty......"
50,“A green oasis in Paris”,"The Arènes de Lutèce is a wonderfull quiet oasis near the Jussieu Metro stop and the university. A Roman amphitheater from the first century AD, it has a large sunken arena where boys play soccer and men play pétanque. During the summer months the arena is surrounded by a forest-like park with benches in cool places and grassy areas for a picnik. There is a childrens playground at one end. Need to hear the birds sing? This is the place!"
50,“The best of Paris.”,"I stayed at my Parisian friend's house in the Buzenval district of Paris in early August for just under a week in 2008. I arrived at Gare du Nord.The first night I arrived, my friends took me to walk along the Sienne river. It looked beautiful and it was lovely to see people enjoying their boat, even in the later hours. We were hoping to be invited on board, but no such luck.During the day, my friend worked so I kept myself busy by exploring Paris on my own. I bought a week pass for the metro and used it an awful lot.I visited the Louvre museum, which is free to younger people of Friday afternoons. I spent most of my time in the Egyptian area.I went to the Sacre Coure and Montemarte which was stunning. Great views at the top and if the stairs look daunting then just get the hidden lift up to the left. Good little market stalls and shops about here. Cheap.For a major shop, I went to Les Halles in the centre of Paris. Huge shopping centre, almost like Lakeside in England. Do also go to Hotel de Ville to shop. Strasbourg St. Denis too.The Moulin Rouge is at the Blanche de Cliche stop and I had a snoop around in the welcome hall. I would suggest stopping off at Pigalle though and walking up because the bridge on the way has an amazing and interesting cemetery, unlike anything I have seen before.There are great places to eat around Odeon and the architecture may be of interest to some. St. Michel is on the way from here to Notre Dame.A visit to St. Paul is recommended for those who may be interested.I went to the Eiffle Tower and stood amongst the steps by the museum to watch it sparkle! Darling merry-go-rounds.Champes Elysses was stunning and I looked out for celebs. When we reached the Arc De Triomphe, I was yet again amazed and the beauty of it.The best place of all is a park in Boulonge Pont de St Cloud. It is a trek from the station which is located at the South-West edge of Paris... but it is more than worth it. Hire out a buggy or bike and enjoy. The staff at the small restuarant at the top, near the water feature were fantastic and made me feel at home.Everywhere is expensive to eat, but I recommend buying bits and bobs for packed lunch to then go eat at the Luxembourg gardens.My review is a bit patchy, I know, but my pictures should portray my experience better than my words can.Feel free to ask me about anything you want. I may know a bit more about museums, sites, money, places and other."
40,“Vibrant City with lots to see and do but not without it's negative aspects”,"The word Paris conjures up romance but alas like other major European cities there are little things that irritate you these days. Firstly with the exchange rate on the pound being so poor, Paris is a very expensive place to eat. Pizza's at £20, Burgers at £15 and even pineapple juices at £10. However, there is a great selection of things to do with the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, The Champs Ellysee, The Louvre and other museums to take note of like the Museum D'Orsay. Personally we enjoyed that museum more than the Louvre. No real difference in price though so if the Mona Lisa is a must then The Louvre it will be. Sacre Couer (not sure if i spelt that right) is a lovely church and the views from the top are breathtaking. This was possibly the best place we went to, access is via a spiral staircase with 300 steps that take you to the top. Cost is 5 EURO's but it is worth the climb as long as you don't mind heights.Unfortunately, Paris now seems to be awash with people trying to harass you into buying tat and some can become a little aggressive so be careful. A firm ""No"" will probably be enough. Beggars even approach you which is unlike say London for instance where they usually just sit.Finally I should add a word of caution regarding the LIDO and CRAZY HORSE shows, these are nothing like the West End shows we have in the UK and I can only describe the LIDO as a rich man's circus. Very expensive and the acts were not of a high standard. The dancing girls all look like models but that should not be the mainstay of any show and it gets repetitive very quickly. I've never been to Vegas but I expect these shows are similar to what you would get two a penny in the Casino's along the strip. All in all we enjoyed our trip but would not rush back. Having been to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Bruges (our favourite) and now Paris for our spring breaks in the last few years it could well be Oxford next year and some English culture."
40,"“Lovely, pretty city”","Paris is very pretty with lots of attractions and things to do.Enjoyed the Eiffel tower, just can't see how it's romantic going to the top with 100's of others to ask someone to marry you. Choose somewhere on the river in view of the tower away from the crowds, much more romantic.Be careful of fruadsters near Metro & attractions. We got stung by a guy pretending to help us buy 3 day Metro tickets only to be given a single ticket, we gave him €67 for what we thought were 3 day passes. When we tried to use them later in the day we found out they were invalid. We fill rather stupid now!!Also had a guy try to give us a gold ring saying we had dropped it. Thankfully we had already cottened on & refused to accept it.Metro is very easy to use. All lines have a number and the end destination.Loved Champs Elysee, wonderful shops & eateries.Take a boat trip along the Seine, you will see all the sights.Really worth a weekend away with a loved one."
50,“MEMORABLE VISIT TO PARIS IN WINTER”,"Patricia and Brendan from Ireland: We spent 6 nights in Jan 09 in Paris. It was everything we thought it would be. Very romantic and beautiful city. We went to champagne dinner and show at Moulin Rouge. So well organised and really sepectacular. We spent the last night on a 3hr dinner and boat trip on Seine - fantastic. They had really good live music and we actully got up and danced. Food and staff very nice. We will do that again. We stayed in Oceania Hotel near Porte de Versailles. Shower facilities excellent. Modern and very comfortable. Water in our room, ice machine and shoe cleaning machine on floor. Swimming pool closed for annual cleaning but we knew that before we went. Hot buffet breakfast excellent by Paris standards. We got room about half of usual price on roomex.com. Able to leave luggage at hotel last day free and visited Palace of Versaille as it was on that side of city. We then collected bags on way back to airport. Under ground and trains easy to negotiate and we never had to wait more than 3min for one. Buy the Tourist Vist card which you can use on all modes of transport for the amount of days you need buy it for. Very good value and it also gives you substantial money off some admission fees. We had been told that French might resent english speaking people, not so. Hotel staff and waiters were so friendly, at least four times when we must have appeared lost, french in street asked us if they could help us. Very impressed generally on how organised and on time everything was from trains to events. We visited mid January and most places still had Christmas decorations up.The weather was very cold but we knew to bring loads of warm clothes. We did feel everything was more expensive than Ireland and that would be our only complaint. If prices had been lower we would have spent more money.We look forward to returning to Paris again."
20,“Pickpockets!!”,"Paris is full of pickpockets. The Metro and around Effiel tower specially,keep your wallet in your front or shirt pocket NOT in the back. Also, keep your hand near your pocket. Beware of any stranger coming too close to you!"
40,“The Paris flea markets”,"Most people read the tourist books and go immediately to the Puces (fleas) at Clignancourt in Saint Oueun but a little more hard work can yield some great deals at the other markets. My favorite was Vanves. I went on the antiquing trip with www.EuropeAntiqueTrip.com in December and our guide brought us to Vanves first. It was a group of sellers who brought recent finds and set up on the sidewalk for the day rather than the permanent (and much more expensive) stalls at st. Oueun. At the edges of the markets there were people who spread out blankets on the sidewalk and put out a few things they probably found in thier attic. You may not be familiar with 19th century absinthe spoons but they are rather rare and valuable here in the United states. I found a guy who had five laid out on the street. I paid 0ne euro each!!! We also went to montrueil which had harder to find bargains amongst piles of trash and new junk. Don,t get me wrong, you still MUST go to Clignancourt! It is beyond belief. You will see the most fabulous antiques you can imagine. The super bargains at the Puces can be found early morning way down the end of the street beyond Paul Bert market. We also (as smalls buyers rather than furniture) found vernaison market to have good deals. Have fun shopping for antiques in Paris."
50,“My favourite place on Planet Earth”,"I visited Paris, the city of lights & the fashion capital of the world in 2004. The moment my flight landed and I got out after airport formalities, I fell in love with this place.I landed at 8 Pm in the evening, and this city of lights was mesmerizing. I quickly booked a taxi to my destination towards Cite Universitaire, who charged me 50 Euros, more than 10 times a train fare. Anyway, first time in a new country, one is better off spending some money, and then save later on.On my way, I saw Eiffel Tower, and for a moment my heartbeat went so fast out of sheer disbelief, that I was indeed in Paris. It was there for 4 months, and it was pleasantly cold.One would not get many Indians out there in Paris, apart from the Maison de Linde, which is India house there in Paris.I had a magical time there for 4 months. I visited Champs d elyse, Versailles, Notredame, and many places of historical significance.If you ever want a trip abroad for all the enjoyment of life, Paris is the ULTIMATE experience.Thanks for reading."
50,“week in france”,took the family for a week saw the sites. must do the fat bike tour. do it early in the trip. both day and nite tours and nice. saw the tour de france bike race the was very fun. rentend a flat on cyberrentals.com it was very nice near the st martin canal. subway was ez. must get a crape near the efile tower. behind the big fountian and up the stairs.
50,“the most beautiful city”,"Paris surely deserves its crown as the city of lights. Close your eyes and be droped at any square of any arrondisement of the city and you will think as if you were at the centre.that is because every square has its character, a number of restaurants and boutiques and always people walking by. I lived there for 6 years and till the day I left I still discovered new places or interest. My enthousiasm about Paris never diminished, just grew with the time. Whether you visit Montmarte for an afternoon walk near Sacre Couer or you roam in the Marais or you drive endlessly by the river Sein, or just have a rest in the Bois de Boulogne...Paris will not let you down..."
50,“Paris Lovers City”,"Paris is a lovers city. They are lot of things to visit in Paris. The famous Eiffel Tower is among the seven wonders of the world, I went to see Eiffel tower twiceonce in the morning where we took a lot of photographs. we can also go on top of tower by puchasing a ticket. It has 3 floors by lift. First one is a restaurant and sitting lounge. The other two floors are for sight seeing. I went on all the floors. The top most floor allows us to see the whole Paris. The tower has lights embedded on its pillars. In night after every hour they blink which is a great view. The other things for which Paris is famous for its Museams. They are lot of there. One is famous for Paintings. The well known Mona Lisa painting is there. The museam is one of the largest in the world. It has lot of paintings which are rare to see anywhere, Napelean apartment is one of most visited spot in the museam. There are lot of things to visit like arc de triumph, It is a place where salutation is given for the martyrs died in wars."
20,“I wouldn't go back there anymore... Once is enough”,"When I was planning our trip to Paris, I couldn't stop thinking about Louvre (I love museums) and how would it be to walk at the top of the Eiffel Tower... But then, when we arrived, I realized that no matter how beautiful the city can be... the people were so rude, unpolite, totally bad, I think I wanted to leave the city the same day I arrived, it was the most awful experience of a trip in my life.For me it's very important to feel like home, and althought I don't speak French (only a bit) I tried to talk in English, and it seems to be very bad for Parish people, they treated me so badly that I don't ever want to go back there anymore. I think Paris is famous because of their places, but it's just fame, I've been in much more beautiful cities were people really make the difference...I think everybody should go to Paris, that way, they would realize that there is nothing like home sweet home... It's a beautiful city, it has so much to see... but I wouldn't recommend any of my best friends to stay there more than 4 days... and I thinks that's too much..."
50,“The most romantic and beautiful places I've ever visited so far”,Such a romantic city....It is a must go place
40,“Studytrip to Paris”,"Paris was excellent! Although only 3 boys are in our class (being the main reason behind the hopeless romantic girls in our class picking Pairs as a resort) the trip was memorable! Paris has everything to offer. It is a city with great history, lot's of things to see, and lot's and lot's of cafes and restaurants should you tire from the sightseeing. Further more there are nice nightclubs.The down side is that their English is very poor as well as they will be disappointed for you not understanding them, ultimately leading to an arrogant behavior."
20,“Paris is Still favourable but filthy”,"We visited Paris fist time on May 2008And unlike other people impression on paris our first impression when we entered paris fom the airport by tain was that we found it filthy and smelly.Of course there are many beutifull things there but still some areas we visited as the famous Eifel tower, Triumprh monument, Versailes etc were also smelly and gabage was everywhere. Warsaw, Poland the city we visited before Paris was even cleaner.And of course the most terrrible thing about paris was that almost no body will help you when you speak english. I do not know whether they cant really speak english or they are too arrogant to speak in english"
50,“City of Lights”,Great place. Our favorite place to visit.
50,“My Favourite place in france”,"Paris is so beautiful and rich in culture! I roamed around paris all day and all the night, you have to see paris at night, its truely something else!!"
50,“I love Paris”,I have the most romantic trip in my life in Paris! The spring in Paris is marvellous!!!
50,“Beautiful World of Paris”,"A very beautiful metropolitan with a balance on modern and ""ancient"" world of Europe. Photographer, like me, would wish to have more time there... There are simply too many things to shoot (photographs, I mean)...In the end, everyone would enjoy their time here, no matter what"
40,“A long weekend in Paris”,"Just back from Paris. Landed Fri night late, had booked Parisshuttle for transfer from CDG airport. Phoned on arrival as per e-mail instruction only to be told there is no car available. Reason given : this sometimes happens and I will refund your credit card on Monday: Not a good start. Finished up using Air France coach transfer (open to any one) 17.50 Euro per person, and a Taxi 10 euro.Coaches run every 12 mins with two drop of f points in Paris.Stayed in Le Meridien Montparnasse - very nice clean hotel with great views (stayed on 20th floor) - bar and breakfast very expensive, 27Euro for continental breakfast. There are plenty of eating places and breakfast bars nearby (breakfast for 7 Euro). Its about 30 min walk to Eiffel tower and 30mins to Notre Dame if you like to use the Metro station is 500m away. Having spent 3 days there a better location would be somewere closer to theRiver Seine, which has a more laid back feel.. A must visit is Shakespeare bookshop just opposite Notre Dame (on left bank) . As a general guide a slow walk from Notre Dame to Eiffell tower takes 40 Mins and you will see most of sights on way. All in all a great city to walk around with good food in small bistros(16 - 25 Euro formula menu) no need to book just enjoy yourself. PS Don't miss a visit to Sacre Coeur/Montmatre - a definite must. From the left bank, you will need to take the metro."
50,“WOW! I can now understand all the hype!”,"We were 3 couples visiting Paris for the first time this past September, spent 6 days there. WOW! Now, I understand all the hype, and those who keep coming back year after year after year to this fabulous city. Absolutely LOVED it. Many thanks to TripAdvisor & its contributors - Big help in my trip planning. Sorry, this is my first trip review & it is long! Here goes:WED/Sept. 24A.M: arrived CDG. Arranged pick-up by Victor's limo. Dropped off bags at our hotel in the Latin quarter and just wandered around up to Mouffetard market area for lunch/back to hotel to complete check-in/wash-up/rest.6:00pm: at the Louvre. (No line ) Spent 2-2 1/2hours/and another hour at Tuileries Garden. Took a bite to eat in one of the restaurants on Rue de Rivoli; had my first crepe (sucre).THURS/Sept 25AM: Notre Dame Cathedral (in line 20 minutes before opening)/ Sainte Chappelle (no line)6pm: 3 1/2 - 4 hour Night Segway Tour which started & ended at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.FRI/Sept. 26AM: Musee D'Orsay (metro & lined up for about 20 minutes) spent about 2 hours here. Had lunch & back to hotel3:00pm: Fashion Show at Lafayette Gallerie/Haussmann area. (pre-booked this a couple of months prior) Afterwards, did a bit of window shopping while ogling the beautiful surroundings.To Angelina's for hot chocolate & macaroons! Met with Paris Vision Tour group in area.6pm: River Seine/Eiffel Tower dinner with Paris Vision Tour.SAT/Sept 278:15 am Picked-up from hotel (arranged thru Viator's) for a half-day Versailles tour.Mid-day: Dropped off at Ile St. Louis/Ile de la Cite area for lunch/had Berthillon ice cream/shopped some/walked around... Delightful afternoon with musicians/street performers on the street. We even requested and danced to tango music on the street of Paris on this beautiful-perfect weather day, with the Notre Dame Cathedral in the background, how romantic...Someone, pinch me - please!Late afternoon: Arc de Triumphe/Champs Elysses (for a few blocks before heading back to hotel).SUN/Sept 288:30 am Mass at Notre Dame Cathederal, then headed for theMontmarte/Sacre Coeur Basilica/Moulin Rouge/ area.MON./Sept. 2910am Marais neighborhood/Place des Vosges/Lu de Falafel for lunch. Did some shopping for souvenir, etc. Picked up some fresh fruits/bread & cheese for our last night in Paris!Tues/Sept. 30Early morning pick-up from Victor's limo for CDG for an AM flight.THINGS THAT DID NOT WORK OUT BUT WAS IN OUR ITINERARY:-We went to the Rodin Museum early Monday morning, it was closed (how did I miss that? I had a copy of Paris museums' schedule for crying out loud)-on Friday night, could not find a club that supposedly had a milonga (tango dancing) on the 3rd arrondissment.(did not contact organizers beforehand)-missed the Luxumbourg Garden/Opera Garnier/Chartier's Restaurant/Laduree - for lack of time.THINGS THAT WORKED:-Read and do your homework - It's a big help to have an itinerary, but be flexible if it doesn't pan out! and always, bring that sense of humour with you!- important tip I got from all of my readings and from TripAdvisor is grouping together interests/areas that you intend to visit and mapping them out (although this seem to be a no-brainer of an advice to any travels - never more so does this apply than in Paris where every block seem to have something interesting to offer)-mixing up organized tours as well as doing things on our own. (saved us a lot of time, not to mention our energy!)-did not buy museum passes but didn't have to wait in line or spend reasonable time doing so (as long as we went before opening time or as with the Louvre, going after 6pm).-We used the Metro (a delightful experience in itself... organized and great for people watching/we didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes waiting for a train!)-we walked a lot too/Got to love these comfortable Keens(shoes!)-Vacationing in a group, it helped to divvy up the responsibilities amongst us: one of us is an artist who directed us to the obligatory must-sees in the museums so as to assist in our limited time schedule, another who has an interest in maps was our personal GPS, and yet another whose line of work is in finance took care - of our tallied expenses, someone else scheduled most of the tours, confirmed/re-confirmed the arrangements, etc.In summary:-The French people could not have been more friendly or helpful.-Yes, someone in our group encountered someone trying to tie a string around one of her fingers, (I forget if it happened in the metro or was it at Montmarte but she quickly avoided it - but hey, this is just part of the whole experience!)-I purposely did not mention any restaurant names although my husband and I are adventuresome when it comes to food we really are not gourmet/food gurus. Sorry. (Suffice it to say that for the most part, we were happy in this department.)-We are (Argentine) tango dancers and among the highlights of our trip(if one can imagine counting 'em) and one of the reasons we were in Paris was definitely dancing under the stars nightly by the River Seine(by the Institut Du Monde Arabe). Weather could not have been more perfect, not a drop of rain the whole time we were there! Funny thing: when our plane landed 6 days before, the driver confirmed that it indeed was raining hard prior to our arrival and as we were boarding the plane for departure, it was just beginning to drizzle...REVIEWS:Hotel College du France: Excellent LOCATION, helpful staff, clean, basic accommodation.Victor's limo service: Excellent (RELIABLE service, came ON time both to/from airport & hotel)Paris-Vision/Seine river tour/Eiffel Tower dining: Good VALUE for your money (considering the cost of dining in Paris & that ""View"")Segway-night tour (arranged via Viator): Excellent.This is not an in-depth tour of the city by any means, but nevertheless KNOWLEADGABLE tour guide & FUN way of getting acquainted to the city.Versailles half-day tour. (private van arranged via Viator's) Very good. It was nice to be picked up on a private van that early in the day (8:15 am) There's a special line for pre-arranged groups like us but we all had to go thru the security line. We were provided an audio guide & you can then roam thru the Palace & the garden at your own pace. And since this was a weekend, we also saw the Fountain shows. Awesome.Finally:I've attached 3 pictures. 1st) is of all of us 3 deliriously happy couples (albeit lack of sleep after a 7-7 1/2 hour transAtlantic flight) on our first day: on the bridge Pont de Neuf, on the way to the Louvre. 2nd) My GF, Marce trying on a hat at a specialty store at Ile. St. Louis. 3rd) is of my husband and myself mezmerized, dancing under the stars by the Seine river...Yes, I know that we did all the ""touristy things"" and happily so:-I cannot wait for our next trip to Paris, perhaps then I can take that #69 bus that Rick Steves' mentions in one of his books, get to the things I missed the first time and/or just wander around..."
50,“Such a beautiful city”,"We've just spent a wonderful weekend in Paris, helped by some late summer/early autumn sunshine.It's a big city with so much to do so my advice would be to do what we did and check out the guide books and trip advisor and see which attractions you really want to see and then do an itinerary. I'm not saying fill every minute - you must allow plenty of time just to sit and people watch - it's such a great place to do that, but if you don't have a plan it's easy to wander and then not see as much as you'd like to have done.Do use the metro - it's cheap and quick, otherwise you will have aching feet!We managed to fit in the Musee D'Orsay - what a fabulous building, let alone the works of art. The view through the window in the clock is incredible... just like something out of a Bond film.A trip up the Eiffel Tower - do take everyone's advice and go early morning provided it's a clear day, avoiding the queues. It does get quite crowded at the top but it is so worth the wait and the views are just breathtaking. And it's amazing to see how much green space there is within Paris - so many parks and gardens.Notre Dame - free to go in and well worth seeing - stroll along the river and watch the jazz musicians playing on the bridge - I took some fab photos that I've converted to black and white and which would give the professionals a run for their money. On the same day we also did a trip along the river and got the best view of the Eiffel Tower for taking photographs.. some of the bridges - especially Alexander bridge are just stunning.Montmartre and Sacre Coeur - we ignored the warnings about how busy it gets at the weekend and went on a Sunday and the atmosphere is just great. So many street artists and whilst we were there they had a food festival on so all the streets around the church were filled with stalls selling the most delicious foods and wines. Everything from oysters, to crepes with Nutella, fresh breads, sausage, olives, chestnuts, almonds all accompanied by Champagne and lovely wines.We wandered along the Champs Elysees - we didn't bother with the designer shops - but there was a exhibition 100 years of aviation with lots of old planes lining the boulevard. Watch out for the traffic - you'd have to be mad to drive - we saw two accidents in less than half an hour. One woman who'd been hit got out of her car and crossed over to the guy who had hit her and kicked his car. They didn't appear to swap insurance details but then maybe they don't have insurance - there are so many dented cars about!We also sat in the Jardin du Luxembourg watching the Parisiens reading their papers and books and picnicing. Most had bottles of wine and were enjoying the company of others, some sat alone just reading. It was a really peaceful place with no sign whatsoever of any antisocial behaviour or drunkeness - just people enjoying the simple pleasures of life - and so nice to see.Eating out is a pleasure of course. There's much said and written about French cuisine and we were not disappointed. Our only disappointing meal was at the Lido , the show was fine - quite stunning in fact - but the food was poor considering the cost.One word of warning - do beware of pickpockets close to all the big attractions and a scam which I had read about and which I saw first hand.. whereby a young woman appears to pick up a gold ring and asks if it's yours - if you take it she then asks for money. We saw this happen twice and each time the people just ignored her and walked away and that was the end of the matter. Also if you are approached and asked if you speak English pretend you don't ,otherwise they thrust a piece of card at you giving some sob story and begging for money.All in all a wonderful experience, the architecture is just beautiful, spend time just looking up at the buildings... and most of all enjoy!"
50,“Paris for Foodies”,"I have just moved to Paris and as an amateur cook, I was happy to find that the French capital still retains some of the best food shops and markets in the world. Local bakeries, butchers, delicatessens, grocers and food markets, long since swallowed up in by supermarkets in other major cities, still play and important part of Parisian life. In almost every arrondissement you can find shops and markets selling food who's owners are still passionate abot the products they are selling and thus sell you the best!When I arrived in paris I came accross many good websites indicating the best places to buy the best products. One that sticks to mind is www.foodies.chsparis.com , which has wide selection of addresses as well of a handfull of well chosen cookery courses. Also www.foodbuzz.com/foodies/fr/france/paris that contains a selection of reviews by insiders.Anyone in the slightest bit interested in cooking or even just food should visit this wonderful city at the first oportunity. I was worried that small indepent shops might have disappeared like elswhere but France and food still go hand in hand!"
50,“Fantastic place.”,Disneyland...it realizes the dream!
50,“One night is never enough”,"What a beautiful, magical city. It certainly lives up to all the hype that speaks of a romantic getaway. I don't know why I have heard that it is a dirty city whose residents dislike Americans. I didn't have any problems with the Parisians. On the contrary, everyone was open and warm, very helpful and seemed to appreciate the business of tourists.I, unfortunately, was only there a short time, but I did get to see the Louvre, the Arc de Triumph, and the Moulin Rouge, go to the top of the Eiffel Tower, have a baguette and cappuccino in a darling cafe, and go on the Ferris Wheel (which, by the way, was the best 5 Euros ever spent!). I can't wait to go back!!"
50,"“Paris, what a wonderful city!”","Paris is just such a wonderful city, lots to see and do and great places to eat. The architecture is something else and a trip to the louvre is a must. The eiffel tower was great to do but be prepared for the crowds, we were ONLY 4 hours in total in line waiting to get to the top, but its just one of those things you have to do!The streets and the atmosphere in Paris is something that is so romantic, of course you must bring your other half with you otherwise I guess it wouldnt feel the same, but We both loved it and cant wait to return again..........We did the open tour bus ride around the city, its a great way to see the sights, if you are going to drive do so at your peril!! its a crazy city if you drive, i dont know how they do it!"
50,“Paris is Wonderful”,"The girls and I being the adventurous type, decided to take a trip to Paris this past spring in May. It was wonderful. I fell in love with Gay Paree so much I am returning in the next week with my husband.There is so much to do, that you really need to definitely do some prior planning before you go. Must sees are Musee du Louvre, Effiel Tower, Musee Rodin, Palace at Versailles, Notre Dame, Catacombs, Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees, to name a few.Getting around Paris is so easy. The Metro, RER, buses will get you anywhere you need to go quickly and safely. You can buy multi day passes and ride as much as you want. Just ensure that you get your pass for all of the areas that you plan to travel. (Areas 1-2 will get you to most of the major attractions, but you will need 1-6 if you are planning on going outside the bounds of Paris proper i.e. Airport, Versailles).You can and will be fined on the spot if you try and ride on a train that you haven't paid for. Couple of the girls found this out the hard way.As for the Parisians, we have all heard that they are rude and don't have time for us Americans. It was our experience that if you make a effort to speak to them in French and show respect, they are the nicest people in the world. (We did have one snooty waitperson, but whatever). The french are very proper people, so greeting and courtesy go a long way with them.Take the time to walk the streets and eat in the local cafes and I'm sure you will fall in love with Paris too!!!!"
40,“Weekend Coach Break”,"I went on weekend coach trip to Paris with my husband in June this year with Leger Holidays.We had a lovely time. It was our first coach holiday and although the travelling was tiring , we still really enjoyed the experience.The hotel we stayed in was a bit out of the way, about 45mins to 1 hour from the centre of Paris but we went on both night trips with the tour company into the city so it made getting there easy and the coach takes you into Paris on the first morning and picks you up later so you can sightsee.Paris is very easy to get around and you can walk if you are fit enough. We also used the Batobus which is a boat that stops at the major sights and once you buy your ticket you can hop on and off all day as you please and you get to travel the Seine.A word of warning for those of you want ing to go up the Eiffel tower. The queues are extremely long and you will queue for at least 2-3 hours for tickets. We were only there for a few days we didn't bother and the queues last throughout the whole day until it closes at midnight! You must make sure you see it at night when it it lit up and the lights twinkle at the start of every hour for 10 minutes.Anyway, if you want a birdseye view of the city you should take a ride up the Monparnasse tower. It's almost as tall as the Eiffel and has the fastest elevator in Europe to get you to the top. The 360 degree view that you see when you get there is well worth the 10 euros.The Louvre is a must see. Beautiful from the outside and you just have to see the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo whilst you are there as well as the pyramid entrance. No queue here and it was mid-afternoon.We went to Notre Dame but unfortunately there was a big religious ceremony that day so we couldn't get inside.The Sacre Coeur is wonderful. Its ceiling is amazing to see but the church stands on a very steep hill so only suitable for the more mobile and fit although there is a cable car most of the way up if you want to pay (about 80p) .The Arc de Triumph is another must see. You will be mesmerised by the traffic circling it. The roundabout has 12 exits and they drive like maniacs.We went to the Palace of Versailles but we only had half a day so we had to choose between a tour of the gardens or the palace. We opted for the latter. It is massive and renovations are ongoing but you get headsets that explain all the rooms and sights.We didn't find it expensive if you ate off the main streets and even a sandwich from a snack bar on the Champs d'Elysee was reasonable.The French are helpful and all speak English. All in all a lovely trip but I would like to return for a full week to see things we didn't get time to see this time and to be more leisurely in seeing the sights."
50,“My favourite European destination”,"We stayed in the colourful area of Montmartre on our visit to Paris..Although not exactly central to the main attractions,you can reach Montmarte easly enough by using the excellant metro system in Paris,and for anyone that enjoys the street entertainers of Covent garden in London,then this area and the adjoining Pigalle,could be just for you.I would however be extra vigilant in the evenings though,both these area's are well known for pick pockets.Our hotel was a short walk from the beautiful Sacre Coeur which offers some spectacular views of the Paris skyline,and the Moulin Rouge was nearby as well.We chose to do both the bus tour of the City and the boat trip down the Seine,you can actually purchase both tickets with the same company (batobus)and get a discount.You can buy these tickets near the Eiiffel tower on the banks of the Seine.The boat operates like many bus tours,on a hop on hop off system and is great for visiting sites like the Notre Dame cathedral and the Louvre museum,and the beautiful Saint-Chapelle.My only regret was not using the service in the evening as Paris is such a beauiful city when it's lit up at night time.A word of warning to anyone who itends on eating anywhere near the major tourist attractions,Paris can be an extremely expesnive city, so it pays to eat and drink a little bit away from the likes of the Eiffel tower, and the Notre Dame.For anyone wanting to visit the Louvre,i would strongly recommend affording the best part of a full day if you wish to walk round all of the it,this museum is huge and theirs so much to see.No trip to Paris would be complete without a visit to the famous fashion districts,we just got off the bus and spent a couple of hours walking round the world famous shops.A short walk from here is the Place de La Concorde,for me the most beautiful site in the whole of Paris and a short walk from the Champs Elysees.The walk along the Champs Elysees leads to the famous Arc De Triomphe,which is also well worth a visit even if only to clmb the many steps to appreciate the view from the top and to look down on all the crazy drivers below!paris is possibly my favourite City, and one i intend to visit again in the not too distant future.Again though,beware of the pick pockets.this is another area well know for thiefs!"
50,“paris vacation tips!!!”,"We just returned from visiting my parents in France.We wanted to do the main sights of Paris in a limited time.We took a shuttle from the airport (usually free) to the RER train station at the airport.There are ticket vending machines , but we advise queuing up to ensure you are purchasing the correct ticket and ask questions, they usually speak good enough English.Buy the 18Euro all day ticket or just to your destination.The all day covers busses and metro too.The 1st day we did to our destination and it was 12Euro return trip.We got off the RER to Paris train at Notre Dame.As you leave the station ask for directions as you can't see it from there. It's very close though. If you don't speak french just say "" Notre Dame?"" in a high questioning voice!! This works for all situations! We viewed the beautiful cathedral, which is free to enter, unless you want to go up to the gargoils.The lines may be long though.Here we boarded the wonderful, inexpensive ""bato bus!!!"" Check out the web site as there are more stops than we made if u have the time.Again, ask for directions, not far. On this river Seine boat you may get on and off like a bus. there were no lines and the boat came every 15 mins. WONDERFUL!!!We got off at the Louvre.BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE BEFORE YOU GO!!!Ticketnow.com I think, but google it.With these tickets you DON'T STAND IN LINE! You enter the museum by the pryamid RICHELIEU entrance. Walk right in thru security . Tickets are checked at each wing on the inside.The mona lisa, venus de milo etc are very well directed and posted. BEAUTIFUL time, our favorite in Paris.If you do the all day ticket and not bato bus, you take the RER to Chatelet les halles or Metro to musee de Louvre.From here we got on the bato bus to Eiffel tower. Amazing!Lines too long though. The only way up with my husband's limited patience is to do the steps(which is cheaper too), but he also is not athletic, so he passed. I passed as it's too high for me!!It was enough to admire from the ground.Ignore all gypsies...it's a scam.The arc de Triumph is a fair walk from here.You can also walk to it from the Louvre, one straight shot down the champs Elyses.Again, too far for us though.We took the METRO to Charles de Gaule etoile. It is above you as you exit the station. accross the street is under ground access to it and the tomb of the unknown. The only way to the top is steps(unless u r disabled).Avoid cafes and restaurants.VERY EXPENSIVE!Grab a crepe, baguette( sandwich) etc en route from a street vendor.(note- a galette is a savory, ie cheese, crepe made with brown flour!)Food not brilliant. Samll portions, expensive and unusual menu options, horse, shark etc. Watch out for the fish, it will be whole and mine had an egg sack too.Nasty.Hotel rooms are again expensive. the cheap end of the scale($60)Pemiere First Classe ( by the airport). Clean but TINY. If you are fore warned then it's ok. We were, so it was actually kind of funny.Make sure you have change for the vendings.Had a free airport shuttle.3 tiny beds in each room, one is a bunk.Bathroom like one you find in a camper.But, if u r tired, it serves a purpose!! Caution Maid walks in unannounced !!!On our return we opted for Holiday inn Express. Use Hotwire.com for a good rate. $150. This saved us because we had 2 kids and most hotels sleep only 2-3. More of an American standard room. 2 queen beds. roomier bathroom, drink facilities. Put the room card in the slot to power the electricity!!! They didn't tell us at front desk and took us a few mins to figure out!This shuttle was 5euro per room round trip. They don't really check the tickets though, your choice!!!My best tips are to ask, ask, ask. Don't waste time looking, the French are actually, contrary to belief, very friendly.However, they tend to say everything is 10 mins away, so don't take that literally!!!!!!!!But, most importantly, savour every second. the beautiful buildings, the history, even the smells!!! ( worse in markets and stores!)The critical factor to enjoying your trip to France( and most of Europe) is that you leave your American expectations behind. The rest of the world doesn't match the conveniences and service known to the US. You might have to pay for the bathroom, you will have to stand in queues, you won't get much ice in your beverage, milk might be warm and the bread rock hard, but it's part of the experience!!!!You can't beat the coffee!!!! Ask for cafe au lait or cafe creme, if you take milk, or I recommend it anyway as the coffee is so much fuller bodied that in the States. Also, ask for grande as it will come in a demi tasse, which is the tiny little shot glass size!And, surprisingly enough, Mc Donald's kicks butt in France!!!!!! Very fast and efficient!!! Your food is being put on your tray as you order.......just good luck finding a seat in some locations!!!!Bon Voyage- we did!!!!!!!!"
50,"“Paris, France Feb 2008”","I have a wonderful time in Paris, FranceThe people were great. The hotel room was small - but clean and great location. The tour guilde from www.goaheadtours.comwas great.I wish to visit Paris again"
30,“My Paris experience”,"My experience with Paris is this. NEVER drive through the city. You are much safer by taking a plane or a train to paris. I would highly recommend the metro system, it is phenominal! The food in paris is good depending on what you get. I personally loved the crepes and the escargot. I did not like however, the oysters and the mustard grain potatoes and the fromage. Shopping in Paris is amazing! The museums are very nice. The eiffle tower still takes my breath away. The Latin Quarter is a must see. Montmartre is beautiful, but something that has to be seen with caution, due to the nature of the area that it is located. (Red light type district). The little cafe's are very quaint. Ibis hotels are a great steal that offer long weekend packages! All in all Paris was good, but not great! For me personally that is, it all varies on what you are looking for! My husband and i visited just about everything there is to visit, and ate just about everything there was to eat, therefor i would be more than happy to recommend going to paris to everyone, if not just for the crepes!"
40,"“Nice city, ashame about the people and the prices!”","My partner and I travelled to Paris for a short city break on the 13-15 July 08. We flew into CDG and transferred by train to Paris. This was a terrible experience. The girl at the information desk at CDG was impolite and posessing a dour and unfriendly disposition. Asking for help from the staff at Gare Du Nord as to what platform we needed to go to was like banging your head against a brick wall. They were the most ignorant people I have ever had to deal with.Our hotel, Residence Des Trois Poussins on Rue Clauzel, was nice, not outstanding as it could do with a couple of improvements. The breakfast was poor, and the receptionist contemptuously balked at my asking if they done English breakfast. As there are plenty of Brits using the hotel, it is not an unreasonable question. The room was nice and comfortable, and appeared to be recently decorated . The lack of tea and coffee facilities in the room were a basic failing, especially as they would charge you 2.5 Euro for a coffee from room service. You also could not order a starter or a dessert from the room service unless you had a main course. Overall though, the hotel was good and the staff polite, by Parisian standards.We toured the City on Bastille Day. What we seen of the parade was good and we fitted in a good number of the sites. The Arc De Triumph and the Louvre were excellent and genuinely stunning and awe inspiring. The architecture of the buildings along the Siene is beautiful. It truly is a beautiful place. We arrived at the Eiffel Tower just as it was closing early so we never got to go up. I will go back just to get up it as it looks amazing.During our travels round on Bastille Day, the Parisians were as unhelpful and ignorant as they had been the day before. The politest and most helpful inhabitant of the city we met was a young lad from Bristol.The meals we had were nice and not too pricey, though the drinks to accompany the food were extortionate, meaning the overall bill was expensive. At one restaurant, a 50cl beer was 9.6 Euro (£7.67) and a bottle of wine 35 Euro. This was not a posh restaurant either. Eating snacks at a Cafe is where you really get stung. We had a crepe and a coffee each at one cafe and it cost 20 Euro.Overall, Paris is a place that has to be visited as it has so much to see. The city has enough character to make up for the unpleasantness of some of its inhabitants. I would not go back to stay though. If I ever go to France for another visit I would only travel in to Paris to go up the Eiffel Tower and then I would leave."
30,“Romantic City?”,"Close your eyes and imagine your in one of the most talked about romantic city in the world........My wife and I went to Paris on a coach tour. Which we found to be a great way of seeing the city, because we didnt have to worry about getting around. We did decide on our free day to go to Euro Disney.The hotel was very nice, the room was basic and clean and the restaurant there was good too. In a good spot to catch the metro and there was choice of restaraunts and bars around. Best one we went to was the New Oxford in Avenue Clichy.The coach company we went with was Crusader holidays.our tour guide was brilliant - Bev was full of knowledge and humour and looked after us very well. The driver Martin made the ride and pick ups very comfortable.I wasnt really that awe struck with the Eiffel Tower, you dont really need to go right to the top to get a fantastic view of the city, unless you really have to go to the top, the second floor is just as good. I did take loads of pictures though. The Arc de Truimph was more impressive.If you want to get some good pics go to Monmarte just before the sun goes down. This is the place to get your potrait done and some really nice paintings - only go to the people in the centre, not the ones walking around for a good drawing done of you. I wasnt overly impressed with the restraunts there.Be careful it is really expensive to eat in the centre of paris and it might be good to go to a supermarket outside and bring your own sandwiches in and have a picnic. We went into this store which is like Harrods behind the Music Acadamey. nearly E30 for 2 sandwiches, 2 desserts and 2 drinks. It is worth going in and looking at the archetectureThis is one of the cleanist cities in the world too. People clean and wash the streets twice daily.For me personally the biggest turn off of Paris was all the people on the streets smoking and carelsy flicking their cig butts in any direction. You couldnt pass somewhere without someone blowing smoke in your direction. My biggest suprise was people smoking in Euro Disney, this is supposed to be the land of child hood, dreams and make believe.Coach loads of kids bombarded the Versailles and other attractions. We didnt actually get a chance to go and in see inside. We took time out and saw the gardens on the train. The best way to see them is to hire a golf buggy there.I thought Euro Disney was fantastic. My wife has been to Florida 5 times and felt that going to this one it was like an introduction to Florida. I enjoyed the Aerosmith ride the most, Space Mountain my glasses nearly flew off my face, I think Nemo ride was too rough and Pirates of the Caribean was really really good. Its well worth the money for the amount of rides and fun we had E60"
40,“Latin Quarter Paris”,"The location is excellent if your getting to know Paris for the first time: you are in the latin Quarter near Notre Dame and St Germain for bars/restaurants/cafes. Youve got the Jardin de Luxemborg park within a 10 min walk and its a gr8 area for strolling having coffees/ beers and relaxing.A good area for first timers as I found it to be an area that was what I Imagined Paris would encompass. If you can find the metro station @ Odeon and venture downhill you will find some nice spots, also some great private art galleries that are nice to stroll past and enjoy the different works.Paris is a big city and a good travel book should show you the different quarters and what they have to offer. Enjoy!"
50,“Ah Paris!”,"I really enjoyed Paris. I have been there twice. I had to travel alone. but didn't have any problems. I speak some French although I didn't have to use it much.The little hotel I stayed at was very small, but clean and safe . The clerks were very protective of me when they found out I was alone. Don't go to this Metro stop, go around the corner and take the bus you can see more, be carefull here, there. Here is our address if you get lost etc.And I did get lost coming back to the hotel, I was in the Sorbonne area and everything looked the same. I went into another hotel lobbey showed them my card and the came out on the street with me and showed me where to turn, I was only a block or two off.Now if you want a cheap thrill ride the bus!!!"
30,“Paris is not as good as i think”,"There are very beatiful places and historical points, but i don´t feel so secure in Paris (i am from Rio de Janeiro, ok ?), the metro is very ugly and dirty,the people are so rude, that all the city beauty goes down...."
50,“Paris by Public Bus”,"Arrived two weeks ago and am finally sitting to write my review of Paris. I visited Paris 30 years ago and was anxious to see it with ""older"" and possibly ""wiser"" eyes. Paris does not disappoint. It is a wonderful city filled with beautiful buildings, people, food, places and things. There is nothing about Paris not to like!Our host family (we traded apartments for a week) were gracious enough to leave us a bus map. We never really gave much thought to traveling by bus since we arrived armed with metro map and tourist guides. Arriving at midnight from London (we took the Eurostar, fantastic!) at Gare du Nord, we took a cab to the 6th for about 17 euros. Located next to the Latin Quarter and Luxembourg Gardens, we were ideally located to walk and ride!Our first day entailed purchasing a carnet (10 tickets) riding to Notre Dame and climbing up to the towers, walking Ile de Cite and Ile St. Louis, walking along the Seine, having lunch at a sidewalk cafe, strolling and taking in the city and finally taking an evening bateau ride.I consider myself a savvy New Yorker and after reading and preparing for this trip for months was not prepared for the pickpocket who accosted my husband on our way to the D'Orsay Museum on our second day there! Disappointed but not daunted (the pickpocket was not successful) we decided to take up our hosts' idea and began traveling by bus. What a novel idea! We got to see Paris through the eyes of Parisians and continued to visit the rest of Paris by bus.From Sacre Coeur to Trocadero, we visited all of the city by bus.I must admit it was only after we got home I realized I never made note of the name of the booklet we used but I'm sure any book store in Paris must carry them. The booklet was divided by arrondisements and points of interests. The bus system equals the metro system in efficiency and many of the buses run till after 1 a.m.. Bus stops have electronic notices telling passengers how long till the next bus and when riding the bus there are announcements and maps designating the next stop. All bus stops have clear maps indicating the direction the bus is going.The week-long trip was wonderful! Great food, wonderful sights.We'd do it again in a New York minute."
50,“Amazing”,"Hi, I was in Paris two weeks a go for four days and my experience was amazing. I was skeptical about not speaking French and taking the train but I had no problems. Some people spoke English and some spoke Spanish and the rest, well, somehow we communicated. The train system is great, you don't have to wait long at all and it's fairly easy. Maybe being from NY helped me get the hang of it quikcly, but it was fast and cheap. Just get a map and familiarize yourself and it's no problem. I did all the tourist places to visit plus the Bike About Tour and that was great, I met a lot of people and the guy that runs it is a very nice guy. One highlight was going to Montmartre, it was so beatiful to be at the top of the hill to watch the sunset and the Eiffel Tower glittering. It really was beautiful and after you can go and have dinner at any of the the great restaurants. I don't recall excatly the names of the places I ate, I just know that wherever I landed the food was delicous. The Louvre museum was amazing, I gave myself 3 hours (because when I get tired, I get cranky) and I had lunch at their restaurant which was ok. One thing that makes the experience better in my view is getting the tour guide machine, aparatus, whatever is called. They give you detailed information about certain pieces that otherwise you may not have known. Also, be careful with the ... well I won't see whom, but with the groups, I felt that I had taken my invisible pill that day because I kept on being pushed around and I was very close to knocking someone but I refrained and used lots of self-control. Anyway, one night I was walking from the train to my hotel which was a 5 minute walk and I had a guy following me, so that was kind of freaky and I made a point of not doing that again, just be careful if you are a female and by yourself. Anyway, back to the museum, check out what you want to do first so you don't feel overwhelmed when you get there, there's so much to see but I didn't want to over-do-it. The hotel I stayed at was very clean and very accessible, it's called Hotel Residence Romance Malesherbes and the price was good and I was pleased, it's no Waldorf but it was just fine for me. I plan on going again, oh by the way, the women are beautiful and the men are just gorgeous...have fun!!!"
50,“I didn't go to Paris to save money...I saved money to go to Paris.”,"My travel motto is ""if you want things to be exactly like they are at home, stay home."" I reminded myself of this as I paid 5.5E ($8.80 CDN) for a coke and 6E (just under $10. CDN) for a coffee. I had planned on $100 CDN. per day for food, and found that 100E ($160.CDN) a day was more realistic. And this is dining at the bistro's, not the expensive restaurants, where a single meal could easily run into the hundreds of Euro's. The trade off, of course, is that so much of what you do in Paris is free: WALKING. Every street is an adventure. This is a culture that takes esthetics to new heights. Their love of their history, monuments, buildings, fountains and above all else, their parks, is a constant source of joy. And the attractions that you do pay for, primarily the museums, are a steal. And what you find inside those museums is often breathtaking. The Musee d'Orsay is certainly Number 1 on the list. The 5th floor alone, with it's endless collections of Renoir, VanGough, Serat, Manet, Monet, etc. kept me enraptured for an entire day. The guide book said plan for at least 2 hours.....I stayed 7, and then only saw part of it.I stayed at the Pavillon Louvre Hotel on Rue Moliere. Small, clean, quiet, comfortable and within a 5 min. walk of the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, the Seine, several Metro stops, etc. And very reasonable rates.Tips? See the Eiffel towel from the outside, especially at night, but skip going up the inside (I doubt anyone would take this advice...I certainly wouldn't have...but it's one of those 'you have to find out for yourself' things). At least get there early in the morning to be first in line, and avoid the weekends, when a 3 hr. wait is not uncommon. But for great views, and the best photo ops, go to the Arc d'Triomphe. It is spectacular. And think of this...when you see photo's of Paris, the most outstanding feature is the Eiffel Tower. Well, when you are IN the Eiffel Tower, it's NOT going to be in any of your photo's. From the Arc d'Triomphe, your view of the city (and the Tower) are unbeatable.Versaille. Plan for the entire day, go early (get the RER train from the Metro Station....it's cheap, fast, efficient...just ask when you get their) and buy your tickets in advance. Their is a kiosk as you approach the Palace that sells them. Trust me...you will save yourself an hour or two in the line-up (this I learned the hard way.) After seeing the apartments, walk down the gardens, and enjoy a true Parisian afternoon in a setting that is truly one-of-a-kind.Other highlights: The Opera House (Opera Garnier). Take a tour, and if possible attend a performance (but get orchestra seats...those gorgeous looking private boxes are not the best....and get very hot.) Street performers. They are everywhere, sometimes even on the Metro, and they are without exception TALENTED. These are not just kids begging for cash, these are gifted individuals who put great thought and preparation into their 'act'...be it juggling, dancing, singing, what have you.The tower at Notre Dame. The view is wonderful, and the gargoyles and chamera's are worth climbing those stairs.LaFayette. It's a shopping centre behind the Opera house. Imagine if Tiffany's did a MALL. You may not buy anything, but it's a wonderful experience, and the glass rotunda is spectacular. and if you ARE a shopper....it's a true paradise!The Metro. Their subway system may look overwhelming from the maps, with it's many different lines, but it is amazingly well organized....numbered, colour coded....you can get virtually anywhere fast. And if planning to do a lot of different things in one day, just buy a day pass....5.6E....probably the biggest bargain in the city.I found the people very friendly and helpful...their English was always better than my French (which is non existent.)Negatives? Cashing travelers cheques at the Cash marts. Be very careful....ask every time WHAT their rate is....and have them count the money out in front of you BEFORE they give it to you. Over a ten day period, I never saw the same person working at the local station more than once. Their rate was 5% one day; 7% another day....and 10% the day I DIDN'T ask!!! Also, they short-changed me once and it was quite a production to get them to admit their 'error'. The next time I will take cash or use credit cards.The Catacombs. It was something I wanted to see, and I'm a glad I did...but if you are the tiniest bit claustraphobic, avoid this by all means.Pigalle. Pig Hell, is what I called it. Reminded me of 47Street in the 70's. A gorgeous old area that has fallen victim to the hustlers, sex shops, scam artists, etc.Sacre Couer. Again, one of those things you have to find out for yourself. Yes, the views from atop the hill are spectacular, and the people watching is actually quite worth a visit. But the church itself is very tacky, and the area below is nothing but cheap souvenir shops, fast food outlets, and tens of thousands of kids....NOT that there's anything wrong with that. And if you ARE a teenager, you'll love it. Older people will want to find the nearest metro and make their get away.All in all....April in Paris was a spectacular get away. One I hope to do again soon."
40,“Thoroughly recommended!”,"Beautiful city with no end of things to see and gaze at. Make your main attraction visits early in the morning to avoid the crowds (Eiffel Tower - be there at 9.00am. Louvre - be there at 9.00am to get a good uncrowded view of the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo).Buy a Metro ""Visite"" card which gives unlimited access to the Metro, trains and buses.Take very comfortable shoes! Even with a ""Visite"" ticket you will still walk a lot as there is so much to entice you.The only downside was that it was very expensive to eat and drink - maybe the exchange rate at the moment - but it seemed very pricey, even in the not so smart areas. About £5.50 for a panini to eat in, about the same for a pint of lager and about £3 for an orange juice. Tickets for the museums, Eiffel Tower and Bateaux Mouche were not unreasonable and about what we expected or less (based on London prices)."
20,“Je n'aime pas Paris. Bleh.”,"Always carry change in your pocket for quick access to the toilet. The french food will give you the runs, and the restaurants on Champs Elyses will not let you use their restrooms for free (as most places in Paris don't). I've been to Paris twice, and I can assure you there are better places in Europe to visit."
50,“Tips for the ultimate Paris vacation!”,"- Stay awake – sleep at night. Get on Paris time the first day.- Enter Le Louvre via Rue Rivioli, through the Carrousel Du Louvre. Get tickets by the “food court”. You’ll miss the long lines!- Go to museums early! Avoid crowds- See Paris at night! Bateau Parisiens was the best dinner cruise ! The best dinner with a view! (make reservation through your hotel concierge to save money). Reserve early!- Eat at Le Ciel – 56th floor of Montparnasse Tower. Great view of the whole city. Good food. Need reservations.- Eat @ Restaurant au Grand Louvre. The best! Avoid stupid museum cafeteria.- Café Marly is another restaurant at the Louvre. Outside seating with a view of the Grand Pyramid and the entrance to the Louvre. Not expensive! Casual.- Galaries Lafayette is tres expensive! Shop Monoprix!- See Eiffel Tower w/group. Avoid crowds / lines.- Tour to take: Seinarama. You see city on the bus, then on the river, then to the Eiffel Tower. 3 hours.- Musee D’Orsay is the best museum. Start on top level.- Eat at Le Fin Gourmet. A very tiny, quaint, but DELICOUS restaurant on the Isle St. Louis. Make reservations. And bring the address. It’s hard to find, yet very easy! Right on the main street on the Island. 42 Rue St. Louis En Ile.- Hot dog at Harry’s New York Bar. 5 Rue Danou, near Opera. Try Bloody Mary, too. That’s where the bloody mary was invented!- Tipping is nice, not necessary.- Fauchon: lovely to look at, expensive. This is a great store, near the Madeleine, that has food, wines, pastries, chocolates, and everything wonderful!!- Near the Madeleine is Rue de Fauburg-St. Honore. This is the “Worth Avenue” of Paris. Great place to window shop. I do like Versace, though!- Best chocolate for the money: Jean Paul Hevin, 231 Rue St Honore.- Best / Original jewelry: Louis Edouard LeJeune, 25 Rue Royale, near Madelaine- When you get a basket of cut bread at some of the smaller restaurants / brasseries, be careful! Expect the bread to be left over from previous patrons!- Dinner on the Eiffel Tower is totally Five Star! Jules Verne. Really expensive. But a great treat! You’ll need reservations months in advance! You ride the private elevator to the 2nd floor and have a great dinner with a great view! Save your money and splurge here!- I love Sephora for perfume, make up, etc. It’s in the mall of the Louvre. We have Sephora here, but it’s huge in Paris!- La Tour D’Argent is the most famously expensive 5-Star restaurant in Paris. Very very fancy! Try it for lunch. Overlooking Notre Dame.- Must visit Montmartre / Sacre Coeur. The church on the hill is famous and fabulous. I always buy some original artwork at Place Du Tertre. There are lots of artists hanging around, painting.-The Metro is a GREAT way to get around the city! Just be aware of pick-pocketers!!! I’ve been robbed once, and almost robbed again! Hang on to your purse, especially when going through the turnstiles!- La Duree is a great place for sweets, lunch, chocolates, and they are famous for their macaroons. There are (at least) 3 locations. The best one (and hardest to get in to) in on the Champs Elysee. Near the new Louis Vuitton store, closer to the Arc de Triomphe.- Le Lido is a great cabaret!!! Pay for better seats, with a full bottle of champagne. Super dinner and a wonderful show!!! This is located across from Louis Vuitton, on the Champs Elysee.- I like to buy lingerie in Paris, just to say “I have lingerie from Paris”! I buy it at Monoprix. A much better deal than the fancy lingerie stores. (like $30 as opposed to $200!) There is a Monoprix on the Champs Elysee, and several other locations around the city."
50,“fantastic!”,"My husband & I have just returned from France. In total we spent 10 days in Paris. I was very surprised to read some of the negative reviews! We had heard the usual 'rude french' & 'dirty city' stories before, but could not disagree more.We never came across one unfriendly person in Paris, quite the contrary. We thought they were all extemely friendly. We had one slightly grumpy hotel receptionist, but that was in Normandy.We were very surprised at how clean the city is. Their green street sweepers seem to be everywhere!We walked everywhere for the first 5 days and would highly recommend it. You really get a good feel for the place when you do. We then started taking the metro and found it an excellent system and very easy to use. Make sure you buy tickets in lots of 10.Loved the view from Arc de Triomphe and Sacre-Coeur better than from Eiffel Tower.Found Paris to be very expensive, especially with our exchange rate, but what the heck, you only live once!We will definately return to Paris. Loved it."
40,“Paris in October”,"Paris. Took a day trip to Paris. The usual sights, i.e. Arc, Eiffel Tower, Seine etc. Arc very impressive, Eiffel tower impressive but looks dull during the day, best time for this is night when it is lit up and then it really does look the bees knees. The unfortunate think are the hawkers trying to sell you tacky plastic light up towers and they don't take no for an answer politely, we found we had to be rude in the end to get rid of them. Queues to go up the tower very long. Get rid of the street hawkers and this would be super at night to just sit by the Seine and relax with the tower as the focus. Champs Elysee very large, not a bad selection of shops and some of the arcades are worth exploring, you can find some good bargains if you look. French food very nice, french people extremely helpful. However, crossing roads is a nighmare, zebra crossings mean nothing in France. French taxi drivers leave you fearing for your life, they just cross in front of other vehicles withouta care in the world, so pedestrians beware, and close your eyes if you take a taxi! Would I go back, yes probably."
40,“Museum Tour”,"I made it through college without any debts so I decided to treat myself to a trip to Paris for my last art history class.We flew from KC to Washington D.C., then a nine hour flight to Paris.We stayed at a 2 star hotel. We had our own bathroom and were served breakfast of a crescent roll, french bread and hot chocolate or coffee. Every day my group met in a park to navigate to that day's museum(s).When moving about the city, we found it was much easier to take the Metro. The routes run regularly and are pretty dependable.Since this was an art history class, we visited many museums, in which they are abundant. The Luvre was freaking huge! It was incredible to see the scale of some of the paintings, especially those commissioned by royalty. A small picture in a history book just can't do them justice!The Picasso museum had to be my favorite. It displayed all styles and medium Picasso used including sculpture. I learned, from sketches on display, that Picasso was a bit of a perv!We also visited the Marmottan Monet Museum, which houses the largest collection of Monet paintings. I had never been a big fan of impressionist painting, however, when I saw them in person the colors were amazing! The painting conveys the emotions through colors and textures as much as the subject itself. Very impressive.You name the museum, we probably visited it. I would advise visiting a couple of museums, even if you wouldn't typically do it in the US. Great collections!Most days we bought sandwiches from street vendors. Usually a crusty loaf sliced down the middle, stuffed with ham, cheese, and tomatoes. We tried to buy loaves of bread to make sandwiches at the hotel. We discovered a couple of things at the grocery store. One, they don't have peanut butter. It is Nutella all the way! Two, floss and deoderant are ungodly expensive! No wonder that smell was in the Metro! Three, the milk was kept on the shelf and warm!One day we stumbled upon a heavily Greek populated area. I was in heaven! Gyros for four euro, what a deal. And every gyro was stuffed with french fries. We made numerous trips back to that area for lunches.Dinners were almost always tasty. We noticed how much slower the French eat their meals. The entire pace of life seems slower there. One night I was craving pizza. I wanted pepperoni, to be more specific. No such critter available! I had an oriental sausage pizza with an egg in the middle of it. Sunny side up in the middle of the pizza, who ever heard of that? Guess what? It was delicious!I would personally advise that you spend more on dinners than lunches, if you are on a budget. My roomie and I brought meal replacement bars to take with us for lunches.One of my favorite memories of Paris was spending an evening at Sacre Coure, on the front stairs watching the sun set, watching the lights blink on throughout the city (it is the highest point) and drinking wine. Okay, I drank a bit too much wine, but you have to cut loose every now and then. We stayed there listening to live music, drinking, and having fun until a fight broke out over one of the girls in our group. Bottles were being thrown and broken so we gathered our group and stumbled our way to the Metro.I would love to go back some day and see other sites besides museums!!"
50,“My Favorite Place”,"I loved Paris. So much to do. The Louvre was one of my favorite places and I spent most of a whole day there. It was exciting to see all of the art that I had studied in college up close. Although the Mona Lisa was kind of disappointing (too many people looking at it and it was a lot smaller than I had envisioned which also made it hard to see with the mounds of people in front of it), everything else was fantastic. Also try to get off the beaten track if you can and experience Paris with the Parisians. Also, try to speak French if you can, otherwise many people won't speak to you. Of course, they may answer you in English (they did me), but they'll answer you and appreciate that you tried. There's so much to do you can't really have a bad time in Paris."
50,“Current (NOVEMBER '07) changes Paris”,"Five weeks in Paris was absolutely heavenly -- tho did find things have changed a great deal since 2005... a few quick comments .The decline of the dollar is not the only thing Americans have to consider -- prices on everything have gone up. Prix-fix meals are now more like 25-35 euros at lunch and 35-40 at dinner at bistros, brassieres, etc.... a carnet of metro tickets is up to 11.20 -- and grocery prices (important to us because we rent an apartment for the month) have skyrocketed.Take advantage of the wonderful free concerts held at the churches -- not only do you experience wonderful music, but you get to see the neighborhood residents as well as the beautiful interior of a church you might not otherwise have visited. Pariscope will help you determine where and when to go.Another interesting free evening or afternoon are the book readings, signings at Village Voice, Shakespear and Co and WHSmith -- again check out Periscope."
50,“VERY Romantic!!!!”,Went her for Roamance & boy did I find it! Loved every minute of this city and think that everyone needs to go and experience it for themselves. I loved the Boulangeries and the Pizza was great too-yummy!
50,“What an amazing place!”,"My wife and I recently spent a few days in Paris. It was the first time in Europe for both of us. Although we looked forward to seeing the city, we had always heard about the infamous Parisian rudeness and the generally filthy conditions.Well, after walking (what seemed like) the entire city, seeing most of the major sites...the tower, the Arc, the Louvre, Notre Dame, Moulin Rouge, Seine River Cruise, etc, etc, etc... I can tell you, we absolutely loved the city and we can hardly wait to go back! The rudeness we on guard for - never happened. The filthy conditions didn't really exist...only in some of the smaller streets around the Moulin Rouge (which is right in the middle of the Red Light District - duh!) ... ok, a slight smell of urine in some parts of the subway (Metro) but whoop-dee doo. The downtown core and especially the places where tourists would want to go was immaculate.Here's our 'secrets' on how to enjoy the city...1. Buy a Visite Paris pass. The subways and the buses are your lifeline, the Visite Paris pass is your pay-once, ride forever cheapest, easiest way to see it all. Buy it BEFORE you leave home. I don't even think you can get it once your there.2. Buy a Museum Pass...saves money and just as importantly, saves time...standing in long lines is not a great way to spend your vacation. Again, don't leave home without it.3. OK, you're a tourist. - try not to act like one if you can help it. Leave your Hawaiian shirt and your crocs at home. Parisians have some style. Blend in a bit, dress up a notch.4. Attempt to speak the language...we're Canadian - but know very little French. Starting the conversation with 'Hi y'all, where's this here Iffy tower we keep seein' on the TV?' will probably bring out the aforementioned rudeness. Try 'bonjour, merci, est que tu parle Anglais?' (excuse bad spelling) You will be pleasantly surprised. We honestly found NO ONE who couldn't speak a little English. People were helpful and friendly everywhere we went. I truly cannot remember one sub-par encounter. Case in point... we were sitting beside an Irish fellow in a restaurant and his idea of 'Continetntal charm' was to wave his hand in a beckoning gesture and loudly say 'Ici garcon, si vous plais'...OK, he attempted the language...but treating people like lowly servants does not work well. I found resturant staff to be quite proud of what they do. I don't think they like being looked down upon...and they absolutely should not be. We need a little more of that attitude on this side of the pond. The Irishman waited a lot longer for his pints than we did.5. Don't be put off by your hotel room. They're small, they're old...you're only there to sleep, and if you have the energy after walking all day...whatever. Have low expectations here and you can only be pleasantly surprised.6. If you can live without going up in the Eiffel Tower, don't waste a lot of time there. The line ups are stupid. I think there are a lot of people who go to Paris, visit the tower only and do little else. Idiots! My wife and I found ourselves at the tower 3 separate times (once early in the morning), you will wait in line for hours, we never bothered waiting...not worth it in my opinion. Get your photo ops on the top of the Arc de Triomphe. It's a beautiful spot and - you can actually get great shots of the tower. No line ups and it's truly an awesome place on this planet.Follow these rules and you will come away feeling as my wife and I do about Paris... we loved it while we were there, we think about it now that we're home and we know we will someday go back."
20,“Just back from Paris and Riviera”,"I got back 2 days ago from a 2 week trip that started in Nice, included Marseille, Nimes, Avignon and ended in Paris for 5 days. We were there for the Rugby world cup so there were lots more tourists in town. I had been concerned about the clothes but they were no problem. definitely jeans everywhere on the streets ....including lots of white tennis shoes! but for the most part I think dark comfortable shoes were the most preferred. but feel free to wear anything and everything. the French women are wearing already their knee high boots a lot. out at night to a nice restaurant pants suit or slacks and sweater set or nice blouse are just fine. my husband took a jacket and never wore it.everything was very expensive by American standards and not up to what I consider American standards by a long shot! cleanliness is a big problem. bathrooms are a HUGE problem. I stayed virtually dehydrated as I did not drink much during the day because of lack of avaiability and when you did get one ,unless it was a pay one with an attendant , the state of it would be shocking! most often no soap and definitely no towels or dryer. and the men and women wash their hands at the same lavatory at the same time. It was just unbelieveable by US standards. In Marseille at the stadium the womens toilet was even what was called a ""squat hole"". I had never heard or seen anything like it. I thought I was in the mens toilet!the food was less than so-so. the croissants and pasteries were great as were the french fries. they have lots of pizza and Italian food. the breakfasts in the hotels are expensive and very European. not good bacon and eggs like we would expect.We stayed in 4 star hotels so they were always very nice.In Paris it was great to see the sites and the architecture was beautiful. the French people were nice and most things were in english so we did not suffer there. It was suspected that as long as France was in the running for the world cup they would be nice. We were only treated rudely once actually. But do not expect service in a restaurant! non existent. they bring your food and NEVER return to see if you want another drink or anything. There is no need to tip as it is included so I think that is the reason there is no service. It was like this everywhere we went.Go to Galleries Layfayette. It is a huge dept store chain much like our Macys but has tons of high end designer things. there is a wonderful deli section in the mens building in paris where you can eat and buy foods. really nice.Would I go back? well never say never but it would really have to be some good good reason for me to return. I never want to come home from vacation and this time I was ready DAYS in advance.You might think that I am picky but I really am not. I am pretty laid back on food and pretty adaptable. This was just not my cup of tea. I have a friend that loves Paris. so who can tell?I would go back to Vienna in a heart beat though."
40,“Paris is still the top tourist destination in the world for a reason!!!”,"Paris is one of the easiest cities to visit in the world. Once you get out of the madness at Charles de Gauille, you are on easy street. The Metro takes you everywhere. The food is fabulous. The markets are even better. The museums are unbelievable. And the architecture is without equal.You may have heard all the horror stories:Rude people, crowds, high prices.They are all true.Paris is a big city. Big city people are harsh. Try New York or Chicago... it is the same. If you attempt the language and educate yourself with a guidebook and maps, people will respect you and treat you better.Crowds only subside in the winter. If you want to avoid big crowds and long lines traveling in the winter is your only option.Prices are high for good food and good attractions... so keep that in mind. If you want to save some money, picnics and passes are the way to go. Picnics are easy to prepare at the bakeries, cheese shops, and market stands. You can buy multiple attraction passes and save money as well.Finally, I know some will disagree, but the REAL France is not in Paris. Paris is a melting pot. The real France is in the countryside. Splendid people and places await you in the smallest of towns. A trip to France is not complete unless you leave the tourist towns behind for a day or two."
50,“Wonderful Vacation”,"We loved everything about Paris. From our hotels, transportation, museums and people, we were not disappointed. We spent 4 days in the Latin Quarter which was a suberb location to explore all the major tourist attractions. We were close enought to walk to most places and enjoyed the lively street life at night. We found some marvelous places to eat, especially the La Maree Verte and Chez Clement. I would avoid places like the Le Procope and Coupole. We had on many occasions asked the local people for directions during our vacation and always received friendly helpful advise. We would recommend Paris to anyone who wants a great vacation in a very busy city full of history and architecture."
10,“Snobbies people I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!”,"During the summer I travelled thru England, France, Belguim, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Czech, Austria, and Switzerland. I enjoyed everyplace that I have travelled thru except France (especially Paris). People were very snobby and hated anybody that didn't talk French. I knew very little French from grade school - 40 years ago. The small hotels ripped us off by not telling us about certain costs (eg. shower, extra key, etc.). When we went to restaurants they gave us a hard time with the menu's. The info centre didn't give us correct directions because they refused to talk in English. I was totally disappointed with everone that we encounted. The rest of France was no to bad but Paris - never again will I go there. The city of Romance my [--]. People treat French speakers very nicely but everyone else was treated like crap."
40,“Better than expected”,"We spend four nights in Paris at the end of a 3 week Italian/Mediterranean holiday. This was my first time to Paris and I was expecting to be treated rudely and only spoken to in French. Not so. I found the Parisians to be friendly and accommodating. Perhaps, not so much as the Italians, but much better than expected. Just about everyone spoke English.My biggest gripe would be with the train system. All the signs are in French with no English subtitles. Come on, even in China we found all signs to have English translations! The same was true of the Palace of Versailles, all signs were in French.The city was suprisingly clean and easy to get around on foot, bus or using the Metro. It is an expensive city to visit. France's high VAT tax plus the Euro/Dollar valuation makes this one of the most expensive places to travel. Nevertheless, the city is a ""must see"" destination. I am glad we went."
50,“Great City”,We had a great time. Stay at a hotel close to the metro because it makes it so much easier to get around. I would not drive in this town if you are a tourist. Our interactions with the locals was mostly good with the exception of 2 people.
50,“Nightlife - Best bars and discos”,"Look, Paris is expensive, and your cocktails are 10 Euros a go – everywhere. So be wary of recommendations of the Buddha Bar or Champs Elysees bars and clubs – you will be fleeced for entry and drinks, so my advice would be to avoid these tourist hotspots for drink and dance.Pigalle / Moulin Rouge.Honestly the best area for nightlife was outside the world famous Moulin Rouge, at Pigalle metro. This is NW of Paris centre, and behind the main street is the Monte Matre, where some of the film Amelie was recorded.The best bar and disco was O’Sullivan’s Irish bar (though not very Irish), which is next door to Moulin Rouge and has a fantastic disco on a Saturday – absolutely full. Two doors up is the Locomotive disco with three levels. Choice of entry prices from 12 Euros, to include a free cocktail. This was also a good ""pulling"" disco.Be wary outside the Moulin Rouge area however, there is some crime and alcohol fuelled beligerance from some of the locals,and a lot of sex outlets.It’s completely safe behind though, on Rue des Abbesses – very French and pleasant, quieter bars and cafes. An exception would be Le Sancerre which I'm told is the best - it looked like lively potential but we were quite early.Bastille / Rue de LappeIn the Bastille area, I’m told the huge and chic Barrio Latino is also a great spot for having drinks and tapas but we thought it was just OK. Instead in Bastille I would recommend Wax disco which is free entry and Disco music on a Sunday, and go after 10pm. Other nights they play a lot of RnB music but nice girls.The friendly Balajo was a bar we could not locate, or maybe we were in there! Either way, take a look perhaps.You will find a lot of competition from the local males. French men are not known for their manners and will push into your conversation and dance, and it is a real free for all. I found them very jealous and possessive! Don’t be offended, just adapt!Rue OberkampfWalk north from Bastille and you will find the Rue Oberkampf with one bar in particular – Café Charbon. This is a bar and eaterie but quickly turns into a dancefloor at weekends. Great pop and disco tunes for a starter bar.We avoided The Marais because of its gay reputation, but we were heteros on holiday.Also I would like to point out that Gard du Nord and Gare de l’Est are very African areas with cheaper hotels. It is quite safe, but sometimes a surprise for newcomers to Paris to see a very strong north African culture here. You can save money if you hotel here.So, in conclusion, start in Cafe Charbon, walk down to Bastille and end up in Wax. On the next day, Metro to Pigalle (it's really cheap at 1.50 Euros) and look at the Monument at the back for views. Start in one of the bars on Rue des Abesses and then walk down to O'Sullivans and Locomotive. Repeat and add in more bars!During the day, of course, you must see the Eiffel Tower - it is pretty awesome from Trocadero direction. Almost surreal to see this huge symbol of France right in front of you. Enjoy!"
50,“A Must See!”,"according to me, if you go to Europe, or france alone, you MUST visit Paris! I went all over Europe, and Paris, France had the best art, shopping, and some nice hotels! If you cant, or dont seem to want to go, but want to hear about it... Send me a message! Im always here for any travel help in Europe!"
50,"“Ah, Paris!”","Loved it! The city was beautiful, full of diverse people, cultures, art, food, and surprisingly clean for a large metropolis (probably due to the fact that Parisians do Not do take-out or to-go). I can't wait to go again as there were many sights we didn't get a chance to see."
50,“city of lights”,"Paris has something for all ages, it has history nightlife, museums a plenty, glorious food, and somuch more, it is impossible to find a bad side to this lovely city."
40,“Go to Paris or You Won't Know What It's Really Like!”,"One thing I would definitely say is that you should go visit Paris when the weather is nice and warm, because when it is raining, especially in winter/spring, the weather gets so cold you wouldnt be able to enjoy anything at all. If you dont speak French, you're even more stuck. Stay away from the train stations, as it is dangerous especially for girls. Eat a lot of their bugettes, crepes and coffee drinks, they're the best in the world!!!!!"
50,“My favorite city!!”,"Great city, lots to do, easy to get around, and especially great for food!! Easiest way to get around is by metro or RER, it wil take you anywhere and close to any major tourist attraction. Better to use the metro and see or go somewhere on your own time, in the order you want and stay as long or little as you want. Tours do not do justice to the city versus seeing it for yourself. Make sure to see the Eiffel Tower sparkle at night every hour. Restuarants are abundant. Laduree is great for dinner and desserts on the Champ de Elysees. Try Montibellos by Notre Dame. Great restaurants with a fixed price menu that was very affordable."
50,“My twopence worth”,"People have been gushing about Paris for years and I just went to do the (super cliche) romantic weekend with my boyfriend.We stayed in Montmatre (spelling?) which he promised me was the best place to stay... and it is, as long as you're not too bothered about seeing the sites. Very romantic village feel and lots of caes and stuff. Loads of american toursits which spoils it a bit but you can't really get away from them anywhere in Paris."
40,“Romantic Paris”,"It is a fantastic city and i wish I'd gone years ago, the public transport is fantastic and cheap, the metro takes you everywhere after you work out the map. There is tour bus that you can hop on and off all day at the sites for about 20euro, all the museums and sites were very reasonable i thought i.e. 10euro to go up the Eiffel tower. The boat trip is a must. The accom is very good we stayed at La Sorbonne Hotel (b&b) £20 pp a nite not bad for the local and cleanness of hotel. The only down side is the price of drink £4.50 for a pint. But overall a fantastic time would go back tmrw. you can also get a train out to Euro Disney for the day very worthwhile if you have children they'll love it, but take a picnic food in the park not upto much."
10,“Never going there again !!!!”,"I last went to Paris 9 years ago. I musy have forgotten how expensive it was. The staff at the cafes/brasseries are rude and arrogant, shop staff in retail outlets were un helpful and rude and everything was so overpriced.I live in London which an expensive city in itself (so i thought!). Even to stop off at a little cafe for a expresso is 6€, which is nearly £5..We arrived in Paris via Eurostar on Friday June 15th 2007, after a comfortable journey we walked through the station to the exit. We had the address of the hotel but were not sure if we could walk or needed to get a taxi (On the brochure it says it is very close).Having asked numerous french people where the hotel was, I was amazed that know one had ever heard of The Waldorf Trocadero!! Eventually we jumped in a taxi, I tried to have a conversation with the driver, just pleasantries, but he was'nt have in none of this, how rude!!!!!!!We arrive at the hotel, eventually.. He charged me 14.50€ for a 7-8 minute trip.Our room wasnt ready as we arrived at 1pm, so we lef tour luggage and headed off out for some lunch. We stopped off at a little cafe/brassiere, nothing fancy just a normal french cafe. My girlfriend ordered a sandwich, I ordered some pasta, 1 glass of wine and 1 orange juice, that was it.. When we finished the bill arrived, 63.40€, just for a light bite. This was the same all over Paris, I cant believe how expensive it was. I did'nt come to Paris to eat Baguettes all day, I wanted to experience French Cuisine, but unless you are one of the lucky super earners dont go there.Even clothing, when you converted the euro back to the pound everything was around 15-20% more in Paris than the UK.The Taxis are the biggest rip-offs. We asked our hotel to order us a taxi one evening, which they did. The taxi arrived, we got in, as he was just pulling away I noticed that the tariff was already on 8.5€, as I dont know if this was the norm I never said anything. When I got back to my hotel I told them about this and they said that was not right and he shoud not have charged us over 15€ for a 5 minute ride. They told me they would speak to the Taxi company and find out why. The next day I went to reception who told me they spoke to the taxi company and even the receptionist was shocked by what he said, apparently the second you call and order a taxi they start there meter running, even if it takes them 10 minutes to arrive you have to pay for this, thats an absolute utter joke!! I have never heard of this before. I have used Taxis in London, New York and other European destinations, I have never heard of this.The highlight of the trip was a cruise on the river Seine with dinner. I pre-booked this in the UK before I left through Cometoparis.com. The whole evening was exquisite, the food was great the service was superb, could not fault this one bit, shame the rest of paris and its hospitality staff are nothing like this..I will never go to Paris again, its over priced the people are rude and arrogant (apologies to the few that dont fit into this catagory). I really dont have anything nice to say about Paris.. Except that I am only talking about Paris not the rest of France.I have been to some lovely places in France and have also worked there. It is only the Pariseans that have earned themselves a reputation for their rudeness.Paris..... Never again...."
50,"“Paris in a nutshell;doing,seeing,eating,staying..enjoy!”","I was in Paris with my mother for about 4 days in May 2007. We had the most incredible time and did so many things!! Here are a few highlights and suggestions from our trip....TO STAY: We stayed in the area where the Opera is, it is quite central, but at the same time, we thought that staying in the St. Germain area might have been better. In the St. Germain, it is much hipper and there are amazing restaurants boutiques and bars to go to at night that are fun and lively. In the Opera, however, there seemed to be no buzz at night, and very touristy restaurants...However, there are amazing shops around the Opera, and we did not even get a chance to visit them-although we DID manage to go to Galarie Lafayette, an AMAZING and HUGE department store!! (the Opera area is also near a very famous street, Rue St Honore where, if I recall correctly, the Chanel flagship store is located, as well as many other amazing shops!!!)TO EAT: falling into Brasseries and Bistros is probably your best bet in Paris, and grabbing a coffee and perhaps a yogurt was always substantial for us for breakfast. Sometimes people may recommend a restaurant to you, as was the case with us, but the hype may be just that,hype; the best restaurants we found just seemed to be busy-looking brasseries and bistros that were not overly expensive and seemed to have nice looking food (going by what we saw the patrons eating). I honestly do not really know the names of those restaurants, but anywhere in St.Germain seems to be good to eat at, and around the Marais are some lovely cafes and brasseries too!! While in Paris, however, you MUST and I say MUST go to Laduree for tea! We went to the one on the Champs Elysees and I believe there may be one in St Germain too-but make sure you eat there macaron cookies-you might think you have died and gone to heaven. Even if you just get a box of 8 for take-away and opt out of the tea (although it is a stunning little restaurant/tea house) make sure you try it. Another MUST is a crepe, of course, mine was choc.hazelnut and was absolutely incredible...also Berthillon ice cream is essential, and in a very cute and quiet part of the city, apparently Johnny Depp lives near there too..hahaha...DO: FAT TIRE BIKE TOURS!!!!!!!!!!!! This American company knows how to show you Paris properly. The day tour is a fabulous bike ride around the city with a stop in the Tuileries area at a cafe and a tour leader who stops and talks about the different historical and cultural sights on the way. It is a great way to meet other travellers and to see Paris in the gorgeous sunshine, with some light exercise. If you want to tour Paris, this is the ONLY way it should be done!!! The night ride was incredible too!! We got a boat ride and wine included in the 24 euro price!!! just amazing!! and a stop at the ice cream shop was also a plus- on this tour you get to see the Notre Dame from outside as well as spot where Princess Di was killed, and we biked through the Louvre at night too....WOW!!!!!On Sunday, head to the Marais if you want to see the Jewish quarter. It's near the Place de Voges, which is very nice to see, and is supposedly the oldest building in Paris-but Marais is so lively on Sunday;unfortunately it was so rainy and cold when we were there, but I still managed to walk around and see the amazing shops and I managed to have a piece of cheesecake in an incredible Jewish bakery/deli - Sacha finkelsztajn, it's called, BIG yellow sign-GO THERE for cheesecake TRUST me!!MUSEUMS: The Louvre is a MUST but DO NOT spend ages there!!! See the things that are essential (eg: Mona Lisa, Samothrace, Venus De Milo, the Crowing of Josephine, Madonna of the Rocks etc....) and don't waste too much time with some of the other things...the room with the coronation crown is very cool,though, and I hear that Napoleon's apartments are amazing, but we did not have that much time because we jetted off to.........the Musee D'Orsay!!!!!!!!!!! Most fantastic museum, the 5th floor is amazing with a lot of Degas, Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, etc... but the ground floor was also amazing and included some gorgeous sculptures too. As well, the actual building itself is gorgeous, as it used to be an old railway station.Paris is a lovely place, but the people can be snooty and rude, as the stereotype goes-no offense to those frenchies out there- but some people are quite charming, just be friendly and don't assume everyone knows English. getting by with a few words in French can be helpful..although understanding is a whole 'nother story!!! Remember though, you are in THEIR territory, so if all else fails, do as the French do and forget you are a tourist, mozy about and fall into places that look cool-follow the locals, too!!"
50,“Central Paris - What a lovely city !”,"We recently stayed in Paris for a long weekend as a treat for my wife on her birthday.We travelled on the Eurostar from Ashford international and arrived into Gard de Nord only 2 hours later.We had booked the Holiday Inn in the Bastille area which was ok if not a bit basic.All the staff were extremly friendly with the room and public areas all very clean.We booked the Le Open Tour bus on a two day pass which we felt was very good and tried to get round all four routes but run out of time.The main event is the Green tour which takes in the main sights although the rest were all informative and pretty.Our tip would be to get to the Eiffel either very early or after 5pm as we waited for 2 1/2 hours to get up the tower, worth every minute.Try to get on the Seinne as the hop on & off cruise is another good way to see the city and takes in all the main sites.The other main event for us is the arc de triomphe which has approx 280 steps but the view is excellent and the traffic very scary.On the last night we did the moulin rouge which was great and you wont mind the entrance fee, just enjoy it.Kevin & Olivia 03/06/07"
50,“Romance in Paris”,"Spring time in Paris is the definition of romance. The massive architecture with detailed opulence, wrought iron balconies with overflowing blooming flower baskets, two person elevators, cobblestone streets, outdoor dining, crowded sidewalks at midnight on a Monday, fashion, shopping, perfume, pastries, and unbelievably fresh flavors.We did the must see tourist sites – Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Rodin Museum, Orsay Museum, Notre Dame, Versailles, Seine River Cruise, Pere Lachaise Cemetery (Jim Morrison from the Doors is buried here), Sacre Coeur, Jardin du Luxembourg, and St. Germain quarter shopping. Gentleman, check out Ttraxx clothing [--] for inexpensive shopping. My husband got an entire outfit for $20 US, a rarity in Paris.The Metro is easy to use. In 10 days, we never got lost. I recommend purchasing a Metro Pass or a carnet (10 tickets). Be sure to take a walking map or pick one up at a tourism office. Purchasing a Paris Museum Pass in advance helps you save money and time. You get to avoid long lines and walk right in. The Louvre was humongous. The only disappointment was that you couldn't take photos of the Mona Lisa. It's roped off with hundreds of people surrounding it. Mona has her own wall with bullet proof glass surrounding it and several guards to watch for eager tourists with cameras. The Arc de Triomphe was larger than I'd expected. We were actually witness to some crazy tourists trying to cross the street rather than take the underground passage to reach the arch. The circle surrounding the arch has traffic from 9 streets converging. It's insane! There was a 2 hour wait at the Eiffel Tower on a Thursday night at 11:00pm. The wait was worth it. The view is spectacular! The Rodin Museum has my favorite sculpture, The Kiss. I couldn't believe it's life sized. Rodin's works of art are displayed in an open rose garden. A mansion houses many other works. The Orsay has displays by my favorite impressionists. The feeling of seeing an original painting, the actual brushstrokes, by an artist that you've studied for many years is unforgettable. It was a rainy day when we visited the palace of Versailles and the front façade was under construction. We still got to see Marie Antoinette's bedroom and the very door that she used to escaped from the mob. The palace and gardens are magnificent. Wander along the windy, cobblestone streets of Pere Lachaise Cemetery until you come to the grave of Jim Morrison. He has a rather simple resting place in comparison to the thousands of others in the over 100 acre cemetery.If you're looking for a place to stay, [--] They have great deals and the apartments are just as pictured. The accomodations are clean and well kept.Do NOT use the Paris Blue Airport Shuttle service (advertised for 14.9 EUR per person). They showed up 1-1/2 hours late to pick us up from the airport. Then, the driver didn't know where our address was. He got lost and we had to call the apartment owner to give him directions. That still didn't work. The apartment owner had to come meet us and lead us to the location. The location was right off the Champs Elysees, a frequently trafficed area for tourists, so I don't understand why he had such a difficult time. Most drivers have a GPS system, but Paris Blue Airport Shuttle obviously doesn't. Also, the driver doesn't help you with your bags or turn on the AC. It was 85 degrees and we were sweating, fanning ourselves with paper. It's advertised the vans have AC. And the driver will stand with his hand out waiting for a tip. Needless to say, he didn't get one. You could use the silver van service from Pairs Aiport Shuttle for the same price. Two of their drivers showed up during the time we were waiting for our shuttle.Be sure to bring a comfortable pair of shoes. On average, we walked about 5 hours at a hefty pace daily (not including the leisurely strolls through exhibits). If you don't want to look like a tourist, don't wear tennis shoes. A nice pair of leather loafers will work. Don't believe that only tourists wear jeans - the French do too. Just make sure your denim is dark, not stone washed.Recommended restaurants:Amorino – It's located near the Pantheon and has the BEST amoretto gelato (even better than in Italy). $3-5 EURLa Carree Elysees – It's a small café on Ave. Franklin Roosevelt off of Champs Elysees. Order the croque monsieur (melted ham & cheese sandwich that comes with a small salad) or the boeuf bourgengon (beef burgundy with steamed potatoes) = $12.5 EUR with a glass of Beaujolais = $4 EUR.Hippopotamus – Several locations, but we dined at 6 Ave. Franklin Roosevelt. Try the crème brulee – very large portion and the lightest I've ever tasted. Fixed price multi course menus available for $14.5 – 29.5EUR. Try the Cote du Rhone for $2.5EUR a glass. The sushi, French onion soup, riz au lait (the creamiest rice pudding with caramel sauce), and chocolate molten lava cake are wonderful. They have quick and friendly English speaking staff and a non-smoking section, a rarity in Paris.Pomme de Pain – Inexpensive sandwich shops throughout Paris. You can get a quick bite with dessert and drink for $7.2EUR. An even better alternative is in Versailles. Check out the sandwich shop near McDonald's.Paul – A bakery with several locations around Paris. Try the tartelette citron, escargot (raisin and cinnamon swirl pastry), baguette, or croissants.If you're traveling with a picky eater or you don't like French cuisine, there are Mc Donald's, Quick Burgers and Starbucks nearby. On almost every menu, you can get a burger, steak with fries, or a ham and cheese sandwich. There are also several American restaurants or English Pubs in the city - Planet Hollywood, American Cafe, American Diner. You could also check out the multitude of Asian and Italian dining."
50,“Paris is perfect!”,"I have been to Paris more times than I can count and yet have never not felt regret upon leaving my favorite city in the world. Paris hasmore to offer in the way of natural and manmade beauty than any other city.I no longer feel the need to stay in the tourist dense center of Paris. Now my goal on each trip is to explore an unknown neighborhood, to immerse myself in the unique culture of each arrondissement and to familiarize myself with the charm of the off the beaten track areas.While following a walking tour of the Canal St. Martin area, which is no longer all that unknown to tourists, I meandered up to the Parcdes Buttes Chaumonts. What a glorious hike! The hills were challenging to this middle aged school teacher, but the views of the city and the incredible beauty of the gardens there were well worth the effort.The highpoint came as I was sitting on a bench, enjoying the sights and sounds of Paris, when I turned to see a pair of peacocks strolling freely through the gardens. It was truly a magical moment that could only happen in Paris."
50,“February In Paris”,"Wow! Talk about a real city! I thoroughly enjoyed my five days in Paris. If you're going to go, plan as many days as you can, but if you even have just five days to spare, do it!You must get the subway pass. It's the best way to get around the city. The first day we did not have a subway pass. We took the RER from the airport and hopped onto a few subways and arrived near our hotel. We probably walked about 20 miles that day trying to see as much as we could. Wear comfy shoes. Everyone in Paris is GQ. I mean, talk about a really elegant city. It was cold and everyone had on long sleek coats. There are so many restaurants and they are open late. You have to get adjusted to the times business are open. The bar scene was very fun! Some of them open all night through the morning. Try the French beer. Not too bad.We tried a plate of frommage (cheese)....and I guess it's an aquired taste. It reeks of sweaty, dirty socks...and well, some of the cheese tasted just as it smelled. It was worth the experience though...we laughed a lot.The pastries are to die for. So beautiful! You will find cheaper pastries and crepes on the outskirts of town. You can find good deals for clothes and other items. I suggest you get one of those Frommer's books and bring it. Read it on the plane.I could keep writing about my awesome experience...but I'll spare you. The French were not as rude as everyone thinks. They were quite friendly. I dunno if you should get the museum pass unless that's your thing. We went to the Lourve and it was so huge! We did about 1/8 of it in 6 hours and decided that was enough.To sum everything up, go with an open mind. Know how to say ""can you speak English"" in French, that's how we got around. And use the subways.PS- Pigalle is the red light district. Our hotel was there. We didn't know this when we booked. But it was very safe even in the middle of the night."
40,“Parisians are Lovely & Friendly People!!”,"My husband and I spent 2 weeks in Paris (my first visit ever) in Sept 06. Many people have commented or questioned the frendliness (or lack thereof) of the Parisians. I wanted to write and share some of our experiences in meeting many, many wonderful, open, and delightful people in Paris. (As a point of reference, my husband & I are in our early 50's and rather casual people, but not overly outgoing)..Let me describe some of the wonderful people we met:Out of all the waiters we had, there were probably only 1 or 2 that were a bit cool (but not rude really). The others were all delightful, personable, & engaging even. One waiter started as a bit reserved, but then became much more animated and talkative (with a mix of my 2-yr French from ages ago & his English), giving advice & telling us to be careful of the skaters who zipped by cafe tables snatching up bags, cameras, etc., and kept a conversation going for several minutes. Another young man was so polite and charming---a lovely, shy smile with just a few teasing remarks about my French. One waiter even gave us a free cognac after a very late, lovely delicious dinner and came over to talk with us after the other clients left. There was the delightful elderly gentleman & his mother who owned a little grocery/fruit shop near our hotel who chatted with us, laughing & teasing about my husband being ""Fred Astaire"". And the beautiful young girl of 18 or so who guided my husband and I around the train station at Auvers Sur Oise, trying to help us get going back in the right direction to Paris (It took two train changes to do it, but finally we did-----with even more help from other locals on train. Another time while walking along a neighborhood street, I swung out my arm in a quick gesture---and smacked a young man across the nose!! I was horrifed and made a quick attempt at an apology in my best (?? ) French---he was so gracious with a ""de rien..ne pas"" (or something to that effect) and made absolutely no ugly comment or reaction!!! Oh, and the young guy at the bookstands along the Seine who walked us toward the bridge we needed...and drew me a quick map on a scrap of paper! Lastly, the lovely, lovely French couple, Bernard & Monique, who sat at a table next to us for dinner and shared a delightful conversation for an hour or so in mixed French & English. There are even more people I could mention, but for space. All of these people and memories were so delightful and I will cherish them always. I do believe the key is in using a bit of French language. That effort goes a long, long way in opening the door to people, and I encourage everyone travelling to try and speak the native language when in someone's country. You'll be much more likely to have ""friendly"" experiences if you do."
50,“Romance en Paris”,"Spent a magic week in Paris before Christmas. We had spent a lot of time on Trip Advisor and the advice was invaluable so many thanks. Here are the highlights.Travel: We flew with easyjet to Charles de Gaulle then got the train in to Chatelet. We landed at terminal 3 and just walked to the train which was well signposted, all the trains seemed to go to Paris but some are express straight to Gard du Nord so it can be worth waiting for them. We had no problems or queues with the ticket machines, use the roller like a mouse, they take credit cards. Once in Paris, we bought a carnet (10 metro tickets) from a machine and just used it to hop on and off the metro when we got tired.Accommodation: We booked an apartment from Habitat Investissement through the parisattitude website. Can't recommend it highly enough. An apartment gives you much more flexibility than a hotel, its cheaper and it means you don't have to spend so much money eating out all the time - we saved a fortune by having large long lunches out and then just bread and cheese in the apartment in the evening. The apartments are small but clean and comfortable and you feel much more a part of Paris life living amongst locals. With bakeries, bars and supermarkets next door the location was superb, next to the Pompidou centre.Highlights - 1. The pont neuf at night with the lights and boats on the river 2. The ice skating rink outside the hotel de ville. 3. Musee carnavalet which is more intimate and less crowded but gives a great feel for Paris history. 4. Places des Vosges (but don't eat there - snotty waiters and overpriced food). 5. Dalloyau for sensational cakes and macaroons 6. St Germain for window shopping 7. Jardin du Luxembourg for a stroll and to watch boules 8. Charles Chocolatier for amazing vegan chocolates 9. Notre Dame on a weekday morning - take the time to have a good look at the stone work on the facade. 10. Food shopping around Place de Madeleine - Fauchon and Laduree. 11. The best Italian food in a place at the very end of Boulevard St Germain near the bridge to Ile St Louis (opposite a steakhouse and next to a moped shop). 12. Ice cream in Berthillon on Ile S Louis. 13. People watching over a pitcher of house wine in any of the thousands of small cafe's. 14. A proposal from the man I love outside St. Eustache.Lowlights - The metro at rush hour, the crowds in the Louvre (again a weekday morning is best).Best advice - 1. Make some kind of attempt at speaking french, even if its awful you will get a much better reception. 2. Go during the week when everything is less crowded and flights and accommodation are cheaper. 3. For food and drink go at least a few streets away from the main tourist attractions to get better and cheaper. Food in small cafe's is often as good as the bigger restaurants. 4. Bring good walking boots. 5. Use the advice on the Trip Advisor Forums - I found it invaluable."
50,“Paris at New Years”,"Last year I stayed in for new year's and was thoroughly miserable, and so my friends and I made a pact to do something interesting and fun this year. As London is far too overpriced and nothing usually happens (even if we had known about the fire would probably not have made the effort, given the state of the weather. So we decided (eventually) to go to Paris. We went there by eurostar (so much easier than flying).When we arrived in Paris, everyone had the same idea as us and there was a 3 hour queue for taxi. The queue for the Metro tickets was about half an hour so we did that.Our Hotel was Les Grand Hotel Gobelins in the south of Paris. Its near two metro stations, and its pretty accessible- even with the reduced metro service on New Years Eve.After we arrived in Paris we went straight to the Louvre, as it was the only day it was open. It is massive and I wish that I had got one of the headphone ear guides- but after we had queued to see the Mona Lisa (looks huge but actually it goes quite quick)and located the Venus de Milo (definatley a man). It then took us the best part of an hour to folow the signs to the exit! That night we had dinner in the bastille and drinks around there (lots of seedy little clubs and stuff if that is your thing)New Years eve- we got off at Concorde and for some strange reason we decided to walk the full length of the Champs Eelyses (?) to the Arc de Triomphe. This is the best view in Paris by miles- cost 5€ if you are under 26, and even though there are quite a few steps it is well worth it. Our stupidity then made us walk to the Eiffel Tower (idiots) which had ridiculous queues and it was too windy to go up the top.In the evening we stood on a bridge and called in the new year. Was very disappointed that there were no fire works but really enjoyed ourselves. Then we went to Queen Nightclub (got tickets earlier in the day)- fantastic atmosphere lots of dancing- didn't need to drink I was having so much fun.New Years Day- Got up at about 1 in the afternoon (8 hours sleep of course) and was starving. As all the resteraunts were shut near us we went to the bastille- and had a lovely (if not crowded) lunch and headed off to the Eiffel Tower (this time on the train) which was still shut due to the high winds. Instead we boarded the 6 o clock Bateaux Parisiens (10€) and sat in the back- was very interesting but VERY VERY cold enjoyed it tho. For dinner we then went to the Latin Quarter. It was amazing all the tiny streets, stuffed with shops and different lights- had a lovely dinner and then headed off too bed.Our train was at 4 the next day so we went to the Galeries LaFayette (unbelivebly busy) and then went home.I really enjoyed myself- I think it would have been nice to have just one more day but it is alot more relaxed and less manic than London. It was very helpful haveing someone in our party who was fluent in french- but everone speaks pretty good english and are quite helpful."
50,“Romance and History”,"All I have to say is that when I first went to Paris (summer of 2003), I thought that it would be overrated. With so much publicity and exposure throughout the world, I believed that it would fall short of my expectations.WRONG!!! I loved the architecture, historical sites, museums and the world famous sights.I fell in love with what the city had to offer. It overwhelmed me and I decided that I would go back at some point in the future.Well I did go back in July of 2005 and proposed to my girlfriend on top of the most famous tower in Paris, maybe even the world, The Eiffel Tower.I plan to go again."
50,“Children in Paris”,"1.Many parks have adventure playgrounds eg the Tuilleries. The Les Halles area also has an area for slightly older children .2.The adventure playground in the Jardin du Luxembourg is extensive, although there is a payment for entry (2.5 euros for children and 1.5 for adults).3.The Parc du Berry apparently has some interesting activities.4.On the weekends, there are some big parks outside the city centre, which are apparently well worth a visit. Your guidebooks should tell you about that.5.There is a Museum of Magic at 11 Rue St Paul near metro St Paul. Admission includes a relatively short but very entertaining magic show.6.You can see a more substantial magic show at Double Fond at 1 Place du Marche St Catherine (to the east of metro St Paul going along Rue St Antoine, take the first left after Rue de Sevigne and you will come to the Place du Marches St Catherine). It is a father-daughter show in a very small area (about 40 people) in part of a café complex. It is heavily booked so you will need to book in advance (tel. 42.71.40.20). Performances for children are at Wednesday 4.30 pm and Saturday 2.30pm and 4.30pm and Sunday 4.30pm (cost 9 euros) – recommended for ages 5-12.7.And of course for both children and adults, you can’t miss Glace Berthilon ice-creams at 31 rue St Louis on the Ile de la Cite. I had the orange chocolate which was simply stunning."
40,“Paris in 3 days”,"We had a wonderful paris vacation this labour day weekend.We reached paris around 9:00 Am .Charles De Gaulle isundergoing construction and visitors should expect delaystransferring from airplane to terminals. It was a 30 minutebus ride for us and some passengers who had connectinngflights were nervous.We had read about the Air France Bus service into the city andtook bus number 6 to reach our hotel in the the Arc De Triomphearea.We had a mertro visite pass which made travel easy.We took tours offerred by something Rama to visit vineyards in the champagne region, dine at the Eiffel tower and take inMoullen Rouge show.Since we were pressed for time we skipped the Louvre and museum circuit on this trip.We had budgeted a good amount for meals and that washelpful as none of our meals cost less than 50 Euro (for two of us). Even the McDonalds meal cost 20Euro which in USwould go for 10 Dollars.The other thing we enjoyed was visiting the La Defense area-the new modern part of Paris. WIth its Arc and all the glassand steel towers. It is a convenient stop on the metro.We strolled along the Luxemburg gardens and the quaintstreets with small shops in that area, stopping for a cup ofgelato here ,a cappucino there.The trip to the vineyards is a day trip to Reims and Epernay.In Reims besides the Piper Hiedsik wine tour ,we alsostopped to see the cathedral. We ate lunch in the smalltown of Reims with numerous shops and cafes.Then on to see the vineyards in Epernay and tour Moet-Chandonwine cellars.We were back in Paris by 5:00 Pm.The rest of that evening we went up the 300+ steps at Arch DeTriomphe to watch the paris skyline at dusk.That was our last night in Paris and it would not be completewithout a dinner on the Champs Elysses.The restaurantwas ,I guess catering mostly o the touristy crowd andI could not be wowed by the food even though we ended upspending north of 70 Euro . (Which is on the moderate side inFrance, A three course dinner in a good restaurant will run north of 100Euro per person)Next time I would like to spend some time in the Louvre,but before that I will pick up a good book on the Louvrein Barnes and Noble and decide what painting /exhibits I want tovisit, because the Louvre can be very overwhelming without a plan of visitation -as has been noted by many a friends who havevisited.In all I most enjoyed the trip and my tip for first timevisitors -Learn a little french -Not everyone there will understandEnglish or be willing to talk."
50,“On a busy weekend....”,"If you hit the Louvre or the Musee D'Orsay on a busy weekend and the lineup is too long, skip it and head to the Rodin Museum.This museum is in an elegant chateau with beautiful gardens, equisitely appointed rooms and is not overly large which will allow you more time at a cafe. It really should not be missed during a visit to Paris.Another museum worth a visit is the Musee Carnavalet. There are a lot of historical artifacts beyond paintings, such as costume, boudoirs done up in period style, and other home artifacts of the petit bourgeois. I believe it is open when the large museums are closed.Enjoy!"
50,“Day Trip to Paris in October”,"We decided to go and see Paris for a Family trip together before our 14 year old wants to do his own thing, so we got up at the unearthy (to me) hour of 4 am and after a Tube journey to Waterloo, arrived to take the Eurostar to Paris.The train was Ok (as it should be for £160) as we had a small carriage to ourselves with only 6 other people which was very restful at 6. 30 in the morning, we had a very smooth journey down and after a short delay, entered the tunnel.The tunnel is not very scary, it is just like going through any other tunnel except there is a slight petrol smell, you completely forget about all the water above you, there is a small buffet car which sells Croissants, pain de Chocolat, sandwiches and even a full english if you are a fan of eat out of a polystyrene tray cuisine, not too pricey either.We arrived in Paris around 11 am and made straight for the Metro, The windows are open to the tunnel at the top to let fresh air in which was lovely with all the people crowded in!, I cant say it was any cleaner than the London one, but it was quicker, 4 minutes wait at Gare Du Nord at 11.10 am on a Saturday morning and our son even got a seat! enough said.the journey down to Cite only took 15 minutes for 8 stops and as we had bought the Paris Visite tickets beforehand and had sailed straight on without having to wait to buy tickets, we were in Notre-Dame Cathedral by 11.45 am, ( a word here about Sainte-Chappell, if you wish to see this place as we did, get there early, we were there at 11.30 am and there were 50 people in front of us), Notre-Dame Cathedral is incredable! the carvings on the outside are so intricate, but the inside is even better, as a service was going on, we had to walk down the side aisles but the stained glass took our breath away, the side chapels dedicated to various Saints with the votive candles illuminating the glass above was really beautiful, even if you are not a fan of churches, see this one purely for its beauty, and of course the Rose Window.The streets around Notre-Dame are wonderful for souvenir hunting, if, like me, you want something more than a plastic Eiffel Tower, this place is the best, the hand drawn pictures and paintings of Paris are lovely and very cheap, also the other souvenirs are pretty good too, we got 2 sketches of Paris for 3 Euros (£1.50p), and a mirror Compact with Parisian scenes on it for my mum and that was 7 Euros (about £5), they also had the pancake and Crepe maker on the corner, our son immedialtely decided it was lunchtime and had a 12 inch pancake made for him with sugar (although they do other fillings too) for 2 Euros (55p).From the Cathedral, walk back across to the other Bank via a bridge, any bridge, it doesn't matter, that is the nice thing about Central Paris, you can cross over, wander about the back streets seeing the real Paris, then just head back down to the Seine and walk along it, stop and see the booksellers and map sellers on the Prominade, you can see the Conseirgerie and many other buildings across the river, including the Eiffel tower in the distance, just follow the Seine down and you will come to the Louvre, I could spend all day describing this place, so I will keep it short, be prepared for the crowds in front, make sure you stand in front of the Arch opposite as it gives a view to Place de la Concorde, down the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe!, there is a coat and bag search inside the Pyramid entrance, so if you dont take a bag or coat you can be fast tracked through, make sure you buy a guide book in the Reception before you start exploring, it is such a huge place with so much to see you need to plan to see just a few things and where they are, otherwise you will be like us, scampering around for 3 hours trying to find things, but we did see the Mesopotamian section, (the winged bull is 14 feet high), the Egyptian section which I would say is slightly better than the British Museum, we also saw the Victory of Samothrace, which is conveniently situated at the top of the stairs with a gallery leading either side, one to the Mona Lisa and the other to the Venus de Milo, (one thing, the Picture Galleries are non flash photography and the Mona Lisa is no photography at all, you have to queue up 10 at a time to see her), the Paintings there are wonderful, all the big names and try to see the Coronation of Napoleon, it is a huge painting but very realistic, the colours are magnificent, then on to the Napoleon III apartments, I wont spoil it by describing them but they are breath-taking, all gilt and Brocade and crystal Chandaliers, it really shouldn't work but it does, absolutely georgeous!If you have time, walk from here to the Eiffel Tower, it sounds a long way but it is only around 20 minutes, through the Tulleries gardens to the Concorde, turn left and walk down over the Seine, crossing over the road and walk down admiring the buildings and statues along the Right Bank, you need a good map, the best map we had was the one which came with the Museum and Monument passes (very good for queue-jumping!), it had every road named however small, with all the major sites listed where they were, so it was easy to follow and you see a lot of the Paris away from the Pomp of the Centre.The Eiffel Tower is huge, we did not have time to climb due to the crowds of people waiting (another tip, get there really early or allow AT LEAST 1 hour for queueing), but got some great pics.Although we had the Metro pass, we actually walked for most of the day, not through necessity but because everything was so easy to get to and so close together, in fact we used the Metro to get to Cite at the start, then a bus from Avenue Rapp to Madeleine, then walked up Rue Lafayettte, past the Galleries Lafayette and the Opera, up the streets you never normally see, and it only took us 30 minutes to get to the Gare Du Nord, it is very clean (no dog poop in sight) and we felt very safe at all times.We had thought the weather might play up being October, but in fact it was 23 degrees!All in all a brilliant day out, and next October we are going back for a weekend to see the bits we didn't have time for, cant wait!"
50,“How to plan well the first visit”,"Hi,I recently went to Paris and completly fell in love with it. The more you walk the more you discover amazing places. My favorite is not the Eiffel Tower (although it was very impressive) but would say the Orsay Museum. The Van Gogh collection is really stunning.I aslo like take taking a Fly Boat at night with my wife. It was really romantic. Overall my week was amazing. One site that really helped me is a small site I found while doing my researches that you might want to check out:[---]. It gives tips and tricks about each monument. It was really useful.Anyway, can't wai to go back."
30,“Bit rubbish”,"We went to Paris for 3nights in Jan 05, We stayed at the Relais De Paris Eiffel Grenaille.The hotel was nice enough shame about the view as we could have got a room on the opposite side of the hotel and got tower views.We did the Eiffel tower which was great and on our last night we did a river/dinner cruise which was really nice food and a wonderful view.Other than that we did shopping and a bit of sightseeing, but Paris is expensive, dirty and the people are rude, so i wouldnt go back not when youve got Prague to contend with."
40,“Wonerful city”,"Recently returned from a weeknd in Paris. Fantastic city, had heard there was a sewer smell around the city however this was not true. We brought a all day underground ticket and got full use of it, even travelled to Euroland disney for one day useing it. Only had to pay for park entrance. Walking around the city at night was beautiful as all the tower lit up. Wasnt like any other city i had been too. ANy questions just ask?"
30,"“People great, food OK”","The people in Paris were very helpful and we had no problem using english (we are from the US). The food was our greatest disappointment. We found a few meals that were good, but not up to our New York expectations. With the US dollar weak and the prices on the menus include tax (19.6% VAT) and 15% service charge (tip)The museum pass is not worth while, you could not do more than one of the main museums in a day. The Metro pass is not needed, but a 10 pass."
50,“One of the most beautiful Cities in the world..........”,"I had been to Paris a month back and it indeed is a fantastic city and a must-go for every European tourist.Before travelling ,i had gone through the reviews on this same site and was cautious enough to avoid untoward incidents but fortunately i did not have any such experiences.The people were helpful and the city was really beautiful.But as suggested be careful with your belongings when about to board the lift for the Eiffel tower.Be it the Eiffel or the Louvre or the Notradamme or the boat cruise we enjoyed every moment of it.Shopping near Notredamme is expensive,but otherwise things are really fine.One of the cheapest modes of transport is either the boat cruise/the trams/the L'Open tour buses.I must say that this site has helped me gain a lot of info before travelling to any place for that matter.....Have a nice trip........But be cautious :-)Abhay"
50,“Paris is forever”,"Dont forget to go to La Fayette in Paris, it is THE department store that sells almost everything. I just love Paris and will be going there for the third time next week. Its a long trip from South Africa, but oh what an experience. The Le Car Rouge is an excellent way to get around at a really affordable price. You get a two day pass, and can travel the round route as many times as you like, hopping on and off at your leisure at any stop. I am trying to learn to speak French, but it really is a difficult language to learn. Well worth the effort though. I LOVE Paris!!!"
50,“Paris in August”,"We just returned from Paris and a great time-despite security at the airport-cdg. For your info- Americans, Italians, Japanese,and British all had the same attitude toward clothing and shoes --1/2 wore blue jeans and tennis shoes, some shorts. You do not need to know much french other than polite conversation. However i would strongly encourgage you to learn the 1-2 pages of french words in the guide books for reading the menus- that's where it really countsAll the french people were friendly, and many spoke some english. The waiters were very hard working - fast and prompt- but they will not hover over you. Probably do not try to order in french but point to the menu and pronounce a key word. they do make errors. It rained every other day- but it is a different type of rain- 1/2 hr of gentle to downpours and the rest of the day, either sunny or cloudyThe metro was great and very fast, easy to use- just follow the signs. Let me warn you though- those darn tickets would not work 5% of the time and they were new ones. so make sure you get extra ones in case.our hotel -HOTEL de Fleurie was a gem- very quiet then, airconditioning ,very helpful people who were fluent in english. Itnot smell of smoke. The only problem is the street is really an alley, but on the same side metro odeon, the next block west -look for the cinema and then the bicycle shop in the street.Our family of 4 took the 2 adjouning rooms and worked out greatMany charming neighborhood restaurants, boulangerie and wonderful bakeries. By the way, service charge is built in the prices of food- all restaurants have the tip built in. Do not make the mistake i did they make their number one like ^ - and their seven has a cross bar I made one waiter especially happy.Go the major sites 1/2 hr before they open- or unless you prefer the normal waiting lines of 1-2 hr minimum.. The Lourve is espcially great if you go the eve hrs. But we were surprised when they would not allow you to take the normal underground passage to the metro and made you go outside 9p m to find the metro in the dark -so ask information how you get the outside metro before you leave the Lourve.One word about those ethnic pickpockets. They are very slick , separate you from your companion when you are on the metro, when you have to stand and hold onto the pole and keep bumping into you. It happened to us even though we were vigilant , on the way to Sacre Coeur. By the way we got her purse and camera back- the exception rather than the rule.Lastlly we got to the airport, cdg 7am before our flight 3 1/2 hr later. The security was so layered that it was barely enough timeThis was also the time when few people were there. The plane was one hr late due to security and we missed our connecting flight , Sooooo. make it 4 hr and change your connecting flight ?"
50,“Overall review of a first visit to Paris”,"Just returned from a trip to Paris, four days only when the travel days are considered. Also a last minute excursion to Ashford Kent via the Eurostar, travel to Ashord Kent early morning one day and return early evening to Paris the next. Accomodations at the Mercure Paris Bercy were more than satisfactory. Comfortable, clean room with buffet breakfast provided daily, which offered everything you would expect in a complete buffet. Quiet hotel with excellent service from staff and only a five minute walk to the Bercy metro station. All staff spoke excellent English and were happy to provide assistance. On the Thursday evening of our stay the hotel offered wine and appetizers to all hotel guests, a great opportunity to chat with fellow travellers. We would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again. A few tips to first time travellers to Paris, as we were. The trip advisor really helped. We took some of the suggestions which paid off, especially purchasing the Museum Pass. The ability to skip the line-up at the Musee D'Orsay was worth the price of the pass alone. There had to be hundreds waiting to buy tickets to enter, before 9 a.m., and we walked right on by, and went in immediately via the entry for pass holders. One thing to note, FNAC offices no longer sell museum passes contrary to information on their web sites. The best place to pick one up is at a museum sometime before you actually activiate the pass, by writing the first day you plan to use it. We got ours at a less popular museum where no one was waiting to get in, so it was a very quick transaction. It is important when planning to note that some museums are not included in the pass and that some are closed on certain days. Also another great tip we obtained from trip advisor was to purchase the Carte Orange. This is a two part plastic folder that on one side has your identification with picture and on the other side your metro ticket that you feed into the turnstiles and retrieve before advancing to the metro or RER. We arrived with one inch by one inch color photos, which are required for the metro pass. Although there are photo machines everywhere at the station, it simplified and expedited the process. We found the metro confusing at first, but quickly mastered it. We followed tips posted on trip advisor regarding safety precautions and had absolutely no problems. We had money and credit cards in waistline money belts placed under our clothes. We had our passports in the hotel room safe with copies in our money belts. Trip pre-planning is the key to a stress free trip. We made a plan that ensured we got to visit all the sites we wanted to see in the time we had alotted. We purchased a plasticized Let's Go Paris map before departing, but great maps were also provided complimentary by the hotel. Some locals were very helpful, and offered assistance when they saw us looking at maps. Be sure to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes. A Paris city map and metro map are a must. We were able to see Paris in a fast paced four days, however it would have been nice to have had more time."
50,“Paris - with children”,"I want to share my experiences with all other parents who are planing to travel to Paris with children. I just returned from a 8 day trip with my 8 year old boy (15-22. April) After extensive research on the net about what to do and how to have the most fun while experiencing culture here are some .-) 16 vital tips:1.don´t bother going with small children (0-6 yrs). It will be tiering, expensive and wont yet leave a lasting impression on them! Even Disneyland Paris is probably not yet worth the money at this age. Whatever your kids will enjoy doing in DLP you can offer them for a fraction of the price in your home town! So, wait until they are a bit older to really have an amazing trip. Friends of our with 3 kids (8,6,4) had a horrible experience. The 8 year old enjoyed quite a few things, the 6 year old was not at all with it, while the 4 year old had to be constantly occupied by the parents.2.Plan your trip well. Know what you´re doing when and have back up plans in case it rains. We were unlucky, it was freezing cold. I wish I had packed some gloves and a scarf!3.For visiting Paris and Versailles with a child 3 1/2 days are just right because you need to start your days EARLY, very early to avoid queues! I had planned 4 and a half days and it was too long. Had to go to the cinema on the Champs Elysées twice to keep spirits up! 1 additional day was spent in Parc Asterix and 2 more in Disneyland.4.Always and without fault be at the entrance of every museum/sight BEFORE it opens. On our first day I didn´t take that advice seriously and had to queue for 2 hours in the freezing cold and rain to enter Musée d´Orsay. If you do end up in a long line, play games, sing songs or even better listen to music, take an MP3 player along.5.Always carry some candies in your zipable rucksack and a bottle of water which you can refill! (price of any drink in a bistro € 4,7.-), an umbrella, a book or whatever games you child likes and which can be played in case of tiredness/boredom. Do NOT keep any valuables in the rucksack; mine was opened twice while riding in the metro!6.See the Eiffel tower (excellent recommendation was to walk up the 2 first flights, kids love it, you hate it! And then take the elevator to the top). Also see the tower at night, marvellous experience at the beginning of every hour: the lights will be blinking for 10 minutes.7.Go on a Seine cruise. If your child is fluent in french I can highly recommed the “croisière enchantée” by the company Bateaux Parisiens right at the Eifel tower. Amazing how much my boy learned and still remembers after listening to this fun and interactive performance for kids. A similar cruise for children is beeing offered by the company “vedettes de paris” (again only in french). My son wanted to go go on that too, but they were closed for Easter, so can´t tell you which one is better. The hop on hop off Seine boat (Batobus) was fun, a change from the metro but nothing ike the cruise for children. Didn’t do a dinner cruise because I thought it may be a boring (too long) and expensive experience – after seeing prices in general I am not sure if it would not have been a good idea after all.8.Go on the Car rouges – red double decker hop on and off buses. Again a nice change from the metro. Kids want to sit on the upper deck even in the rain!!!! Do it, take out your umbrella and freeze, you child will enjoy it! Don´t mind that the headphones are hopeless…9.You can go up on the Arc the Triomphe to have an amazing view of the Champs Elysées and then a meal at Mc Donalds on the Champs Elysées. Don´t worry they will eat plenty of real french food at other places (baguettes, frites, croque monsieur, pain au chocolat, croissant..)10.Visit the Louvre even if it is just for the Mona Lisa and the Venus of Milo. Again stand in line for tickets BEFORE it opens! On your way to these two master pieces your children will absorbe a lot more than you think (the magnitude of this former palace, the different pieces of art… Be out of there within one hour before the crowds arrive and your child starts hating it. Then walk through the Jardin des Tuilleries to the Obelisk (to let of steam, there is a plaground, poneys, cafés..). Then hop on a Car rouge or take the metro.11.See Notre Dame de Paris and be prepared for a never ending queue to get to the towers – this queue was the worst, it practically didn´t move at all – we had to give up because of the freezing cold, which was a great pitty because the fun for children at Notre dame is up on the towers (seeing the gargoils and view, not inside, that is what adults enjoy!)12.Go to Montmartre where the painters sit. Just for fun and show we used the funiculaire. Of course you will pass Sacre Coeur. My boy refused to enter another church after the Notre dame waiting experience. Apart from the Eiffel tower, the Seine cruise for french speaking children, the Montmartre experience was the third hightlight of my boy. I payed € 50 for a portrait which is not all that great, but he enjoyed the experience thouroghly. After that we had dinner on that pittoresque square where he even gladly ate escargots! Proudly he returned to our hotel with his portrait under his arm. All in all I can warmly recommend this experience.13.¾ day were spent in Versailles. Again be first in line at 8.30. I can recommend the audio guide for children (several languages) even for adults. It´s very well done, you get to see and listen to all that a child is able to absorbe within a hour. Then either take the little train (hop on and off) or the rent a golf cart to drive through the gardens of the chateau to Petit Trianon (nothing special) close by is the Hameau de la Reine which is much more fun for children, the Grand Trianon and then end up at the Grand Canal. You can also walk to the Grand Canal and rent bikes to see the Trianons. We did all of it: Train, bike and after an OK meal in la Flotille restaurant at Grand Canal we rented a rowing boat. I think that was the part my son enjoyed must. I should have rented it for 1 hour instead of ½ hr!!! By the way just in front of the Versailles train station there is a Mc Donalds.14.Since we started all days (but one) so early, having a breakfast buffet at our hotel and paying € 13.-p.P. for it wasn´t an option. Instead I bought croissants and pain au chocolat from the local boulangerie. I did see plenty of cafés that offered breakfast for a fixed price of € 6,5.-. Those without fixed prices charged € 12.- for 2 croissants and 2 hot drinks!!! So go for the fixed priced breakfasts.15.What would my son do again:Tour Eiffel walking up and watching lights at nightSeine cruise, Car rouges and metroMontmartre including a portraitLouvre, Musée d´Orsay (short visits)Arc the Triompe walking upChamps Elysées (Mc Donalds and Cinema)Versailles especially the boating experience16.What would I do differently next time travelling with my child: I maytry the Seine dinner cruise;definitly go up on the towers of Notre Dame.Go to La Vilette – apparently a great interactive museum for ChildrenHave dinner in quartier latin or St. Germain des PrésBring warmer clothes just in caseForce my child to go to the toilettes before and after visiting sights or whenever possible."
50,“Paris needn't be expensive.”,"My wife and I have been to Paris every year for the last four years. The sights of Paris are world famous and do not need mention here. However, Paris is often regarded as one of the most expensive cities in the world - but it needn't be if you know a few simply rules. Here are a couple of guidelines to save you a great deal of money.1. Parisian bars and restaurants have a reputation for being very expensive indeed. To dine on a cruise boat on the Seine for example can cost up to 500 euros per person.However, most Parisian bars and restaurants make their money from either their food or drinks - but rarely from both! About half the restaurants attract customers by offering good and reasonably priced menus - but then they sting the customer for any drinks they have with the meal. Other restaurants attract customers with very cheap drinks - but then they sting the customer for any food they consume.Most people who know the system have learned to eat in a bar or restaurant that advertises cheap meals - but they DRINK ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. They then leave after the meal and visit the bar or restaurant up the road which advertises cheap drinks - but there they EAT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. If you stick to this rule then you can enjoy superb food and drinks at very reasonable prices. An excellent 3-course meal can cost as little as 15 euros if you look around - even in central Paris. If you eat and drink in the same place though you will probably be presented with a hefty bill.2. Beware of where you sit for a drink such as coffee or tea. A cup of coffee in a side street cafe or a kiosk usually costs about 1.50 - 2 euros. However, if you sit at a table in a popular location you will almost certainly be stung.On our first visit to Paris, my wife and I sat down at a cafe table on the Champs-Elysees. It was a recommended 'Thing to Do' in our guide book. I thought the two coffees would be a little more expensive than usual - but what the hell. When the bill came with the two cups of coffee - it was 26 euros! That was about 18 UK pounds or 9 UK pounds per coffee! That's about 18 US dollars per cup!After the initial profanity and minute of shock, we started to see the funny side. The whole thing was so well done and the waiter really was immaculate and impeccably polite. He made us feel like royalty and he didn't bat an eyelid when he presented the bill. We do appreciate style and class when we see it and I eventually gave the waiter a 4 euro tip! I've never felt so pleased to be ripped off. We also took photos of our coffee in the cups - of us drinking our coffee - and then pictures of our empty cups! We still look at the photos now and laugh about our 26 euro cups of coffee.When we asked about two coffees at a cafe in the Place de Bastille last year, they were 14 euros. We walked across the road to a market stall and bought two coffees for 3 euros - within sight of the cafe! If you do not want to get stung in such tourist locations, then always check the price of a drink or a food item AT THE TIME YOU ORDER. The same coffee in a side street or a kiosk will probably be about 2 euros - often within sight of the tables that charge you several times more.3. The other thing to be aware of in Paris are the taxis. As taxi-drivers go, those in Paris are polite and reasonable enough. However, many of them do have a rather curious habit of taking their dogs to work with them - presumably for company. The dogs usually occupy the front seat beside their owner, while the passengers occupy the back.Our first experience of this was when we climbed into a taxi - and the driver's Pekinese immediately joined us in the back. The Peke spent the rest of the journey being petted on my wife's lap. Another taxi contained an Irish wolfhound and the huge creature barely fitted on the front seat with its head on the ceiling! The giant hound spent the journey, either with it's huge head out of the window (ears flapping in the wind) or turned around between the seats looking us in the eye for a fussing!My wife and I love dogs and we were not bothered at all. But if you do not like them, then your journey may be unhappy. If that is the case - and if you don't like dog hairs or being licked - then only hire a taxi whose driver has not taken his pet to work with him.Paris is known as 'La Reine du Monde' - 'The Queen of the World'. It is the most beautiful city in the world and we love it as you will too. Follow the simple rules above and your visit will not be as expensive as many might think. You will enjoy Paris as much as us."
40,“Loved PARIS”,"We just got back from an amazing spring break in Paris!! Spent the first few hours on the top of the Arc de Triopmhe for our first views of Paris. This was our first trip to Paris. The Metro and the RER train are the best way to get around a big city i have ever seen. We went from our hotel to Versaille on the RER in about 30min. An amazing site to see and on the return went to Sacre cour in about 45min. The sites were great from there, you could see the eiffel tower as if it were right across the street. Went to a fun little restaraunt called ""Les Fondue"" sat with some fellow Canadians from Toronto (sorry) lots of food and all the wine you could drink (from a baby bottle?). Spent a day at the Louvre (awesome) but waaaay to big and tireing! Went across the river to the D'orsay museum and enjoyed that more. Went up the eiffel tower and caught the sunset, we stayed for awhile and watched as the city lit up, it was a beautiful site. The weather was sunny every day but a little cold and the gardens had not begun to show yet. Maybe next trip!"
50,"“Paris, France -- A must see for everyone.”","Paris is a wonderful place to visit. Plenty of attractions, full of history. Walking through the city, and visiting all of the famous and historic monuments is a very satisfying experience. My favorite was Château de Versailles. A gorgeous and monumental palace outside of France full of art surrounded by gorgeous landscaping... I hope you enjoy some of the pictures that I have taken."
40,“Wintertime in Paris”,"This post is especially meant for anyone interested in possibly going to Paris in the winter months. We went for the last week of December 2005. While it was cold (think Philadelphia or New York in December), it is arguably the best time of year to go for your first visit. The lines and crowds were much smaller, and we were able to get to all of the sites during our brief trip. Check out some of our wonderful pictures of Paris, some with snow flurries included at no extra charge!"
40,“The city of light!”,"Paris is la ville des lumières. I moved to Paris few weeks ago and I feel really pleased with the atmosphere present in the city. Contrary to what people may think, Paris doesn't really wake up before 10 am. Very few cafes and boutiques are opened before 10 or sometimes 11 pm.. It is nice to walk in the streets in the morning and enjoy a city that never sleeps! :)"
50,“A 'must do' view of Paris without the queues”,"We visited Paris last weekend and were fortunate to have fantastic weather on the Saturday and our expensive room at George Cinq, Four Seasons was upgraded to a suite.As expected queues for the main tourist attractions were very long and with only a weekend visit we were loathed to spend hours queuing. We visited the Louvre and the nearby gardens where we came across a traditional fairground with a Ferris Wheel. At the age of 34 I had never experienced one of these and to be honest neither of us are great at heights. I can't remember the exact cost but it was only around 3 or 4 euros and better still no queue.The view at the top was incredible although it did take a couple of full circuits to become used to the height. Using the central pole you could even rotate to change your view.If you want to see a fantastic view of Paris, taking in the Louvre, Seine, Eiffel Tower and Mont Marte then this is a cheap, fun and quick way to do it. Definitely one of the highlights of a luxury romantic weekend for two.One word of advice, if you attempt the log flume, you will get wet and you may well hurt yourself on the long slide. We both walked off with minor injuries but it was worth it! We even have the tacky photo to prove it ;o)"
50,"“Great City, Great People”","Visited Paris May 19-26, 2005 and our conclusion (my husband's and mine) is that this is a wonderful city filled with wonderful people. Don't let people tell you that Parisians are cold and nasty - that couldn't be further from the truth. We walked all over the 6th and 7th Arrondissments and crossed the Seine to the Louvre many times. The Louvre is a city unto itself and if you're interested in art and culture and history you can spend a week in there, if not more. We stayed in the St. Germain du Pres area where you can find a restaurant every 20 feet and the several we visited were all good. Don't miss the crepe makers and the little shops with pastries and meats. Their glaces are as good as gelato in Italy. Most people in the city speak English (and several other languages as well) and they are not indignant if you can't speak French. If you go with a scowl on your face, that's what you'll get back but if you are pleasant, that's what you'll get back - and that works in all of life, not just while travelling. In any event, Paris is fabulous and we can't wait to explore more of it in the future.JS, Randolph, MA, USA"
10,“Paris is a big scam”,"Do not visit Paris if you are on a budget!! It has such a reputation for being romantic, but in reality it is smelly, dirty, difficult and not so great as you imagined. Of all the European cities I have visited, Paris is the absolute most expensive (more expensive than London or the Riviera). The cafes are really smoky and often the food is terrible, even though it costs so much. Service is usually slow and/or somewhat rude for no reason. (The only things of good value are the crepes at vendor stands which are both cheap and delicious.) Yes, the bridges are beautiful and yes, the Louvre is rather big and somewhat impressive (but the British Museum is free and it is even more impressive though it is smaller). In Paris, you pay through the nose for even the tiniest item you wish to purchase - i.e. $10 for a hot chocolate, $6 for a coca-cola, and in the end it feels like the Parisians ask too much for what they have to offer. Even the Eiffel Tower is quite a hassle. You have to wait in line for over 4 hours from start to finish. (Don't be fooled - the line at the base of the tower says ""1/2 an hour from this point"". But once you get into the elevator and go up, there are tons of lines all through the tower and it is freezing at the top, even in summer, and you will wait and wait and wait in long lines just to get back out of the tower.) Worst of all, we bought the France Saverpass which is supposed to allow you travel any 4 days in a one month period. We went to take the train from Paris to Avignon and they told us they had no more seats because our tickets were at a discounted rate & those wouldn't be good enough. Our choice was to either wait and go the following day or pay an additional $160 to be able to get on a train and leave that day. I saw this happen to many, many other people at the train stations and I find it abominable. (Be sure to make a reservation at the train station, many days in advance of your desired travel date, in order to avoid this situation). I speak French almost fluently and even so we didn't have a very easy time of it in that city. I've spoken with many French people who also hate Paris. I'm not saying all French people are bad - quite the contrary; almost all the French whom we encountered elsewhere in France were lovely - but Paris is difficult and you should be prepared to face a lot of unpleasant things if you wish to enjoy what it has to offer. If you are very rich, then it won't matter to you because you'll be able to stay on the Right Bank, you'll enjoy much better service and money won't figure into things; but the very most expensive parts of Paris are quite different from the rest of the city. There are so many other places one can visit for half the cost, and enjoy so much more (i.e. Edinburgh, London, Rome). I wanted to spread the word so that people can make happier choices."
40,"“Ah, Paris, the City of Lights...and the cold.”","Just got back from a European adventure to both Paris and London. The London review is seperate and will also be available to read. The review of the hostels/hotels will also be seperate. Spent April 8 through 14 in Paris for the first time, only my second trip to Europe. FIRST of all when you arrive to Paris, the Gare du Nord station if you fly into Charles De Gaulle airport and Gare du Austerlitz if you fly into Orly airport, is BUY A PARIS VISITE 5 day travel pass. This pass is good for travel in the subway system, the buses, the rail line (like the one you take to Versailles and the Disneyland Europe), and unique things like the furniculare in the Montmarte district to take you the Sacre Coure. It is invaluable; for 30 Euros it is a life saver. The subway system is very easy to pick up. Do yourself a favor and be familiar with it before you get there. It is very common sense...each line is color and number coordinated with the direction determined by one of the stations at the end of the line, ie. one ending station for the Blue Line or the 5 is Charles De Gaulle Etoile which is right outside the Arc de Triomphe...convienent. The SECOND item to pick up is a Museum Pass...usually a 3 day pass, but 5 days is available. This pass is for consecutive days and only starts when you use it the first time. This covers almost everything!Our, my roommate and I, first stayed in Paris' Chinatown area, near the Place d'Italie station. Definitely an interesting dichotmy of people in one area. Chinese food in Paris is surprisingly good. We would frequent local brasseries and patisseries in the morning and afternoon and had decent meals for dinner. Our favorite item to order would be the Croque madame with salad and fries. It is an open faced melted ham and cheese with a fried egg on top, usually about a reasonable 7-8 Euros tops (at the time about $10). We also ate a lot of Pain au Chocolate and the different baguette sandwichs, my favorite the Thai Chicken Curry...yummy. The second hostel/hotel we stayed at was in the Levallois Perret area, which is a more white collar, family oriented area of town..a little more clean.We visited all the usual spot like Versailles, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs d'Elyssee, the Effiel Tower, and Notre Dame. We also went to less well-known places like Sacre Coure, which overlooks the Montmarte district and the Invalides, burial place for Napoleon. Most of these places are covered by the Museum Pass, except things like the Effiel Tower, which is 10,70 Euros or $15 to go to the top. We also sampled the Indian and Japanese cusine in Paris, also surprisingly good. Now for my only complaint, the weather. Wow for being the middle to the end of spring, the weather absolutely sucked. It was cold and rainy and nasty for about half the time we were in Paris. I would definitely suggest going May thru June and September thru early November."
50,"“warm, friendly Paris”","We visited Paris this month, certain we would be treated rudely and with disdain. We are delighted to report that the people of France could not have been more cordial and welcoming. Everyone we met was warm and friendly and even perfect strangers went out of their way to help us. ""Merci beaucoup"" to the people of France!"
10,“Paris”,"I visited Paris 10 years ago and I went again last week.There are a few things I want to write:1)Paris in one of the filthiest places I ever visited.2)Metro, trains, buses and airports are terrible.3)Handicapped. Don't even think about visiting Paris4)French people. Rude and ironique.In general Paris seems to be on its decline.Everything seems abandonned.I hope that they don't organise the 2012 Olympic Games.I come from a small country,Greece and I truly believe thatwe have nothing to be jealous of. We don't have big parks orgreat buildings because of the turkish occupation for 400 yearsbut we live happy. In Paris the only thing you can see is misery.Frenchmen,stop believing that you are the best in the worldand try to do something with your country and the services you offerto the visitors.Katerina,33Athens"
30,“Paris is just average”,"I went with my sister for 3 days and just got back from Paris yesterday. I was really looking forward seeing Paris after reading reviews. However, when I arrived I was disappointed. I found it boring and average and generally cannot see the fuss about it. Yes it did have some great places and at night it was buzzing...but I was bored most of the time. The metro system is ok, but really smells and people are so rude...Euro Disney was nothing special and the Airport was awful....only Mexico City airport was worse! Basically there are better cities in the world and it amazes me how Paris is consider to be one of the top city destinations...it's ok but nothing special!"
40,“Loved the Latin Quarter”,"We returned this week from a stay in a hotel on the Rue Moufftard and had an absolutely delightful stay in this cozy area. There are many restaurant selections, local weekend markets, various street performers and so much more.The Pantheon, Luxembourg Gardens, Boulevard St. Michel and San Germain Des Pres are within easy walking distance. The museum and metro passes are well worth the euro cost.We had fun and so will you when you visit Paris.Drs. Lawrence & Linda Benjamin"
30,“Paris was an experience”,"Paris was my first experience in Europe. It started out as the trip of a life time (so far). I saw all the famous sites that the city had to offer and they definetly lived up to all my expectations. Paris is a beautiful city and also a romantic one at that. Although I was not with my boyfriend you could feel the romance in the air, especially walking along the Seine River. My friends and I also met some amazing people during our stay, but we also incountered some of the rudest people that I have ever come in contact with. I always heard the rumor that the French don't like Americans...well it's true! I enjoyed my stay in Paris, but I will probably never go back to France."
50,“Paris in the Springtime”,"This was my 4th trip to Paris. My previous trip had been in 1997 and Paris has changed. The Paris of today is ""clean"". What a relief not to have to constantly look where you are walking to avoid dog poop. I joined up with my wife from a business trip in Paris on May 17, 2004 and we stayed in the 5th District. It was wonderful. We only took the metro once because of time but we walked everywhere, ate bagetttes with ham and cheese for 3.3 Euros (neither the price nor the ham and cheese will kill you). We again did all of the tourist things but we this time we really enjoyed the cafes and restaurants on the many side streets. But the highlight of our trip was sitting on the grass about 200 metres from the Eiffel Tower watching the 10 P.M. light display and drinking a bottle of red wine. Life doesn't get much better than springtime in Paris."
50,“A Taste of Paris”,"End of April can be a wonderful time to visit Paris. The weather last week was excellent, with only hints of rain, and temps in the 60-70s daytime. The food is fabulous everywhere, from the common bistro/cafe to Atelier Robuchon, portions large too. Watch out for tourist trap prices at some cafes like Deux Magots,etc... Eat lots of cheese and bread!!! Chocolate shops are everywhere and worth every Euro. Visit the Catacombs for a break from the heat if you don't mind walking a few miles underground in some tight spaces with lots of dead people! Go early to avoid LONG lines at fave museums and monuments. Marche Vanves is a good flea market on weekends. Be prepared to spend money and have lots of extra space in suitcases for purchases. There's so much to buy all over Paris. Cuban cigars can be found at La Civette. Wait on any of the Ponts crossing the Seine at sunset on a clear night for a lovely Kodak moment. Enjoy!!"
50,“Loved April in Paris”,"I just returned from visiting Paris for the first time. It is a magnificent city and the French are friendly, helpful, genteel people.The Hotel Ibis Porte de Clichy has a wonderful staff that helped in way that was needed. Most speak English. I am in a wheelchair and the room was more ample and I expected and accessible into the bathroom. It had no role-in shower (had a tub) but I didn't expect one. For the money I give it an excellent rating. There are other Ibis Hotels so make sure you get the right one.If you're a walker you can walk everywhere. If not, Paris has a excellent transportation system. I took my wheelchair on the buses and saw ALL of Paris. There is also the train and metro system which I did not use. Rode my electric wheelchair onto a tour boat to see Paris at night. The lights of Paris from a boat is a must-see.The spring weather was sunny, comfortable temperature, lilacs blooming everywhere."
50,“Paris - The City”,"Paris was a wonderful city to visit.The boulevards, the buildings, the river, the churches, the monuments, the history, the French people, (who willingly helped us with directions), the weather, the transport system, (thanks to all the bus drivers who were friendly and polite), all these aspects of Paris were better than expected.(And we had high expectations!)The main downside was the rip-off price charged for beer in a little Greek restaurant in the Latin Quarter"
50,"“Oui, Oui!!”","It was so easy to get in to The City from the airport. Taking the trains gave us time to realx and gather our thoughts.We stayed 4 blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral. Woke up to the bells ringing lightly in the distance, ate at several brasseries, cafes, walked to some museums. We were able to easily connect to several different Metro lines since our hotel was ideally situated in the Latin Quarter.The hotel staff were very nice and congenial.All in all, a great palce to visit AND a great time of year to visit. Not crowded and excellent service in the restaurants/cafes."
50,“Great City”,"There is just so much to do in Paris. If you are planning a weekend in Paris, just take one advice from me. Don't expect to visit all the landmarks in one weekend. The best way to explore Paris and to enjoy it is to go in a series of weekends over your lifetime.If you want my advice on what to see if you are planning to visit Paris only once, then make sure you go to the Eiffel Tower for the breathtaking views (on a clear day though) and visiting the Notre Dame in the evening.Make sure you buy a batch (10 tickets) of Metro tickets as this will help you to travel around Paris easily and save you from walking pains and a few euros!!"
50,“Forget the stereotypes and 'rules'”,"Paris is so much more relaxed and easy to navigate than any of the reviews and advice I'd read prior to arriving. It is so friendly and international. As a vegetarian, I was concerned with locating places that would have something I could eat. Not to worry, every block of Paris is loaded with an international array of eateries, from Vietnamese to Indian, Middle Eastern and so on. So much easier than here in the USA! Although we studied French phrase books and did our best to speak in French, most people are very good at understanding English. At McDonalds, you can point to the picture on the counter where you order. We never met a single rude French person. Although I had read that we must wear dark solid colors, anything goes. The French airport personnel should teach our airports how to treat customers with respect. I felt like an honored guest there. What a shock to arrive in Philadelphia and be treated like cattle going to the slaughterhouse. The only thing I must advise is to drink water whenever possible as simple drinks (soda, tea) were often 4 euros which is over $5 in US money. Grab something at a patisserie in the morning then go to McDonald's - tea and expresso were only 1 euro. Bring comfortable walking shoes; we wore sneakers and were just fine. You can walk forever in Paris and love every minute of it. October was the perfect time for walking. We felt very safe even late at night. Do expect to find an over abundance of peddlers at the entrance to major attractions. Usually these are guys from Africa trying to make a living, and are very friendly. While they are usually reasonable in their prices and very willing to bargain, there are so many that you may feel overwhelmed. As far as exchanging dollars for euros or getting a good exchange rate, we found that the ATMs were the best bargain, so relax. There's an abundance of everything you need in Paris!"
50,“can't wait to return”,"My husband and I traveled to Paris in late March of 2003, just as the US was invading Iraq. We had some qualms about our trip, especially as most news reports showed protesting in the streets of Paris. I am so glad we ignored all the bad press, and went ahead with our plans! We were warmly welcomed wherever we went. We spoke no French, yet everyone was helpful, we stayed in areas away from all the tourist attractions, and gratefully rode the metro to all the ""sights"". We ate in neighborhood restaurtants, and the waiters gladly translated everything for us. We went to Le Moulin Rouge, Buddha Bar, and Barrio Latino as well as all the usual touristy attractions, and had a wonderful time!!We are going back again this spring, and we would encourage anyone with the desire to see Paris to leave all of your preconceived notions back in the US, and go have a fantastic time-Parisian's love Americans!"
50,“Paris is wonderful for a short break”,"Visted Paris with 3 friends for a 4 day break. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The city is lovely, they really know how to nurture their public services, great transport, tidy parks and crammed with little bars and resturants with lively atmosphere and great food well served.The museums were interesting, we walked around the city but one of the best ways to see it is by bus with a tourist transport ticket which is good for buses, metro and travel on the RER trains from the airport.Will be back."
30,“Still the best city in the world”,"Despite the US Media generated ""anti-French"" campaign, I found that Americans are welcomed in Paris just as warmly as anyone else...maybe more. The old days of ""the French hate Americans"" are obviously long-gone..We found most waiters, cab drivers, etc. do speak enough English to get by, and are more than pleasant and accommodating. This city which oozes history and beauty from every pore just overcomes one with a feeling of love..the lovers are everywhere..strolling on the beautiful streets, cuddled together on the side of the Seine, nuzzling in a park. There is no need to even talk about the food, whether you are in a three star Michelin restaurant, or a local corner cafe, the food is fresh, tasty, delicious...All the French people with whom we spoke agreed that this anti-French campaign is obviously sparked by the US Media, who of course represents the US government's attitude of being 'pissed off' because France didn't agree with its UN DENIED resolution on the war in Iraq. The lesson is clear...don't believe what you read or see on TV...go and meet the real 'people' of a country to see what is really the truth.. This is a beautiful, historic, live-loving people, and their city promotes this on a minute-by=minute basis!"
40,“Roaming about France in Septembe”,"Arrived in Paris and spent three wonderful day near the Parc de la Villette exploring the many facets of the Parc. The Omni, and the science exihibits and the many tiny restaurants in the area. Enjoyed the TGV train to Evian-les-Bains and spent four lovely days in a B&B on Lake Geneva (Lac Leman). Our Lake side room afforded us a view of Lausanne, Switzerland, which we did visit along with Montreaux. The boat from Evian makes round trips from all the major cities on both side of the lake. The city of Evian at the foot of the Alps offered more events than we had time. Our returned to Paris for twelve more days meeting old Friend and making new one in several surburban areas of Paris. A day trip to Chateau Terry to view the vinyards and sample wines and champagne. A day at DisneyLand to check out the new addition to the park. A trip to Giverny to discover additional painting of the master and to visit his gardens, home, and work places. Of course we took time to visit the time honored regular monuments. Took lots of pictures and this time we did what the French do on vacation: relaxed."
50,“Fantastic trip”,"Got a great deal for 7days in Paris last March. The weather was perfect, and with the museum pass, we were able to see so many beautiful places. We did our planning in the evening, so during the day we could just hop on the Metro and get where we needed to be. I was told to watch for pickpockets, and I just laughed it off, but one Sun.morning when the subway was the least crowded, I felt a guy trying to get in my backpack, so watch out! Be sure to see Versailles (easy Metro access) and the Picasso Museum along with the other standard attractions!"
50,“First Trip to Paris”,"My wife and I just got back from our first trip to Paris. Our experiences exceeded all our expectations. Paris could not have been more romatntic or more beautiful. We stayed on the Ilse de St. Louis and found it to be very charming and convienent. Our experience with Parisians was wonderful, people could not have been nicer or kinder to the two of us. Our advice is pack your bags and go ASAP for a trip you will never forget."
50,“Walking in Paris”,"I had an amazing four days in Paris.When I got in to the city, I found a Hostel and headed straight for the Tower. I walked for about 4 hours that night. The next day, I got up good an early and walked for 13 hours. I took a out-of-town tour until noon the next day but walked 9 more hours when I got back. My final day had me walking about 3 more hours. Paris was a crazy city. There is SO much to see if you are willing to do a little walking. Don't bother with those site seeing bus tours! Walk it!!!"
40,“Kota yang romantis”,"Kota yang terkenal sebagai kota mode ini memiliki pemandangan yang luar biasa, ada Louvre, ada Eiffel Tower. Anda dapat menyusuri keindahan kota ini dengan kendaraan mobil dan menyusuri lokasi trowongan dimana Lad Diana pernah mengalami kecelakaan dan meninggal, ataupun menyusuri kota ini dengan kapal, anda dapat melihat jembatan cinta yang digantungin gembok sebagai simbol kelanggengan cinta, anda juga dapat melihat Eiffel Tower dari kapal itu.

Париж не разочаровал, нет, он, вполне ""стоит мессы"" но! Есть в этом славном городе печальные минусы: а) куча валяющихся везде оборванцев и бродяг (клошары современные, полагаю), б) дурацкое ""Око Саурона"" на Эйфелевой башне, в) ещё кое что... А ещё, меня подвёл фотоаппарат не желавший цеплять ночные виды. Таким образом, ночной Париж посещён, но альбом об этом будет довольно скудным ((( Увы, так уж получилось ((( В Париже посетил всё, что хотел за исключением Сакре Кёр. Прошёл по всей Рю де Риволи, Елисейским, хотел на Трокадеро даже заскочить, но, подумал: а, зачем? - ради вида на Эйфелеву с другой стороны? Не стоит. На Сите посмотрел всё, Нотр Дам само собой.

Facciamo uno spuntino sulle simpatiche sedie di ferro che sono di fronte ai due laghetti che sono fuori al museo e poi ci dirigiamo sulla Senna direzione Notre Dame. Ci fermiamo lungo la riva per acquistare dei dipinti su tela della città dalle classiche bancarella poste lungo la riva e poi prendiamo un caffè (ma non ve lo consiglio) in un bar di fronte la cattedrale. Da qui passiamo il ponte e visita alla chiesa Di Saint Chapelle dove troverete dei magnifiche vetrate che rappresentano la genesi e il creato. Poi ritorno in albergo e dopo esserci riposati, la sera visita al quartiere latino con cena in uno dei tanti ristornati presenti in questo quartiere pieno di simpatici locali e di giovaniIl secondo giorno partenza per il quartiere Montmartre dove ci attende la bellissima basilica del Sacre Coeur dove abbiamo trovato (oltre alla scale purtroppo) tante attrazioni, dalla famosa giostra del film Amelie a numerosi negozi di souvenir e non vi perdete tra questi un museo del cioccolato con delle sculture delle attrazioni più belle della città che è qualcosa di meraviglioso. Visita poi alla piazza dietro la basilica piena di artisti e molto suggestiva dove abbiamo acquistato dei dipinti di artisti del luogo. Scendendo siamo arrivati al quartiere di Pigalle, caratterizzato come saprete, per i suoi sexy shop e visita da fuori al famoso teatro del Moulin Rouge. Abbiamo fatto poi colazione per strada fermandoci in un posto consigliato (Place des Voges) in albergo e visita poi ai bellissimi giardini del Lussemburgo passando per il quartiere latino con boulevard San Mitchel e Sain Germain.Ritorno in albergo e poi cena da un amico che ha un ristorante italiano alla periferia di Parigi a base di pesce e frutti di mare.La mattina partenza per il quartiere di Montparnasse dove vi è uno dei grattacieli più alti di Parigi e dove abbiamo visitato un mercatino dove si dice si incontrano i veri parigini. Abbiamo trovato dei banchi pieni di ogni ben di dio, da quelli dove si vendevano pesci e frutti di mari a quelli a base di carne, per non parlare poi dei banchi dove si cucinava e dove vi erano dei pentoloni pieni di zuppe, verdure, paelle e non so cos’altro.Uscito dal mercatino siamo passati per il bellissimo cimitero di Monteparnasse e ci siamo fermati a fare colazione in una boulangerie del posto a base di succo d’arancia, caffè e marmellate. Poi purtroppo ritorno in albergo e ripartenza verso casa. Come avrete capito se avete voglia di muovervi in tre giorni (o quasi) c’è tanto da vedere"
50,“Tour de Parigi”,"Avendo il week end libero ( mi trovavo in zona per lavoro), decido di far visita alla capitale francese. Premetto che preferisco visitare ciò che crea la natura che quello che crea l'uomo, comunque devo dire che ne è valsa la pena il girovagare per la città . ovviamente il poco tempo a disposizione ,mi costringe a visite mordi e fuggi dei luoghi più importanti della città. Torre Eiffel, Louvre,Arco di trionfo,Piazza della Concordia,Champes Ellisse , passeggiata lungo la Senna,Notte Dame ecc.ecc.sono luoghi e punti di interesse di bellezza indiscutibile anche se soggettiva. La città offre un aria magica soprattutto di sera. Non per nulla fa parte delle città più belle al mondo. Sicuramente da visitare avendo a disposizione almeno 4-5 giorni ."

40,“Cidade luz”,"Paris tem muita elegancia, predios e museos, assim passear pelas ruas é muito prazeiroso. A av Champs-Elysees é muito bonita, recomendo iniciar do arco do triunfo e seguir em direcao ao museo do Louvre. Tem varios restaurantes e cafes no trajeto para dar uma parada. Outra opcao de passeio é seguir para La defense, mas recomendo o uso do metro, pois a distancia e grande.Nao muito distante do arco do triunfo pode visitar a Torre Eiffel que o cartao postal de Paris. Proximo a torre pode-se tomar os barcos de passeio pelo rio Sena."

30,“Paris un lifting très mal reussi”,"Paris n'est pas la plus belle ville du monde. Il vient après Venezia, Roma, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, London, Barcelona et autres. Une grand partie de la ville ancienne de Paris a été détruite par Napoleon III et Hausmann. il est uniforme et avec un panorama historique modeste vis à vis Roma par exemple. Les musées de Paris sont plains d'ouvres de l'étranger.http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/11/03/01016-20111103ARTFIG00750-au-fil-des-siecles-les-trois-quarts-de-la-capitale-ont-ete-effaces.php"

40,“Paseando por Paris”,"Paris es una ciudad especial para llenarse de arte, cultura, historia y sobre todo para disfrutar de esos barcitos que estan por todas la ciudad.Para personas como yo, que me gusta disfrutar de los lugares sin tanta gente, he tenido la experiencia de visitarla en temporada baja y alta, lo ideal para tener acceso a todas las cosas para ver, seria en temporada media en la que no hay tanta gente.Es de destacar la facilidad de ir a todos lados en tren y metro, empezando desde el aeropuerto hasta cualquier punto y gastando muy poco."
50,“Cidade”,"Bom, Paris é linda e especial. Caminhar pelas ruas de Paris é glamuroso. Sentar em de seus cafés é mais glamuroso ainda. Todos os pontos turísticos são lindos de se vistar."
40,“reveillon em paris”,"como a maioria das pessoas também sempre quis conhecer Paris. Sem dúvidas a cidade e lindissima. Monumentos, palácios, muitos jardins, museus, e a torre que é fenomenal. è maravilhoso andar pela champs eliseé no meio das lojas mais caras e badaladas do mundo. tudo e deslumbramento. Porém como já tinha ouvido falar, o povo não tem nada de hospitaleiro, Há filas em todas as atrações, eo preço de refeições, taxis é muito alto. O metro é imundo, e super lotado. Ma sé sempre maravilhoso, podermos etr estado em Paris, fazer um passeio de barco no rio sena, ver a cidade luz a noite, e tudo mais, valeu muito a pena."
50,“Ciudad de Luces desde las Alturas”,"Paris es sin duda la ciudad mas romantica de Europa. La mejor forma de conocerla es recorrer sus calles a pie y con un buen mapa. Una semana es poco para descubrir los mas bellos secretos que atesora Paris, pero en una sola noche te enamoras de ella. No se si sea mas bella de dia o de noche, es que creo en realidad que hay 2 ciudades muy diferentes en un mismo sitio, una ciudad que dia te brinda todas las opciones para estar siempre entretenido, pero que cuando cae la noche sus calles toman un romanticismo que te invita a vivir un amor a lo frances. Su icono, La Torre Eiffel de dia te muestra una ciudad palpitante pero de noche es una magia sus luces y las cistas de esta preciosa ciudad. Y que dicha Paris cuando llueve, vale la pena andarla lentamente y de mano de un amor..."
50,“c'est paris”,"Paris est et restera Paris. Nous y allons depuis si longtemps. Je vous recommande aujourd'hui une visite de Montmartre. A faire le matin de bon heure. Oubliez les guides touristiques. Allez sur internet et créez votre circuit. Cette butte est fantastique. du moulin au bateau lavoir, des abeysses aux vignes. tant d'artistes y ont vécu et nous les comprenons. par contre, regardez le sacré cœur de loin. une foule immense. Une autre visite indispensable : le parc de la butte Chaumont. A faire aussi le matin : superbe ! un havre de paix dans Paris"
40,“Muito bom!”,"O Hotel é excelente em vários aspectos.Super bem localizado, o quarto é muito confortável e silencioso.Adorei e recomendo a todos."
40,“Andar e seguir o metrô até o fim de cada linha.”,"A cidade é praticamente plana, e mesmo com uma semana de estadia foi pouco tempo. Aconselho não comprar o Paris Pass a não ser que você seja um amante incondicional de museus e tenha muito tempo. Preferimos conhecer os principais pontos turísticos, andar a pé e muito de metrô. Sentar tomar um café e apreciar a cidade. Na próxima visita conhecer a parte norte da cidade, as Gares, Montmartre, Roland Garros e rodar mais na Ile de la Cité."
50,“musée à ciel ouvert”,"Chaque année, escapade dans notre belle capitale.A chaque balade,je fais de nouvelles découvertes......monuments...jardins...rues.....musées....(certains gratuits un dimanche de chaque mois) ect.............On peut visiter sans faire d'énormes dépenses si l'on veut bien marcher.Assister à des émissions de télé,radio,spectacles gratuits.Choix de tout types de restaurants abordables meme le shopping.Location en basse saison abordable.Bref, avec une bonne documentation et simplicité, je passe toujours un bon séjour à Paris.Je regarde le luxe sans envie et comprenant certaine pauvreté avec justesse.."
50,“Очень люблю Париж!!!!”,"Конечно говорить о Париже можно бесконечно! Поэтому лучше один раз увидеть, чем сто раз услышать. Время года не имеет ни какого значения, зимой своя прелесть (средняя температура + 5), можно смело гулять и наслаждаться красотой, историей....Летом Париж конечно приобретает радость солнца и цветов, ВЕЛИКОЛЕПИЕ!"
30,“paris è romantica e raffinata”,"parigi è una bella città europea ma bisogna camminare per vedere bene e nei tratti più distanti avevamo usato benissimo la metrò,"
50,"“Nada me disgustó en este viaje, todo fue bueno, hasta el clima”","A pesar de la época, el clima fue excelente. No llovió ni hizo calor ni frío. Observo que la atención de los franceses a los turistas ha mejorado mucho en los últimos 40 años. Todos fueron muy amables y colaboradores. Es admirable el mantenimiento que los franceses dan a sus edificios y obras. La ciudad está más aseada que antes, pero requiere todavía mayor esfuerzo de limpieza."
50,“UNICA”,"Calzado cómodo y sólo las ganas son suficientes para caminar Paris. Quizás también, al partir una gran melancolía y la enorme necesidad de volver"
30,"“Linda cuidad, se disfruta mucho mas si hablas frances”","Es una cuidad muy bonita desde lo arquitectonico, muchos museos para visitar que lamentablemente no estan totalmente traducidos al ingles.La gente no es amable, fundamentalmente porque rechazan la gente que no habla frances. Todos los lugares estan llenos de gente y los famosos bares franceses son muy incomodos por falta de lugar, mesas minimas para comer. Buen sistema de transporte, pero dificil comunicarse para comprar el ticket. Las tiendas son muy lindas pero inalcanzables."
50,“グレイシャトル(greyshuttle)のサービスはグレートでした。”,高齢の母を含めた家族5人での旅行で、2台に分かれてしまうタクシーを利用する選択肢はなかったため、移動の際は送迎サービスを利用することは最初から計画していました。パリの送迎サービスはピンからキリまであるようですが（御サイトの口コミで知りました）、グレイシャトルのプライベート送迎サービスはグレートでした。2011年10月に旅行した際に、ＣＤＧ空港から北駅まで、北駅から宿泊施設まで、宿泊施設からＣＤＧ空港までと計3度利用しましたが、すべて満足いくものでした。特にＣＤＧ空港から北駅までの最初の送迎サービスでは、とてもお世話になりました。ユーロスターに乗り継いでロンドンに移動の予定だったため時間に追われていたのですが、朝のラッシュのパリの街を素晴らしいドライビングテクニックで走り抜け、遅れることなく送り届けてくれました。パリを出発する際の空港のターミナルと受付カウンター番号も事前にチェックしてくれていて、大変ありがたかったです。価格もリーズナブルで、複数回利用すればディスカウントもあります。加えて、リピーターには特典もある旨の案内メールを、帰国後にいただきました。残念ながら日本語のサービスは無いようですが、ドライバーのジャン・ミシェルは英語が堪能で十分なケアーをしてくれ（そのうえ、おしゃれで(^.^)）、家族は次回も（もし、次回があれば・・・(^^ゞ）ぜひ彼にお願いしたいと言っています。
50,“Tolle Stadt auch im Winter!”,"Die Reise führte uns im Januar 2011 nach Paris. Trotz eisiger Kälte konnte uns die Stadt für sich erwärmen. Tolle Bauwerke, ein umtriebiges Großstadtleben und der berühmte französische Charme konnte uns begeistern. Von Sacre Coeur, dem Eiffelturm, der Notre Dame und den Einkaufsstraßen konnte uns alles 5 Bewertungspunkte abringen. Wir können jedem empfehlen diese Stadt zu besuchen - vielleicht aber zu einer etwas wärmeren Jahreszeit."
40,“Paris es la torre Eiffel”,"Paris nos ha impresionado, pero sin duda la atraccion que más huella nos ha dejado ha sido subir a la torre Eiffel, creo que hay pocas experiencias que se puedan comparar con esta, menos mal que no la desmontaron como pretendían,recomiendo a todo el mundo que no dejen de visitarla."
50,"“Paris, wie könnte man dich nur beschreiben?”","Wenn 5 Sterne Ziele für Reisende das Größte sind, dann müsste Paris mindestens 10 Sterne bekommen.Diese Stadt zu beschreiben gleicht einer unmöglichen Aufgabe, da man sie nur einfach die Göttliche nennen kann.Hier nun die Superlativen aufzuzählen, wie den Eiffelturm, Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde, etc., würde ihr nicht alleine gerecht.Jeder kennt diese außergewöhnlichen, wunderbaren, überwältigenden Plätze und Orte.So möchten wir auf weniger bekannte Ziele aufmerksam machen, die nicht sehr weit von Paris liegen und trotzdem wunderbar sind und das Bild vervollständigen.Einer diesen wunderbaren Orte nah bei Paris ist die Domäne und das Schloss Chantilly. Ein wunderbarer Ort. der einen verzaubern muss. Hier bekommt man auch preiswerte Unterkunft, vielleicht sogar in dem kleinen Lustschloss in Chantilly.Ein Örtchen welches sich die französischen Künstler schon vor mehr als hundert Jahren erobert hatten, ist Barbizon, im Département Seine-et-Marne der Region Île-de-France.Hier gibt es auch kleine, preiswerte Hotels.Der Ort hat nur 1.500 Einwohner und ist mehr als idyllisch.Nicht auslassen sollte man den Wald von Fontainebleau, mit seinen unglaublichen Gesteinsformationen.Paris und seiner Umgebung geben wir als ein Weltziel-Muss ungewöhnliche, unendlich viele Sterne."
50,“La meilleure ville du monde !”,"Paris est sans aucun doute la plus belle ville du monde. Entre les monuments, les bords de seine et les boutiaues, Paris a tout pour plair a tout le mode et a tous ages. Cette ville est juste magique. Je vous recommande fortement cette capitale."
40,“Parigi non delude mai”,"Parigi è una città adatta a tutti ed anche la prima volta che si visita sembra di essere in un posto tanto familiare quanto fantastico. Si può passare dalla cultura (il museo d'Orsay per me è il meglio che ci sia) alla frivolezza dei negozi in cui comprare o solo ammirare le vetrine luccicanti; dalle sponde della Senna alle vedute dall'alto della Torre Eiffel; dallo storico Arco di Trionfo al moderno Grande Arche della Defense.Ritornarci è sempre una novità. Non più costretti a vedere quanto riportato su ogni guida della città si può stare ad ammirare le strade, le piazze ed i sontuosi palazzi. Camminare ed immergersi nella città, magari gustando una baguette con camembert e sorseggiando un bicchiere di vino. Doveroso concludere con un macheron di Fauchon"
50,“Banale ma...la città dell'amore!”,"Inutile e banale dirlo ma Parigi è realmente la città dell'amore e della vita notturna: noi ci siamo stati in pieno inverno e oltre l'una di notte la metropolitana era ancora piena di gente come fosse giorno! Al di là dei luoghi più isolati come la reggia di Versailles, nonostante le enormi dimensioni è tutto ancora a portata d'uomo: noi (e non siamo degli atleti) abbiamo raggiunto tutte le principali attrazioni a piedi. Dall'Opera al Louvre, la Tour Eiffel, gli Champes Elysee, Notre Dame, l'Arc de Triomphe sono tutti visitabili in giornata con un po' di buon allenamento. Unica pecca, almeno nel nostro caso, è stato il tour con i ""Bateau Mouches"" che, causa una cattiva organizzazione, non abbiamo fatto."
30,“Paris:10- Parisinos:0.”,"Despues de muchos años, tuve ocasion de volver a visitar Paris como turista. Siendo nacida en Francia, me averguenzo del trato de los Parisinos a los visitantes. No se puede ser mas grosero y maleducado con los visitantes. Ni siquiera la policia contestaba con amabilidad..Las cartas de los restaurantes no vienen en Español, ni en Ingles..ni siquiera en el hotel, 4 estrellas, hablaban español....La ciudad bien cuidada, imponentes sus monumentos.Lo de sacar por Internet los bonos de transporte, lo de los museos y la cita para visita de la Tour Eiffel, te facilita mucho el viaje, te evitas las larguissimas colas.Una mencion especial al Museo de l´Orangerie:imponentes cuadros de "" nenufares de Monet"" ."
40,“Incantevole Parigi”,"Innumerevoli sono le attrattive offerte al visitatore da Parigi.Sicuramente i luoghi che costituiscono la pià classica iconografia, Tour Eiffel, Louvre, Notre Dame, Montmartre, Champs Elysees sono imperdibili ma può essere molto appagante inserire nel proprio programma di visita anche qualche momento in altre zone.Interessante può essere una giro della zona della Sorbona o dei Giardini del Lussemburgo. Per le vedute di insieme, Tour Montparnasse e la cupola del Pantheon offrono ampi panoramiche nelle giornate di bel tempo."
40,“Paris ... eine Reise wert?”,"Paris präsentiert sich wie viele Großstädte unserer Zeit. Eine Mischung aus kommerziellen Mythos (Stadt der Liebe, Stadt an der seine, der Kultur, des guten essens, ...) und den nicht übersehbaren sozialen Problemen. Einerseits gibt es noch kleine Plätzchen zu entdecken - andererseits wälzt man sich mit den kauf- und schaulustigen Massen den Champs Elysee rauf und runter. Wer Paris erkunden möchte kann dies ruhig mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln tun - ein gut ausgebautes Netz und entsprechende Tageskarten - auch kombiniert mit Museen und Sehenswürdigkeiten - sorgt dafür. Wer mit dem Auto unterwegs ist, sollte beim Parken nicht auf den Euro schauen, sondern eine der Parkgaragen nutzen um nicht einen Strafzettel oder eine Abschleppung zu riskieren.Fazit: Wer Großstädte mag kommt hier auf seine Kosten."
30,"“Povera ""Ville Lumiere""”","Senza togliere la bellezza dei suoi momumenti e dei suoi luoghi questo è un dato di fatto!!!Caotica,sporchissima(escrementi di cani? ovvunque,poco curato tutto)persone povere in ogni luogo che dormono in ogni angolo e anche sulle vie principali (Rue de rivoli,Place vendome ect ect.).Carissima anche senza giustificazione qualitativa!!!!(Ma siamo a Parigi)!!Tra 50/100/150 non ci sarà più un francese bianco ma solo gente di colore!!Se ai francesi va bene così!!Metro efficentissima l'unico modo per girare Parigi senza impazzire oppure il carrouge(splendida invenzione).Da non ritornare in tempi brevi!!!Anzi!!"
50,“Parigi val bene una messa”,"Città bellissima, da visitare con calma, meglio un week-end lungo per poter assaporare tutto ciò che ha da offrire. Il mio consiglio è quello di visitare non solo le classiche mete quali la torre eiffel, montmartre, il louvre, il musse d'orsay, l'arco di trionfo, gli champs elysees, etc, ma anche trascorrere ore passeggiando nei classici quartieri come saint gemain de pres, il quartiere latino, etc. Visitare Parigi è semplicissimo, con la metro si arriva ovunque, è aperta fino a notte inoltarta ed è sempre affollata, per cui anche all'una di notte si riesce a prendere la metro sentendosi tranquilli e sicuri. Io consiglio di fare un abbonamento che fa risparmiare un bel po', io ho utilizzato la paris visite zone 1-3. In effetti tutto quello che c'è da vedere si trova nella zona 1. Da ricordare che la prima domenica di ogni mese i musei sono gratis, ma bisogna armarsi di pazienza, cercare di arrivare presto e fare lunghe file, che comunque scorrono abbastanza. Da non perdere il tramonto stando seduito sulla scalinata di Montmarte, ma ricordatevi che d'estate a Parigi fa buio molto tardi, verso le 22.00."
40,“MAGNIFICA”,"La città di Parigi è bellissima e merita di essere visitata. Immancabili le classiche mete del Museo de Louvre, della Torre Eiffel, di Mont Martre e degli Champs Elysées. A mio avviso i francesi non sono puliti come gli italiani. Abituatevi a mangiare in locali non proprio pulitissimi, senza tovaglia e con tavolini sporchi."
50,“Paris”,"Bonjour Paris. Man taucht ein in das pulsierende Herzstück Frankreichs, um die Stadt der Liebe mit allen Sinnen zu geniessen. Das französische „Savoir vivre“ erlebt man am besten im gemütlichen Cafe an der Ecke. Bei einem köstlichen Cafe au lait vergisst man die Zeit und geniesst das Leben in vollen Zügen. Am nachhaltigsten aber verzaubert die Pariser Atmosphäre ganz unvermutet während die Metro über die Hochbahn rattert, bei einer Kanalfahrt durch die Schleusen oder beim Blick auf die Dächerlandschaft."
50,“ville lumiere”,"la capitale per eccelenza,rimane sempre una delle mie mete preferite.ha un fascino intramontabile."
50,“La capitale più affascinante d’Europa”,"Una delle capitale europee più affascinanti, offre al suo interno un’infinità di attrattive. La Parigi culturale e storica, con il famosissimo Museo del Louvre, Les invalides, la Tour Eiffel, il Musèe d’Orsay e Notre Dame (solo per citare alcune delle mete più famose) è ampiamente controbilanciata dalla Parigi giovane, lussuosa e vivace. Mont Martre, il Quartiere Latino, il quartiere dell’Opera offrono mille soluzioni per chi vuole vivere la città anche nelle ore notturne. Da non perdere l’escursione fuori porta a Versaille, la navigazione sulla Senna (sui celebri e romantici Bateaux Mouches) e la scalinata del Sacre Coure, Chiesa che apre le porte alla vivace zona di Mont Martre. Per chi ama le architetture moderne, consiglio di visitare il nuovo quartiere della Defense."
50,“Romantisch....”,"Paris ist ja so romantisch. Das Zentrum ist ideal zu Fuss begehbar. Es empfiehlt sich einen Spaziergang am Abend entlang der Saine zu machen. Nur schon in der Métro spührt man das Flair der Stadt. Häufig spielen Musiker. Wichtig ist, dass man die Sehenswürdigkeiten am frühen Morgen anschauen sollte, da man insbesondere am Eiffelturm lange ansteht. Empfehlen kann man auch die Region bei Cambronne. Dort ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ideal!"
30,“deludente”,"Per la fama che ha, mi aspettavo molto meglio. Per gli amanti dell'arte, qualche bel museo, ma con moltissime opere di origine non francese. Interessanti i ristoranti e la vita notturna. Deludenti molti monumenti arcinoti come la torre eiffel (cos'ha poi di bello...) e il sacré coeur. Ottima la metropolitana."
50,“Paris je t'aime”,"Wie waren während der French Open in Paris. Die Stadt ist einfach traumhaft und so romantisch. Man kann im Stadtzentrum alles wunderbar zu Fuss erlaufen (mit Ausnahme des Sacre Coeur). Dorthin würde ich die U-Bahn nehmen. Besonders zu empfehlen sind die Gärten vor dem Louvre, wo man superschön die Stimmung geniessen kann. Nicht zu spät zum Eiffelturm gehen, da man ansonsten endlos anstehen muss."
50,“Mein absoluter Favorit in GANZ Europa”,"Eine bildhübsche Stadt, für Künstler, Familien oder auch alleine. Ein Erlebnis. Es fängt an beim Eiffelturm, dann zur Notre Dame, Galerie La Fayette, Arc de Triomphe, Champs'Elysees....Immer lohnenswert. Wie in jeder Stadt gibt es außerhalb des Centrums nicht ganz so schöne, etwas ''gefährliche'' Ecken. Die gibt es über All! Noch eine Empfehlung: Hotel Coypel!"
40,“Città romantica ma sporca”,"Ho passato un weekend lungo a Parigi (5 giorni di cui uno a Disneyland) ed ho visitato praticamente tutto (eccetto Versailles dove tornerò per un altro weekend). La città è molto bella, anche se forse un pò sporca. Il trasporto pubblico è eccezionale: non c'è un posto che non possa essere raggiunto con la metropolitana che è aperta fino all'1:30 di notte ed è sempre frequentata anche di notte.. A parte le attrazioni principali (Tour Eiffel, Arco di Trionfo, musei vari, Notre Dame, ecc.) ho trovato molto carini per passare la sera i quartieri di Saint Germain de Pres e Montmartre, ricchi di ristorantini e vita notturna. Per gli alberghi è fondamentare stare vicino ad una metropolitana, ma per risarmiare non è necessario stare al centro, tanto, come già detto con il metrò si raggiunge ogni posto in poco tempo ed a qualsiasi ora."
50,“città fantastica”,"La città di Parigi merita di essere visitata per varie ragioni: dal punto di vista architettonico e,principalmente, da quello culturale.Offre tantissimi musei tra i quali consiglio di visitare il Louvre e il museo d'Orsay. Trasporti eccellenti con una metropolitana molto efficente e capillare. Ottima città per un week end da giovedi a lunedi."
50,"“Parigi passano gli anni, ma sempre spettacolare”","Splendida città come sempre! Ricca di storia, di cultura, ma anche creatrice di tendenze e promotrice di innovazione.Io vengo spesso qui per lavoro ed occupandomi di retail marketing, trovo sempre qualche spunto.Negli anni la trovo sempre un po peggiorata nella pulizia. E cosa ancora più triste, sempre più invasa da senza tetto e mendicanti.Comunque rimane e rimarrà nel top delle mie destinazione europee preferite"
50,“Die Stadt der Liebe.”,"Paris ist voller Sehenswürdigkeit, Shopping und Entspannung. Es empiehlt sich mehrere Tage aufenthalt zu buchen, da die Stadt viel zu sehen anbietet.Folgende Sehenswürdigkeiten darf man im Paris nicht verpassen: La Tour Eifel, im obersten Stock sieht man die ganze Stadt. Einfach verzaubert. Der Museum Le Louvregilt als berühmteste Museum der Welt. Die Kathedrale Notre Dame de Paris, absolut zu besuchen. Wenn man schon im Paris ist, darf ein besuch im Disney Land nicht fehlen!"
50,“Non ci sono parole per esprimere una emozione così forte”,"Veramente. Non credo esistano abbastanza aggettivi per esprimere tutte le emozioni che si provano a visitare, ma anche solo a passare alcuni giorni a Parigi... Già a partire dal Charles de Gaulle, uno degli aeroporti piú avanzati mai visitati. Poi il primo momento usciti dalla RER é un emozione magnifica... Tutto é veramente a misura d'uomo, di businessman, di turista. Parigi dovrebbe essere una città modello per tante altre. Inutile dire che uno dovrebbe andare almeno una volta a Parigi nella sua vita..."
40,“citta affascinante”,"parigi è una citta affascinante, le sue vie del centro sono sempre cosi piene di vita e di iniziative culturali che non è possibile annoiarsi durante una permanenza in citta. non puo' mancare per chi è in visita alla citta, una gita sulla tour eifel e un giro al centre pompidu., un posto che io adoro perche' cosi originale e animato.in citta sono numerosi i punti di interesse, i vari monumenti e musei , un giro alla defense oppure una passeggiata in ozio nel centro. da consigliare"
20,"“Cidade linda, porém mal cuidada”","A cidade é linda, mas estava extremamente mal cuidada e suja! Ruas cheirando a urina, museus caindo aos pedaços. Povo mal educado. Fiquei decepcionada, mas vale a visita para conhecer os pontos principais."
40,“PARIGI una metropoli dal sapore ottocentesco!”,Parigi val pure una visita completa e come abbiamo fatto noi di una settimana si è rivelata vincente sia come periodo (inizio maggio e quindi clima buono e fortunatamente senza pioggia) che come lunghezza che consente con un buon programma di riuscire a vedere sicuramente tutti i monumenti e i principali musei.Merita certo una visita anche Versailles e la sua splendente Reggia.Comoda la Metro che consente di muoversi in tutta Parigi in maniera davvero conveniente e veloce. (Si consiglia il pacchetto 3 o 5 giorni per tali periodi che ripagano bene il prezzo del biglietto stesso).Parigi è semplicemente Parigi capitale europea che pur nella sua grandezza resta affascinante senza affaticarsi dei segni di una metropoli.Aperta e tranquilla anche la gente ci ha accolto col sorriso lasciandoci un piacevole ricordo.Marco&Fabry
40,“La città per gli innamorati”,"Certo, è un luogo comune, ma non c'è niente di più vero: Parigi è la città ideale per gl iinnamorati. Ad ogni angolo c'è uno scorcio suggestivo, un posto romantico, un angolo intimo. I francesi non sono campioni di simpatia, e la città è in generale cara nei prezzi, ma sia dal punto di vista artistico che da quello emotivo, consiglio sicuramente di visitare questa città."
40,“impressioni a parigi”,"Ciao a tutti, ho fatto un breve viaggio a Parigi, diciamo un regalo di compleanno alla mia dolce compagna, un ritorno dopo quasi quaranta anni. Devo dire che non ci sono stati molto cambiamenti, solo la grande Piramide al Louvre, che permette un nuovo grande accesso al museo, e direi non stona con l’ambiente circostante, rallegrato anche da fontane e giochi d’acqua. L’altra novita’, il Centro Poumpidou, una grande costruzione moderna, architettura di pali, vetri ed altre intersezioni varie. Niente di bello secondo me, utile per i servizi che offre, centro di studi, convegni, un museo, biblioteche. Insomma scompare un po’ nel centro del Marais, nei suo incorocio di strade e stradine piene di vita, locali, localetti, sempre aperti, con i loro dehors, pieni di giovani e meno giovani, a consumare pasti a qualsiasi ora del giorno. Dal tardo pomeriggio, si potevano consumare delle apericene, sempre molto accette dalla gioventu’ locale. Insomma un correre continuo di vita in questo quartiere. Davanti al mio appartamento, un locale per gay apriva tutti i giorni alle 18 e si prseguiva fino a tardi, circa le 3 / 4 della notte. Niente di particolare, non ho avuto motivi di reazione, salvo una volta ho visto due uomini baciarsi, e mi ha fatto un po’ effetto. Per il resto grande gioia e voglia di parlare ed incontrarsi. Anche per coppie eterosessuali. Ma era solo un locale, nel mare magnum dei localetti e bistrot che caratterizzano a decine tutto il quartiere. E in misura varia, anche l’intera citta’. I dehors sono una costante in tutta Parigi, strade, viali, piazzette ne sono inondati. I prezzi, purtroppo, sono abbastanza elevati, tanto da considerare Londra meno cara, ove almeno ci sono locali piu’ abbordabili, al limite anche Stoccolma ed Oslo. Comunque fanno colore e simpatia. Quello che mi ha scandalizzato, (in senso buono) e’ stata l’occupazione selvaggia di dehors della piazzetta di Montmartre, una volta regno solo di artisti, tavolozze e cavalletti. Tutto e’ rimasto delegato nelle centinaia di copie che puoi comprare nei vari negozietti per turisti. Una piccola delusione. Il resto e’rimasto invariato, una citta’ luminosa, viva, fremente. E direi anche una delle piu’ belle. La maestosita’ dei viali, giardini, grandi palazzi, i monumenti nazionali la pongono in alto, rispetto a citta’ come Londra, Bruxelles, Berlino, che vorrebbero competere in maestosita’ e bellezza, ma per me un gradino inferiori. L’organizzazione dei trasporti, la pulizia, la varieta’ di locali, negozi, mercatini, un traffico non troppo eccessivo, la rendono una citta’ molto vivibile. Solo l’alto costo della vita degrada il giudizio. Accanto a tanti lustrini, l’altra faccia della medaglia, un’ umanita’ dolente, rassegnata, incupita. La grande famiglia dei clochard, un numero molto elevato, anche di coppie, un umanita’ che vive, dorme accanto alle loro povere cose, il loro mondo povero ed umiliato, che vive accanto, o meglio sopravvive, ai margini di tanta luce, od anche dentro. Sono tanti, notte e giorno, non chiedono niente, solo una tazza davanti per una richiesta di elemosina, ed uno sguardo ormai vuoto. La politica francese credo abbia eliminato, sopportando solo alcuni suonatori ambulanti o venditori di qualche oggetto, ma non in grande numero. Ma il popolo dei clochard viene lasciato nella completa indifferenza. Altro versante, ma secondo me meno apprezzabile, la presenza di zingari che fanno la questua. Insomma una citta’ con luci ed ombre. E rappresenta anche l’eccezione, in una Francia, che nelle altre citta’. secondo me, non gode dello stesso stile di vita. Ma comunque tornando al turismo, non sto a fare l’elenco delle cose da vedere, tutti le conosciamo, almeno per sentito dire, e niente rimane inferiore alla loro fama. Parigi e’ molto grande, i servi pubblici sono ottimi, anche se cari. Un biglietto, per un solo viaggio, costa 1,70 euro. Si possono fare degli abbonamenti di uno, tre e cinque giorni. Io ho scelto il cavallo di San Francesco, anche perche’ puoi vedere molte piu’ cose, non solo monumenti ma anche vita, atteggiamenti, costumi, che in metro ti possono sfuggire. Sempre tornando alle novita’ moderne, Les Halles, il vecchio mercato, ricostruito con delle strutture moderne, che hanno completamente ucciso il vecchio spirito del mercato con una miriade di negozi moderni, che niente hanno a che fare con la vecchia visione romantica ed il suofascino. E’ come se volessero modernizzare il bazar di Istanbul, un operazione impossibile.Una nota che non si puo’ ignorare, la vecchia strada a luci rosse di Pialle, addirittura con museo erotico. Il vecchio Moulin Rouge continua a battere le sue pale. Ho visto che uno spettacolo con cena varia sui 200 euro, solo con champagne sui 120 euro, miseramente solo spettacolo, 85euro. Per chi vuole prenotarsi. Infine i traffico sulla Senna, sempre per me molto suggestivo con i grandi barconi da trasporto che la solcano nelle due direzioni. Accanto i bateaux mouche, che tanto muoche non sono piu’, grandissimi contenitori di masse di turisti seduti su centinaia di sedie come al cinema, per ammirare i monumenti dal fiume. Parigi e’ anche questo, migliaia di turisti che affollano qualsiasi posto famoso da visitare, e talvolta tolgono anche l’aria che respiri. Per fortuna Parigi e’ grande e c’e’ posto per tutti. Ma non tolgono le code ai vari monumenti e musei. Tutte le citta’ d’arte sono anche questo. Fortunatamente ai possessori di tessere museo giornaliere o altre forme viene evitata la coda, una bella iniziativa, da ampliare il piu' possibile. Insomma una grande citta', piena di musei, arte, divertimento, spettacolo.A bientot.Paolo"
40,“Jedes Jahr einmal nach Paris”,"Paris ist immer eine Reise wert.Man kann einfach nicht alles auf einmal sehen,deshalb oefters hinfahren,vorher planen was man sehen/unternehmen will.Unbedingt auf die Liste setzen Louvre,Versailles,Opera.Essen,Wein und Shopping gehoeren auch dazu.Allerdings ist Paris nicht billig,besonders wenn man Ansprueche stellt.Hotel im Zentrum auswaehlen,da Paris sehr gross und sonst weite Wege."
40,“citta dell'amore”,"sicuramente parigi è una citta affascinante, molto piacevole girare tra i vicoli e i mercatini, visitare i musei e i locali. la città e molto vivace e animata, oltre a i classici punti turistici ci sono molti angolini che vale la pena di visitare e che devono essere scoperti.consiglio a tutti di passare almeno un fine settimana in questa citta."
40,“shopping tour”,"also, mal einen tag nach paris bringt ne echtes erlebnis. morgen um 7 hinfliegen und abends um 19 uhr zurück. ca. 1 stunde flug. von charles de gaulle airport mit dem roissy bus in die stadt, echt abenteuerlich, morgens ne halbe stunde, abend 1:15 Stunde. kann man ein kaffee trinken und ein croissant in den vielen kleinen kaffees trinken und sehen wie die stadt erwacht. ein bischen shoppen in der galerie lafyette an der oper, ein blick auf den eifelturm, eine leckere quiche und ein glas wein und dann wieder zurück, das herz gefüllt"
40,“唯一印象深刻的就是香街”,"走在香街上,看着身边熙来攘往的人群,真的感觉每一个角落都是那么的时尚,周边的店铺,甜品店,咖啡馆,石子路,凯旋门....真的要再来逛逛!"
50,“La classe e l'eleganza...”,"Città sublime, ricca di fascino e storia... con i musei più belli al mondo (consiglio vivamente il D'Orsay).. allo stesso tempo la grande facilità di muoversi, con una rete metropolitana seconda forse solo a New York o Londra... si arriva da un estremo all'altro della città in pochi minuti... la sera consiglio vivamente il quartiere Saint Germain, ricco di ristorantini molto carattreistici.. come zona dove alloggiare consiglio Monmatre e Saint germain, purchè sia vicino una stazione della metropolitana.."
50,“città incantevole ed unica”,"siamo stati a Parigi con la famiglia, in 2 giorni ( un po' tirata ma si può sempre ritornare), abbiamo visitato tour eiffel, versailles, grand arc, arco dei trionfi, e sulla piazza del Louvre, ( fino a 18 anni gratuiti e studenti fino a 25), cena al quartiere latino e poi vista della torre illuminata, 2° giorno visita a notre dame e palazzo pompidou poi moulin rouge e pigalle e montmartre, poi un salto alla nuova citta della scienza e rientro"
50,“Che romanticismo”,"Sembra scontato da dire, ma davvero è la città più romantica del mondo. Una vacanza adatta per coppie più che altro per potersi gotere insieme alla propria anima gemella dei giorni all'insegna del romanticismo. Non basta senz'altro un week-end per visitarla, ma appunto ogni volta è una scoperta nuova. Oltre al conosciutissimo Louvree ci sono altri moltissimi musei che non lasceranno scontenti i propri visitatori. L'unico da sconsigliare è il museo del Romaniticismo, una vera delusione con 10 quadri e praticamente la cifra d'entrata vale un euro alla visione di uno."
50,“Metropole mit so vielen Touristen wie sonst nirgens”,"Eine Stadt, die man nicht im Eiltempo durchschreiten kann und soll. Es locken die Museum, die man je nach Interessenslage aufsucht ohne auf die Restaurants und Cafes (Betrug ist an der Tagesordung, also Vorsicht ist geboten) zu vergessen, welche eigentlich recht gut sind. Man muss unbedingt auf zentrale Lage setzen, denn das reduziert die Anstrengung des Fortbewegens erheblich."
50,“città dell'Amore”,"Sono stata in questa meravigliosa città nel 2006. Desideravo tanto andarci anche per riscontrare in concreto se le cose belle che mi avevano raccontato su questa città fossero davvero vere...e vi posso dire di si. Ho visitato diverse città, europee e non, ma nessuna mi ha lasciato una così bella sensazione..... appena sono arrivata già l'aria era diversa per non parlare dei monumenti e delle attrazioni. Se state pensando ad un viaggio romantico, non abbiate i dubbi..Parigi è la meta ideale ;-)"
40,“Internationale Sadt”,"Paris ist als touristisches Ziel sehr zu empfehlen, da es viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten bietet ob man nun kulturell interssiert ist oder sich liebe nur alte Bauten ansieht.Außerdem ist das Disneyland nicht weit entfernt und somit können auch die Kinder unterhalten werden.Paris mit dem Auto zu besuchen bietet nur den Vorteil unabhängig zu sein wenn man aus der Stadt heraus möchte. In der Stadt ist ein Auto völlig überflüssig und zudem sehr anstrengend, da dort viel chaotischer gefahren wird als in deutschen Städten."
50,“Parigi città spettacolare”,"Di ritorno da una vacanza a Parigi, dopo tanti anni che non ci mettevo piede, è semplicemente bellissima, spettacolare, credo la più bella città in Europa, una settimana non basta per riuscire a visitare tutto ciò che offre.La Tour Eiffel a piedi, la Senna, il Sacro Cuore, Notre Dame, sono solo i luoghi più famosi, ma c'è dell'altro da visitare: le catacombe, le fogne, i cimiteri, la prigione.Veramente stregata ed affascinata dalla sua bellezza."
50,“Supera la vostra immaginazione! Da favola!”,"Se non siete ancora andati a Parigi fatelo ora!E' la capitale della moda, del buon gusto, dell'arte, della cultura!Tutto è bellissimo a Parigi! Tuot il est tres jolie!La Senna, Le Marais, Notre Dame, Louvre, La Tour Effeil, Arco di Trionfo! Percorrete tutta rue Rivoli! Le Champs-Élysées! Il Mulin Rouge! Montmartre! Canal San Martin! Paris Je t'aime !"
50,“Bella ciudad”,"Debe ser sin duda, la ciudad más hermosa del planeta. Paris es monumental, imponente, imperial, majestuosa.Nos toco gente muy amable, que siempre estuvo dispuesta a orientarnos y ayudarnos, en contrario con la fama de los parisinos."
50,“Paris die Stadt der Liebe”,"Paris ist traumhaft schön. Die Menschen sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Der Eifelturm, der Louvre, der Chaunselysee, der Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame und vieles mehr. Man kann sich gar nicht satt sehen an den vielen schönen Dingen. Es gibt aber auch viele enge Gassen in denen man einfach nur einen Kaffee trinkt und dem pulsierenden Leben auf den Straßen zusieht."
40,“PARIS BY NIGHT TROP TOP!”,"Lorsque j entendais dire autour de moi que PARIS est la plus ""belle ville au monde"" je trouvais que c était un peu exagéré d autant plus que je connaissais déjà ce lieu .La semaine dernière un sejour de3jours en famille dans la capitale a été tres agreable.L hotellerie la restauration,les visites culturelles.Une surprise lors d une balade le 1er soir sur le PONT des ARTS ou un grand apero avait été organisé, j ai adoré cette ambiance ou tout le monde semblait vivre pleinement ce moment .Une grande promenade sur les bateaux mouches au coucher du soleil mémorable, le prix de cette visite touristique est justifié(11euros par pax) car une surprise nous attendait lorsque nous sommes passés devant la TOUR EIFFEL celle-ci se trouvait d un seul coup illuminée nous avons pu prendre autant de photos que nous voulions cétait tout simplement magique!!!Maintenant je fais partie de ces personnes qui disent que PARIS est un endroit exceptionnel et pourtant je suis une voyageuse de tous horizons et je peux dire que j y retournerai volontiers meme si ca peuple de monde c est tres cosmopolite et c est ce qui fait le véritable charme de cette ville majestueuse."
50,“Wunderschöne Stadt”,"Von den Parisern kann man halten was man will, aber die Stadt ist wirklich eine der schönsten in Europa. Man sollte sich aber das nötige Kleingeld einstecken, da die Preise doch, vorallem im Stadtzentrum rund um die Champs-Élysées etwas gehoben sind! Abgesehen davon ist garade dieser Teil wirklich sehenswert. Eine sehr moderne Einkaufsstrasse mit dem Louvre am einen und dem Triumphbogen am anderen Ende der Strasse. Paris ist für Museumsliebhaben ein absolutes MUSS. Wer ein bisschen weniger für die Unterkunft ausgeben will sollte eintweder früh buchen oder etwas abseits der Champs-Élysées übernachten."
40,"“Alles Alte ist gut, alles Neue schlecht”","Alles Gute an Paris ist leider aus der Vergangenheit. Sicherlich auch La Defense hat einen gewissen Charme, wie der Grand Arc usw. aber ansonsten ist es traurig zu sehen wie die Champs von Billigshops und FastFood Restaurants überschwemmt wird. Selbst in Vendome ändert sich alles zum Negativen. Von den Gestalten die man teilweise etwas außerhalb trifft und in der Metro sieht ganz zu schweigen. Schade, denn eigentlich ist Paris wirklich eine der schönsten Städte der Welt.(Hoteltipp: HR Madeleine, Hidden, Secret de Paris)."
20,“Parigi...che delusione!”,"Carissimi, sono stata a Parigi la settimana scorsa e devo dire che la città mi ha molto delusa, perciò volevo dare alcune dritte ai lettori.1) Se dovete cenare senza farvi "" spennare "" ( ricordate che sul totale del conto sarà aggiunta anche la tassa cittadina 5,5% ) recatevi al quartiere Marais...lì c'èanche un posticino che fa delle crepe dolci e salate ottime.2) Non prendete il caffè...è pessimo e costoso, ma se proprio non potete farne a meno andate alla Fayette e nello stesso piano dell'entrata, superato il reparto delle scarpe, troverete l'angolo della illy caffè: divino!3) Le attrazioni ed i musei non costano molto e se volete andare alla chante capelle e alla defense vi conviene fare il biglietto cumulativo alla defense ( si risparmiano € 8,00 ).4) Per non trovare la mega fila ai musei andate all'orario di apertura e non alla pausa pranzo; e per la tour effeil la sera verso le 21.5) attenzione per i souvenir conviene comprarli vicino a notre dame in una viuzza dove ci son solo negozi di souvenir ad 1/4 rispetto che in altre zone di Parigi."
50,“パリのカフェ”,パリのカフェはどこも素敵です。特にオープンカフェがお勧めですが、私が行った昨年の８月中旬は低温で、ちょっと寒い思いをしつつ利用しました。どこで食べた食事も満足。さすがパリだなぁと思いました。
50,“eine Weltstadt mit allem”,"Paris kennt fast jeder. Es ist die Stadt der Mode, des guten Essens, der Museen und Sehenswürdigkeiten. Mehrere Dinge hier sind Muss: der Eifelturm, der Louvre, der Montmartre. Es lohnt sich aber nur bummeln und beobachten. Die französische Lebensweise, die Ruhe, der Genuss der Zeit und des Seins.Ich empfehle die Aussicht vom Hochhaus Tour de Montparnassseund den Besuch des Museums d´Orsay."
50,“Incantevole!”,"Ecco una città dove ci si può andare quante volte si vuole senza mai pentirsi di esserci tornati ! Affascinante, romantica, piena di posti stupendi da visitare, deliziosa !!!"
50,“巴黎游”,这次感觉总体还是不错的，认识了很多朋友，还有很多美女。也吃了很多好吃了。感受到了法国的浪漫色彩，总体还是很满意
20,"“Parigi, cosi cosi”","La Parigi vista nei film o letta nei libri non esiste, e' in realta' piu' una citta' come Milano. I parigini non esistono, la citta' e' turisticamente disorganizzata, un po' sporca, e sicuramente costosissima per i turisti. Potrebbe essere molto migliore! Una nota poi sui ristoranti e locali notturni: in centro abbiamo faticato per trovare un ristorante che servisse dopo le 20.30 di sera, e alla fine ci siamo dovuti accontentare di un pessimo fast food. La sera poi discoteche e bar come intendiamo noi non ce ne sono."
50,“París bien vale una misa”,"“París bien vale una misa” (Enrique IV) ¿Por donde empezar? ¿Qué decir? Pues París, como Roma o Londres tiene para un mes o más... Yo estuve cinco días y no paré. Como no quiero ir enumerando todo lo que vi (Y debéis ver), y repetir lo que todos decimos, os contaré lo que yo os recomiendo.Podría decirlos que subáis a la Torre Eiffel (Por favor, subir hasta arriba. Ya que habéis llegado hasta aquí, no os quedéis en la base y mucho menos seáis rácanos con el dinero...), visitar el Sagrado Corazón, “perder” una mañana en el Louvre, o visitar Notre Dame. Todo eso está muy bien y hacerlo pero... yo me quedo con cinco cosas inexcusables: Subir andando al Arco del Triunfo y disfrutar de las vistas (Campos Elíseos, Torre Effiel, la City,...), callejear por Montparnasse, visitar el Museo de Orsay (A mi me encanta el impresionismo), navegar por el Sena (Bien sea de día o de noche) y cenar por el Barrio Latino en cualquiera de los pequeños restaurantes que lo llenan. Como veis no os cuento nada que no se sepa para a veces “el árbol no nos deja ver el bosque”...Mi visita fue en julio y el tiempo no dista mucho del que tenemos en España. Si te gusta andar puedes moverte bien por el “centro”, pero según tu ubicación y lo que quieras visitar (Un ejemplo puede ser el Sagrado Corazón) el metro es la solución ideal. No disfruté demasiado de la comida francesa pero los tópicos no fallan. No os vayáis sin probar una crepe en el barrio Latino cerca de Notre Dame. Aprovechar... ¡¡Buen viaje!!"
20,“巴黎很美，法国人很差劲”,花都巴黎有众多景点，埃菲尔铁塔，卢浮宫，凯旋门，巴黎圣母院，圣心大教堂，蓬皮杜艺术中心等等。巴黎有众多的餐厅，咖啡馆和酒吧。厨师手艺精湛，牛排，鹅肝美味。地铁四通八达。巴黎有太多值得回味的东西，但是法国人的傲慢无礼，自大狂傲也让人对这个国家和这座城市有了几分怯意，如果当我再次计划我的旅行行程的话，我一定绕过法国，世界这么大，漂亮的，美好的事物不单只有法国有。没有必要飞12个小时过去，让人轻视。
40,“ANTICO E MODERNO NELLA VILLE LUMIERE”,"E’ difficile recensire Parigi: le dimensioni spaziali e storiche di questa celebre metropoli sono infatti imponenti.Con circa 10 milioni di abitanti l’area metropolitana Parigina è, assieme a Londra, la più grande della Comunità Europea, e, aggiungendo Mosca al gruppo, la più grande dell’intero continente europeo (tutte e tre le metropoli hanno infatti una dimensione demografica dell’intero agglomerato urbano stimata tra i 10 e gli 11 milioni di abitanti).La regione di cui fa parte, L’Ile de France, della quale assorbe la quasi totalità della popolazione, è tra le quattro più produttive d’Europa.Parigi non è antica come Atene o Roma, ma contiene, in termini artistici ed architettonici, il più vasto e variegato patrimonio europeo: dall’alto medioevo alle tendenze più recenti ogni stile è ampiamente rappresentato.Se la Capitale Francese continua ad essere una delle primissime (spesso la prima in assoluto) città al mondo per turismo è senza dubbio perché non ha riposato sugli allori del pur sbalorditivo patrimonio passato, ma ha saputo reinventarsi e lanciarsi con coraggio ed audacia nella modernizzazione architettonica, imponendo anche al tessuto urbano contrasti di scala e di stile eclatanti ma quasi sempre riusciti e sempre apprezzati dal pubblico mondiale, con buona pace dei nostrani ultraconservatori architettonici, che in ossequio al “rispetto delle preesistenze” bocciano grandiosi progetti dei principali architetti mondiali imponendo la continuità morfologica e dimensionale anche con mediocri cascine o dozzinali edifici distanti magari un chilometro e presenti, purtroppo, in quantità sul suolo nazionale (oggi fortunatamente questa tendenza oscurantista sta cambiando anche in Italia, specie a Milano).A Parigi l’auto (sia essa privata o taxi) è un oggetto inutile: la rete di trasporto pubblico è una delle migliori del mondo per estensione, capillarità, rapidità, efficienza. 14 linee di metropolitana per oltre 215 km di rete: nessun punto di Parigi città dista più di 500 metri da una stazione della metropolitana e spesso molto meno; la copertura è totale.In effetti la Municipalità di Parigi, che corrisponde anche al Dipartimento, è molto poco estesa: appena 105 km compresi entro il Boulevard Peripherique con l’aggiunta dei grandi parchi urbani Bois de Boulogne e Bois de Vincennes. Entro questo perimetro vivono poco più di due milioni di persone, gli altri otto sono nella Banlieue, l’hinterland di Parigi, che non contiene solo le residenze middle-class, aeroporti, industrie e ghetti urbani ma anche il centro direzionale della Défense, la Reggia di Versailles ed il nuovo stadio di Saint Denis, dove la Francia si laureò campione del mondo nel 1998.Alcune linee di metropolitana si estendono nella “Petite Couronne” cerchia interna della Banlieue attorno a Parigi Città, ma per girare la grande Parigi conviene la RER, rete di treni suburbani molto ramificata ed efficiente, che entro Parigi città funge da metropolitana espressa.In ogni caso i trasporti su ferro sono sempre l’alternativa più rapida ed efficiente, oltrechè tra le più economiche per girare Parigi, il taxi può occasionalmente servire solo a notte fonda (quando molti mezzi si fermano ed alcune zone della città non sono del tutto sicure: a Parigi città si gira abbastanza tranquillamente anche di notte, meno però che nelle metropoli tedesche o scandinave).Anche per gli spostamenti da e per l’aeroporto conviene sempre il treno, sotto qualsiasi punto di vista, compreso quello dei tempi d’attesa e della sicurezza: i collegamenti sono talmente fitti che l’attesa è inferiore a quella per i taxi, sui quali a volte ci si può imbattere in autisti particolarmente sgarbati nei modi e spericolati nella guida.Parigi è poi nodo primario dell’alta velocità ferroviaria così come delle ferrovie tradizionali si ché, in giornata, è possibile raggiungere tanto interessanti città francesi sito di meravigliose cattedrali gotiche (spettacolare l’incompiuta Beauvais) tanto metropoli Francesi ed Europee come Lille, Lione, Bruxelles e Londra, quest’ultima in 2 ore, centro-centro no-stop (Gare du Nord – St. Pancras Station).Parigi dispone di due aeroporti civili il Charles De Gaulle, hub di Air France e Orly, scalo secondario charter e Low Cost.Il primo è l’approdo più conveniente e tra i più celebri scali del mondo, secondo in Europa per traffico dopo Heathrow. Va detto però che è anche il più saturo e congestionato, anche a causa dell’accentratissimo network di Air France e che, a dispetto dell’innegabile grandiosità architettonica e dell’eccellente collegamento con la città e con altre metropoli europee via alta velocità ferroviaria, è uno scalo piuttosto inefficiente e caotico per gli standard occidentali, dove nulla è più facile che perdere una coincidenza, o il proprio bagaglio.Tre consigli per evitare ogni problema: non usarlo mai come aeroporto di connessione, volare a Parigi scartando Air France e Alitalia optando piuttosto per Lufthansa Italia da Milano Malpensa o Easyjet anche da altre città italiane oppure, nel caso non vogliate seguire il secondo, di viaggiare possibilmente con solo bagaglio a mano. Se invece non seguirete il primo, ve la sarete proprio andati a cercare.Un altro aspetto negativo – a fronte dei tanti positivi – di Parigi è l’eccessivo nazionalismo diffuso, che se da un lato ha contribuito a rafforzare un orgoglio nazionale meritato e concretizzatosi nella celebrata grandeur, dall’altro ha determinato aspetti partici poco piacevoli per turisti e visitatori: il ricorrente rifiuto di usare l’inglese anche quando conosciuto, l’atteggiamento snobista, un certo protezionismo economico e culturale che va a detrimento del rango internazionale della città."
40,“Eine Reise wert - selbst für ein paar Stunden!”,"Wir waren mit Verwandten aus USA einen Tag in Paris - 3 Erwachsene, 3 Kinder. Morgens um 6 mit dem Thalys von Köln nach Paris, Metro zu Notre-Dame, weiter zum Eiffelturm, mit reservierten Tickets ganz nach oben, den Ausblick geniessen, nett in einem Bistro speisen, zu Fuss zum Louvre entlang der Seine, abends wieder mit dem Zug zurück. Sicherlich bei weitem nicht ausreichend, um Paris in ganzer Schönheit zu geniessen (wem gelingt das schon?), aber alles in allem ein schöner erster Eindruck und durchaus bezahlbar, wenn man u.a. die Tickets für den Thalys früh genug kauft. Es war zwar März, wolkig und windig, aber selbst dann versprüht die Stadt des Lichts ihren besonderen Charme!"
50,“Una Parigi da scoprire”,"Parigi, in sé, non ha bisogno certo di altre recensioni, ma io vorrei segnalare un luogo preciso, forse poco conosciuto. Partendo da place de la Bastille, nei pressi della Gare de Lyon, c'era una strada ferrata, credo nel passato occupata da una vecchia linea della matropolitana. La strada è collocata in alto rispetto al viale soottostante,: a Parigi, invece di lasciarla per anni in rovina, hanno fatto di questa ex ferrovia la ""promenade plantée"", cioè la passeggiata tra le piante. Appare come un viale circondato di alberi, che si estende per più di un chilometro, collocata in alto rispetto ai palazz,i per cui è al livello degli ultimi piani. Una vera chicca, completata dal ""Viaduc des arts"", costituito da grandi archi, posti sotto la promenade, occupati da vari piccoli deliziosi negozi di prodotti artigianali e botteghe antiquarie. Da scoprire in una città dove pare , erratamente, che sia stato già scoperto tutto!"
20,“Paris ist nicht mehr mein Ding.”,Paris ist so eine schöne Stadt! Leider habe ich aber schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht. Ich wahr mit dem Bus da und habe leider verschlafen. O.K. meine Schuld. Ich bin dann vom Süd Paris nach Nord Paris (Montmartre) gelaufen. Ich hatte nur eine kleine Karte vom Hotel. Leider wollten die Franzosen kein Deutsch oder Englisch sprechen. Bin bischen enttäuscht. Nur Touristen haben mir geholfen. Und ich dachte immer Englisch ist die Weltsprache.
50,“Kulturparadies”,"Die Reise verlief ohne Schwierigkeiten via Flughafen Charles de Gaulle und der Metro. Unser Hotel war das Best Western Montcalm mit einem spitzen Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Die Lage war ebenfalls super, direkt neben einer Metro-Station.Da es so viele Sehenswürdigkeiten in Paris gibt, waren wir ganztägig immer unterwegs. Die Höhepunkte waren, wie könnte es anders sein, ein Besuch des Eiffelturms, sowie der Sacre Coeur. Weiters sahen wir uns einen 3D-Film im Geode an, was ebenso toll war. Das Louvre war sehr überlaufen mit Menschen und konnte mich daher nicht so überzeugen.Schließlich machten wir noch einen Ausflug zum Schloss Versailles. Da das Wetter perfekt war, waren vor allem die riesigen Gartenanlagen wunderschön zu erkunden."
30,“piccoli consigli per Parigi”,"Udine 13/03/2011.Lo scorso fine settimana sono stata con la mia famiglia a Parigi volando con air france da Lubiana ed è stata veramente un' ottima esperienza e una buona qualità- prezzo. Abbiamo visitato quasi tutti i monumenti ed il museo del Louvre. Essendo la prima domenica del mese l'entrata era gratis.La coda era di due ora ma abbiamo avuto la fortuna di essere indirizzati in un'altra porta (Porte des Lions) dove in dieci minuti siamo entrati.La sera, per la cena, ci recavamo nei bistrot a montmatre, molto caratteristici e a buon prezzo. Abbiamo alloggiato all'Eden Montmatre perchè ci piaceva la zona, molto ben servita sia come negozi che come mezzi di trasporto (metro,bus e poi c'era il montmatrebus che fa veramente un comodo tragitto).Abbiamo scelto questo hotel anche perchè era compresa la colazione cosa che a Parigi in pochi la danno.Per quanto riguarda Disneyland avevamo preso i biglietti on line sul sito billet francilien e siamo entrati ai tornelli ( non serve passare in cassa) senza nessun problema.Abbiamo fatto anche il fastpass con il codice a barre del biglietto che avevamo stampato noi a casa."

50,“Perfekt”,Paris als Hauptstadt Frankreichs bietet eine Vielzahl von exzellenten kulturellen Möglichkeiten. Neben den Museen gibt es noch tolle Kirchen zu besichtigen. Und die Lebensart und das hervorragende Essen sind auch sehr hervorzuheben. Das Flair in den Künstlervierteln ist wirklich beeindruckend. Auch ein Ausflug nach Saint Denis und Versailles rentiert sich unbedingt.
50,“parigi è sempre parigi...”,"parigi è sempre un'esperienza eccezionale.io la amo alla follia.sono stata diverse volte e non mi stufo mai di vederla.ogni volta vado al louvre,a notre dame,alla reggia di versailles(consiglio a tutti di camminare una bella oretta nei giardini e di andare a vedere il""mulino della regina""con il piccolo villaggio),a mangiare cervello e lumake e a fare la ""[--]""(passatemi il termine)nel mega negozio di vuitton..stavolta però,dato ke c'andavo con mio marito e mia figlia di 6anni abbiamo deciso di fare una piccola follia e di andare al moulin rouge..ke serata stre-pi-to-sa!!si è divertita pure mia figlia rimasta impressionata da tutta quella musica,dai colori e dai balletti esileranti e mai volgari.ci tornerei adesso!per il resto parigi è sempre la stessa,forse un po'più sporca e più multietnica..comunque sicura:noi abbiamo viaggiatyo tranquillamente in metrò anke di notte senza mai avere nemmeno il sentore di nn essere al sicuro..ovviamente la consiglio a tutti,si respira un'aria diversa a parigi.un piccolo consiglio:dormite fuori dal centro(dove ci sono le principali cose di interesse turistico),tanto c'è la metro ke vi porta in poco tempo ovunque.in centro vi spennano!"
50,“meravigliosa Parigi”,"Parigi affascinante città, come dimenticare la tour Eiffel che vi da la possibilità di ammirare dall'alto la città è un'esperienza da togliere il fiato, camminare sulle champs elysèes i tantissimi mercatini delle pulci , Mom Martre dove potete farvi fare dai numerosi artisti un vostro ritratto, il Louvre famoso museo da vedere, e come tralasciare Versailles la fastosa reggia e i suoi magnifici giardini punteggiati da aiuole boschetti , bacini d'acqua e sculture.Per chi ama invece l'arte contemporanea non dovete tralasciare il centro Pompidou."
50,“LA TORRE EIFFEL NON E' PARIGI”,"con mia moglie siamo stati 4 giorni a parigi partenza da torino con il TGV, opzione direi perfetta rispetto all'aereo, perchè arrivi in centro città in poco più di 5 ore a gare de lyon dove abbiamo anche pernottato in un NOVOTEL a 2 passi dalla stazione centrale, opzione anche questa perfettà perchè a fine vacanza avevamo il tgv nel primo pomeriggio e questo ci ha permesso di alzarci con tutto comodo, fare colazione e andare a piede alla stazione senza cadere nella confusione della metropolitana. i nostri 4 giorni sono stati fantastici, perchè come tutti i nostri viaggi il mezzo preferito di spostamento sono le nostre gambe, semplicemente per un fatto di sentirsi parte integrante della città, e così abbiamo visto in lungo e in largo ogni singolo scorcio di PARIGI,, una città semplicemente unica, una città riccà di fascino storico e moderno insieme, tante sono le cose che ci sono piaciute, sicuramente il nostro punto preferito è la BASILICA DEL SACRO CUORE, da li il nostro cuore si è aperto e si è abbandonato in un orizzonte meraviglioso, oltre la basilica è bella tutta la zona fatta di localini tipici francesi dove bere un PASTIS a qualunque ora senza sentirsi le solite battutte AH SIETE ITALIANI!!!che in molti posti ci facevano per il solito nazionalismo francese, ma a parte questo, meraviglioso anche la zona di NOTRE DAME, mai quanto il SACRO CUORE, ma ne vale la pena, ma a me personalmente invece ho trovato di CATTIVO gusto la TORRE EIFFEL, bello il parco intorno, belli i giardini di mars, belli i monumenti intorno, bello il quartiere, ma questo monumento messo in questa città dal mio punto di vista è di cattivo gusto, si la gente in coda per andare su in alto, e poi si uno SKYLINE bello, ma il monumento è tristissimo, questo ferro che si incrocia , con intorno una città ricca di storia dal mio punto di vista stona...sarò atipico, ma PARIGI per me non è la TORRE EIFFEL, anzi sono le vie dove si è fatta la rivoluzione, le vie dove Coco ha fatto la sua rivoluzione della moda, le vie dove un QUARTIERE intero prende il nome dai suoi abitanti QUARTIERE LATINO, le vie che portano alla reggia più famosa del mondo, le vie dove i poeti compevano e i pittori dipingevano...PARIGI E' QUESTA MA NON LA TORRE EIFFEL"
10,“paris une belle ville mais vraiment désagréable!!!”,"La tour Eiffel le Louvre etc...c'est géniale mais franchement pour le reste c'est nul!!!les rues c'est des dépotoirs,les gens sont presque tous mal polie!!!il pleut les 3/4 du temps!c'est tellement pollué qu'on a l'impression d'avoir de l'enduit sur le visage!!! le personnel de certain restaurant ou boutique chic sont souvent prétentieux et pensent qu'au pourboire en revanche la nourriture est bonne dans cette ville!!!en sortis de ville c'est les bouchons pendant 3 heures!!!! pfff franchement la capitale touristique mondiale il est temps qu'elle s'améliore!!!!"
50,"“Paris, la ville lumière”","Parigi, la pronuncia del solo nome fa già innamorare! Ci sono stato parecchie volte, ed è sempre una scoperta dopo l'altra. Città metropoli dalle innumerevoli sfaccettature, ricca ricchissima di storia, arte, cultura, musei e l'incantevole tour Eiffel (consiglio di visitarla prima di notte e poi di giorno, + affascinante!).I suoi quartieri multietnici, multiculturali, luogo d'incontri.La Défance, Le louvre, Le Sacré Coeur, Les Champs Elysées, Trocadéro, San Michel, Quartier Latin, ... sono troppo i luoghi da visitare!!!Il servizio Metro è super comodo e operativo. Porta ovunque.2 maggiori aeroporti servono la città: Roissy CDG e Orly perfettamente collegati.Buon viaggio!"
40,“Parigi nel cuore”,"Parigi, che dire meravigliosa. Ci siamo stati per due anni di fila e non siamo riusciti a vedere tutto tanto è grande e tanto c'è da vedere. Nel 2009 abbiamo visto i monumenti principali, tour Eiffel, Montmatre. Notre Dame, Louvre non tutto è impossibile, tour montparnasse. Nel 2010 abbiamo visto le cose meno principali ma non meno importanti. comunque un consiglio scarpe comode e gambe allenate."
50,“La capitale della cultura e dell'amore”,"Parigi, ha tutte le caratteristiche per abbagliare i suoi visitatori: la bellezza delle opere d'arte, la maestosità delle sue ""rue"", la delizia delle sue gastronomie..da dove incominciare?Il solo elenco delle sue meraviglie può bastare: Tour Eiffel, Arco di Trionfo,Champs-Élysées, Louvre,Sacré-Cœur, Panthéon, Notre Dame, Jardin du Luxembourg..etc etc.Ma soprattutto è una città che si lascia visitare, grazie ai suoi piu che efficenti mezzi di trasporto. La ""metrò"" è indispensabile per qualsiasi turista che vuol conoscere a fondo la capitale francese.Parigi non è solo una grande metropoli europea. Conserva ancora i suoi caratteristici e incantevoli bar dove poter sorseggiare un caffè in compagnia di un buon libro.E' una città affascinante, magica ed intrigante, a portata di tutti.Meta perfetta per una vacanza romantica."
50,“Die ästhetischste Stadt Europas”,"Wir waren mit unseren drei jugendlichen Kindern für 4 Tage im Oktober in Paris. Anfahrt mit ICE/TGV, was uns die teuren Autobahn- und Parkgebühren sparte. Wir hatten ein Appartement in einem schicken Stadthaus im 8.Arrondissement, in Fußnähe zum Elysee Palast gemietet. Alle öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel standen uns vor der Tür zur Verfügung. Wir waren unabhängig von guten, aber für eine Großfamilie teuren Pariser Restaurants und nutzen Bäcker und Supermarkt um die Ecke. Da uns nur 4 tage zur Verfügung standen, war es uns wichtig, ersteinmal die Pariser Atmosphäre zu erfahren, zu erwandern. Wir durchschlenderten das Marais, Quartier Latin, St.Germain, Ile de la Cité etc. und machten immer wieder Pause in kleinen Cafes oder den vielen Parks der Stadt.Freitag Abends sind alle Museen der Stadt für junge Leute bis 21 Jahren gratis, was unsere Kinder nutzten und den Louvre besuchten.Die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel, wie Metro und die Busse sind mithilfe von 10er Karten ein sehr gutes und günstiges Verkehrsmittel, um Paris auch in den äußeren Bezirken zu erkunden. Nach einiger Zeit durchschaut man auch das Tunnelgewirr der Metro, wenn man darauf achtet, dass man die Endstation seiner Linie weiss.Der Herbst bietet sich als Reisezeit sehr an, da das viele Laufen bei großer Hitze zu anstrengend ist. Draussen sitzen vor den Cafes wird durch viele Heizpilze trotzdem möglich.Es waren 4 aufregende Tage, die uns überzeugten, wieder nach Paris zu fahren und diesmal gezielt die vielen Museen der Stadt zu besuchen."
30,“Parigi...in tre giorni.”,"...direi ""nella media""!Città molto bella ma sporca, ad ogni angolo urina sui muri e spazzatura a terra. I Parigini con la ""puzza sotto il naso"" in tutti i sensi!Ma non solo cose negative, infatti abbiamo trascorso 3 notti a Parigi e le sue meraviglie storiche ci hanno confortato.Giro su bus turistico per una introduzione alla storia e ai monumenti/palazzi da visitare.Torre Eiffel maestosa! Ascensore dopo coda di un paio d'ore ma ne è valsa a pena, una vista su tutta la città difficile da ritrovare se non al Sacre Coeur in Montmartre ma da tutt'altro punto di vista.Metrò e taxi non sono costosi.Da fare assolutamente una serata al Moulin Rouge! Abbiamo prenotato (obbligatorio) sul sito dall'Italia. Fantastico! Una serata ""di gala"" in un ambiente molto chick, champagne a tavolo e splendide donne sul palco!Musei..c'è l'imbarazzo della scelta. Il Louvre è stata la nostra scelta per motivi di tempo, le code sono molto lunghe per entrare (dipende dal periodo) e la Monnalisa DEVE essere ammirata!"
40,“Parigi è sempre Parigi”,"Parigi è fantastica, la tour Eiffel, Notre Dame, la Senna, il Louvre, les Champs Elisee... è una città d'arte che di sera si illumina per donare un fascino unico!"
20,“Parigi con la neve e' ancora più bella”,"Mi sono recata a parigi con un'amica nel periodo dell'immacolata .Siamo giunte all'aereoporto dopo un'abbondante nevicata, le strade erano impraticabili, non funzianova alcun mezzo di superficie e l'ultima metro per il centro partiva a mezzanotte, la sucessiva alle 5 del mattino.Se non prendevamo quella metro saremmo rimaste al freddo ed al gelo in aereoporto. Ma poi giunte in centro come avremmo raggiunto l'Hotel? I taxi non circolavano le strade erano ghiacciate....Sembrava cominciato un incubo e non una vacanza.Dopo una colletta di spiccioli siamo riuscite a fare i biglietti della metro per l'ultima corsa,... ( se non hai monete non riesci ad acquistare i biglietti ai distributori automatici, le biglietterie sono chiuse!!!).Dopo circa un'ora di attesa parte la metro e ci porta in centro in poco meno di un'ora.Sono circa le due di notte siamo in centro le strade sono impraticabili i taxi...neanche a pagarli a peso d'oro, telefoniamo all'hotel ma non possono aiutarci.....l'unico conforto è che per strada ci sono centinaia di turisti con valige al seguito che cercano di giugere a destinazione....è il caos ma...mal comune mezzo gaudio...così vien fuori anche qualche risata e finalmente passa qualche taxi e così circa alle tre giungiamo in albergo.La mia amica è un pò pentita di aver scelto parigi... troppa disorganizzazione... forse stiamo meglio in Italia nonostante tutto!Comunque all'indomani ci si sveglia in una parigi semplicemente meravigliosa la neve colpita dal sole fa risplendere palazzi e giardini, il traffico è lento e le strade ancora ghiacciate ma camminando con un pò di prudenza ti accorgi che puoi percorrere le stradi di parigi e che per un giorno la città è tutta tua.I panorami sono mozza fiato con il sole che si riflette nella neve, anche mont matre assume una veste diversa....E' inutile soffermarsi sul resto, chi non conosce almeno di nome le attrazioni della capitale francese!Il giorno dopo infatti sì è tornati lentamente alla normalità e, quindi, a passeggiore lungo la senna in un'atmosfera natalizia con addobbi semplici ma di grande effetto...il resto scopritelo da soli. buon viaggio"

40,"“Nett bei schönem Wetter, aber unglaublich teuer!”","Paris ist der Klassiker für Städtereisen, nur man muss als Student damit rechnen, hier arm zu werden. Ein standard fast food Abendessen (Pizza oder Chinese) kostet mit getränk über 10 Euro, die Metro vpm Flugplatz fast 7 Euro. Ein Schnäppchen ist der Eiffelturm, wenn man per Treppe hochgeht. Knapp 5 Euro Eintritt und ein hervorragendes Erlebnis beim hochklettern, man darf bis zur 2. Etage hoch, was einem schon einen hervorragenden Blick über die Stadt bietet. Leider war an dem Wochenende wo ich da war schlechtes Wetter, viel Programm war da nicht möglich - ideal aber für Museumsbesuche. Ich empfehle den Kauf einer Mehrfahrtenkarte der Metro, mit der Metro kommt man wirklich überall hin."
50,“Stadt der blendenden Lichter”,"Paris ist eine Stadt wie keine zweite. Sie besticht bei jedem Wetter Ihre Besucher mit Ihrem unglaublichen Charme.Egal in welches arrondissement man sich sein Hotel sucht es hat immer etwas Besonderes. Für einen Reinen Städte Trip empfehle ich in den Bereichen von 1 (Insel) bis 3 ein Hotel zu suchen, da es einfach wesentlich näher an den Sehenswürdigkeiten liegt und sehr sehr Zentrumsnah ist. Für längere Aufenthalte lohnt es sich auch preislich etwas außerhalb der direkten Innenstadt zu suchen. Erstens gibt es dort wunderschöne Hotels und man hat die Möglichkeit schon auf den Weg in die Innenstadt oder was auch immer die Facettenreiche Stadt zu sehen. Denn Paris ist nicht nur die Champs Elysée und es lohnt sich die Stadt kennenzulernen. Nicht jeder Bezirk ist wunderschön und verstreut Charme aber jeder ist auf seine Weise Sehenswert und ein Teil von Paris."
50,“top metropole europas”,"paris, eine der top metropolen europas, die man jedenfalls besucht haben sollte, bietet vor allem für kunst- und kulturliebhaber enorm viel! aus kunsthistorischer sicht wunderschöne gebäude, kirchen und paläste reihen sich neben den wahrzeichen eiffelturm und mont martre wie auch den unzähligen museen wie louvre oder centre beaubourg oder dem picasso museum ein. ein spaziergang an der seine inklusive besichtigung des flohmarktes oder bummeln im quartier latin gehören ebenso zum pflichtprogramm."
40,“paris - immer eine reise wert”,"paris ist eine stadt mit vielen tollen sehenswürdigkeiten, die alle serh gut und einfacht mit der metro erreichbar sind. sacre coeur auf dem hügel in montmartre oder notre dame. eine fahrt auf den eiffelturm lohnt wegen des faszinierenden ausblicks. aber auch ein spaziergang an der seine entlang der brücken kann interessant sein. im louvre waren wir leider nicht. auch den obelisk von luxor auf der place de la concorde sollte man nicht auslassen."
50,“Unter den Top 5 der Weltstädte - immer wieder eine Reise wert”,"Auch Paris gehört zu meinen persönlichen Top 5 in der Welt. Die Stadt mit ihrer unbeschreiblich schönen Bausubstanz, vielen alten Fassaden und grossen Herrenhäusern, dann im Gegensatz das ultramoderne La Defense mit einer Bürostadt aus der Retorte, beeindruckend gleichermassen und auch einen Tagesausflug wert. Neben den traditionellen Touristenattraktionen wie Eiffelturm , Champs Elysees, Arc de Triophme oder Louvre gibt es in Paris so viele tolle Stadtviertel und weniger bekannte kulturelle Dinge zu entdecken, dass es immer wieder eine Reise wert ist, bei der man auch immer wieder Neues entdecken kann. Eines meiner persönlichen Highlights immer wieder am frühen Abend vom Sacre Coeur über die Stadt blicken und einfach nur bei einem Kaffee geniessen."
50,“Ideal auch für ein Wochenende”,"Ich war zusammen mit meiner Freundin für ein Wochenende in Pairs. Dank excellenter Direkt-Flugverbindungen aus Deutschland bietet sich Paris auch für einen Kurztrip an. Um Restaurant-Kosten zu sparen, haben wir uns in einem Lebensmittelgeschäft mit Essen und Trinken versorgt und das Abendessen romantisch auf einer Parkbank zu uns genommen."
50,"“Parigi... una città di classe, quasi sempre”","Non è la prima volta che viaggio a Parigi, per cui la conosco molto bene.Questa volta accompagnavo una persona che la vedeva per la prima volta, per cui ho vissuto con lei gli ""spotlight"" più importanti della città e analizzato i pro e i contro.Tra i pro sicuramente l'attenzione per i particolari, dai negozi con vetrine molto curate, alle botteghe artigiane con spesso piccoli oggetti che avrei voluto avere a casa; dai venditori dei prodotti gastronomici che sanno decantare come pochi al mondo le bontà del loro Paese (formaggi su tutti) ai monumenti da visitare, curati, tenuti bene e con molte informazioni in varie lingue per i turisti.La cucina è ottima, peccato non sempre economica, ma in ogni via ci sono possibilità di scelte tra brasserie, bar e ristoranti. Tantissime ostriche e frutti di mare, ma foie gras, formaggi e vino sono le tre essenze della cucina francese. Da provare e gustare.I contro... l'atavico amor proprio del francese medio (la grandeur), la sporcizia per le strade (mai visti tanti escrementi di animali sui marciapiedi) e i costi (un cappuccino a 5,8 euro a un tavolino di un piccolo bar è un insulto al momento storico che stiamo vivendo).Da visitare, non solo una volta, ma sempre quando si ha un'occasione per tornarci."
50,"“Parigi, città affascinante”","Tutti dicono che Parigi è una città bellissima, romantica e dopo esserci stato anche io non posso fare altro che confermare quanto detto. In effetti è una città ricchissima di storia e di fascinio, camminando per le sue vie si scoprono scorci incantati e molto suggestivi ideali per essere immortalati da una fotografia. Che dire poi della Tour Eiffel, senza dubbio il simbolo della città, vero capolavoro di ingegneria costruita nel 1889 in occasione dell'Esposizone Universale. Altro luogo da visitare è il Museo del Louvre ricchissimo di reperti archeologici e di preziosissimi dipinti come La Gioconda di Leonardo da Vinci (molto bella anche la piramide di vetro che funge da ingresso principale del museo).Insomma Parigi è un'ottima meta sia per chi cerca un week end romantico e sia per chi vuole visitare una città che offre moltissimo da un punto di vista culturale con tanti musei, mostre."
50,“パリの地下鉄ではコインが絶対必要”,ツアー以外で始めてパリに行きました。はじめの自分で乗るパリの地下鉄では、コインが無いばかりに、自動販売機で悪戦苦闘し、後ろで待っている人たちにかなり迷惑をかけてしまいましたが、フランス人は慣れているようで、意に介さないように待っていてくれました。まず、旅行中自動販売機で紙幣の使えるものは発見できませんでした。また、日本発行のクレジットカードは使用できませんでした。1ユーロコイン、50、20セントコインは必需品です。ちなみに、パリの多くの地下鉄の駅には、インフォメーションがあり中に駅員さんがいますが、紙幣の両替や切符の買い方のアドバイスは一切してくれません。何のためにりるのかよくわかりませんでしたが、そこがまたフランス流でよいのかもしれませんね。なお、現在のパリに地下鉄の乗車券の料金は、1ユーロ70セントですが、自動販売機で2人分を買うと表示は3ユーロ40セントと出て、その金額を投入すると、実際に必要な料金は3ユーロ22セントでおつりが出てきました。この理由もよくわかりませんでした。
40,“バスがお勧め”,久々に訪れたパリ。前回はサンジェルマンデプレの近くに滞在しましたが、今回はオペラ座の近くに。毎日デパートの食料品売り場で買い物をしました。前回の反省により今回は地下鉄を使わず、バスだけで移動。車窓からの景色を眺めるだけでも楽しくて、正解だったと思います。乗り継ぎを前もって予習しておけば、バス移動がお勧めです。日程と予算の都合上2泊しかできなかったのが残念です。
40,“Splendida vacanza”,Ottima Vacanza in quattro giorni siamo riusciti a visitare tutte le maggiri attrazioni e centri turistici di Parigi. Posizione perfetta presso Louvre.
50,“Un museo di Capitale”,"Parigi, ottobre 2010, Hotel terminus Orleansabbiamo soggiornato per 5 notti, Hotel pulito, camera spaziosa, anche il bagno comodissimo, Personale gentile, posizione ottima a pochi metri dalla Metro ""Porte d'Orleans"" ...... una bellissima vacanza consiglio quest'Hotel a tutti e se dovessi ritornare nella bella Paris andrei nuovamente nello stesso Hotel"
40,"“ah, la francia!”","da qualche anno mancavo da parigi e forse per questo ho potuto apprezzarla ancora di più: vivace, tanto fermento nel mondo dell' arte e del design, locali nuovi,tanta gente nei bar (non solo turisti), trasporti pubblici che funzionano e dove tutti pagano il biglietto....proprio come nelle nostre città.non vedo l'ora di tornarci."
50,“La mia città preferita”,"Parigi...che dire. E' davvero la città più romantica in assoluto. Di sera, camminare sul lungo Senna, sui suoi magnifici ponti, illuminati dalla luna e con le mille luci della Torre Eiffel come sfondo farebbero diventare romantico anche un carciofo!Parigi è una capitale molto attenta ai turisti, li coccola ed offre molte possibilità di trascorrere una vacanza indimenticabile. Provate uno dei tanti ristorantini del Quartiere Latino o per stupire, una cenetta intima con vista, su di uno dei bateaux che fanno il giro della città passando sulla Senna. Inoltre, interessantissimi musei faranno felici gli appassionati d'arte. E che dire della collina di Montmartre con la sua Basilica del Sacro Cuore. Da li si può ammirare uno stupendo panorama di Parigi. Nei paraggi v'è la Place du Tertre, famosa per i pittori di strada.Insomma, che tu voglia soggiornarci per giorni o mesi, Parigi ha attrazioni per tutti i gusti e per tutte le tasche.Concludo la mia recensione citando una frase di Hemingway: ""Se sei abbastanza fortunato di aver vissuto a Parigi da giovane, allora, per il resto della tua vita - ovunque andrai - Parigi sarà con te."""
40,“Parigi romantica”,"Agosto 2010Viaggio a Parigi con la Parrocchia di S.Antonino di Palermo.Viaggio in nave Palermo-Genova e poi in pullman a salire,facendo qualche pernottamento.Parigi è una città mitica,ma il ricordo più bello è stato uscire dalla stazione metropolitana e vedere all'improvviso la Torre Eiffel illuminata la sera e con fasci di luce che rendevano ancora più spettacolare il tutto. Da non mancare il giro in battello della Senna,che percorre e spiega i singoli monumenti in lingua italiana. Altra tappa logicamente Versailles ed Eurodisney,anche se devo dire che Gardaland è più bella e più concentrata nei giochi,mentre a Parigi è molto dispersivo.Giuseppe Sutera Miles & More 9920 0355 9286 988"
40,“ぜひ　また　行きたい街”,そんなに　広くないイメージです。地下鉄は　フランス語表記なのを除けば　あちこちに　乗り換え案内や　路線図があり　とても利用しやすいです。小学生の子供との旅行だったので　夜９時以降は　外出しませんでしたが　とくに　治安の悪い印象も　ありませんでした。歴史のある観光名所が　たくさんあって　短い日数じゃ　足りないかな・・・。建物への　そこいらじゅうにある落書きと、　喫煙者のマナーの悪さが　少し気になりました。
50,“冬と初夏、まったく違う印象を受けたパリ”,娘がパリの１４区にある国際大学都市の寮に１年余りいました。その間２回ほどパリを訪ねました。１回目は年越しのパリ、夜明けは遅く８時半ごろやっと薄明るくなってきたように覚えています。夕方は早くに日が落ちてしまうので、一日が短く感じられました。お天気の日は良いのですが、曇りや雪の日は、一日中どんよりしていて、華の都パリには程遠い気がしました。大晦日のシャンゼリゼはネオンは綺麗でしたが足元はゴミだらけでがっかりしました。行きかう人々はおしゃれではあるのですが、ほとんどの人が上から下までダークな単色を着ていました。スカーフ（マフラー）だけを鮮やかにした人を見かけましたがなんだかとても暗く感じました。。町のあちこちの路地には犬の糞があり、気をつけて歩きました。その糞の上に雪が降って、凍って、犬の糞が透明に凍った氷の中にあるのが奇妙に写りました。元旦はノートルダムも、エッフェル塔も人人人、良い天気だったので中には入らずにセーヌ川沿いを散歩しました。１週間のパリステイは華やかなことはなく過ぎ、ちょっとがっかりして帰ってきました。次に初夏にパリで１０日ほどを過ごしました。冬とはまったく違う印象、日ざしは明るく、風は爽やか、一日は長く、町を歩く足取りも軽やか、うきうき気分になりました。人々の服装も華やかで、パリを満喫しました。やはり、旅行は季節を選ぶべきだなと思いましたが、違う季節に行ったからこそ、パリの姿を感じることが出来ました。パリで苦労した娘も今はパリを懐かしく思い、映像でパリを見ると、あーやっぱり素敵な所だよねといっています。今度は秋に行きたいです。ぜひ訪れて欲しい都市ですね。
40,“Vive la France”,Paris ist immer eine Reise wert. Die Museen zeigen eine überragende Auswahl an hochwertigen Gemälden und Skulpturen. Der Louvre muß es nicht immer sein.
40,“PARIS EXTRAORDINAIRE”,"16 dicembre 2010Giorno UnoSono a Parigi. Sono passati 18 anni e mi ritrovo di nuovo su un pullman che mi porta a destinazione. È il giorno del mio trentaseiesimo compleanno, i miei secondi diciott'anni e la torre Eiffel che si staglia sulla sinistra, fuori dal finestrino, quasi come se qualcuno a un certo punto decidesse di dirti che sì, è vero, sei proprio a Parigi. Hai forse qualche dubbio? Allora guarda quella mastodontica ferraglia là in fondo.Il pullman ci scarica all'Arc De Triomphe, simbolo maestoso della ricca Avenue de Champs-Èlysèes.Il nostro hotel tre stelle ai Campi Elisi (Royal Magda Etoile), è quanto di più parigino e delizioso ci possa essere, e la receptionist prova addirittura a parlare italiano. Una costante di questo viaggio sarà l'estrema gentilezza dei francesi. Quando si dice andare oltre i luoghi comuni.Un Mc Donald's veloce, e si parte alla volta della Île de la Cité. Le destinazioni prescelte sono due: la Sainte-Chapelle e la cattedrale di Notre-Dame.Io non ci sto pensando, ma oggi è il mio compleanno. E la Sainte-Chapelle chiude presto. Allora niente volte gotiche, almeno non quelle, sennò perdiamo Notre-Dame.Ecco la cattedrale imponente dove puoi inspirare storia di tutte le epoche. Dove puoi lasciare un'offerta praticamente ovunque: ci sono più prezzi luminosi che altari votivi. Dove Napoleone, me lo immagino con quella sua manina dentro la giacca, veniva incoronato imperatore megalomane. Dove ogni cosa ti sembra piccola, come a San Pietro o a Westminster. Dove i gargoyles vegliano su di te.La Île Saint-Louis, l'isolotto accanto a quello più celebrato, è incantevole e merita una passeggiata al freddo, tra botteghe e lucine natalizie.I ponti sulla Senna sembrano quelli del Lungotevere, ma sono un po' più brutti, mi perdoni Parigi. La stessa ficcante sensazione mi si era instillata diciotto anni fa.Mi perdoni invece Roma, se l'Isola Tiberina è sonoramente più brutta di queste due isole fluviali parigine.Mi ricordo che è il mio compleanno quando in serie mi piovono in testa una serie di sorprese di cui non parlerò, per custodirle gelosamente lontano da occhi indiscreti.Solo una cosa: il ristorantino al Marais è buono, ottimo direi.E la cucina francese adesso mi fa meno paura.Piove, fa freddo, taxi, sorprese, persino una candelina, occhi che brillano, sonno.Giorno DueIl vento mi fa un regalo tardivo ma graditissimo: durante la notte porta via tutte le nuvole. La giornata è di quelle che lèvati.Sole, cielo limpido, sette-otto gradi, una spruzzata di neve sui tetti.Parigi è una modella perfetta per gli scatti dei fotografi. Ha fatto le bizze, si è fatta aspettare ed è arrivata all'appuntamento più sexy che mai.Sexy come le ballerine che animavano e tutt'ora animano il Moulin Rouge, che visto di giorno è meno tempio del peccato e più scala antincendio.C'è Pigalle, uno sguardo alla mappa, sfioro la strada che tutt'ora ospita lo scalcinato albergo della mia gita scolastica e proseguo su per Montmartre.Rue Lepic si arrampica sul colle tra bistrot e negozietti, fiori e dolci, ostriche e champagne. C'era anche il Cafè dove lavorava Amèlie Poulain proprio in questa via, ma me ne sono accorto adesso che cercavo curiosità.Più si sale, più tutto diventa turistico.Però vi dirò, ci siamo lasciati contagiare dal quartiere degli artisti, che è quello che solletica l'immaginario di tutti. Un turista, quando viene a Roma, vuole farsi ammaliare da Trastevere e Monti. Lo stesso succede qui con Montmartre. Ci rassegnamo senza troppo dispiacere all'idea di essere banali, e arriviamo su su fino a Place du Tertre, ritrovo degli artisti, sempre pronti a farti un ritratto, proprio come a Piazza Navona, ma con la neve intorno e il panorama in fondo.C'è una piazzetta dedicata a Jean Marais, l'attore.Mi faccio la foto, quasi commosso.Al Sacre-Coeur c'è un panorama mozzafiato, esclusa la torre Eiffel che è coperta dagli alberi del colle. La basilica è bianchissima e fa meravigliosamente contrasto col cielo azzurro. Dentro non è niente di speciale, ma fa niente, conta l'atmosfera. Un signore suona Frank Sinatra con l'arpa, un ragazzo canta bene i Queen e gli Oasis, tutti e due incassano applausi e monete. Tutto un po' oleografico, ma ci sta.Nel riscendere a valle, guardando i vigneti, ci imbattiamo in un ristorantino rosa e meno turistico: omelette, chèvre au provençal, una turista toscana che sola soletta si gode il formaggio di capra fino in fondo. Usciamo, il cielo è diventato bianco, abbiamo i biglietti per il serale al Louvre, ma c'è tempo per andare a salutare i morti del Père-Lachaise.Che è immenso. E che tutti ci vanno per Jim Morrison, ma in realtà Jim Morrison è tipo Alvaro Vitali, rispetto alla gente che riposa in quel cimitero. Peccato che o compri la mappa fuori, o impari il cartellone dei morti vip a memoria, o, come abbiamo fatto noi, segui una scolaresca e riesci a vedere la tomba di Balzac.Fiocca leggermente, adesso.Il Louvre ci aspetta: c'è tempo per un tè caldo, mentre Rue de Rivoli sta decidendo se bagnarsi d'acqua o imbiancarsi di neve.Dentro il museo più museo del mondo c'è tutto quello che i francesi sono riusciti a rubare nel corso dei secoli.Quindi la Nike di Samotracia, la Venere di Milo, le Nozze di Cana del Veronese, Amore e Psiche di Canova e sì, pure la Gioconda, che non è un granchè ma è sempre la star assoluta.Sindrome di Stendhal ogni tre per due, ma il tempo è tiranno, e per vedere tutto il Louvre non basterebbe una settimana.Fuori nevica di brutto, la piramide di vetro è affascinante, ma il freddo punge.Il viso si congela, le sinapsi anche, se è vero come è vero che può capitare di rimanere imbambolati davanti a una delle uscite della metro e non ritrovare più il proprio albergo pur sapendo che sta lì a un passo.E innervosirsi mentre la neve ti si squaglia in faccia senza alcun rispetto.Giorno TreComincia a serpeggiare in me la paura di non riuscire a tornare a Roma e di passare ore e ore in aeroporto.Neve, pioggia, neve, ancora pioggia. E finché piove va tutto bene.Destinazione Musèe d'Orsay, sulla Rive Gauche.Qui hanno impacchettato tutti i quadri degli impressionisti e li hanno appesi dentro una stazione ferroviaria antica. Bello in modo assurdo.Per certi versi anche più del Louvre.Visita lunga, passeggiata fino a Place de la Concorde, che è uno spazio immenso delimitato dai giardini delle Tuileries, con annessa ruota panoramica.Verso l'opulenta Place Vendôme, ci fermiamo a mangiare soufflè di tutti i tipi.Poi a stretto giro di posta Parigi ci offre la piazza stessa, la magnifica Operà, i magazzini Lafayette con le vetrine animate e la gente incastrata pure sui soffitti. Che tutto il mondo è paese. E la lobotomia collettiva natalizia colpisce anche i parigini senza alcuna pietà. Tra l'altro qualcuno dovrebbe spiegarmi come si fa a scegliere un regalo in mezzo alla folla che poga.In fuga da Lafayette, ci spostiamo verso la Torre Eiffel.Ed è a quel punto che ci assale il delirio di onnipotenza degli elementi.La torre, il ferraglione, è immerso nella nebbia. I vucumprà ci tampinano con l'offertissima: sei modellini inutili della Tour a solo un euro. No, non sarò mai uno di quelli che portano a casa una chilata di torrette da distribuire ad amici e parenti.Mentre penso questo, ecco la bufera di neve.La più forte che io abbia mai visto abbattersi su una città.Immaginate dei fiocchi di neve grandi come tessere bancomat, fateli cadere violentemente orizzontali, pensate all'ombrello come accessorio pressochè inutile, diventate dei pupazzi di neve e aspettate che un bambino vi metta una carota all'altezza del naso.Immaginate poi che la strumentazione di bordo risenta del freddo e la macchina fotografica simuli una rottura definitiva di buona parte dei tasti.Paura, orrore, rabbia, freddo becco, fila per salire al primo piano, vucumprà infoiati, bambini giocosi, che uno a un certo punto dice: ma tipo tornare in albergo?Amen.La sera stessa, il vento spazza di nuovo le nuvole.E dopo una zuppa di castagne e un doppio hamburger con il roquefort, si può pensare di digerire andando su e giù per cinque chilometri lungo gli Champs-Èlysèes, guardando la gente, il lusso, i mercatini di Natale, ammirando Parigi così come si è truccata per noi in questa ultima notte.Il freddo non taglia le gambe ma ci va vicino. Il sonno ci scalda e dissolve i cattivi pensieri sul volo di ritorno.Giorno QuattroLà fuori nevica di brutto. L'aereo decolla alle 17,30, gli aeroporti stanno chiudendo. Se guardi qualsiasi telegiornale, è lo sfacelo.Il volo prima del nostro viene cancellato, ma poi piove e l'acqua, si sa, scioglie il ghiaccio.A mezzogiorno stiamo scrutando la Torre Eiffel dal Trocadèro.Stavolta la città si è imbiancata per davvero. Salsicce, vin chaud (vino caldo), il tempo di salutare Paris.L'aereo ci porterà via da Orly senza un secondo di ritardo ed è una fortuna macroscopica. I due giorni seguenti, nel cielo bianco sopra Parigi non volerà più nemmeno una mosca. Faccio in tempo a comprare i macarons, che solo dopo scoprirò essere i dolcetti più trendy del momento.Parigi d'inverno ha pochi eguali.Viaggiare in autunno-inverno non ha eguali.Non è da tutti festeggiare la seconda maggiore età nel luogo in cui diciotto anni fa, eri vicinissimo a festeggiare la prima.Parigi vuole che torni di nuovo, me l'ha sussurrato con la erre moscia e il nasino all'insù, mentre si copriva di bianco.E io, senza nemmeno pensarci un attimo, le ho detto di sì."
40,“stupenda”,"Parigi è una città meravigliosa: quello che mi ha sconvolto è la sua grandeur ( si dice così?) Tutto è grande, largo, maestoso, però i francesi non mi sono piaciuti affatto, me lo avevano detto, non ci avevo creduto, ma ora devo ammettere che avevano ragione, hanno la puzza sotto al naso, sono scortesi, sporchini (voglio essere buona!). Trovo assurdo che a Londra non si paghi nei musei e invece a Parigi si paghi tutto e anche caro. Detto questo però, ripeto, è meravigliosa, sono spesso rimasta senza fiato, e sappiate che ero prevenuta, dicevo che avrei continuato a preferire Londra.Preferisco l'atmosfera di londra, l'aria che tira, l'eccitazione che trasmette, ma Parigi è...... non trovo un aggettivo adatto... grande, ecco è grandiosa!!!"
50,“Voyage à Paris entre filles”,"Je suis partie à Paris, en juillet 2010.Un voyage entre filles. Un voyage très agréable d'une semaine, ce qui pour moi était suffisant pour me promener à Paris.Nous avons demeuré dans un appart Cytadine dans la Petite Itale dans le 13e arrondissement. Un peu éloigné de la Tour Effeil et de l'Arc de Triomphe etc... mais très accessible à pied ( quand la marche ne nous fait pas peur) et nous pouvions prendre le métro à deux pas de notre appart.J'ai adoré la visite l'Opéra de Paris et place de l'Opéra. Le bateau mouche sur la Seine (Viste vers les 21h et lorsqu'on revient la Tour Effeil clignote de toutes ses lumières, wow!). Les petits cafés Français et leur serveurs arrogants mais si amusant en même temps.Ne dépenser pas votre argent à visiter l'intérieure du Chateau de Versailles car ce sont les jardins qui en valent la peine et c'est gratuit.ATTENTION! Garder TOUJOURS votre ticket de métro à portée de main car on peut vous les exiger en tout temps à la sortie du métro et si vous l'avez égarer alors attendez-vous à payer une amende et c'est très frustrant à vivre . Mon amie à dû payer une amende de 40 Euro :("
50,“Stadt der Lichter und Verliebten”,"Paris ist Paris und das ist gut so. Paris ist zweifelsfrei (zusammen mit Rom) die schönste Stadt der Welt. Paris ist romatisch, wild, schön, ruhig, laut, speziell, normal, exquisit, günstig, fordernd und lustig zusammen! Paris ist unbedingt eine Reise wert und muss man gesehen haben. Ohne Paris wäre die Welt um viel ein Vielfaches an Schönheit ärmer."
20,“パリの券売機”,パリの地下鉄に乗りました。券売機がわかりにくいです。まず言語を選び、その後、言葉で出たとおりにコンピュータの操作のように選択と実行を繰り返します。確か、スケートの織田選手がパリで迷子になり、地元の人に券売機を操作してキップを買ってもらったというような記事をオリンピック前に見ました。あれは操作が複雑であったためで、まるで織田選手が子供のような印象の記事でしたが、そうではなく、彼もあの複雑さにどうしたら良いかわからなかったのではないかと察します。彼を弁明いたします。
50,"“Paris, die Stadt der Liebe”","Paris ist wunderschön, einzigartig. Viele sehenswürdigkeiten, nicht nur der Eifelturm. Auto vollkommen unnötig, alles per Metro erreichbar.

Et puis on y trouve traiteurs, restaurants, boulangeries, théatres et 2 magasins aux pieds de l'appartement pour faire ses courses! les propriétaires sont super gentils, vraiment je recommande vivement car en plus il n'est pas cher à partir de 120 € la nuit pour 4!!! vraiment pas cher pour sa situation."
40,“Paris ist sehenswert”,"Im Januar entschieden wir uns spontan für einen Autotrip in die Citymetropole Paris. Wir hatten einen Aufenthalt im Disneyland Paris und dachten uns éinen tag in Paris zu verbringen. Leider gestaltete sich das Parken dort als ""unmöglich"". Nicht weil es keine Parkplätze gibt, nein, das Parkscheinsystem war uns völlig fremd. So konnten wir eigentlich nirgends lange anhalten und haben dann nur ganz kurze Stops eingelegt für ein paar Fotos zu machen. Zuerst kamen wir an der berühmten Kirche Notre Dame vorbei, unser eigentliches erstes Ziel sollte aber der Eiffelturm sein. Nachdem wir ihn dann gut fanden stiegen wir kurz aus um ein paar Fotos zu machen. Leider hatten wir kein gutes Wetter an dem Tag, es regnete und es war kalt. Viele schöne Bauten gibt es in der Stadt der Liebe zu sehen, so auch den Luvre, Champs Elysee, die berühmte Strasse, Mont Martre und natürlich nicht zu vergessen den Arc de Triomphe. Das PArkscheinsystem gestaltete sich schwierig, eigentlich unmöglich. Wir wussten nämlich zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht das man sich eine Pariskarte aus dem Tabakladen kaufen muss und damit dann einen Parkschein ziehen zu können. Denn mit normaler EC oder Kreditkarte gings nicht. Die Karten kosten wohl zwischen 10-30 Euro, je nachdem wo und wielange man parken will. Wir kommen aber wieder, denn Paris ist wirklich sehenswert und eine Reise wert. ich hoffe auch wir schaffen es zum Schloß Versailles."
40,“parigi città dell'amore”,"Sono stato a Parigi nel periodo natalizio 2010/2011,cosiglio vivamente chi volesse soggiornare in questo periodo di premunirsi con abbigliamento pesante perchè si schianta dal freddo.Luoghi da visitare chiaramente in primis il Louvre,ma ci sono molti altri musei e monumenti degni di essere visitati,consiglio se soggiornate per almeno una settimana di acquistare il ParisMusium che in teoria vi permette di non fare troppa coda allingresso dei musei,sotto i 25 anni se non ricordo male i musei dovrebbero essere gratuiti prendete questa informazione con le pinze però.Merita anche la Tour Eiffel ma se soffrite l'altezza come me...avrete seri problema già al secondo piano 150 metri d'altezza piu o meno e vi garantisco che visti dall'alto sono veramente tanti,se poi siete coraggiosi potete prendere l'ascensore che vi porterà dal secondo piano fino in cima dove vedrete Parigi da un'altezza di 300 metri circa.Ultima cosa che può valere la pena di visitare è EuroDisney anche se con un costo di 65 euro a persona non aspettatevi niente di eccezionale sopratutto a capodanno,chiaramente è un parere personale.Detto questo non vi resta che indossare scarpe calde e comode e...buona vacanza!"
40,“Paris siempre vale la pena”,"La capital francesa es una ciudad monumental. Sus monumentos, sus grandes avenidas, sus museos. Tiene grandes iconos que nos hacen evocarla en cualquier situación.

50,“花の都です！”,フランスの首都パリは日本人が大好きな花の都です！ヨーロッパの中でも比較的大きな街なので、見所はたくさんあります。中でも私のオススメは街歩きです！シャンゼリゼは勿論ステキですが、サントノレ通りやラスパイユ大通り等、歩けば歩く程色んな発見があり、素顔のパリを見る事が出来ます。是非、ゆっくり滞在して、パリジャン、パリジェンヌの気分で、それぞれのパリを満喫して下さい！
50,“身心放松”,在那里，你可以感受到巴黎历史厚重，真正的艺术之都。在塞纳河畔，你可以感受到一份宁静感，巴黎的一切都让我身心放松！
50,“Paris im Winter”,"Es war eine spontane Idee, Paris im Winter zu besuchen - und, es hat sich gelohnt. Selbst das Grau der Straßen und die Temperaturen um 0 Grad störten das Vergnügen nciht, sondern gaben dem Kurzurlaub eine besondere Note. Die Menschen sitzten weiterhin draußen vor ihren Cafes, in der Metro spielt weiterhin die Musik und man bekommt überall leckeren Glühwein - den leckersten unter dem Eifelturm, wo er bei der langen Wartezeit auch sehr gut tut. Der stimmugnsvolle Weihnachtsmarkt auf dem Champes Elysee ist ebenfalls einen Besuch wert. Der Louvre aht alledings am 01. januar geschlossen."

20,"“Paris, no vuelvo nunca más”","Lo rescatable de Paris es la historia, el Louvre, Montmartre, Notre Dame, Museo de Orsay, L`Opera. Fin.La Tour Eiffel es un bodoque de hierro que impresiona desde lejos al verlo por primera vez, al entrar es horrible. No me gustò para nada.LO PEOR: Los parisinos y su cultura, groseros, sucios, desporlijos PEOR que los Argentinos, PEOR que Buenos Aires (aclaro que soy Argentina). Mugre y mal olor por todas partes en la ciudad, los basureros desbordados, los parisinos no pagan los boletos del subte, pasan por abajo o saltan por arriba del molinete con total desparpajo (eso es impensable en Inglaterra, sería una falta de educaciòn y decoro). Vagabundos que te piden limosna todo el tiempo, gente en el subte que te canta, te baila, te pide, te aturde.Los parisinos se reúsan a hablar o intentar entenderte si no les hablàs en francès, sobre todo en los servicios públicos donde màs necesitás ayuda ellos te hablan en francès y a toda velocidad y por supuesto no entendès nada (salvo que hables francès que no es mi caso). Muuuuy descorteses, muuuuy desagradables, lleguè a odiarlos, casi pierdo el aviòn por su falta de voluntad.

40,“人が思ったよりやさしい”,パリは怖い、とよく聞いていましたが、実際はフレンドリーで親切な人が多く、ヨーロッパの都市の中でも特に好きな街のひとつになりました。人によって感じ方は違うかもしれませんが、普通に観光しているぶんには治安もそんなに悪くなさそうでした。人がおしゃれで人間観察も楽しいです！
50,“飽きることがない場所”,パリのひとつの街の中にサンジェルマン、カルチェラタン、オペラ界隈、マレなど各地区が非常に個性があり何回訪れても飽きることがない街、ただ、ひたすら歩くだけでも楽しい街ですが、歩き過ぎると疲れる街ですので、効率よくメトロやバスの利用も薦めます。
30,“モンマルトルの治安”,モンマルトルの丘から見下ろすパリの街並みは絶景でした。映画「アメリ」に出てきたメリーゴーランドも見れて、大満足。細く入り組んだ路地や階段がたくさんあり、路地好きにはたまらないと思います。が、あんまり治安の良くない印象を受けました。サクレクール寺院の下、ケーブルカー乗り場のあたりに、多数のミサンガ売りがいました。ざっと見、6人ほど。手にひもを持っているのですぐわかります。こっちが日本人と見るや、「コンニチハ～」と話しかけて、近づいてきます。ミサンガ売りはさっと手首にミサンガを巻いて取れないようにし、金額を請求してきます。私は早足で間を通り抜けて何も被害を受けませんでしたが、立ち止まったりすると危険かもしれません。女性だけの旅行では十分気をつけたほうがいいと思います。ちなみに私はアベス駅から歩いてサクレクール寺院に行きましたが、アベス駅から地上に出るための階段の、おそろしく長かったこと!!膝がガクガク震えました。それに狭くて一本道で、怖い人と遭遇したら…と思うとぞっとします。もしアベス駅を利用されることがあるなら、必ずエレベーターを利用したほうがいいと思います!!
50,“Erleben Sie Paris”,"Paris ist die Stadt der Liebe, der kulinarischen Genüsse, die Hauptstadt der Mode, der monumentalen Sehenswürdigkeiten.Der Eiffelturm, der Triumphbogen, der Louvre, der Invalidendom, die Brücken über die Seine und viele andere Sehenswürdigkeiten erwarten sie in der Stadt der Liebe."
30,“Triste Week End a Parigi”,"Appena tornato da un fine settimana a Parigi, desidero esprimere la mia opinione su questa città.Penso innanzitutto che non si possa visitare Parigi prescindendo da Roma e dall'Italia. La chiave di lettura siamo noi.La città è stata evidentemente costruita a partire da due secoli fa con una specie di ossessione nei confronti della vecchia capitale dell'Impero. Tra l'altro questo complesso nei nostri confronti è ancora molto vivo nell'animo dei parigini.MONUMENTALITA'La città trasmette un monumentalità imponente, quasi fastidiosa, evidentemente creata ad hoc, ma andando nel dettaglio si scopre l'inganno.Andiamo per ordine monumento per monumento.Archi di Trionfo - L'Arc di Triomphe e l'Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel sono copie monumentali degli archi di epoca imperiale romani, in particolare Arco di Tito e Costantino.Obelisque de la Concorde - Obelisco originale egizio. Roma ne possiede ben 13.Colonne Vendome - Copia quasi esatta della Colonna Traiana di Roma.Montmartre - La scalinata è ispirata alle forme di Trinità de monti, pur essendone, nell'effetto, lontana anni luce.Il panorama che si gode dalla sommità invece, dominato da grattacieli moderni, non ha proprio niente a che vedere dalla vista di Roma dal Gianicolo o dal Pincio.Chiese - Notre Dame ed il Sacro Cuore, le chiese più importanti, non meritano al visita ed all'interno. Ci si sente quasi presi in giro dall' l'amenità degli interni.LOUVREL'intento di creare un museo grandioso è perfettamente riuscito. Come si sa, questo è stato fatto rubando centinaia e centinaia di opere d'arte proveniente dall'Italia.La quantità di opere d'arte romana, etrusca e Rinascimentale sottratta, il fulcro del museo, è incredibile. Ci si chiede come abbiano fatto a rubare tutte questa roba.Nessun italiano può visitare il Louvre senza uscirne pieno di un profondo rancore.CIBO - Se noi non esistessimo la cucina francese sarebbe la prima al mondo.GENTE - I francesi, come tra l'altro noto, sono realmente un popolo triste. Parigi ti trasmette una melanconia che dopo un paio di giorni inizia realmente ad infastidirti. Sono tristemente ai primi posti in europa per numero di suicidi, e, osservando la gente, percepisci grigiore.Non sanno cosa sia l'accoglienza. A proposito cito, per concluderem un aneddoto alquanto sintomaitco.Ero alla ricerca di francobolli da apporre su cartoline. Mi reco d'istinto in un tabaccaio il quale mi dice, con l'usuale scontrosità, che non ne ha. Mi reco da un secondo, ed anch'egli ne è sprovvisto. Cercando un terzo rifletto che ciò mi sembra strano, in quanto dovrebbero avere scorte sufficienti.Anche il terzo, non ne ha, a quel punto gli chiedo in inglese, chi ce l'ha ed ovviamente lui nemmeno mi risponde e passa al cliente successivo. Voglio sottolineare che dietro a me in fila c'erano diverse persone che avrebbero potuto rispondere al mio quesito, ma nessuno l'ha fatto.In albergo, ho fatto la stessa domanda al concierge che mi ha finalmente detto, di sabato sera, che i francobolli si acquistano solo alla Posta. Il giorno dopo, domenica, sono ripartito e non ho potuto spedire alcunchè.Quello che voglio dire è che se un francese a Roma, cercasse i Francobolli in cartoleria, il negoziante, oltre a dirgli che non ne possiede si adopererà naturalmente per spiegargli che deve andar in tabaccheria. Rendedogli, così, con un semplice gesto per noi naturale, il suo soggiorno più piacevole.Andate tutti a Parigi, per amare di più la nostra, povera, Italia!"
50,“法国”,我在到达法国的大巴车上。法国真美，埃菲尔铁塔真雄伟。刚到达法国的时候，有一种接受不了的寂寞。然后瞬间爱上这个国家。
50,“パリのお気に入りの場所”,モンマルトルのサクレ・クール寺院前です。大階段に腰をかけ　ストリートﾐｭｰｼﾞｼｬﾝのバイオリンの切ない音色に耳を傾けながら　パリを一望していると　本当に　ステキな気分に浸れます。
40,“夏休みは避けた方がいい”,2010年の夏にパリに行きました。花の都パリと胸をときめかして行ってきました。凱旋門、エッフェル塔、ﾙｰﾌﾞﾙ美術館、ベルサイユ宮殿等、見所が多く、やはりパリはすばらしいと思いました。しかし、とにかく、観光客が多く、どこの観光地も人、人、人で、長蛇の列です。パリはすばらしい場所ですが、夏休みは避けた方がいいと感じました。
50,“Einfach TOP!!!”,"Paris zählt für mich zu den schönsten Städten in Europa. War für drei Tage da und konnte so die Stadt gut besichtigen und kennenlernen. Am schönsten fand ich den Eifelturm, auf den man auf jeden Fall hochfahren muss. Das Louvre und Notre Dame muss man aber auch gesehen haben. Leider habe ich es nicht ins Disneyland und Schloss Versailles geschafft."
50,“万千宠爱的浪漫之都”,都说巴黎是最浪漫的一座城市，可能当你真正到了这座城市的时候并不会有特别深的体会，毕竟那里整天都是乌云密布，交通堵得要命，各个景区也都挤满了来参观的游客。但是每次一回想起在巴黎的点点滴滴，却总是有一种莫名的感动，后来想想，这可能才是真正的浪漫之都带给人们的感动，永远是默默地潜移默化，这种浪漫的感受也许才更能细水长流吧。回想起来，对巴黎的情感，大概是由每次看到塞纳河时，夜晚去看埃菲尔铁塔时，还有和朋友走在香榭丽舍大街时所感受到的情绪交织而成的，真的很美丽。
50,“paris”,"Es una ciudad magica la mejor epoca para ir es julio o septiembre, lo que mas me gusto es ver la Torre Eiffel de noche iluminada y toda la gente en los campos de mars tomando champan."
50,“Paris: Die Stadt der Liebe”,"Paris ist die Stadt der Liebe. Vom Montmatre hat man einen wunderschönen Ausblick auf die Dtadt. Toll ist auch die Kirche SAcre Coer. Natürlich sollte man auch auf den Champs Elysees spazieren. Auf der einen Seite der Arc de Triomphe, auf der anderen Seite der Place de la Concorde mit der Obelisque. Natürlich sollte auch der Eifelturm nicht fehlen."
40,“パリ　一日満喫”,パリを1日歩き回ってきました。朝早く到着したので、まずはシャンゼリーゼ通りから少し入ったところにある、PAULで朝食。クロワッサンとエスプレッソの朝食セットは2.90ユーロでした。クロワッサンはサクッとフワッとすごくおいしかったです。その後、Monoprix、ユニクロ、ラファイエット、Le Bon Marche、などで買い物をしました。Monoprix：　モンパルナス店が大きくてオススメです。Lafayette：クリスマス前なので、ライトアップがすごく綺麗でした。Mariages：今回はLafayetteの中にある売り場に行きました。置いてある種類は少ないですが、定員さんが丁寧に紅茶選びを手伝ってくれます。暗くなるのを待って、メトロでTrocardero駅へ。ここからのエッフェル塔の眺めは何度いっても感動します。最後はシャンゼリーゼ通りと、凱旋門のライトアップを見て、パリ一日満喫しました。
50,“Paris ist eine Reise Wert”,"Je näher Sie in Paris mitten in der Stadt Ihr Quatier aufschlagen um so mehr können Sie zu Fuss erreichen. Mein Tipp das ""Westin Paris"" Von hier aus brauchen Sie überhaupt kein öffentliches Verkehrsmittel um den Louvre, den Eifelturm, die Triumphbogen oder die Champs Elysees zu besichtigen. Auch Notre Dame ist kein Problem. Einzig für Sacre Coeur sollten Sie die Metro nehmen. Nehmen Sie sich mindesten drei bis vier Tage Zeit und machen Sie sich vorher einen Plan. Je nach Jahreszeit sollten Sie Karten für den Louvre vorreservieren. Im November / Dezember kommen Sie überall ohne Wartezeit rein. Einzig beim Eifelturm steht man auch im Winter. Eine Stunde insgesamt muss man auch im Winter einplanen. Essen und Trinken können Sie an jeder Ecke. Gut bis sehr gut ist überall möglich. Paris ist kein günstiges Pflaster.Je nach Vorlieben für Aktivitäten im Hotel, finden Sie für jede Preisklasse im Internet ein passendes Hotel. Auch Diese gibt es in Paris wie Sand am Meer. Im Sommer zu Reisen ist sicherlich von den Temperaturen die angenehmere Reisezeit, wenn man aber nicht anstehen möchte, dann kommt man am besten von Nov. bis Feb. Hier sind die Preise auch in den sehr guten Hotels zu bezahlen und alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind ohne Menschenmassen zu bewundern. Ich persönlich findes das wesentlich besser."
40,“Paris - Frankreichs mondäne Hauptstadt”,"Paris ist Weltstadt - in jeder Hinsicht, und bietet dem Touristen alles, was sie / er sich wünscht. Freilich ist das Vergnügen nicht ganz billig. Kulinarische Highlights gibt es etwa überall zu finden, aber gegen entsprechendes Kleingeld. Die Geschichte der Grand Nation ist allgegenwärtig, und atemberaubend, auch und gerade in der weniger gemütlichen Jahreszeit. Der Eiffelturm wird allen Erwartungen gerecht. Auch das Shoppingherz wird gut bedient. Besonders angenehm aufgefallen ist uns, dass das Rauchverbot in Restaurants ua nunmehr greift. Dies ist ein großer Unterschied zu unserem letzten Besuch im Jahr 2007. Bravo!"
50,“consejos para viajar a paris”,"Lo primero decir que la ciudad es alucinante, preciosa, una maravilla. Pero entre los parisinos abundan las caras largas y la gente borde. Supongo que es por la cantidad de turistas que tienen que aguantar. Moverse en metro es sencillo, no tanto en RER. No todos los trenes del RER paran en todas las estaciones. Sí en las del centro pero no en las otras. Cada tren tiene un nombre que pone en un letrero de la locomotora y tienes que estar atento a qué paradas hacen. Si no, puedes acabar muy lejos de tu destino, en un barrio desolado. En general París, su metro, el RER, los museos, no están bien adaptados para minusválidos o sillas de bebé, maletas, etc. Hay falta de escaleras mecánicas y ascensores. Para comer no suele haber problema y no me ha parecido caro. El primer domingo de mes los museos son gratis. Para bebés, suelen tener un microondas en cada restaurante de los sitios turísticos. Allí puedes calentar potitos y lo que quieras. Es darle al 1 y ya está. Una buena alternativa al metro y al RER son los barcos que surcan el sena en ambos sentidos. Recorren los principales sitios turísticos y puedes bajarte y volver a subir con el mismo billete."
50,“Die Stadt der Liebe”,"Einmal Paris sehen und sterben. Es klingt übertrieben. Es ist jedoch wahr, daß wenn man die schmalen Strassen von Mon Martre, den Eifelturm und Champs-Elyisee nicht gesehen hat und nicht durch die Stadt gebummelt hat, nicht den Geist von Parist eingefangen hat, Paris nicht gesehen hat. Dazu muß man unbedingt auch einen Picknick mit einem Baguette, französichen Wein und Käse irgendwo im Grünen gemacht haben. Für diese Stdat muß man mehr Zeit einplanen. Es ist einfach unmöglich alle Sehenswürdigkeiten nur in einem Wochenende zu sehen."
50,“Paris - eine wie keine!”,"Wow, einfach nur wow! Ich war letztes Jahr mit meiner besten Freundin in Paris und wir hatten das tollste Freundinnen-Wochenende. Auch im Winter kann man die Stadt genießen und mal einen ganz anderen Charme spüren. Auf jeden Fall auf den Eiffelturm fahren, das Geld ist sehr gut investiert, denn die Stadt ist wunderschön von oben anzuschauen. Alles weiß!!"
40,“Chinatown in Paris”,"Chinatown liegt im 13. Bezirk nahe der Place d´Italie - leicht mit der Metro erreichbar; unverwechselbare chinesische bzw. asiatische Atmosphäre; viele typische Restaurants mit guter, preiswerter Küche; ein Besuch lohnt sich sowohl zu Mittagszeit als auch Abends; diese Restaurant sind nicht mit den typischen China-Restaurants in Europa vergleichbar; authentisch;"
40,“パリの方のイメージ”,フランス人は冷たい、などとよく耳にしますが、旅行をして全く違うことを感じました。地下鉄で乗り継ぎに戸惑っていたときなど、現地の方が優しく声をかけてくださいました。レストランやホテルの方も愛想よく、とても気持ちのいい対応を受けました。イメージだけで決め付けずに、こちらからも笑顔で挨拶などをして気持ちのいい旅行をしようと改めて思いました。
50,“Parigi fa girare la testa!”,"Parigi e' una citta' meravigliosa. Nonostante sia grandissima e' possibile visitarla con comodita' e senza stress.Le lunghe code che si vedono davanti ai musei possono far desistere se paragonate all'Italia ma qui scorrono veloci.E' possibile spostarsi velocemente con il Metro' ma fuori dagli orari di punta e' bello utilizzare i Bus che permettono di vedere splendidi panorama. In entrambi in casi se la vostra permanenza e' superiore a 5 giorni e' consigliabile fare un piccolo abbonamento che vi fara' risparmiare molti soldi: la carte orange (portatevi dietro 2/3 foto da documento).Oltre ai Musei e alla bellezze artistiche da tutti conosciuti ci sono tantissimi luoghi da visitare ed io che vado ogni anno ne scopro sempre un nuovo: parchi, giardini, musei, bar, brasserie, negozi, percorsi, cimiteri, eccPer mangiare la scelta è molto ampia: si va dalle trattorie di campagna ai grandi ristoranti gestiti da famosi chef. I bistrot propongono menu tradizionali a prezzi vantaggiosi. Ci sono poi le brasserie (molto simili ai nostri ristoranti), le tipiche birrerie alsaziane, dove si possono gustare birra, vino e stuzzichini e piatti caldi. In campagna è facile imbattersi nei ferme-auberges: semplici locande situate all’interno di vecchie fattorie, dove si possono assaggiare prodotti genuini tipici della zona.La maggior parte dei ristoranti propone sia menu degustazione a prezzo fisso sia à la carte. Un italiano e' abituato a ordinare alla carta. Cosi' spesso spendete di piu'. Provate i menu' (Formule). Il pranzo francese (le dèjeuner) è dalle 12.00 alle 14.00 e' uno spuntino veloce, riservando alla cena (consumata tra le 19.00 ele 21.00) il ruolo di pasto principale."
40,“外観が綺麗な町パリ”,家族でフランス・パリ旅行へ行きました。とにかくエッフェル塔を見たときはとても感動しました。これがあの！という感じで実物を見れて嬉しい気持ちでいっぱいでした。そしてすべての建物が綺麗なつくりなのでうっとりして高い建物の上の方ばかりみていました。ガイドさんの説明によると建物のベランダの鉄格子がすべて違うそうで、デザインがそれぞれ凝っているようでした。しかし意外に歩道はごみが。。。あまり下を見て歩かないようにしました。凱旋門も思ったより大きくその偉大さを感じました。パリは遠目で眺めていたい町かな。と思いました。
50,“すべてがアート”,パリはどこを見ても全てがアートに見えます。憧れのパリに来たんだという実感が持てます。とにかく写真を撮るところが多すぎてカメラの充電が持ちません。充電器を持っていった方がいいと思います。フランス人も気さくな人ばかりで嫌な思いもしませんでした。「ありがとう」「こんにちは」をフランス語で言うだけでお店の人の態度なんかも変わってくるそうです。私も挨拶くらいはフランス語でしなければと思いお店でも観光名所でもフランス語を使いました。後の言葉は英語で全然しゃべってくれたので不自由しませんでした。次に訪れる時はもうちょっとフランス語をしゃべれるようになりたいです。
40,“美しい街並み”,ひとつひとつの建物が芸術的で、街そのものが美しいところです。ぷらぷらと歩くだけでも楽しく、ウィンドウショッピングにはぴったり。世界遺産も多く、メトロが発達しているので、観光地へのアクセスも◎円高の今ならブランド物のショッピングも、かなり安く購入できます。食事にお金がかかるのが、この街では仕方ないことですがそれでもサンドウィッチなど軽食・デパートのお惣菜・パン屋さんのパンがとてもおいしいのでその辺をうまく活用すれば過ごしやすいです。（私は妻と４００円のワイン、エリック・カイザーのパン、お惣菜数種を買って、ホテルで晩餐しました。それだけでも十分です）だいたいのお店などでは、英語メニューがあったり、英語が通じたりするので、観光するには過ごしやすい街ですがエリアによっては治安が悪かったりするので、その辺は十分注意が必要。特に観光地では物売りも多いので、いらないなら「Non！」と強く拒否する姿勢を。モンマルトル界隈では、執拗につきまとってきます。また混雑した地下鉄でのスリ被害にも注意。妻は渡航歴が多いにもかかわらず、被害に遭いました。パスポートは腰巻か、持ち歩かない貴重品はバッグの中のチャックのある内袋に入れるなど簡単にすられない工夫をしましょう。
50,“Hochzeitsreise”,"Mein Mann und ich waren im Mai für 3Tage in Paris. Innerhalb 1,5h ist man bereits in der Stadt der Liebe. Wir waren etwas außerhalb in einem Geschäftsviertel im Sofitel-Hotel untergebracht. Das hat sich als sehr sinnvoll erwiesen, denn Paris ist eine hektische und übervolle Stadt. Dennoch sind alle Sehenswürdigkeiten bequem mit der Metro erreichbar, dher kann ich nur raten sich eine Unterkunft außerhalb der City zu suchen. Wenn man dann nach einem stressigen Tag zurückkommt, kann man wieder aufatmen und Kraft für den nächsten Tag tanken. Eines sollte man noch bedenken bei seinem Trip nach Paris-deutsch wird grundsätzlich nirgendwo gesprochen, ein bischen englisch, ansonsten sind die Franzosen stur, was ihre Sprache angeht. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten von Paris sind top. Man braucht aber auch mindestens 3Tage, um sich einen kleinen Überblick zu verschaffen. Am überlaufensten ist es am Eifelturm. Wir haben ihn daher nur von unten besichtigt, da die Zeit sonst für alles andere nicht gereicht hätte. Ebenso ist der Louvre so gewaltig, das man dafür allein schon 2Tage benötigt. Am besten man macht sich einen Masterplan mit Prioritäten und fährt einfach noch einmal dorthin. Paris ist es wert!"
50,“lieu à visiter absolument !!!”,"Il y a tellement de choses à faire à Paris qu'il faudrait plusieurs jours pour tout visiter. L'avantage est que où vous soyez sur Paris, il y a toujours des bons restaurants surtout à saint michel. Petit conseil pour visiter Paris : Tour eiffel, trocadéro, champs élysées, notre dame de paris, sacré coeur (magnifique!!!), beaucoup de magasins à chatelet mais les meilleurs magasins sont à la défense...Bonne visite car si je continue la liste est interminable..."
50,“paris”,"très belle ville, tout est à proximité , tout est accessible en transport en commun"
40,“mes boites de nuits”,"quoi dire sur les boites à Paris : c'est une sensation que je n'ai jamais ressenti sur marseille. Les boites sont pleines à craquer, les boites sont classées par musique, les gens danse par chorégraphie c'est incroyable"
40,“Magique”,"Les comedies musicales sont bien représentées aux galeries Lafayette, toutes en chanson et en mouvements.Les vitrines du Printemps sont plus soignées, plus minutieuses.Féeriques pour les enfants !"
30,“ワイン落としの恐喝・パリ”,夜間のパリは要注意貧しそうなおじさんが、ワザと通りすがりにぶっかって、持っていたワインを落として割ります。当然、安物のワインですが、高級品と言って弁償を迫ります。夜間の歩道には注意して下さい。
40,“Le patrimoine de Paris est incontournable”,La capitale de la France n'a rien a envie aux autres villes.Idéale pour les sorties le soir comme le jour. Le patrimoine à visiter est riche et somptueux.Un seul point négatif: le prix des locations.
20,“子供のすり軍団”,モンマルトルに行く地下鉄の中で子供（１２－３才くらにの女の子）が寄ってきて自分の腕を指し何やら時間をフランス語で尋ねられてる様子。私は左腕にしてあった時計を見せてあげてたらもっとよく見せてほしそうにしてるから、目が悪いのかと思い近寄って見せてたら数人に取り囲まれたみたい。突然大人の男性が大声で私のポーチを指指し「開いてる」と。でもその時すぐにパスポートと旅行先で利用してた財布があり安心してしまい、カメラや別の財布（日本円入）をとられてることに気付かず・・・。一瞬で子供もその男性も次の駅で降りてしまってました。モンマルトルでそれに気付き、警察に届けに行きました。どうやらそれはいつもの手口らしくなかなか捕まらないと・・・。本当に子供にまんまとやられて悔しい！！次回リベンジしたいと思ったけど、それより何より８日間の旅の思い出がつまったＤＳ返せ！！
50,“El mejor restaurante de Paris”,"Un restaurante a recomendar sin ninguna duda. La comida es absolutamente deliciosa y la relacion calidad-precio excelente, uno de los poco lugares donde todavia se siente la pasion del chef por su trabajo, que nos transmite en cada uno de sus exquisitos platos. No se lo pierdan y que aproveche!!!!!"
50,“Sie ist es tatsächlich! Die Stadt der Romanciers.”,"Da haben wir sie. Die Stadt der Sensiblen. Der kulturell verliebten. Der Literaten und Eleganten. Wie keine andere Stadt auf der Welt ist Paris all dass. Und auch genau das Gegenteil. Ich liebe diese Stadt, weil man hier so sein kann, wie man ist. Man muss sich nicht verstellen, denn die Enttarnung droht sofort. Diese Stadt liebt Querdenker und Charakter. Sie zwingt einen, das wahre ICH zu zeigen - und nimmt dieses dankbar an.Sie werden sich wundern, wer Sie tatsächlich sind."
40,“実はゴルフ天国”,パリ、イルドフランスといえば、数々の有名な観光名所がありますが、もしあながたゴルフ好きだったら、ぜひフランスのゴルフ場でプレーしてみてはどうでしょうか？意外と気軽にプレーできて、しかも、プレーの後はおいしい料理とワインも堪能できますよ！シャルル・ド・ゴール空港の近くにもいくつか良いゴルフ場があり、夜便でパリを出る場合など、日中プレーして、お風呂（日本のゴルフ場みたいなお風呂があるところもあります）で汗を流してから空港へ向かうという事もできます。値段も日本に比べて安いですし、プレースタイルもカジュアルで、手引きカートを借りて健康的に回るもよし、バギーで楽に回るもよし。外国人ばかりだと・・・という方はご心配なく。パリ在住の日本人の方々もたくさんプレーしていますので日本語もそこここから聞こえます。空港近くだと、Applemont、Rarayという二つのゴルフ場がお勧めです。日本よりも距離が長めなので飛ばし屋さんは楽しめると思いますが、ヤーデージはグリーンセンターではなく手前までのところが多いので気を付けて！
40,“パリ地下鉄改札留意点”,パリでナビゴを使い改札を取る場合注意か必要です。ナビゴは日本のパスモやスイカと同じく非接触ICカードですが、改札の読み取り時に音がしない場合が多く、躊躇してやり直すと、×とブザーが鳴り、入場できません。これは、ナビゴが、記名人式（写真添付カード）カードで、複数人の不正利用を排除するためのものだと思われます。とにかく躊躇せず、読み取らせた後は、回転式の入場ガードを思い切り、ぶつかる感じで回して突進してください。それでも、失敗した場合は窓口に申し出るか、次の駅まで歩いて入場するか、してください。カード自体の問題はありません。
50,“何度でも通いたくなる”,旅の目的は毎回ほぼショッピングですが、街の雰囲気も、お店もすべてが大好きで、憧れです。高級メゾンから、セレクトショップ、デパートに至るまで欲しいものだらけで、食品もバター、パン、ケーキ、、、持ち帰れるなら全部。。。時間があれば行きたい場所です。
30,“La ville des lumières”,"Voilà plusieurs années que je vais à Paris pendant les vacances, et je dois avouer que la ville des lumières s'éteint. Il y a en effet de moins en moins de concerts, de soirées originales. Mais les monuments sont toujours aussi attirants, et les musées passionnants."
40,“Die Stadt der Lichter und Musik”,"In den Sommerferien war ich in Paris.STADT | GENERELLES- Sauberkeit: Es war ganz in Ordnung, aber auch nicht so besonders toll. Gerade an tollen Sehenswürdigkeiten war es leider manchmal ein wenig verdreckt.- Strukturierung/Infrastruktur: Mit der Metro ist so gut wie alles zu erreichen, wodurch die Reise durch Paris sich als sehr einfach gestaltet (wenn man den Fahrplan verstanden hat).SEHENSWÜRDIGKEITEN- Es gibt natürlich den Eifelturm. Dieser ist besonders nachts/abends im Dunklen immer, wenn die Stunde voll ist, gut zu betrachten, da er dann ""blinkt""!- Es gibt viele Mappen/Flyer etc., wo Sehenswürdigkeiten drauf abgebildet sind, in Paris gratis zu bekommen, sodass die Suche nach Sehenswürdigkeiten kein Problem darstellen sollte.GESAMTEINIDRUCK, STIMMUNG- Paris ist eine Stadt mit - besonders abends - vielen Leuten, die einem etwas verkaufen möchten und auch manchmal sehr hartneckig sind.- Das darf einen aber nicht davon abschrecken. In Paris kann man abends so zu sagen nur eine gute Stimmung haben, da es alles schön beleuchtet ist und viele Leute Musik spielen und etwas vorführen (Feuer etc.)!Wer Paris noch nicht gesehen hat - Ab nach Paris! Ich denke, dass jeder etwas finden wird und es sehr interessant ist!"
40,“Ma ville”,"Et oui, il s'agit de la ville que j'habite depuis 30 ans ! Alors certes, les parisiens sont souvent infectes et prêts à vous mettre à terre pour une place dans le métro mais cette ville est fabuleuse, belle, diverse et elle réserve une surprise à chaque coin de rue, on ne s'y ennuie jamais. Alors, ami provinciaux et les autres, évitez les heures de pointe dans le métro mais venez découvrir tous les trésors de Paris"
50,“Paris quand tu nous tiens ...”,"Que dire de cette ville la plus visitée au monde, rien d'autre que d'y être pour le vivre, c'est la magie de Paris...No Comment ... Faites en votre propre avis ..."
50,“恋人達のパリ”,秋に訪れたのですが、枯葉が舞うパリの街で恋人達がラブラブで何とも絵になる風景でした。パリはやっぱり秋ですよ！
50,“観光＆買物に最適”,街の中心部に大きくて有名な建造物が沢山あり、それらを見てまわるだけでも圧巻です。また、大きなショッピング通りがいくつもありブランド品から個性的な小物まで買物を楽しむにもとっても良い場所です。観光＆買物に飽きない街なのでなるべく長く滞在する予定で行くことをお勧めします。
50,“歴史の都パリを感じさせる街並みでした。　”,初めてのヨーロッパでもあったので、まさにカルチャーショックでした。とにかく、いまどき先進国でありながら何世紀も前の建物が残っていることに驚きとこの街並みを残した国民性に感心しました。さらに、エッフェル塔がこの街並みとなぜかマッチしていることが不思議でした。パリは何回も行きたくなる都市です。
40,"“Ciudad enteramente ""Monumental""”","Ciudad impresinante por sus monumentos, aunque, con respecto a España, sus calles están un poco sucias. El precio de los hoteles es muy elevado, y sus instalaciones muy viejas...aún así hay que visitar Paris."
40,“芸術に浸れます”,なんといっても芸術の町。いろんな美術館が目白押しで、忙しく見て回らないと時間がいくらあっても足りません。食べ物はおもったほどおいしくないです。高級店に行かないとダメかも。ショッピングは天国です。いまならユーロも安いのでおすすめです。
50,“MARRIOT ILHE DE FRANCE RESORT”,"La estancia en este resort Marriot a las afueras de Paris fue estupenda. Las casas tienen todo lo necesario para pasar unas vacaciones en familia con todo el confort, y estan muy cerca de Dysneyland donde tienes que tomar el tren que en 50 minutos te deja en pleno centro de Paris.Increibles vacaciones en familia con niños durante el mes de julio, mucho entretenimiento, el resort lindisimo, lo recomendamos altamente para vacaciones de relax y en familia."
40,“Weltoffene Stadt”,"Die Stadt haben wir mitr dem speziellen Flair auf uns wirken lassen. Am Ufer der Seine haben wir uns ausgeruht von Museumsbesuchen u. a.Gefallen hat uns die Hilfsbereitschaft der Franzosen. Wir sprechen deren Sprache nicht, haben aber trotzdem deren Hilfe bekommen. Das war toll."
40,“休暇が取れるなら”,休暇が取れるなら、12月初めのパリはお奨めです。飛行機やホテルの値段もリーズナブルだし、何よりクリスマスのデコレーションがきれい。ファッションの街だけあって、ショーウィンドウを見るだけでも飽きません。　美術館も比較空いていたし、チャンスがあったら、またこの時期に行きたいと思っています。
50,“Paris - die schoene Hauptstadt Frankreichs”,"Paris, die französische Hauptstadt, bietet zahlreich kirchlicher und sehenswerter Parks, Museen, Kunstgalerien und mehr als 10.100 Restaurants. Mein Lieblings-Coffeshop/Restaurant: Bar du Marche des Blancs Manteux bei 53, Rue Vieille du Temple, 4e."
40,“海明威最爱的城市-巴黎”,交通、服务、人文、娱乐样样便捷舒适。有大把便宜舒适的青年旅馆，也有超一流的酒店餐馆。无论“穷游”还是“奢侈游”都是一生至少应该去一次的城市。海明威说：“假如你有机会有幸年轻时来过巴黎，那么你此后一生中无论走到哪里她都与你同在，因为巴黎是一席流动的盛宴。”去过之后，你会发现，他老人家说的是真的！
50,“Paris........”,"París es... París. No hay necesidad de mayores adjetivos para reconocer lo que al viajero sugiere esta ciudad. París es tan intensa como sutil, tan veloz en la vida cotidiana como reposada en las tardes de bohemia, tan moderna como antigua, tan culta como popular; es tan francés, que no se concibe a Francia sin ella. Pero París no es toda Francia, es sólo una parte de este encantador país a cuyo encuentro acudo en cuanto puedo."
50,“La città dell'amore per eccellenza”,"Questa è stata la mia seconda volta a Parigi, ed è stato semplicemente fantastico!! La città è bellissima, i parigini non sono tutti cortesi con i turisti e se non parli francese, non è un loro problema in quanto non tutti conoscono l'inglese e non si sforzano particolarmente per capirti... ma a parte questo, il resto è tutto meraviglioso. Spostarsi è semplice, anche se ci sono 14 linee della Metropolitana e RER, basta avere una piantina e ci si orienta facilmente. Le fermate della metro sono vicinissime tra loro e si raggiungono i posti da visitare molto in fretta. Per chi lo volesse, c'è un sistema di affitto di biciclette (Velib') che permette di affittare le bici per tutta la giornata, basta avere la carta di credito (con microchip) per lasciare la cauzione (150€) e con 1€ si può girare la città: l'importante è lasciare ogni mezz'ora la bici alla stazione di Velib successiva, altrimenti non conviene più!Vi ricordo anche che per tutti i giovani sotto i 26 anni e residenti nell'UE la maggior parte dei monumenti e musei (per esempio Versailles e Louvre) sono GRATIS e altri fanno degli sconti (Tour Eiffel), basta mostrare la carta d'identità.Spero di essere stata utile!"
30,“素敵な場所、でも物価が高い！”,初めてフランス・パリにいきました。初めてだし心躍るような気持ちで到着しました。散歩をしてわかったのですがとにかく地図を見るのが意外と難しく目的地に着くまでかなりてこずりました。。。一本道を間違えると放射線状に道が交差していくのでどんどん遠ざかってしまます。初めてだったので次回から気をつけます・・・それとどこのレストラン、カフェに入ってもとにかく高い！東京より高い感じがしました。二人でコーヒーいっぱいずつ、サラダを一個頼んで３０００円位だったような。。。　パリはそういう街。ということですね。いい勉強になりました。
50,“Le 2ème arrondissement : plongée au coeur du Paris éternel”,"Imaginez :l'Opéra Garnier, la place Vendôme, le Louvre, les Grands Boulevards, l'Olympia, la rue Saint Honoré, le Palais Royal sans compter les nombreux théatres et passages couverts qui jalonnent le quartier. Nous sommes au coeur de Paris.Le Paris historique et culturel dont l'aura continue de diffuser dans le monde entier ce je-ne-sais-quoi de raffinement mêlé de frivolité. Bienvenue dans le 2ème arrondissement de Paris.Mais de la vie de ce quartier, de sa vie authentique, de ses habitants et de ses petits commerces. Que reste-t'il ?Si la carte postale est belle, Paris n'est qu'une coquille vide sans les parisiennes et les parisiens. Vous en apprendrez plus sur ce qu'est ""la movida"" parisienne en passant la porte de cette droguerie plutôt que de vous laisser éblouir par les miroirs aux alouettes disposés à propos pour les touristes. Passez la porte de ce boucher ou de cet artisan boulanger pour en découvrir les spécialités qui régalent les papilles des parisiens.Mais le coeur de la vie parisienne se réduit comme une peau de chagrin. Ce quartier se meurt de la spéculation et les quelques commerçants qui défendent encore un mode de vie ""à la parisienne"" ne tiennent qu'à un fil.C'est pourquoi, lors de votre prochaine visite dans ce beau quartier, n'hésitez pas à emprunter ces petites rues qui vous font quitter les sentiers battus du tourisme. C'est là que nichent ces petits commerces si typiques de la vie quotidienne des parisiens : en un mot le vrai coeur de Paris.Bienvenue dans la ville lumière et que votre séjour soit inoubliable."
50,“Sin dudas la mejor ciudad del mundo!”,"Sin lugar a dudas París es, por lejos, la mejor ciudad del mundo!Con todo su colorido e iluminación, la pasé excelente cuando fui. Por todos lados a donde vas encontrás algún monumento histórico o lugar cultural para visitar, y lo mejor de todo es que todos y cada uno de ellos son preciosos.Desde la Torre Eiffel hasta el Arco del Triunfo, pasando por Notre Damme y por el museo del Louvre, cuando estén de visita en París no pueden perderse absolutamente nada! ¡Todo es impresionante y hermoso!"
40,"“Frankreichs Hauptstadt, am schönsten im Frühjahr”","Frankreichs Hauptstadt Paris ist am schönsten im Frühjahr; alles blüht, die Blätter sprießen und die Stadt der Liebe zeigt sich von der schönsten Seite. Wenn man in Paris ist, darf man die ""Klassiker"" nicht auslassen: Notre Dame, Eiffelturm, Sacre Coeur, Triumphbogen, ... Wenn Sie mit den Öffentlichen unterwegs sein wollen planen Sie aber längere Gehzeiten zwischen den Stationen ein - und das sehr oft ohne Rolltreppen oder Lifte. Unbedingt behindertenfreundlich ist die Stadt nicht, aber trotzdem sehr schön."
40,“Paris - eine tolle Sadt!”,"Paris ist eine wirklich tolle Satdt. Vor allem der Eifelturm begeistert. Man sollte nach Möglichkeit auch hinauffahren,m um einen tollen Blick über die Satdt zu genießen. Natütlich ist auch ein Spaziergang über die Champs-Elysées empfehlenwert. Hier sieht man dann auch den beindruckenden Triumphbpgen."
30,“Pas pendant les greves!”,C'est sympa mais pas pendant les greves... je me suis retrouvee coincee a Roissy pendant 1/2 journee... mais une fois qu'on y est arrive Paris reste une ville fantastique!!!
50,“La più bella città che ho visitato”,"Parigi, fantastica, entusiasmante, sorprendente!!!Tra tutte le città che ho visitato (tra le quali San Francisco, New York, Cuzco, Istambul, Il Cairo, Atene, Londra, Washington, Tunisi, Katmandu.....) ad oggi è l'unica che mi ha di più rallegrato e rilassato.Sono stato con mia moglie per una settimana. Direte di sicuro ""poco"", ma organizzandosi in tempo e marciando giornalmente in lungo e in largo per le avenue o le rue, si riesce a vedere parecchio.Vi consiglio di seguito 7 giorni intensi:1° Giorno: pernottando preferibilmente al centro e più precisamente nei pressi della Gare di S. Lazarre, il primo giorno ci si può incamminare nelle vie del centro, dare uno sguardo a Place Vendome, Museo del Louvre (alcune sezioni) e poi a piedi sino al Centre de Pompidou dove sarà facile trovare un accogliente ristorantino tipico.2° Giorno: Bastille, cimitero degli uomini illustri in fondo alla via De La Rochette, attraversata la Senna visitina all'Istituto del Mondo Arabo e fine dell'itinerario con la visita alla cattedrale di Notre Dame.3° Giorno: trenino e visita a Versailles....e per oggi basta!4° Giorno: Accurata visita della torre Eiffel, del Trocadero e della spianata Di Marte. Fine serata in BATOBUS per un giretto sull'acqua.5° Giorno: Visita al museo D'Orsay, passeggiata per il quartiere di Saint Germain e fine della serata alla Defense per ammirare l'imponente arco illuminato.6° Giorno: Visita al Parco De La Villette in mattinata e per il resto solo ed esclusivamente Montmartre.7° Giorno: se si pernotta al centro che, peraltro ve lo consiglio, passeggiata per gli Champ Elisee sino all'Arco di Trionfo.Consigli:Acquistate al centro per il turismo il pass per la visita ai musei, vi farà evitare le consuete lunghissime file all'entrata dei musei, risparmiando un gran quantità di tempo.Non mi resta che augurarvi buon viaggio e nell'attesa di sentire le vostre emozioni in merito, a presto, Piero Minutoli."

50,“Mein Eck in Paris”,"Paris, eine wunderschöne Stadt, die Stadt der Liebe!!Man muss in Paris viel spazieren gehen und immer wieder einfach von den Touristenwegen ablassen und sich in die Seitengassen dieser wunderschönen Stadt treiben lassen.In diesen kann man immer wieder auf neue wunderschöne Gebäude stoßen oder völlig unerwartet in einem wunderschönen alten Pariser Kaufhaus landen, welches wegen seiner Architektur schon allein bewundernswert ist, dabei geht es nicht um die Waren die angeboten werden sonder um das Gebäude selbst.Also immer von den Touristenpfaden ablassen und die Stadt selbst entdecken."
30,“Paris: GRAN DESILUSION”,"He estado en la Ciudad Luz, muchas veces pero esta vez me ha desilucionado: ! cuantos mendigos pululando sus calles! cuantos africanos?? encimandose para venderte baratijas!! mujeres con ninos pidiendo, desocupados que matan su tiempo y su hambre cantando, por unas monedas en todos los vagones del metro; todo el mundo alertandote contra los carteristas. La ciudad sucia. La comida mala. Dios crei que aun estaba en Caracas. Que ha pasado contigo Paris??Consecuencias de la Comunidad Europea? Mal gobierno? Al compararla con Bruselas, Berlin,Barcelona, sales mal parada. Espero que sea algo pasajero;que vuelva tu brillo!! para que sigas siendo la ciudad mas bella del mundo."
50,“浪漫休闲之都”,09年7月份，一个人出差到巴黎，工作之余有幸游览这座美丽的城市。凯旋门，圣母院，凡尔赛宫，卢浮宫，香榭丽舍大街，每一个景点都让人流连忘返。走在小街小巷，看着咖啡馆里悠闲自得的人们，还有你侬我侬的情侣，真的让人很羡慕他们的悠闲生活。
50,“Must Be in Europa”,"Die Stadt der Liebe kann auch wunderbar als Single erkundet werden. Paris ist einer der Millionenstädte Europas und braucht seine Zeit um erkundet zu werden. Ich würde mindestens 4 Tage veranschlagen und danach 1 – 2 zur Erholung.Zu sehen gibt es viel, vlt. sogar schon fast zu viel, denn die reichhaltige Geschichte von Paris kann man an so fast jeder Strassenecke mitbekommen.Must sees sind auf jeden Fall Eifelturm, Louvre (1 Freitag im Monat kostenfrei und für alle unter 26 generel), Moulin Rouge, Triumph Bogen, Notre Dam und La Defense. Ich werd zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten hier nichts schreiben, da diese in jedem Reiseführer drin stehen.Sich ebenfalls nicht entgehen lassen sollte man jedoch auch die etwas wenig bekannten Attraktionen wie den Friedhof Père Lachaise wo Jim Morrison begraben ist oder Tour Montpernass (http://www.tourmontparnasse56.com/uk/) wo man sich auf der Besucherterasse einen einmaligen Ausblick über Paris ergaffen kann, sehr cool ist das man auf das Dach des Gebäudes gehen kann und man sich fühlt wie auf dem Dach der Welt weil alles um einen herrum unter einen ist (höchste Gebäude Frankreichs)Ebenfalls sollte man die Autosalons und Geschäfte auf der Avenue des Champs-Élysées und den Place de la Concorde nicht entgehen lassen.Paris ist so gigantisch das es sich lohnt ein 3 Tages Ticket für die Metro zu kaufen, Füsse und Schuhe werden es einem Danken und so teuer ist die Metro auch gar nicht.Was jedoch teuer ist, ist der Rest. Paris ist überall teuer und daher sollte man Preise vergleichen und nicht direkt vor dem Eifelturm seinen Milch Kaffee trinken. Die kleinen Gassen in der Gegend um das Moulin Rouge sind dafür eh viel besser geeignet, dort bekommt ein wenig echtes Frankreich geboten. Bezüglich Übernachtunden sollte man sich klar machen, dass auch die Hotel Zimmer recht teuer sind und ich eher für ein Hotel der grossen Ketten gehen würde, weil man dort sicher seien kann auch etwas für sein Geld zu bekommen. Ausserhalb gelegene Hotels sind jedoch eine Überlegung wert da man mit der Metro eh von überall nach überall in Paris kommt."
40,“Parigina per una settimana”,"Per una settimana mi sono sentita parigina! Ho alloggiato in una casetta al quarto piano nelle vicinanze della stazione Telegraph del Metrò. Al mattino andavo a fare colazione al bar sotto casa e mi stordivo con profumo dei croassant prima di andare al supermaret dove incontravo una variopinta umanità multietnica. Per tutta la giornata, poi, in giro per vie, piazze, monumenti, bistrò come una donna qualunque, non una turista. Sono passata dalle grandi emozioni della Gioconda e della Tour Eiffel, alle piccole gioie dei mercatini e delle crepes alla nutella vendute per strada. La sera una scappata nelle zone chic come gli Champes Elysee o una sosta al quartiere latino nel ricordo di Touluse Lutrec per un buon bicchiere di vino in un bistrò. Mi hanno colpito molte le donne: eleganti, fantasiose non omologate come le italiane griffate fino all'esasperazione. Tornerò presto in quell'appartamentino per sentirmi di nuovo parigina per una settimana."
10,"“Parking en Paris, la verdad verdadera”","bueno, como española que soy, he visitado muuuuchos parkings en españa, no solo en pueblos, sino tambien en capitales, y no tienen nada que ver con el estrangero, y más concretamente, en Paris. contratamos por internet en parking de paris el parking para 1 semana en el centro de paris, el de Saint laurent.en primer lugar, al llegar nos encontramos con un garage minusculo, muy estrecho, y hombre que no habla ni español, ni inglés, ni na de na, solo francés. nos dice que tenemos que aparcar, y darle la llave. ¿LA LLAVE DE MI COCHE? si, asi es, super raro, nos vamos al hotel, y nos dijeron que era lo más normal, pero como no nos fiabamos, nos llevamos toda la documentación del coche, y nos apuntamos los kilometros hechos. te dan un mini papel como garantía. eso si, NO LO PERDAIS!!!!!! ya que sin él, se quedan tu coche. A nosotros nos pasó que no lo encontrabamos, y no nos querían dar la llave de nuestro propio coche, aún siendo el mismo hombre el que nos atendió, muy desagradable, tener cuidado, por eso es importante llevarse toda la documentacion del coche, porque aún a malas, se acude a la policia.pero eso no es todo, cuando nos vamos a llevar el coche, no dice, (bueno eso intentó, porque solo habla en francés) que tenemos que pagar un dia más. le explicamos que no, que ya está pagado, le enseñamos la factura, una y otra vez, y que no, que si no pagamos 1 dia más, el coche no se mueve de ahí. ya indignada, despues de la semanita que llevabamos, yo accedo a pagar, pero que lo voy a denunciar, que le iva a poner una reclamación que se acordaía de mi, y fué oir reclamacióbn, que mira por donde el hombre se acordó de un papel en el que pone que lo habia pagado, en fin, si podeis, no lleveis el coche, o aparcar en otro lado, yo, lo tengo claro, no volverá a pasarme..."

50,“Die Traumstadt”,"Paris ist eine der schönsten Städte der Welt!!!Es gib ein vielseitiges Kulturangebot. Hunderte Museern und Gallerien in der ganzen Stadt sowie Straßenkünstler.Das Palais de Louvre ist auf jeden Fall einen Besuch Wert, ich habe aber das Centre Pompidou und vor allen das Musee d´Orsay viel mehr genossen. Besonders letzteres gilt als mein Lieblingsmuseum überhaupt! In einem alten Bahnhof, ist das Gebäude an sich schon ein Traum; dazu noch die berühmtesten Werke der Impressionisten....ich habe einen ganzen Tag da verbracht und würde noch mal gerne hingehen!Notre Dam ist auch ein Besuch Wert, genau so wie der Arc de Triomphe und natürlich der Eiffelturm, den man auf jeden Fall auch Abends besuchen sollte.In Paris sollte man auf jeden Fall sich eine Woche Zeit nehmen um all das zu besichtigen und dann noch die wunderbaren Viertel zu erkunden. Montmartre, Quartier Latin, Montparnasse, St. Germain und vieles mehr."
40,“Immer Magnifique”,"Paris bedeutet eine Explosion der Sinne. Keine Kompromisse im Hinblick auf Schönheit, Geschmack und Musik. Es ist immer eine schöne Reiseziel - sowie im Sommer als auch im Winter weil auch das Wetter kann das Vergnügen nicht verderben. Furchtbar teuer, manchmal launisch, ist Paris das Weltzentrum der Mode, Küche, Kunst und High Class."
10,“schmutzig teuer faszinierend”,"paris ist eine stadt, die man am besten genießen könnte, wenn man weder schlafen noch essen müßte oder aber geld keine rolle spielt. hotels liegen von der sternebewertung zumeist weit unter dem gewohnten deutschen standard. man sollte nur in solche restaurants gehen die einem tunlichst von bekannten empfohlen werden. das kulturelle angebot gleicht vieles aus"
40,“Vive la France”,Paris muss man mindestens zweimal im Jahr besuchen!
50,“Ein einzigartiges Ambiente”,"Paris ist eine zauberhafte Stadt mit einem ganz eigenen Flair. Mit der Metro kommt man schnell vom einen zum anderen Ende der Stadt und vom Tour Montparnasse oder dem Eiffelturm hat man einen sehr schönen Blick auf die Stadt. Es lohnt sich, einfach mal an der Seine spazieren zu gehen. Besonders die Kirchen sind sehr reizvoll, Notre Dame, Sacré-Cœur (wobei man dort vor Trickbetrügern auf der Hut sein sollte), Saint-Germain-des-Prés, um nur einige zu nennen. Aber auch die Gärten wie der Jardin du Luxembourg sind eine Besichtigung wert. Unzählige Museen laden ein, der Louvre ist dabei natürlich ein absolutes Muss."
20,“pas ce que j'attendais”,"Moi qui pensais passer un bon week-end, et bien j'ai été déçue par le comportement des vendeurs, des gens dans la rue, très hautains et pas voir peu aimables.Pas franchement l'envie d'y retourner."
50,“La mejor ciudad del mundo”,"Fui a Paris dos veces en mi vida, y sin duda es la ciudad que mas me gusta del mundo, desde sus calles, su luz, su arquitectura, magnificos museos, atracciones todo el año...nunca te va a defraudar pasar tus dias en Paris, los bares y restaurantes son perfectos, y sus boutiques son una muestra perfecta del glamour parisino.En sus calles se respira arte, historia y romanticismo.¿que recomendaria?, no pueden pasar por Paris sin darse una vuelta por la orilla del Sena, hasta llegar al museo D' Orsy (un museo precioso en su arquitectura como en las obras que engalanan sus salas), luego una relajada comida en alguno de los preciosos ""bistro"" que abundan en la ciudad, contemplar las vistas de Paris desde Mont Matre, o tomar un delicioso cocktail en el mejor hotel de Paris (y uno de los mas emblematicos del mundo), el Ritz.Si amas la historia, una visita a la Concergerie, te transportara a los ultimos dias de la reina Maria Antonieta. Aunque si te sobra algun dia, es impensable no pasar el dia en Versailles, visitando el palacio, los Triagnones, y por que no, hacer un picnic en los preciosos jardines de Versailles, donde podras pasar una tarde de ensueño, explorando sus recovecos y preciosas fuentes; y hasta podras alquilar una bici alli mismo, para que el paseo sea inolvidable....Podria seguir hablando de este maravilloso destino durante horas, me resulta inspirador y de una belleza sin parangon. Que lo disfruten tanto como yo lo hice, y sin duda, seguire haciendo!!!!."
40,“Paris ist einen Besuch wert”,"Paris ist eine recht elegante Stadt. Sie ist allerdings auch sehr weitläufigt und oft gibt es rund um die Sehenswürdigkeiten nur Touristenneppgeschäfte. Ich hatte nur zwei Tage und bin von einer Touristattraktion zur nächsten geeilt und war schon am Ende des ersten Tages total erschöpft - und ich war noch nichteinmal Shoppen!! Überhaupt Shoppen: Dior und Co habe ich gefunden, aber etwas günstiger sollte es halt schon sein - vom Angebot zu normalen Preisen war ich jedenfalls enttäuscht. Klar gab es auch H&M etc, aber ich wollte etwas, was ich nur dort bekomme - zum Schluss hatte ich nur Kleinigkeiten im Gepäck. Im Vergleich zu London fand ich das schon ziemlich enttäuschend."
50,“Paris ist ganz einfach Paris”,"Paris ist wirklich einen Besuch wert. Selbst wer kein Geld für Eintritt ausgeben möchte, bekommt hier viel zu sehen. Am besten man erkundet Paris zu Fuß. Überall gibt es etwas zu sehen. Wer die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten abhacken möchte, der kommt mit der Metro schnell überall hin. Im Vergleich zu manch anderen Großstätten ist die Metro relativ günstig. Am besten man kauft ein ""Carnet"" - 10 Fahrkarten für 10 Einzelfahrten zu einem vergünstigten Preis. Essengehen ist relativ teuer. Selbst die üblichen Fast Food Ketten bieten ihre Burger & Co zu höheren Preisen als in Deutschland an (Halber Liter Cola 5 Euro!) Tipp: Oft findet man in den Seitenstraßen der Shoppingmeilen Supermärkte und kleine Geschäfte, die zu relativ günstigen Preisen Brötchen und Gebäck anbieten."
50,“巴黎”,非常经典的一个城市，浪漫之都啊，怀念，还想去，不足的就是确实卫生差了一点啊；但是卢浮宫、凯旋门、协和广场，哇塞，都是经典中的经典
30,“Ich war etwas enttäuscht”,"Ok. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten in Paris haben mich umgehauen (vor allem La Defense). Ich schaue die Städte immer auch an als potentieller Einwohner. Zum Leben wäre Paris nichts für mich. Ubahn ist katastrophal. Man macht unterirdisch sehr viele Kilometer. Ubahn ist oft dreckig, immer wieder tropft Wasser. Kaum Aufzüge/Rolltreppen. Manchmal verleirt die Ubahn Strom.Nur die automatisierte Linie (ohne Fahrer) war sehr schön. Andere Sache was mir in Paris nicht gefallen hat war Müll auf den Strassen. Viel zu oft für solche Stadt. Deswegen die neutrale Bewertung"
40,“ノートルダム寺院”,初パリ！ということで、観光名所をまわりました。有名なバラ窓もしっかりみれましたし、セーヌ川沿いには露店がたくさんでていて、素敵な絵を購入。絵といっても、手のひらサイズのもので、値段も８ユーロ。お土産にもよろこばれました。
50,“FINAL FOUR”,"Estuve en Paris la primera semana de Mayo con cuatro matrimonios amigos, el motivo del viaje era hacer algo de turismo y ver al Barça ganar la Final Four en su tercer intento en Paris. Los dos anteriores me tuve que conformar con solo el turismo, que no es poco.Nos hospedamos entre la estación de Lyon y el pavellón de Bercy, situación exelente para visitar la ciudad y acudir a presenciar los partidos.Paris siempre vale una visita, aunque se pague un precio elevado. Buenos espectáculos, museos espectaculares, buena comida y bebida, y sobretodo conocer la ciudad. Es muy aconsejable recorrerla por zonas, a pie, montado en los autobuses turísticos y en barco por el Sena. Asi te haces una idea real de lo que es Paris, en todas sus prespectivas.Era mi septima visita y de aqui a un tiempo pienso volver.¡Y lo mejor fue que el Barça gano.!"
40,“Parigi per la prima volta........bellissima”,"Bellissima Parigi che non avevamo mai visitato, abbiamo fatto 6 giorni cercando di vedere tutto quello che potevamo, un amico nato e vissuto lì ci ha portato in giro in lungo e in largo.......non potevamo non visitare il Louvre.....in parte perchè ci vorrebbe u na settimana a vederlo tutto, poi il museo d'Orsay veramente bellissimo, Notre Dame, Sacro Cuore, Montmartre ecc. ecc.abbiamo veramente visto tanto di Parigi che dopo altre capitali europee non mi aspettavo fosse così GIGANTESCA è veramente immensa e bellissima........Il ns. hotel era a Rueil Malmeison carino pulito ma non centrale, va bene solo se avete l'auto, d'altra parte lo avevo scelto io perchè vicino alla casa del fratello del ns. amico.Versailles bellissima,,,,,,,,,,abbiamo fatto un giro col trenino nei giardini, poi noleggiato le bici e abbiamo fatto tutto il giro del lago immenso.........e tutti i giardini. Meno male che ci sono le bici perchè a piedi sarebbe persino noioso.....Bellissimo da non dimenticare il villaggio di Maria Antonietta.........."
50,"“Eine meiner liebsten Städte, für kurzbesuche und auch Urlaube”","jedesmal wenn ich nach Paris komme denke ich mir ""Diese Stadt lebt"". Schon am Flughafen hab ich das Gefühl, und spätestens am Gare du Nord, wenn ich vom RER B in die Metro umsteige bin ich mir sicher angekommen zu sein. So viele verschiedene Menschen, gestresst bis relaxed, jung bis alt, ...Ein bißchen Hektik überall aber trotzdem nicht unfreundlich wenn man als Gast jemanden irgendetwas fragt.Von den Sehenswürdigkeiten hier zu schreiben würde zu keinem Ende führen. Ich freu mich auf alle Fälle schon auf das nächste Mal"
50,“Meine lieblings Stadt”,Die schönste architektur und eine der schönsten städte der Welt. Bin stunden lang spazieren gegangen und habe immer noch was zu entdecken gehabt: Super infrastruktur und sehr schöne kleine gassen.
30,“Paris - romantisch aber überfüllt”,"Ich wollte schon immer mal nach Paris, aber so ganz zufrieden war ich dann doch nicht. Hotelzimmer sind in Paris ziemlich teuer und winzig (wirklich sehr klein). Mit der U-Bahn kommt man überall hin. Das Essen ist gut (Baguettes sollte man ausprobieren, schmecken dort einfach super). Es gibt viele Sehenswürdigkeiten, aber leider sind sogar außerhalb der Saison soviele Touristen die überall stundenlang Schlange stehen, dass man gerne darauf verzichtet sich einige Sehenswürdigkeiten anzusehen. Leider :-(."
50,“Eine Stadt mit ganz besonderem Charme”,"Eine Stadt voll von verschiedener Kulturen - einerseits harmonisch, andererseits chaotisch miteinander und nebeneinander lebend - einfach spannend. Die Stadt besticht durch ihre Diversität und durch ihre Kontraste. Zum einen spürt und sieht man an allen Ecken und Enden die ausgeprägte Geschichte Frankreichs - spürt diese Liebe zur eigenen Tradition. Auf der anderen Seite erlebt man Chaos Schmutz und Gestank wobei auch hier nie diese unverkennbare Elegance ausbleibt."
50,“Silvester in Paris”,"Wir waren zum Jahreswechsel 2009/2010 in Paris und habenvon dort sehr viele tolle Eindrücke mitgenommen. Auch wenn es in Paris kein Feuerwerk gibt, war es sehr schön den Eifelturm in verschiedenen Farben zu sehen und das neue Jahr an der Seine zu beginnen."
40,“Paris - immer eine Reise wert”,Ich war im Juni 2010 wieder mal für drei Wochen in Paris und diese Stadt ist immer wieder faszinierend. Einfach nur entlang der Seine schlendern oder einen Kaffee trinken. Da ich auf einer Geschäftsreise war blieb wenig Zeit für die Museen.
40,“paris o paris”,paris ist eine stadt die man auf jedenfall mal in seinem leben gesehen hben sollte.wenn man durch die straßen geht wird man vn der anderen lebenseinstellugn der franzosen einfach mitgerissen.durch die zahlreichen sehenswürdigkeiten lohnt sich auch ein zweiter besuch auf jedenfall.meine besondere empfehlung: das künstlerviertel.
40,“Meravigliosa Parigi”,"Meravigliosa Parigi! siamo andati io e la mia ragazza la settimana prima di Natale, un freddo boia. Abbiamo soggiornato in un Hotel economico vicino alla tour eiffel prenotando dal sito www.youcantravel.eu . Parigi va visitata in almeno 5 giorni secondo me. c'è molto da vedere, molti monumenti e bellissimi paesaggi. Se vi capita andate pure nei quartier latin, molto caratteristici e romantici. Fate un buon viaggio a Parigi Ciao!"
50,“巴黎”,"所有的欧洲城市,都拥有自己的味道.有的城市走来相似其他.但是巴黎绝对是自有风味.在市中心,所见建筑几乎都是法式文艺复兴式样,并且高度受到规范,因此不只风格统一,还有视野宽阔.是会来再来的地方."
40,“paris france”,"paris hat sich zum besseren entwickelt. besonders gut für turis sind die fahrräder, die man überall benützen kann. einzig die preise sind hoch."
50,“Cidade Luz”,"A cidade é realmente linda, a arquitetura é exuberante. É uma cidade para andar a pé e descobrir cada um de seus encantos. O transporte público, metrô, trens e ônibus, é de boa qualidade e pontual, dá pra andar bem com auxílio de mapas. a cidade é muito bem sinalizada."
50,“La nostra settimana a Parigi (dal 18 al 22/08/2010)”,"16-08-2010Arrivo all'aeroporto di Beauvais (BVA) da Bologna - siamo in 2 - Compagnia Ryanair (precisazione: tutte le borse e borselli devono essere riposti nell'unica valigia; se si ha il bagaglio a mano la valigia non viene pesata (max 10 Kg) ma vengono controllate le misure di ingombro nell'apposito ""aggeggio"".(le ns Tratte sono state: Bari-Bologna-Parigi all'andata; ritorno Parigi-Bari)Piove - Il pullman ci attende (scritta grande Ryanair non ci si può sbagliare); qualcosa più di un'ora per arrivare a ""Porte Maillot"" dall'aeroporto (biglietto 15€ - a/r 30€ - c'è il botteghino).l'aeroporto è veramente lontano da Parigi.Prima di entrare in metro abbiamo fatto il ""Pass Navigo Decouverte"" x 1 settimana zona 1-5 (:33.40€ la ricarica settimanale + 5€ x la tessera (comprende oltre alla metro (zone 1-2), tutti i treni (linee A, B, C, D) le linee speciali T + la funicolare di Montmartre)E' stato solo un pò difficile spiegare all'operatore che tessera volevamo - non parla l'italiano.Precisazione: il Pass potrebbe bloccarsi sul lettore ottico - l'operatore vi sbloccherà la porta di accesso x farvi passare.Albergo alla fermata ""Goncurt"" abbiamo preso 2 Metro da Porte Maillot per arrivarci (in totale dall’aeroporto più di 2 ore x arrivare in albergo)La camera è un buco ma molto pulita, pagamento del saldo all'arrivo. rilasciata regolare fattura.curiosità: bagno con lavandino e doccia ed un altro bagnetto con solo il Wc. (niente bidet)le fermate della Metro ""Republique"" e ""Chatelet"" ci sono sembrate nodi fondamentali per raggiungere tutti i monumenti di Parigi.Consiglio vivamente di scegliere l'albergo su queste 2 linee della Metropolitana (ci sono in totale 14 linee)La metro passa ogni 2 minuti nelle ore di punta. la sera ogni 4 minuti. la domenica ogni 7 minuti. chiusura alle ore 1.00 solo il sabato alle ore 2.00 di notte.Tra Metro, Pullman e treno preferire sempre la Metro (se si perde il treno, per il prossimo ci vorranno non meno di 15 minuti)Se cercate supermercati per fare la spesa non ne troverete nelle zone prettamente turistiche ma solo nei quartieri popolari.16-08-2010 dopo l’arrivo in albergo (hotel ""International"" stanza n.13) e una piccola spesuccia al supermercato ci siamo recati alla Torre Eiffel.I biglietti sono stati acquistati dal sito internet (giorno ed ora prestabiliti). Avevamo l’accesso preferenziale – salita ore 21 al tramonto (bellissima la Torre Eiffel illuminata).Tra Accesso Nord, Sud, Est ed Ovest c’erano circa 1.000 persone in coda (siamo passati davanti a tutti).Preferite la salita in ascensore alle scale. (se c’è troppa gente viene chiuso l’accesso alla Torre dalle scale)Ci sono 2 ascensori che salgono fino al 2^ piano – si scende – si prende un altro ascensore che porta al 3^ piano (in cima fa freddino).Abbiamo trovato un bel po’ di fila per scendere.17-08-2010Champs-Elysees.Passeggiata sulla via “di lusso” della città. Ci sono tutti i negozi dei marchi più famosi.Stradone alberato verso l’Arco di Trionfo.Su questo stradone c’è il Negozio Fnac da dove abbiamo ritirato i biglietti per il Museo d’Orsay e del Louvre comprati online (ho mostrato carta di identità e carta di credito)Arrivo all’arco di Trionfo dove non siamo saliti.Visita alla cattedrale di Notre Dame. Una bella fila per entrare. Per visitare la chiesa non si paga nulla se si vuole salire fino in cima (più di 300 gradini) si pagano 8€ e c’è una fila interminabile.Prossima tappa Pont Neff e relativo giardino.Museo d’Orsay nel pomeriggio. Non abbiamo gradito molto.In serata passeggiata nei pressi dell'Hotel De Ville.Quartiere ""Marais"" - pieno di locali e molto frequentato.18-08-2010Piazza della Bastiglia – c’è solo il monumento.Da qui si prende il battello del Canauxrama (fermata metro “Bastille”) che passa sotto la (ex) Bastiglia.Visita al Phanteon – Pendolo di Foucault – Patrona di Parigi (Santa Genoveffa) – sotterranei tombe di Hugo e Rousseau.Nelle vicinanze visita all’Università della Sorbonne.Visita al ""Centre Pompidou"" - siamo rimasti un po’scettici.Nel pomeriggio Louvre. Entrata dalla Piramide. Fila scorrevole.Tutti gli italiani erano nella sala dedicata alla Monna Lisa.Serata Torre Montparnasse. Siamo saliti fino al 59° Piano - lo sconsiglio.19-08-2010 DisneylandArriviamo prima delle 10.00 (apertura)i biglietti Francilien devono essere convertiti.Fila alle casse.Mai vista tanta gente tutta assieme.A tutte le attrazioni ci sono file che vanno dai 60 agli 80 minuti.Il fast pass è inutile nel pomeriggio. Permette l'entrata senza fila solo dopo 5-6 ore.Sinceramente le giostre non sono un gran che.La coda è astutamente nascosta (all’ombra) per non “demoralizzare la gente”.Abbiamo assaggiato la mela caramellata.Primo spettacolo danzante al centro della piazza alle 17.30.Spettacolo finale con i fuochi alle 22.30Siamo entrati solo nel Parco principale. In una giornata è impossibile visitare i 2 parchi.Per la cena di Buffalo Bill l’attrazione è tra il 1^ e il 2^ Parco.In serata cena in un ristorantino giapponese (costa meno dell’Italia) e passeggiata a Pigalle.Ci sono una miriade di sexy shop e di locali di lap dance.I prezzi sono accessibili sia per pranzo/cena sia per i souvenirs.Ci siamo fermati al Moulin Rouge. Fila di 4 isolati per entrare alle 21 – cena + spettacolo 102€.20-08-2010Reggia di VersaillesBiglietto comprato online (“Passport”) fila lunghissima ma scorrevole per entrare.Sinceramente meglio la Reggia di Caserta.Prendiamo il pulmino (a/r 6,50€) per visitare i giardini e la residenza estiva di Maria Antonietta. A piedi è una bella scarpinata di 2 ore.Giro in barca a remi sul Canal Grande.Tardo pomeriggio visita ai giardini di Tuileries e all’Invalides.Siamo passati dall’Opera e siamo entrati nella vicina galleria la Fayette (prezzi da urlo)In serata siamo andati al Buddha Bar accanto all’ambasciata Americana.21-08-2010Visita (gratuita) al Castello di Vincennes (non c’era nessuno)In seguito visita alla chiesa del Sacro Cuore di Montmartre (funivia gratis con il pass Navigo).Non è possibile effettuare foto.Ottimi prezzi x pranzare/cenare e per comprare souvenirs.Visita al nuovo arco di Trionfo alla ""Defence"" (immenso). E' la zona dei nuovi grattacieli di Parigi.Pomeriggio Palazzo di ""Luxembourg"" e relativi giardini inglesi.Museo dell’Orangerie (gratuito)In serata giro sul Bateaux mouches “Canauxrama”. (solo andata sul Canale Saint Martin)Passiamo sotto la Bastiglia. Bello il sistema delle chiuse anche se ce ne sono un po’ troppe.Tutti i parigini sono sulle rive del canale seduti a bere qualcosa. Bella atmosfera.22-08-2010Partenza per Bari"
40,“憧れの？パリ”,人がとても多いのに驚きましたが、やっぱりパリはおしゃれな街だなと思いました。そのへんにあるカフェ、公園などなんでも絵になるかんじ。モンマルトルは裏のなんでもないような道を歩くのもおすすめです。シテ島も歩いているだけでパリの雰囲気が味わえてよかった。かわいいものを売っているお店もありました。スリが多いので気をつけて！改札口に強引に一緒に入ってくる人、注意をひきつけて別人がかばんを開ける・・なんてことが３回ほどありました。あとのみの市、楽しかったです。
30,“Stadt der Liebe? Muss wohl in der Vergangenheit so gewesen sein”,"Sicher gehört Paris nicht zu den 10 grössten Flops aber sie verspricht mehr als sie hält.Kino und Geschichten erzählen von der Stadt der Liebe, na ja dies habe ich leider nicht erlebt.Die Hotels sind ganz okay, da gibts für jeden was. Luxus bis einfach ist zu haben.Das Essen kann super sein, sofern man sich auskennt oder sich erst mit einem Guide erkundigt.Die Sehenswürdigkeiten, schön aber nichts Weltbewegendes. Romantik kommt wahrlich keine auf, vorallem nicht beim ganzen Müll der am Abend auf der Strasse liegt.Paris lebt von seinen Geschichten und von dem was die Film Industrie daraus gemacht hat. Da hat Frankreich mehr zu bieten. Man findet einfach ein kleines Schlösschen, mit super Restaurants auf dem Land."
40,“我真的很爱你 巴黎”,很慢的都市 到处都是艺术品 到处都是咖啡厅 精品打折超爽地铁有自己开门的老地铁到新是小轻轨 1~13区 都逛不完我在16区 按到一间房要卖 好想买 因为 房价比上海便宜 哈哈 离罗浮宫很近我还想去 每年都要去
50,“Una ciudad encantadora”,"Yo estuve tan sólo cinco días y no es suficiente para ver todo lo que allí te espera. Es una ciudad muy cómoda para caminar por ella, al menos en agosto, pues tuve la suerte de que los días erán cálidos, ni frío ni calor, nada de lluvia y nada de sol. Por ponerle un pero, si quieres comer comida francesa y buena tienes que pagar mucho dinero, los restaurantes más o menos económicos tienen una comida malísima. La próxima vez que vaya como en restaurantes italianos o en MacDonalds. Fui a París en coche desde Girona pasando por Marsella, Lyon, etc,... y volví a Girona por los valles del Loira, Carcassone, etc,... una semana para ir y otra para volver además de los días que estuve en París y solamente comía bien cuando iba a los restaurantes caros, pero caros de verdad. Al final decidí que era mejor adelgazar yo que mi bolsillo y volví a España con 3 kilos menos. Lo que nunca, en vacaciones bajar de peso. Ahora, Francia entera es preciosa, los paisajes, los castillos, las playas a las que fui, las montañas, etc,.... volveré aunque tenga que comer gusanos."
10,“Una pesadilla”,"Hola viajeros, espero que esta crítica sirva para concienciar a aquel/lla que vaya a Francia con la ilusión de su vida. Para mi ha sido con diferencia el peor viaje de mi vida.Soy una persona que me encanta descubrir nuevas culturas sean como sean pero lo que yo vivi alli no se lo deseo a nadie. En primer lugar comentar que si te vas a gastar dinero para ver Eurodisney mas vale que te lo gastes para ir a Port Aventura en Cataluña que le da mil patadas (lo peor es que encima se creen Disneyworld en Orlando).Y si llevas crios, ten por cuenta que no vas a entender nada de nada porque aunque resulte inverosimil y el español sea un idioma de mucha mas extension mundial que el frances, no habia nada ni un cartel, ni un solo espectaculo en español!! eso si, en todos los demas idiomas si eh?.Los empleados del centro ni te miraban a la cara cuando les comprabas o preguntabas algo..en fin...vergonzoso e indignante si encima el que les preguntaba era un niño y se daba cuenta del desprecio, imaginaos...Ya en Paris..., en fin pobre ciudad, porque es bonita pero la gente con su pesimo comportamiento le quita todo encanto.El hotel sucisimo a rabiar, un tres estrellas casi cuatro que en España no llega ni a la suela de los zapatos a la pension mas cutre (asi alucinan como alucinan cuando vienen).Solo os dire que no podiamos mover la cortina porque caian bichos a punta pala...sin aire acondicionado y moqueta con medio metro de suciedad era irrespirable, les pides un ventilador y directamente SE RIEN en tu cara, si si , se rieron con toda la mala fe que comporta, de verdad el tema es digno de estudio porque a la gente que encontre en este pais no se que les pasa en el cerebro, si me dicen que han hecho todos un master en groseria y mala educacion me lo creo seguro vamos.Ya de turismo por la ciudad, puedo deciros que por primera y unica vez en mi vida senti en mis carnes lo que es ser discriminado por nacionalidad. Increible verdad en esta epoca y un pais vecino y europeo?pues si, nos trataron fatal por ser españoles hasta el punto de llamarnos borregos y españoles de....por hacer una consulta mas larga de lo habitual en un puesto de informacion porque nos costaba mas entender que a quien domine el frances.Por la calle olvidate de pedir ayuda porque directamente te giran la cara.En la principal estacion de trenes no nos quisieron atender en español (comprendo que no lo entiendan) ni en ingles perfectamente hablado (hablaba una traductora de idiomas) pero a los ingleses de detras les atendieron estupendamente oye....Denunciable. Y para rematar, tanto alardear de la gastronomia del pais....fatal!! ahi lo entendi todo!! tienen una enviadia a los españoles que no pueden con ella!!!!! por eso nos tratan asi...porque ni en un cinco tenedores comes bien (por experiencia) y atencion con la falta de higiene en general en el pais, porque en el megarestaurante de lujazo te sirven el pan con las manos de toquetearlo todo y las jarras de agua las van rellenando de unas a otras...En fin, que gastronomia mala, hoteles vergonzosos, amabilidad y educacion inexistentes y digno de estudio y analisis sociologico,higiene desconocida para ellos.....A los que vayais: paciencia y estómago!!"
50,“Die Stadt der Liebe”,Diese Stadt ist auf jednfall einen Besuch wert. Sehr zu empfehlen ist es den Eifelturm bei Nacht zu erleben. Zum Beispiel an Silvester findet eine überwältigende Lichtershow statt. Der Turm schimmert in den verschiedensten Farben.Die beste Sicht hat man von der Seine auf der Gegenüberligenden Uferseite. Dort kann man die Lichtershow hautnah erleben. Sehr romantisch.
50,“Die Romantische an der Seine”,"Besuchern von Paris möchte ich dringend ans Herz legen mehr als ein Wochenende dort zu bleiben und sich so Zeit zu nehmen für die Schönheiten der Stadt, jenseits der großen Touristenmagnete! Die Metropole verströmt in ihren Gassen ein unglaubliches Flair, welches sich besonders im Frühling und Spätsommer mit Leichtigkeit genießen lässt. Für die weltlichen Genüsse sollte das Urlaubsbudget von vorn herein reichlich geplant werden, vor Ort verzichtet man ungern auf die kulinarischen Finessen, die einem dargeboten werden."

40,“Immer eine Reise wert”,"Paris gehört meiner Meinung nach zu jenen Städten, die man zu jeder Jahreszeit besuchen kann. Neben den offensichtlichen Wahrzeichen wie Louvre, Eiffelturm, Champs-Eylsées, ... hat Paris auch fern ab der Touristenscharen vieles zu bieten. In zahlreichen kleinen Parks kann man auch im lebhaften Paris Ruhe zum Verweilen finden. Auch wenn man sagen muss, dass sich diese Stadt nicht gerade durch seine Sauberkeit auszeichnet, gibt es viel zu entdecken.."
40,“Paris - eine Stadt zum Verlieben und Staunen”,"Paris ist eine wunderschöne Stadt. Sie bietet eine Reihe von Sehenswürdigkeiten wie die Basilika Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre, eine der schönsten und originellsten Kirchen der Welt mit Ausblick auf die ganze Stadt oder die Champs Elysee, die sicherlich zu den grössten Shopping Strasse der weltweiten Metropolen gehört. Man sollte in Restaurants und Bars in Paris eher Wein bestellen, da man ansonsten für 0.5 Liter Bier schonmal 8 Euro zahlt.Für einen Besuch des Musee de Louvre sollte man viel Zeit einplanen, die vor allem zum Warten dient. Es scheint als würde die ganze Welt jeden Tag in dieses Museum gehen wollen, so lang ist die Schlange davor. Alternativ bietet sich aber auch ein Besuch im Musee Rodin, Musee Picasso oder Musee d'Orsay an. Kulturell bietet Paris sehr viel.Auch ein Spaziergang durch die Fussgängerzone direkt beim Cafe Hugo am Place des Vosges lohnt sich. Dort lernt man die wirklichen Pariser kennen und deren Art einen Sonntag in einem schönen Cafe an einem Ort ohne Touristen zu verbringen."
20,"“Che bella, ma noi italiani proprio non esistiamo...”","Sono appena tornata da Parigi dove mi sono recata in ferie con il mio compagno e mio figlio di 12 anni. Passi che gli hotel siano un pò vecchiotti ma tutto sommato accettabili, grandi perchè la maggior parte dei musei sono gratuiti per i ragazzi, servita molto bene la metro anche se cara a sangue e non meno care tutte le formule di paris visite, ma quello che mi ha lasciata sconcertata sono state le baguette e croissaint surgelati serviti in hotel e ristoranti oltre al costo del noleggio del velib(biciclette) non spiegato proprio chiaramente nelle colonne di servizio!Vi esorto a prestare attenzione al bagaglio con cui viaggiate, ma non per il furto, bensì per il peso ; infatti se viaggiate con Air France ogni valigia deve pesare al massimo 23 Kg e non cumulabili... per meglio intenderci se 3 persone hanno a disposizione 23 Kg ognuna devono fare 3 valige da 23 Kg ( o meno ) e non una da 30, una da 14 e una da 28. Questa è una nuova disposizione della compagnia ci hanno detto, solo al ritorno però; all'imbarco a Bologna infatti non ci hanno fatto storie se la valigia pesava 28 Kg.Vogliamo poi parlare delle indicazioni stradali: capito il fatto di seguire i numeri delle strade e non le località da raggiungere non è semplice lo stesso saltarci fuori... indicazioni inesistenti o Km prima o addirittura coperti da altri! Un incubo.Noi italiani poi siamo sempre ben considerati dai francesi: oltre a non esserci quasi nessuno a parlarlo, quando sentono che sei italiano fanno la faccia scocciata e insofferente. Non parliamo poi delle guide, o hanno l'audioguida o l'italiano lo trovi solo nei depliant informativi molto striminziti. Però che bella!!!!!"

50,"“Paris, Großstadt mit Charme und viel mehr als nur Eiffelturm”","Bei einem Besuch dieser wundervollen Stadt sollten Sie sich nicht ausschließlich auf den Besuch der drei bekanntesten Sehenswürdigkeiten , dem Eiffelturm, Arc de Triumpf oder dem Musée du Louvre beschränken. Entdecken Sie diese tolle Stadt und Ihre versteckten Ecken über diese Must-go's hinaus!Neben den 3 bekanntesten Sehenswürdigkeiten ist auch stets Montmatre ein Besuch wert. Auf dem Pariser Berg tront die Sacre-Coeur und strahlt in Ihrem prächtigen weiß herrlich herab. Von der Aussichtsplattform haben Sie außerdem einen herrlichen Blick auf die Stadt der Liebe. Doch beschränken Sie sich nicht nur auf diese Sehenswürdigkeit und erkunden Sie Montmatre etwas zu Fuß. Der Aufwand wird sich lohnen. In kleinen Gässchen verstecken sich wuderbare Bars, Restaurants und Lädchen, die die Pariser Patisseriekunst zur Vollendung bringen.Neben Montmatre sind immer das Hotel de Ville, das Pariser Rathaus, die Oper, die Champs-Elysées anschließender Place de la Concorder, Napoleons Grab das Hotel des Invalides ein Besuch wert.Die Pariser Metro wird Sie überall zuverlässig hinbringen."

50,“Neve em Paris”,"Visite Paris no inverno, pois é muito charmoso e você ainda pode encontrar neve. Se for o caso, vá jantar na Torre Eiffel que a vista é maravilhosa e também muito romântico. Não deixe de fazer uma passeio no Rio Sena."
50,“Hotel Le Royal a Paris”,"Bonjour,Je voulais partager l hotel Le Royal avec vous...J arrive d une semaine a Paris et j ai logé a cette hotel...Le Royal est tres bien situé dans un tres beau arrondissement et proche de tout.Le service et la propreté de cette hotel a fait que ma semaine etait encore plus agréable. Les chambres sont assez grande et climatisées...le petit déjeuner compris dans le prix...Nous étions a 5 minutes de marche du Jardin du Luxembourg, de la Gare Montparnasse et du cimetiere Montparnasse.Station de métro a quelque pas de l hotel...alors facile d acces pour visiter...Plusieurs restos et boutiques a porter de la main..Je vais surement retourner a Paris et rester a la meme hotel bientot,j ai adoré."
20,“PARIS - City of Lights”,"Paris,aus meiner Sicht eine völlig überbewertete - und völlig überteuerte, aber auch schöne Stadt im Herzen Frankreichs.Doch diese Erfahrung sollte jeder für sich selbst machen, da diese Metropole sicher auch ihre gute und attraktiven Seiten hat.An Sehenswürdigkeiten, Clubs und Bars und tollen Aussichtspunkten jedenfalls mangelt es hier nicht. Einzig und allein die manchmal (gegenüber Deutschen) etwas unfreundlichen Franzosen trüben dieses Bild hier etwas.Toll allerdings ist die stets pünktliche und äußerts preiswerte Metro der Stadt..wenn auch etwas muffig."
40,“梦幻巴黎”,小镇的宁静点缀着历史的厚重，漫步在街道上就好像无比接近漫长的历史。如果说北京的韵味来自于源远流长的文明，那么巴黎的历史就来源于文化的底蕴。
40,“die Schönheit an der Seine”,"Wichtig ist es in Paris ein relativ zentrales Hotel zu haben mit gutem Zugang zur U-Bahn damit man die Gehstrecken etwas abkürzen kann. Sehenswürdigkeiten gibt es hier mehr als genug. Eiffelturm, Triumpfbogen, Champs Elysees, Place de la Concorde, Jardin des Tuileries, Louvre, Notre Dame, Montmartre,...Sehr schön kann man Paris auch mit dem Fahrrad erobern. Diese kann man an vielen Verleihstellen abholen. Sehr schön ist auch ein Spaziergang am Canal St. Martin entlang. Die beste Reisezeit ist Frühlich oder Herbst. Im Sommer kann es sher warm werden"
50,“巴黎艺术文化的海洋”,巴黎值得去的地方很多，卢浮宫，巴黎圣母院，埃弗尔铁塔，塞纳河畔，蓬皮杜图书馆，拉德芳斯，凡尔赛宫以及枫丹白露等等。如果喜欢绘画及雕塑，最好的地方就是卢浮宫了，在那里你将看到全世界艺术品的云集
40,“attenti ai biglietti della metropolitana”,"State attenti agli abbonamenti della Metro, si smagnetizzano dopo poco e il personale cerca di fregarti in ogni modo. Inoltre, non è scritto chiaramente che la validità è giornaliera e non 24 ore!!!! Conservate la ricevuta di acquisto delle macchinette o la custodia per dimostrare la validità del vostro titolo di viaggio!!!! ....a parte i parigi; PARIGI è un sogno!!!!!"
40,“Wunderbar für ein Wochenende”,"Für Berliner Verhältnisse recht teuer. Beispiel bei uns Sonnenschutz bis 5€. Dort ab 10€ aufwärts :-(Ansonsten Hammer Sehnswürdigkeiten. Unbedingt Stadtführer holen und alle abgrasen, denn sie sind echt sehenswert.Wir haben uns eine 3 Tages Karte für die ÖPNV geholt (20€ Zone 1-3 reicht völlig) und waren sehr zufrieden. Alle RER (schneller als Metro weil Sie nicht überall halten) ausgenutzt.Beim Eifelturm auf jeden Fall erstmal Treppe laufen. Spart Geld und Zeit und ist kein Problem. Kein stundenlanges Anstehen an der Kasse für den Aufzug. Wer ganz nach oben will, der kauft sich im Mittelgeschoss für 5€ noch ein Aufzug Ticket . Fast keine Wartezeit und zahlt insgesamt nur 9,5 statt 13€."
50,“Die tollste Stadt”,"Paris ist immer eine Reise wert, es kann nicht oft genug gesagt werden. So schön auch der erste Besuch in Paris sein kann, richtig spannend und interessant wird die Stadt erst mit dem zweiten oder dritten Besuch, wenn man die Muße hat sich auch abseits der Touristenpfade umzusehen. Ein wunderschöner Spaziergang führt beispielsweise über das Viaduct des Plantes (im 11.) Richtung 12. über den Cours St. Emilion bis in den Parks Bercy und hinüber auf die andere Seine Seite zur Bibliothek Francois Mitterand..."
40,“Beau et dispendieux.”,"Paris est une ville qu'il faut vraiment visiter au moins une fois. Il y a tant de belle chose à voir que c'esn est étourdissant. Le prix des restos, ou l'on mange très bien, est toutefois assez élevé. Comme celui de la bière. Les pic-nics sont recommandé pour les bourses plus modestes."
40,“Eine der tollsten Städte überhaupt”,"Wir waren zum ersten Mal in Paris und sind total begeistert.Es ist eine Stadt mit tollen Sehenswürdigkeiten, die man prima zu Fuß oder mit der U-Bahn erreichen kann. Das U-Bahnnetz ist sehr dicht und wirklich zuverlässig.Eine tolle idee sind auch die ""Mietfahrräder"", die man an vielen Stellen ausleihen, eine Runde drehen und dann wo anders wieder zurück stellen kann.Um Paris von der Wasserseite zu sehen, haben wir ein ""Linienboot"" genutz, wo man mit einem Ticket ""Hopp on - hopp off"" machen kann, was uns sehr gut gefallen hat.Für den Weg zum Flughafen mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln sowie für Check-in, Gepäckaufgabe und Sicherheitskontrolle in CDG sollte man ausreichend Zeit einrechnen, das hat sich alles etwas gezogen."
50,“cuantos adjetivos caben en este recuadro?”,"donde dice ''que hacer en paris'' deberia contestar :''vivir los proximos 50 años''es dificil encontrar un adjetivo que le quede mas o menos a la altura,desde que te bajas del avion hasta que te vuelves a subir pareces estar en tu mejor sueño.la mejor ciudad que he visto y vere.compra una guia y organizate para no perder ni un minuto"
50,“die Stadt der Liebe”,"die Stadt der Liebe zeigte sich über Pfingsten von ihrer besten Seite - Sonne satt - und ein riesen Angebot an Straßencafes, Sehenswürdigkeiten und relaxten Leuten, man kann sich sehr wohl fühlen dort, auch wenn viele Orte natrlich voll Touristen sind, etwas Zeit muss man eben mitbringen, besonders gut hat uns die L'open Bus Tour auf verschiedenen Routen gefallen"
50,“Je tàime”,"Paris je tàime. Mehr muss man eigentlich nicht sagen, Sehenswürdigkeiten bis zum Abwinken. Die Seine bei Nacht? Unschlagbar romantisch. Der Eifelturm? Beeindruckend. Louvre? Faszinierend. Perfekt auch die Mobilität mit der Metro. Schnell findet man sich zurecht und gelangt leicht von A nach B. Es gibt keine schönere Stadt in Europa."
50,“Pariser Friedhöfe”,"Mit dem ersten Flugzeug nach Paris und mit dem letzten zurück nach Wien.MIt der Metro fuhren wie nach Mompanase,Wir fuhren mit dem Lift auf den Hochhausturm, von dem es eine schöne Aussicht über Paris gibt. Aus dem reizende kleine Blumenmarkt unterhalb des Tauers ist leider er ein arabischer Ramschladen geworden. Wir besichtigten auch den Friedhof von Mompanase Sehr viele prominente Personen sind dort begraben. Nur sind auf dem Friedhof die Gräber nicht in einer Reihe geordnet sondern ein riesiges Durcheinander.Anschließend fuhren wir mit der Metro nach Momartre wo wir in einem kleinen Lokal zu Mittag gegessen haben, am frühen Nachmitteg besuchten wir den dortigen Friedhof wo auch viele Prominente begraben sind. Das gleiche Durcheinander wie am ersten Friedhof. Mich würde interessieren wie man dort die Menschen bestattet, In den rückwertigen Reihen gibt es keine Wege, man kommt nur über die Gräber bzw. Grabsteine zu diesen. Vor dem Molin Ruge stiegen wir in einen Minnizug und fuhren durch den ganzen Bezirk, auch bei dem ältersten Nachtlokal vorbei. Sehr nette Fahrt. Mit dem Bus Nr 29 fuhren wir bei allen Sehenswürdigkeiten vorbei und schön landsam mit dem Zu zum Flughafen. Es war ein schöner Tagesausflug."
40,“Romantisches Paris”,"Paris ist wirklich die Stadt der Liebe. Super romantisch vor dem Eiffelturm, im wunderschönen Stadtteil Montmartre, an vielen anderen schönen bekannten Plätzen in der Stadt. Auch bei einem Gläschen Wein mit delikatem Essen bei Kerzenschein in einem der vielen süßen Restaurants kann man die Romantik der Hauptstadt Frankreichs spüren. Zu empfehlen ist auch für erwachsene Pärchen ein Tag im Disneyland und den Disney Studios. Da hat man viel Spaß!"
50,“Meine Liebligsstadt in Europa: das zauberhafte Paris”,"Paris-die schönste Stadt Europas, lädt zum Flanieren, Sightseeing und Shoppen ein. Besondere Highlight: Eifelturm bei Nacht ganz hoch fahren und den Blick über die City genießen. Auf dem Platz vor dem Eifelturm picknicken die Pariser, schöne Atmosphäre. Shoppigparadies. Der Luxustempel Galerie Lafayette und Kaufhaus Prins Temps, besonders zum Ausverkauf zu empfehlen. Das Viertel um Sacre Couer is mein Lieblinsgplätzchen, mit den Musikern und Künstlern vor der Kirche, himmliche Ruhe mit Nonnengesängen in der Kirche und dem phantastischen Blick über die Stadt."
30,“メトロで手動ドアを体験”,パリのメトロは円を描くような路線で１０分くらいで何処にでも行けそうな距離です。ドアを手動で開けて乗り降りするので、出遅れると大変なので、地元の人は降りる手前にはドアに手をかけています。種類があって押すものや廻すものがあるので自分で体験するのも楽しいです。出入り口の周辺は混雑しているとスリの集団に周りを囲まれてすられるそうです。気をつけましょう。
50,“Schöne europäische Stadt”,"Wir waren schon einige Male in Paris und werden auf alle Fälle auch noch öfter dort hinfahren. Die Stadt ist einfach traumhaft..Man bewegt sich am besten mit der U-Bahn vorwärts. Die bringt einen überall hin. Man sollte sich alles bei Tag und dann nochmal alles bei Nacht anschauen. Super ist natürlich der Eiffelturm, gefolgt vom Louvre, Sacre Coeur, Notre Dame, das Künstlerviertel und Moulin Rouge. An Silvester ist Paris herrlich, alle liegen sich auf der Champs Elysées in den Armen. Man muss es einfach erlebt haben. ;-)Auf alle Fälle empfehlen wir ein Hotel in der City nahe der Sehenswürdigkeiten.Vorsichtiger wären wir bei Fahrten mit dem eigenen Auto-die Franzosen legen nicht soviel Wert auf ihr Auto, hatten wir zumindest den Eindruck. In Cafes sollte man aufpassen, dass man sich nicht unbedingt den besten Platz ganz vorne aussucht, dort ist der Kaffee dann am teuersten."
50,“Ein Muss für Kulturinteressierte”,"Paris hat unheimlich vieles zu bieten. Zahlreiche große Museen und Galerien, aber viele kleine Atelies, die sich immer weider verändern und den Standort wechseln. Besonders empfehlenswert ist die Ile-de-la Cité. Hier hat man das Gefühl in einem kleinen französischen Dorf zu sein und nicht mitten in Paris. Champs-Elysées und die die Gegend um den Eifelturm würde ich meiden - da es nur auf Touristen ausgerichtet ist und keinerlei Flair mehr hat. Stürzt Euch am besten in die kleinen Gassen und entdeckt die Stadt mit dem Fahrrad, das man mittlerweile an fast jeder Straßenecke ausleihen kann. So kann man seine eigenen Lieblingsecken finden und entdecken."
50,"“Mächtig, schön und teuer”","Paris kannte ich bevor ich lesen und schreiben konnte, die bezaubernde Gigi alias Leslie Caron hat es mir angetan. Zu meiner Kindheit war Paris auch deswegen in, weil dort eine immer noch nicht vergessene Nachtigall sang, Edith Piaf. Meine Tanten trällerten ihre Lieder, mussten sich aber von der ältesten Tante, die Französisch studiert hatte, erzählen lassen, das seien unanständige Sachen. Später habe ich noch Jacques Brel und Yves Montand bewundern gelernt. Kurz danach kam À bout de souffle von Jean-Luc Godard mit der unvergesslichen Jean Seberg in die Kinos. Bis ich nach Deutschland kam, gab es für mich nur noch Nouvelle Vague und damit viel, viel Paris zu sehen.Der Vater eines Freundes war ein berühmter Dichter und schwärmte immer von Paris, wo er studiert hatte. Ich stellte mir die Stadt vor, in der dieser imposante Mann nur eine Kleinigkeit neben Jean-Claude Brialy, Jean-Pierre Léaud oder Michel Piccoli darstellen konnte. Ich frass alle Filme von Chabrol, Truffaut, Godard und Rohmer in mich hinein. Dennoch dauerte es sehr lange, bis ich nach Paris fuhr. Vielleicht aus Respekt, oder aus Angst? Oder weil ich eher andere Landschaften bevorzugte. Denn Nouvelle Vague war meine offizielle Leidenschaft gewesen, während ich nachts heimlich in Kinos ging, wo Western liefen. Die unendliche Prairie in Nevada oder die Berge in Wyoming zogen mich eher an. So ist der Besuch einer Bar, auf die ich am meisten stolz bin, nicht etwa von Maxim in Paris gewesen, sondern eine Kneipe in Moab, in der sich John Wayne seinen Namen in die Theke gekratzt hatte, als er Red River drehte.Spät, aber nicht zu spät. So etwa 20 bis 30 Mal muss ich Paris gewesen sein, weil ich dort viele Treffen besuchen musste. Bei meinem ersten Besuch geriet ich in einen Randbezirk, Banlieue, wo die Häuser aussahen wie in einem bestimmten Gebiet von Istanbul. In Rueil Malmaison. Dort erlebte ich auch, wie man abstürzt. Kurz vor dem Mittagessen kam der Barkeeper in unseren Gesprächsraum und fragte, ob er uns etwas mixen sollte. Ja! Wir tranken das Gebräu und fanden es fantastisch. O.K. sagte er, dann serviere ich es. Oh, weh! Die Sitzung ging gründlich daneben. Aber die anschließende Tour zu Fuss durch Paris war eine Offenbarung. Ich marschierte eine Strecke von etwa 20 km bis die Nacht so dunkel war, dass ich Angst um meine Sicherheit hatte. Die Metrostationen hatten bereits geschlossen. Da ich hier und da nachgetankt hatte, machte ich mir aber keine Gedanken - man schwebt so leicht über den Realitäten. Die Nacht endete in Quartier Latin, wo die Franzosen, anders als in Filmen, viel Bier trinken.Bleibenden Eindruck hat bei mir ein Restaurant hinterlassen. La Coupole - ein Denkmal und keine Fresshalle. Dort haben wir mit einem Freund zusammen ein dreistöckiges Fischmenu bestellt, das etwa für sechs Leute reichen würde. Der Kellner guckte sich in der Gegend um, um die weiteren Mitesser zu platzieren. Wir deuteten an, die Sache ginge in Ordnung. Um ihn noch mehr zu irritieren, bestellten wir Rotwein zum Fisch. Seine Augen verfinsterten sich, wir taten so, als hätten wir unseren Fauxpas gemerkt. Und änderten die Bestellung in Bier. Jetzt hob er die Augenbrauen an und sagte laut „Terroristen“. Er brachte uns eine formidable Flasche Weißwein und der Abend geriet zu einem echten Highlight.Leider kann man in Paris nicht überall so gut essen wie in La Coupole. Das Essen ist teuer - und zuweilen schlecht. Wer gut essen will, ist auf Empfehlung angewiesen. Der übliche Touri wird eben wie ein üblicher Touri abgespeist.Wer lange Nachts unterwegs ist, muss sich daran gewöhnen, dass er bestimmte No-Go Areas für Weiße gibt. Zwar kenne ich niemanden, dem man etwas angetan hätte. Trotzdem sahen die Straßen nicht so kuschelig aus. Vielleicht ist mir nie etwas passiert, weil ich aus Städten wie Rio oder Johannesburg gelernt habe. Nur billigste Klamotten anziehen, möglichst vor Ort gekauft, und nichts Glitzerndes an sich. Man wird in diesem Aufzug leider nicht in allen Restaurants höflich bedient, aber besser als eine Vorzugsbehandlung im Krankenhaus ist es allemal.Über die vielen Dinge, die man sich ansehen sollte, braucht man nicht zu schreiben. Es steht in tausend und eins Reiseberichten. Aber vielleicht darüber, wie man Paris am intensivsten erleben kann. Zu Fuß! Wie der gemeinsame Name meiner Reiseberichte heißt - Walkabout - kann man seine Touren planen wie ein Aborigine. Man kauft sich ein Tagesticket für die Metro, legt sich einen etwaigen Zeitrum fest, wo man an die Rückfahrt zum Hotel denken müsste, und los geht´s! Wenn die Füße einen nicht mehr tragen wollen, dann zwei Stationen mit der Metro. Wer etwas mehr Geld ausgeben will, kauft sich ein Ticket für die hop-on-hop-off-Busse (z.B. Lescarsrouges), die im 10-Minuten-Takt die Stadt durchpflügen. Man kriegt zu Beginn Kopfhörer ausgeliefert, die man in jedem Bus benutzen kann.Ganz eine 24-Stunden Stadt wie New York ist Paris nicht, aber fast."
50,“Meine Traumstadt”,"Paris ist eine Traumstadt und bietet für jedermann etwas. Nicht nur die Sehenswürdikeiten sind ein Traum, auch die Businesscenter, Shoppingmöglichkeiten sowie der franz. Lebensstil sind ein Traum für mich!"
50,“La mia visita a Parigi”,"Se non volete spendere circa 50€ di taxi , vi consiglio di andare a Parigi dall aereoporto in treno ( si chiama RER ) , una volta arrivati a Parigi procuratevi un carnet di biglietti per la metropolitana e con questa riuscirai a muoverti per tutta Parigi , cambiando linea metropolitana , le cui stazioni sono diffusissime sul territorio . Per girare con sicurezza procuratevi una piantina dei trasporti e non avrete bisogno di altro .Se vorrete visitare i monumenti o musei o quartieri più interessanti potranno esservi utili i pullman turistici a due piani ( il superiore scoperto ) che con 25€ vi assicureranno 2 giorni di percorsi con guida turistica e potrete scendere e salire a piacere durante i 2 giorni di validità del biglietto . Se avrete voglia di vedere cose particolari potrete noleggiare una bicicletta ( si trovano ogno 2 o 300 m ) per 1 € al giorno . Nei musei non è come in Italia , in cui è vietato fotografare , e rendono la visita molto più gradevole perchè non si ha impressione di ricevere un favore come da noi . Per il resto , vi auguro di trovare il soggiorno gradevole , come ho trovato io , anzi spero lo sia di più , in altre parole : divertitevi ."
50,“Hermoso paris......”,"Visitar Paris fue y es una experiencia unica, sus calles, sus monumentso, su historia, su vida, lo hacen una cuidad unica, solo mejoraria de Paris el servicio de taxis, unos verdaderos piratas y estafadores, es extraño que no halla algun control sobre estos, pero este pequeño detalle no deja de que te maravilles con la hermosa PARISADORO PARIS.........!!!!!!!!"
50,“メトロでぶらぶら街歩き。”,初夏のパリ市内街歩きの旅をしました。滞在初日に一週間のナヴィコ・パスとミュージアム・パスを購入しました。両方ともとても使い勝手がよいシステムで、ナヴィコ・パスはメトロ・RER・バスに使用できるのでとても割安で快適ですし、ミュージアム・パスはかなりのパリ市内および郊外の美術館・観光名所をカバーしています。ヴェルサイユから、ノートルダム、凱旋門、ルーブル。数え切れません。これを持っているだけでチケットを買う行列から解放されますし、また夜間拝観日を上手く組み合わせると朝から晩まで楽しめます。ただ、一ついうならば、ミュージアム・パスが発売されているとされている場所が売り切れだったり閉店していたりというハプニングが多かったので、時間がタイトな方は日本で購入しておくことをお勧めします。メトロに乗ればどこでも行けるパリ。素敵な街でした。
40,“Stadt der Lieber”,"Eine wunderschöne Stadt! Romantisch und trotzdem sehr lebhaft! Für mich war Sie ein bisschen zu hektisch und voll, aber sehr sehenswert für mal ein (z.B.) Wochenentrip! Und natürlich ein Shoppingparadies :-)"
50,“Immer wieder eine Reise wert”,"Die französische Metropole lockt nicht nur mit den allseitsbekannten Sehenswürdigkeiten. Natürlich, der Eiffelturm, der Louvre, die Champs-Elysées, Montmartre, das Quartier Latin stehen in jedem Reiseführer und verschlagen einem den Atem. Ich möchte jedoch jeden ermutigen auch ein wenig Zeit für das Paris abseits der ausgetretenen Pfade einzuplanen. In dieser Stadt kann man eine kleine Weltreise unternehmen: Wer an der Metrostation Barbès aussteigt, der wird direkt nach Westafrika katapultiert und rund um den Place d'Italie breitet sich asiatisches Flair aus. Für das beste Eis der Welt sollte man Berthillon auf der Ile St.-Louis aufsuchen. Auch einen kleinen Weinberg gibt es zu entdecken, man muss sich nur auf die Suche machen!"
50,“Paris mein Lieblingsziel”,"Wer Paris noch nicht gesehen hat, sollte das schnellstmöglich nachholen. Zahlreiche Sehenswürdigkeiten und Museen. Mein Favorit ist das Picasso Museum. Mein liebstes Hotel ist das junge Hotel Costes K, sehr zentral gelegen."
50,"“Paris nich ""nur"" die Stadt der Liebe”",Paris wird generell immer nur als Stadt der Liebe bezeichnet jedoch vergessen viele das die Stadt viel mehr zu bieten hat als nur Romantik.Natürlich sind der Notre Dame und die Champ Elysee sehr romantisch aber auch sehr interessant.Zu meinen Lieblingsorten gehören der Louvre und der Eiffelturm.
50,“巴黎”,巴黎是一个充满了浪漫风情的城市 拥有着美丽的古堡，漂亮的河 凯旋门 埃菲尔铁塔一切的一切给人以一种舒服的感觉
30,“Nicht meine Stadt”,"Wir haben den Flair vegeblich gesucht, nach 3 Tagen in der Stadt, muss ich sagen..nein.. ich muss nicht wieder kommen. Fängt damit an, das man uns in fast jedem Restaurant übers Ohr hauen wollte,ständig standen Getränke auf unserer Rechnung die wir nicht hatten. Die Leute waren unfreundlich und die Souvenier verkäufer aufdringlich.. und wenn die sich dann noch die Köpfe blutig schlagen mit ihren Eifeltürmen, muss ich das nicht habe. Paris hat mich nciht überzeugt"
50,“lieblingsstadt”,"Ich habe mittlerweile 350 flüge auf den Buckel (nur die letzten 15 Jahre) aber die geilste Stadt ist dennoch Paris....nach 25 Aufenthalten dort, gefällt mir die französische Metropole immer besser. DIe Stadt hat alles, von kleinen Restaurants, bis zu Sehenswürdigkeiten, die einen 4 Tagestripp optimal machen..."
50,“EUROPÄISCHE KULTUR”,Eine ruhige Stadt im Gegensatz zu LONDONBeste POLIZEI der WELTSCHÖNE und sichere STADT
40,“パリのサロン（見本市）”,パリでは毎週末（金曜日から月曜日までなど）、市内や近郊にある見本市会場でサロンが開かれます。例えば年2回開催されるワインや食材が国内外から集まるガストロノミー・サロン、やはり年2回の自然派商品サロン、日本でも行われるチョコレートのサロン・ド・ショコラ、アンティーク・サロン、農業市、ファッション、ツーリズム、マリアージュ（結婚式）など、一般的な生活で必要な情報をほぼすべてクリアしているといっても過言ではありません。パリを旅行の際は観光局などでぜひ情報収集することをお勧めします。最近では英語が堪能な人もスタンドに立っていますし、カタコトの英語でもきちんと対応してくれる人々が多いです。ワインなど専門用語が必要となるとお互いに気を使うかもしれませんが、旅の思い出として残るよい体験ができる可能性は高いと思います。
30,“Pfingsten in Paris”,öffentlicher Nahverkehr (Metro) gut ausgebaut
50,“Die schönste Stadt in Europa”,Paris übertrifft alle Erwartungen. Endlose Möglichkeiten sich kulturell zu betätigen. Zahlreiche must-see's.Leider etwas teuer bzw. überteuert.
40,“巴黎圣母院”,非常推荐在周日的上午参观巴黎圣母院。周日有弥撒，圣母院里的神职人员唱歌非常好听，感觉像在歌剧院。门前的广场上还有巴黎市“中心”０公里地标。
20,“paris y la mugre que hay en las calles”,"es la primera vez que veo Paris tan sucia, no se que ocure con la recoleccion de basura, pero la mugre abunda."
40,“人はのんびり”,一番印象に残っているのはパリの人はほんとにのんびりしています。公園で寝たり、コーヒーショップでコーヒーを飲んだり、、、、時間は止まっているようです。。。
30,“巴黎的冬天很冷！”,刚到巴黎是晚上，天超冷，下着雪。本想走到埃菲尔铁塔，结果被冻回来了，惨啊！白天的巴黎依然很冷，路上没有什么人，一点都不像是个大城市。很安静。 很好！
40,“Presentare Parigi al mio compagno”,"Sono tornata nella città che adoro e l'idea era di ... fare condividere le mie emozioni al mio compagno.Non so dire se sono riuscita nell'intento.Qualcosa ha funzionato (i servizi di trasporto della città sono ai massimi livelli, secondo me) e qualcosa un po' meno.In aeroporto tutto bene: noi siamo arrivati allo Charles De Gaulle perchè abbiamo viaggiato con Alitalia: Ryan Air atterra... in un'altra città, tanto è lontano l'aeroporto Paris Beauvais.L'albergo ci ha delusi. Un tre stelle nella zona di Parc Monceau.Le stanze davvero piccole, il letto matrimoniale costituito da singoli uniti... male; la reception senza infamia e senza lode.Ma a Parigi la ricezione alberghiera non è delle migliori. Soprattutto in riferimento alle toilettes. ovviamente nei grandi hotel va tutto bene... ma appena si scende di categoria... e l'ing. Amedeo Gerardiano (in questi casi gli do del lei...) secondo me ne ha sofferto un po': abituato a viaggiare ai massimi livelli!!!Abbiamo fatto tanta strada a piedi... davvero: abbiamo visto di corsa quel che si poteva ""zippare"" in un lungo WE... Per fortuna io conosco molto bene la città e... ce la siamo cavata benino.Quanto al cibo: bene tutto ciò che riguarda i pasti veloci o informali: consiglio ""Le sourir verte"", vicino L'Opera. Per le cene un po' più tradizionali Bofinger, metro Bastille. Stante la fama del locale, dovuta anche ad alcune vetrate in stile liberty, è opportuno prenotare, magari attraverso il loro sito online direttamente dall’Italia, prima di partire.Francesca Maniscalco con Amedeo Gerardiano"
40,“巴黎圣母院&埃菲尔”,去的时候正好遇上巴黎圣母院做活动。有一个乐队在做表演。内部比想象的大的多。还有投钱买纪念币的小机器。1欧-2.5欧不等的价钱。其实我觉得跟去过的欧洲几大教堂有很大相似之处。钟楼没有去，因为时间紧。埃菲尔铁塔去了两次。一次是白天。一次是夜晚。感觉不论什么时候都很Q的建筑物。
20,“HolidayFlatParis”,"Olá amigos, eu aluguei um apartamento com esta empresa em Setembro de 2009. [--] e paguei todas as taxas, além de 150 euros de caução que seriam devolvidos até dois meses após a devolução do apartamento.Recebi o apartamento em ordem, limpo, tudo conforme combinado. Era silencioso e aconchegante. Tudo transcorreu bem.O apartamento foi devolvido em excelente estado, limpo com tudo em ordem, mas eles não devolvem o valor pago a título de caução, não me informam o motivo, não respondem aos meus e-mails. Estou alertando a vocês para que outras pessoas não passem pelo mesmo problema que eu estou passando, pois já se passaram mais de seis meses após a entrega do studio e eles não fazem a devolução."
50,“香风巴黎”,走累了坐在巴黎圣母院后面的长椅上，休息一下，满眼时尚的美女，还有一路跟随主人漂亮各异的小狗大狗。一阵小风吹过，风中带有走来走去人们身上的香水味，巴黎很浪漫，风也是有香味的----
40,“ボルケーノや国鉄ストライキに負けず楽しみました”,４月１３日に日本からパリへ入り、３日間の予定が６日間に延びて予定以上に楽しみました！モンサンミッシェル、エッフェル塔、凱旋門、ヴェルサイユ宮殿、ルーブル美術館、ノートルダム寺院などなどバスや電車、水上バス（バトビュス）で効率良く周って満喫しました。中でも日曜日の午前中に開催されていたバスティーユ駅近くの朝市（マルシェ）は地元のパリジャンが大勢集まって新鮮な野菜や果物、魚貝類やパンなどのお店がズラ～っと並び、楽しくテンション上がりっぱなしでした。オススメです。ちょうどアイスランドのボルケーノ影響でフランスの空港が閉鎖されてしまった上、フランス国鉄のストライキ、そしてイースター休暇のCグループ最中で大混乱のパリでした。夜行寝台車でスペインへ行く予定でしたがストでキャンセルとなり、３日間パリで待機してTGVでスイスへ抜ける予定に変更。駅のチケット売り場は大混乱＆電車は満席・・・と試練が続きましたがインターネットで色々調べて代替え案A・B・C・・・と練って工夫した事など今までの多くの旅行体験の中でも３本の指に入る印象深い場所になりました。総合的には大変アクティブで楽しい旅になりました。
40,“梦幻圣诞”,08年的圣诞，两个人，一座城市巴黎的轨道交通之复杂果然是名不虚传，经历了第一天半夜地铁迷路事件之后我们就再也不敢独自行动了，还是老老实实跟大巴走吧。艾菲尔排队的人太多了，由于行程紧张就没有登塔，夜里九点，爬上城北的55楼拍她的身影，释怀。巴黎圣母院去了两次，第一天夜里，以及第三天与旅行团大巴同往。更喜欢晚上的圣母院，剔透，伴随着圣诞树的温馨。卢浮宫，赶鸭子，不提。。
50,“Paris-eine Stadt mit Charme und Klasse”,"diese stadt ist definitiv eine reise wert!jeder sollte einmal in seinem leben diesen besonderen charme gespürt haben.wunderschöne architektur,freundliche menschen,kunst und mode..angekommen in unserem hotel,das im schönen viertel saint germain des pres lag,machten wir uns am frühen abend auf die suche nach dem cafe de flore.das ehemalige künstlerviertel hat viel zu bieten,inzwischen sind dort allerdings mehr designer als alte buchhandlungen und kunsthändler zu finden.d.h. wie überall in paris,geld mitbringen!gleiches gilt für das cafe de flore,es gab dort bier für 9euro und wodka-o für 22!(zugegeben frisch gepresster saft)für uns war es trotzdem sehr aufregend dort zu sein,da wir wußten das jim morisson in vergangenen zeiten oft dort einkehrte und sich in der oberen etage stundenlang dazu hinreißen ließ gedichte zu schreiben od einfach nur das geschehen um ihn herum zu beobachten.dieses wissen machte unseren aufenthalt dort zu etwas besonderem.natürlich sollte ein besuch beim montmartre nicht fehlen,denn dort findet man die wohl berühmteste mühle der welt das moulin rouge und natürlich oben auf dem hügel sacre coeur mit der strahlend weißen kuppel.(eine echte belohnung,wenn man es zu fuß die 130 meter nach oben geschafft hat)das herz des montmartre ist die schöne place du tertre,allerdings wird man den flair den dieser ort ausstrahlt nicht allein genießen können,da es von touristen wimmelt.es ist wirklich besonders dort und wenn man die augen schließt und tief luft holt,den duft der creperien und cafes einatmet ,dann kann man das bunte treiben früherer zeiten wahrlich vor sich sehen.anspruchsvolle kunst gibt es im musee de montmartre zu sehen.museen gibt es sowieso unheimlich viele wunderbare in paris und damit meine ich mehr die vielen kleineren als das große louvre,wobei auch das nicht vergessen werden sollte!für fans von jim morisson ist der besuch auf dem friedhof pere le chaise ein muß!es vergehen stunden an diesem wunderbaren ort ohne das man dies bemerkt..und wenn man das erste mal da ist,brauch man wahrscheinlich genau so lange um jim endlich zu finden.da wir extra wg jims todestag in paris waren,hatten wir das glück die doors coverband ""the lizard kings"" live in einer kleinen bar (die falabar) zu erleben.toll!allerdings ist dieses viertel( belleville) nachts zu fuß eher unangenehm,da dort kaum ""fremde"" verkehren,deshalb zogen wir ein taxi für den rückweg vor..wer in paris ist MUSS shoppen gehen,das geht nicht anders!dabei ist es egal ob man in den vielen kleinen gassen herum irrt od sich zu den großen shopping-tempeln wie die galerie lafayette begibt,man findet mit sicherheit überall etwas.für menschen die mode lieben kann es allerdings auch schwer werden,da man sich all die namenhaften designer oft nicht leisten kann.als wir dort waren,fingen die ""sales"" aber schon an und das lohnt sich teilweise wirklich!also unbedingt einen tag einplanen!und die kreditkarten nicht vergessen ;-)all die klassischen sehenswürdigkeiten,wie den triumphbogen,den eifelturm od notre dame sollte man natürlich auch nicht vergessen.was man allerdings vergessen kann ist das essen,ich habe in paris gewiß nicht das beste essen bekommen,auch wenn meist für diese küche geschwärmt wird.vlt sind wir auch nicht gourmets genug..alles in allem..worauf wartet ihr noch?!auf in diese romantische stadt....und geld nicht vergessen!"
40,“巴黎是一个漂亮宝贝”,巴黎是一个让人恋爱的地方。100历史的地铁、巴黎人的懒散与浪漫、塞纳河、狭小的街道都让人心生怜爱。而埃菲尔则是需要晚上才能看懂的爱情标志。四处可见的咖啡馆，沿街坐着品味咖啡的人们，每一处都让人放慢了自己的时间。巴黎，确实是一个漂亮宝贝
50,"“Todas las ideas, todas las sensaciones...”","La conocí con 17 años y supe por primera vez, como era la sensación de la libertad, he vuelto muchas veces y cuando regreso intento absorver toda su esencia, su cultura, el arte en todas sus manifestaciones, la cortesía de sus habitantes, su famoso glamour....y me siento distinta.Todo en Paris es inigualable, y no mas caro que Madrid, hay hotelitos encantadores por un precio asequible, pero alli encuentras gentes de todo el mundo,los mejores museos , la moda, el lujo refinado y ese poso que el devenir de su historia ha ido dejando en cada rincon de la ciudad.Mi barrio preferido es Le Marais, por sus encantadores hoteles, tiendas de diseño, restaurantes, y su tranquilidad, pero no hay que perderse el atardecer sobre el sena en verano, zarpar en el bateau-mouche para divisar las dos orillas, rive droite rive gauche, a la vez, la maravillosa basilica de Nôtre Damme y sus conciertos de órgano matinales del domingo, algo sublime!! y la cercana Ille de France, el barrio de san Germain des prés, la tour eiffel, saborear su gastronomía, los crêpes en todas sus variantes, un buen vino de borgoña, y caminar, caminar mucho por sus calles para descubrir todos los secretos de la que fué, es y será la gran dama de Europa.Si me pierdo, buscadme en Paris."
40,“时尚之都 历史之都”,名声在外的巴黎其实很低调，真的，她绚烂的特别低调。在法国，在巴黎我们能真真切切的感觉到法国人对历史和文化的尊崇，街上都是几百年前的老式房子，外面古旧内部翻新，感觉真好。
40,“とにかくおしゃれ”,とにかくおしゃれ！ふらっと入ったパン屋さんやふらっと入ったブティックがすべて絵になる、そんな街。何を食べてもおいしいし、何よりも歩いている方たちの服装がみんなとっても可愛くてスタイリッシュで、そりゃあこんな街で生きていれば自然とセンスが身に着くのかなと思える街です。パリだけでなく、他の都市も周るツアーも多いけど、パリ１都市に滞在して、暮らすように観光するのもおすすめです。
50,“Mein Fav in Europa”,"Nur kurz: gutes Essen, nette Menschen-egal was fälschlicherweise gesagt wird,wunderschöne Stadt mit unglaublich viel Kultur.Silvester statt feuerwek Metrofrei^^"
40,“Hotel Sribe ***** - Ottimo Hotel in ottima posizione (Louvre)”,"L'Hotel è risultato all'altezza delle aspettative (che per un 5* nel cuore di Parigi non erano poche !). La camera (una doppia Luxury) molto spaziosa, conteneva il letto matrimoniale più grande nel quale abbia mai dormito. Il bagno ampio e confortevole è dotato di tutto il necessario (tranne che per la tradizionale assenza del bidet) . Cassaforte e acqua naturale in bottiglia comprese nel prezzo (e l'acqua, a Parigi, costa come il vino !). Peccato solo per la solita moquette e per l'esiguità dell'armadio. SPA irrilevante. Per la colazione consiglierei una delle tante brasserie nella zona. Una posizione più centrale sarebbe difficilmente immaginabile. Consigliato !"
50,“浪漫之都”,在巴黎生活了5年，真的感受到了什么是浪漫之都，这个城市需要时间去理解和体会，漫步在塞纳河边，漫步在美术馆，咖啡馆，真是浪漫。
40,“El paraíso”,"Aquí todo es hermoso... es muy impresionante porque no hay absolutamente nada que no represente prácticamente un hito en la historia... y también tiene vistas hermosas y envidiables realmente... el único problema a diferencia de la ciudad anterior por la que habíamos estado es que el transporte subterráneo es un poco más viejo, los vagones, las estaciones, y la gente (por el idioma, ya que con mi marido hablábamos inglés, no francés) era menos propicia a ayudarte en algunos casos aunque pudiesen. Pero igual, una experiencia maravillosa."
10,“メトロ乗車時の注意”,メトロでスリの被害にあいそうになりました。シテ等からモンマルトルに向かう途中、混んだ車両に乗ったところ、4名程度の集団に取り囲まれ、身動きができなくなりました。明らかに前の女性が不自然に密着してくるのですが、緊張して声が出せません。幸い、内ポケットの財布はポケットの大きさに対して大き目だったため、抜き取りにくかったようで、被害にはあいませんでした。次の駅で、その一団は捨て台詞を残して降りて行きました。混んだメトロの車両では、周囲に気を使い、できるだけ隅によって乗るようにしたほうがいいと思います。
50,“パリの美術館を無料で楽しもう！”,パリにはたくさんの美術館があります。ルーブル、オルセー、オランジェリー、ロダン. . . .　１つの美術館をゆっくり楽しむのもいいですが、ルーブルのモナリザ、オルセーのゴッホ、オランジェリーのモネなんていう風に、１つの美術館のお気に入りの数点を楽しむのは最高の贅沢だと思いませんか。でもたくさんの美術館を訪れると入場料だけでも馬鹿になりません。そこで、私はパリに行く時はなるべく、第一日曜日をパリで自由に過ごせる時間を計画します。第一日曜日はほとんどの美術館の入場料が無料となるのでーす！　当日はスニーカーで遠足のつもりで、メトロと徒歩で美術館めぐりです。無料なので、入場の列も長くなることがありますから、朝一番で行きましょう。ちなみに私はオランジェリー→オルセー→ルーブル→ロダンと回りました。なんとも充実した美術の１日でした。
40,“Capodanno Parigi 2009/2010.”,"Ho passato 6 giorni a Parigi con la famiglia (3 adulti 1 bambino 12 anni), in tutto abbiamo speso 2000 euro (aereo, trasporti locali, entrata museo, torre, ecc, mangiare e hotel (proprio tutto).Abbiamo visitato la torre, l'arco, il ""cimitero"", il Louvre, la cattedrale di Notre Dame, giro sul Senna, visita alla torre Monteparnasse, Molin Rouge e dintorni (esterno), quartiere latino, Eurodisney. Ci é mancata la visita al castello di Versalles che era in programma ma i figli erano troppo stanchi....Ho scelto di fare la Parigi Visit Card, ma poi facendo bene i conti ""forse"" se avessi preso i blocchi di biglietti avrei risparmiato qualcosa....Come alloggio abbiamo scelto Adagio City Aparthotel Montrouge, avendo la cucina e il supermercato vicinissimo é stato una buona scelta. Dalla metro bisogna prendere un pullman per 3/4 fermate, ma non' é scomodo.Il viaggio é stato meraviglioso, torneremo senz'altro, soprattuto per rivedere il Louvre, che abbiamo visitato di mercoledi che chiude piu tarde ed entrando dalle 18 si paga di meno.Gli unici inconvenienti sonno stati il capodanno che hanno illuminato la torre con i colori della Francia e Europa ma NON HANNO FATTO I FUOCHI!! Incredibile! Un'altra cosa da dire é che ad Eurodisney fa VERAMENTE freddo, cerano bambini con tutta da neve, che invidia!!"
50,“Visita obligatoria de Francia”,"Tenia muchas expectativas cuando decidimos mi marido y yo conocer Paris (Francia) y no me decepciono, creo que las supere si cabe.Visita obligatorias: Champs-Elysees, Tour Eifeel, Louvre, Notre Dame, Le Sacre Coure, Arc de Triomphe.Solo un consejo, no vayais en diciembre, el frio es horroroso y, por ejemplo, la visita a Versalles se disfruta menos porque los jardines estan sin florecer y las fuentes congeladas. Por el resto, una ciudad maravillosa y unas gentes maravillosas.Y aunque sus gentes tienen fama de estirados, no hay que ir con ideas preconcevidas, gente malcarada hay por todas partes."
50,“街全体が絵になる街”,観光名所でなくても、日常生活をしているような住宅街でも絵になる街です。石畳の歩道が多いので、ピンヒールはほとんど歩行不可、歩きやすい靴でぶらぶらするのがおすすめです。なぜか犬の散歩をする人が多く、日本のようにマナーが徹底されていないからか犬の落とし物には注意が必要です。
40,“美食の街パリ”,パリはお金を出さないと美味しいものが食べられないと聞いていましたが、全くそうではありませんでした。テイクアウトのクレープはとても美味しかったですし、スーパーで売っているフランボワーズのヨーグルトドリンクも最高でした。オルセー美術館の中にあるレストランでも一人２０ユーロくらいで非常に素敵な内装の中食事ができ、感動しました。ぜひまた行きたいです！！
40,“パリジャンの休日”,パリには何回か訪れる機会がありましたが、一番の休日の過ごし方は、何もしないでいるということです。パリの中心地を地下鉄を乗り継いであちこち練り歩いてあげくへとへとに疲れるより、朝からカフェに行ったり、かわいい小さなお店で時間をつぶしたり、我がもの顔でまるで地元の人のように過ごすのが一番の過ごし方ではないでしょうか。親切な人も多く、おすすめです。
40,“芸術の都”,パリに行くのなら、パリだけで過すことをおすすめします。フランス周遊もまた、それなりによいとは思いますが、パリを堪能したいのであれば、9日間から10日間ほど、パリに滞在して観光すると良いでしょう。それでも、たぶん見きれないと思います。フランスの学校はお休みが多いようですので、その時期をはずしていかれることをおすすめします。お休みとぶつかると、どこもかしこも混んでいます。エッフェル塔や凱旋門、ヴェルサイユ宮殿、ルーブル美術館など観光地をあげたらキリがないくらい見どころがたくさんありますので、出かける前によく検討し、自分が一番見たいところを中心に計画を立てると良いでしょう。とても、交通が発達しているので、地下鉄やバスを上手に利用するとよいと思います。また、パリは街がきれいに区画されているため、とてもわかりやすくなっていますので、歩くのもまた良いと思います。パリは観光地も充実していますが、駅の入り口やホームにも目を向けると、きれいな装飾や絵が飾ってあるところもあります。目的地を見るだけでなく周りにも目を向けると良いでしょう。パリは様々なレストランが数多くあると思いますが、カフェもまたかなりの数があります。レストランだとかなり値がはりますが、カフェだとそれなりの額で、食事が出来ますので、カフェで食事をとるのをおすすめします。また、夜はパンやお惣菜、パティスリーなどを買って、お部屋で食べるのもよいでしょう。ちなみに、街並みはとてもきれいなのにもかかわらず、足元に気をつけないと、危険なものが良く落ちています。きっと、滞在中は一度ぐらい・・・しまう可能性があります。十分に気をつけてください。
40,"“France,Paris:ワールドクラスの芸術がずらりと揃った街”",[コメント]シャンゼリゼ通り、エッフェル塔、凱旋門、ルーブル美術館と誰もが一度は耳にしたことのあるワールドクラスの観光名所がずらりと揃う芸術の都パリ。パリジェンヌの様に優雅な生活体験をしたいのなら自由行動できる時間が一日や二日では到底足りないだろう。[物価]日本の1.2-1.5倍くらいと、と激しく物価の高いパリ。ただでさえ物価の高いヨーロッパの中でも特に有名な観光地ということがそうさせる。シャンゼリゼ通りでおしゃれにコーヒーが飲みたいわなんて言うならランチ一食分位のコストは覚悟した方が良いかも。
40,"“Paris, cidade exuberante”","Realmente se você está pensando em conhecer alguns lugares na Europa, comece por Paris. Eu moro em Pelotas, RS e a arquitetura daqui lembra a de Paris. A capital da França é uma cidade que encanta a todo instante e os franceses, ao ocntrário do que muitos pensam, são gentis e estão acostumados a tantos turistas. Porém, uma coisa me chamou a atenção: nenhuma placa em inglês. tudo em frrancês"
40,“Capodanno a Parigi”,"Una città assolutamente da visitare soprattutto se lo si fa in coppia. Città romantica con molti posti da visistare che lasciano senza fiato.Piccola (grande) delusione il capodanno, infatti sconsiglio di organizzarlo li, se lo si vuole passare in piazza in quanto zero animazione, zero controlli e quindi zero sicurezza, ma solo la maestosa torre che si illumina e ripete sempre ed in continuazione le stesse musichette (3 canzoncine) per 3 ore sino alla mezzanotte per poi illuminarsi d'argento all'arrivo del nuovo anno. Neanche un conto alla rovescia. Insomma una vera delusione e tanti ubriachi in giro pericolosi che si picchiavano. Delusione in ogni caso superata viste le tante cose da vedere che lasciano senza fiato, ed i francesi stessi persone alla mano e gentili.Assolutamente da vedere Versailles, la tour eiffel, notredame, arco del trionfo, Pigalle (zona del moulin rouge), disneyland e tanto tanto altro ancora.Periodo secondo me migliore per visitarla da aprile a settembre."
50,"“precioso, y barato!”","Dicen que Paris es caro, pues para mi no lo fue, todas la entradas menos la de la Torre Eiffel, son gratis (totalmente) para menores de 27 años, y para comer solo hay que buscar un poquito.El metro esta bien y no es caro, la gente es amable, la ciudad es muy bonita, y esta muy bien cuidada."
50,“Parigi una meta da non perdere!”,"Bonjour!Parigi,la città degli innamorati e non solo,con i suoi tanti musei e le sue attrazzioni uniche come L'arco di Trionfo o la torre Eifel,oppure la reggia di Versailles. Se vi recate nella città durante la stagione invernale copritevi di tutto punto perchè per gustarvi la citttà dovrete camminare molto. Per la notte di capodanno vi consiglio di posizionarvi davanti alla torre e non in altre zone rischiando davvero una ressa furiosa,e infine non fatevi mancare un escursione sui battelli nella Senna.Visionate bene i vari hotel prima di prenotare e sceglietene uno ben servito dai mezzi per potervi spostare velocemente.Questa città stupenda affascina ogni anno milioni di viaggiatori ed è una metà imperdibile e da vivere in più giorni! BUON VIAGGIO"
40,“Tre giorni da sogno...”,"Questa è una guida pratica per un tour breve di tre giorni a Parigi (novembre 2009) provata personalmente .. in pratica quello che abbiamo fatto per vedere questa meravigliosa città...1^ GIORNO - lunedìdall'aeroporto di Bouvais si prende il biglietto per navetta verso Parigi (costo € 13,00 a tragitto – valevole 1 anno – biglietteria all’interno dell’aeroporto e anche all’esterno per evitare le code)Il bus aspetta appena fuori l’aeroporto e si arriva a Port Maillot dopo circa 1 ora e mezza. La metro è vicinissima (1 gialla) e conviene comprare la Paris Visite (per 3 giorni costo € 20,00) che permette di usare tutte le Metro, i Bus, i Treni e la Funicolare (usare soprattutto la metro per il grande traffico su strada)La destinazione era Montmartre e quindi siamo arrivati fino CONCORDE e si prende la linea (12 verde) fino a PIGALLE dove si vede il MOULIN ROUGE e si percorre una via totalmente piena di sexy shop e locali hard da una parte e dall’altra negozi di ogni genere di vestiti, scarpe (tipo mercato).Percorrere a piedi le vie fino ad arrivare alla fermata metro di ABBESSES dove seguendo le indicazioni si arriva alla funicolare per Montmartre. Salire con questa o sulla lunga scalinata fino ad arrivare ai piedi della chiesa del Sacre Coeur davanti alla quale si apre una discesa di scale e giardini e si vede un bellissimo panorama di Parigi. Proseguire circondando tutta la chiesa fino a Place de Tertre ricca di artisti di strada e negozietti vari e arrivare alla chiesa di Saint Pierre.Ritornare quindi a piedi verso la fermata metro di Pialle e scendere alla fermata St. Lazare proseguendo fino ai magazzini Printemp e poi La Favette. Salire fino al 7^ piano nella terrazza panoramica per godere della vista (davanti l’Opera e sul fondo la Tour Eiffel). Sempre con la metro arrivare di nuovo a Place Concorde e vedere la piazza (ruota panoramica, obelisco, fontana) proseguendo per gli Champ Elisee fino all’Arc de Trionphe e ritorno di nuovo a Concorde.2 GIORNOGiornata dedicata al centro città quindi prendere la metro fino a Concorde e poi la linea 1 fino a Chatelet per il cambio con la linea 4 fino a Citè. Si è sull’isola centrale. Dirigersi verso Notre Dame e costeggiarla tutta. Andare al Palais de Justice che contiene la Conciergerie e la Saint Chapelle (visita da non perdere € 8,00). Percorrere il lungo Senna e attraversare il Pont Neuf. A sinistra verso il Louvre (chiuso il martedì) la sua piazza e la piramide di ingresso. Davanti si trovano i giardini. Proseguire ritornando indietro verso Les Forum des Halles (grande centro commerciale sotterraneo), la chiesa di St. Eustache e il centro artistico Pompidou (chiuso il martedì). Continuare verso Place de Vosges e la Place de la Bastille (solo una colonna centrale ad un rondò molto trafficato).Riprendere sempre la metro (linea 12) direzione fermata Solferino. Dirigersi al Museo d’Orsay (ingresso € 9,00) con la mostra permanente degli impressionisti all’ultimo piano. Proseguire a piedi costeggiando tutta la Senna fino ad arrivare alla Tour Eiffel. Attraversare i giardini de Camp de Marc fino a giungere all’Ecole Militare.3^ GIORNOGiornata dedicata alla vecchia Parigi del Quartiere Latino quindi dirigersi verso Les Invalides fino alla fermata metro (linea 13) di Varenne fino a Duroc per incrociare la linea 10 fermata Le moine (quartiere Latino). Proseguire in direzione Panteon e percorrere tutta la tipica via Mouffetard ricca di botteghe artigiane e prodotti tipici. Andare alla fermata metro Censier (linea 7) fino a Jussieu per incrociare la linea 10 fino a Mabillon. Vedere la chiesa di St. Sulpice e St. Germani de Pres. Riprendere la metro (linea 4) fermata omonima per raggiungere Chatelet dove si incrocia la linea 1. Proseguire per la Defense (ultima fermata) dove si vede le Grand Arch e dove si trova il grandissimo centro commerciale.Sempre con la linea 1 si ritorna alla fermata Port Maillot per la fermata bus di rientro in aeroporto (essere alla fermata almeno 3,30 h. prima del volo). Nei pressi all’interno del palazzo dei congressi esiste un centro commerciale e nei dintorni molti negozi.Per quanto riguarda il cibo esistono moltissime boulangerie dove acquistare baghette da mangiare per strada e altrettante pasticcerie. Non mancano i tipici Mac Donald o Quik. Conviene comprare l'acqua sempre nei mini market a prezzi modici mentre nei locali il prezzo è altissimo.La promessa è di tornare presto!!!!!"
40,“Un séjour presque parfait”,"Excellent centre-ville pour tourisme pédestre! Architecture magnifique, beaucoup à voir et à faire. Nous pouvons recommander le restaurant Polly Maggoo, rue de Petit-Pont (rive gauche, près de Notre Dame). Transports sont très ponctuels et efficaces.Mais ATTENTION à la ligne RER B (aéroports) qui est ciblé par voleurs et arnaqueurs - nous avons temoigné deux tentes à vol dans le même voyage! (une tente à notre groupe inclue). Si vous devez prendre cette ligne, gardez bien vos sacs! (ou prenez un taxi)"
50,“la capitale de la france”,"J'ai passé dernièrement quelques jours à Paris.On en dit beaucoup de bien : plus belle ville du monde, ville des amoureux ... J'étais septique quant à ces dires, mais je dois avouer que cette ville m'a charmé. Du moins le 7eme et 2eme arr.Les monument sont bien sur d'une immense beauté, mais même les bâtiments les plus simple, style appartement, vous en émerveillent. Vraiment un séjour inoubliable. A voir !!!"
10,“夏は暑い”,パリの公共施設はクーラーの設備が整っていませんので気をつけましょう！ホテルでもクーラーがあるのはフロントだけのところ多数あります、これも地球温暖化の影響でフランス対応が遅れていました
10,“空港と市内の移動手段”,エールフランスの夜行便で現地に着くと大変である。タクシー利用なら問題ないが、コストの関係上で公共交通利用ならである。鉄道は深夜早朝は自重した方がいいみたいでバスは始発まで長時間待機になる。なので、利用時はご注意を。
50,“La France Oh la la !”,"Paris...ville lumière...`c`est tout a fait vraie.Nous avons séjourné deux fois à Paris .La première fois fut un voyage à visiter le tout Paris et nous avons logé aux Cidadines,St- Germain- des- Prés, face à la Seine et cela pour dix jours. C`est un appar. - hôtel avec toutes les commoditées et c`est excellent , vous êtes près de tout; métro , bus, tour de ville, restaurants, en fait c`est l`endroit idéal.L`hôtel peut vous suggérer certains tours guidés, cela en vaut la peine surtout pour aller visiter Versailles, le Louvre, et les environs et le coût est très acceptable. Notre séjour fut très agréable, mais trop court.Pour ce qui est de notre deuxième séjour, nous sommes partis cinq semaines; une semaine à Paris, logé à l`hôtel Sélect , Place de la Sorbonne ...Excellent emplacementet et super hôtel et par la suite visiter la France. nous avons loué une voiture et nous commençions notre voyage en partant de Paris, en utilisant seulement les routes secondaires pour pouvoir mieux connaître et aussi visiter....tout ces petits villages ,et ainsi profiter à plein de ce voyage.La Normandie , la Bretagne, les Pyrénées,st- Emillion, Monaco, la Côte d`Azur, Monpellier, Carcasonne, St-Malo, La Rochelle, Mont st- Michel , Lourdes, et même Fort Boyard...He oui, encore et encore, et j`en passe, pour enfin terminer quelques jours à Nice sur la Promenade des Anglais à l`hôtel Mercure, Excellent hôtel.....délicieux déjeuners.Encore une fois tour organisé pour visiter Nice et les alentours...village d`Eze, le marché de fleurs, Fragonnard. la .parfumerie etc Super..Lorsque nous visitions les villes de France, nous logions dans des Gîtes reconnus et c`était vraiment exceptionnel.. Tous avaient le petit déjeuner compris dans le prix,......à faire et à refaire ( 3 jours au même endroit. quelques fois 4 ).Nous avons cotoyé des cultivateurs , des pêcheurs, des éleveurs de bovin, des marins, ...des médecins ect. de tous les âge , de tous les métiers et ce fut pour nous des leçons de courage et de vie pour certains, et d`amour pour d`autres. Une expérience riche à vivre en émotion de toute sorte.Nous avons visité beaucoup de villes et d`endroits merveilleux, mais ce n`est qu`une infime fraction de ce que l`on a pu voir.Notre prochain voyage sera OÙ......on ne sait pas encore, mais la France demeure et demeurera notre coup de coeur !Bonne fin d`année à tous !"
50,“cha”,"Jolie ville , agreable ,on trouve tous ce que on cherche,dernière mode a paris toujours"
20,“パリ、タクシーでの注意”,パリ旅行にツアーで行った際、自由行動中タクシーを利用した人の何人かが”紙幣のすりかえ”被害に遭っていました。支払いのときに50ユーロ札を出したら受取った瞬間20ユーロ札にすりかえて「20ユーロだからまだ足りない！」と言われたそうです。文句を言っても結局返してもらえなかったと言っていました。私も4回タクシーを利用しましたが、その様な事がなかったのですが、支払いの際は「50ユーロね」くらいは言葉に出した方がいいと思います。
50,“憧れの街　パリ”,３年前、初めて遠くの外国へ一人旅をした思い出です。パリに２週間近く、アパートを借りて過ごしました。凱旋門や美術館近くの場所だったので、セーヌ川沿いは散歩コースでした。景色は最高でした。食事のために、マルシェに出かけ、たくさんの野菜や果物を飽きるほど食べることができました。フランスパンとそれに付けるチーズもおいしくてたまりませんでした。蚤の市も大きな所へ２カ所行ってきて、セーターやバックなど、トランクに詰め込めるだけ購入し、楽しみました。パリ市民になった気分で、バスや地下鉄に乗って出かけたのですが、間違いだらけだったことや言葉が通じなかったことがやや苦しかったのですが、これもいい経験と思ってます。夏の訪問でしたので、バカンスに浸っているパリ市民が多く、旅行者がほとんどでした。その方たちは、ツアーが多く、バスや地下鉄では見かけませんでした。現地の方に特に駅員さんに片言の英語で話しかけても、返事は貰えず、自力で生活したって感じです。
50,“交通機関”,以前はただブラブラ歩く、時間に余裕のあるバックパッカー旅行だったのですが、今回初めて少ない日数で、自分で観光地をひた走る旅行をしました。（連れが初めてのパリだったので。）そのため、地下鉄とバスを乗りまくり、観光地から観光地へと移動しました。モビリス（パリの一日乗車券）を購入。一枚づつかったら、決してこの値段ではすまないほど、恐らく２倍以上はしたと思うほどに、乗り倒しました。観光地から観光地までは地下鉄とバスを使えば、必ず近くまで移動できます。また、待ち時間も、日中なら長くて１０分程度です。地下鉄はそれほど待ちません。バスも優先レールがあるようで、渋滞に悩まされるようなことはありませんでした。また、バスに関しては、メジャーなオペラや凱旋門などで乗り継げば、立派な夜景ツアーまで楽しめます。夜遅くまで走っているし、観光バスより、全然お得です。バスラインに関しては、ガイドブックでも十分かと思います。もっとしりたければ、観光案内所やホテルに置いてあるパリの地図に充分載っていると思います。日数の限られた旅行者にはお勧めです。
40,“モンマルトルの汽車型トラム”,モンマルトルへ行ったとき、広場の脇に見つけたのが汽車型のトラム。モンマルトルを中心にサクレクール寺院・テアトル広場から、周辺のまち、そして、ムーランルージュ前などを一周してくる観光用トラムです。パリの街を見るという意味でも時間があると乗ってみることをおススメします。値段は忘れましたが、とても安かったと思います。
10,“想像と違う　パリ”,水が合わないので一か月いて、ミイラみたいになった。現地で住んでる人も、旅行者も少し長くいるとかぴかぴになるらしく、湿気の多いアジアから行くと、カルキの強い硬水と乾燥した空気にやられるらしいです。これからの季節、ほんとに気をつけてください。（短期旅行ならだいじょうぶかもしれないけど、顔は洗わないで拭き取りでメイクを落とすようです）
30,“汚い、、、”,最初のイメージが汚いでした。空港からの電車から見える外の景色には壁の落書き。かなりありました。あんなのばっかり見るとパリのイメージが台無し。そしてホテルについて周辺を散策すると犬のフンが、そこらじゅうに。私たちのホテルはちょっと離れてたので、いい立地ではなかったのもあるかもしれません。そしてシャンゼリゼ通りを歩くと、すごい喫煙者の数。どこにいても煙が来るし、本当にハンカチで口を押さえながら歩かないといけなかったです。それでもとても気分は悪くなりましたしね。でもそこから凱旋門、エッフェル塔など観光したらパリの見所を見れて楽しかったですが。私はかなりたばこの煙がだめな人なので、かなり幻滅です。話には聞いていましたが、フランスはどこにいても喫煙者だらけですね。
40,“フランス革命記念日”,7月に9日間、フランスを旅行してまいりました。14日はちょうど革命記念日。その日が私たちのツアーの最終目的地パリ宿泊の日でした。着いてびっくりしたのは、通りの両端にずらっと並ぶパトカー(フランスでは何というのか、わかりませんが…)とそしておびただしい警官の数。弁当を広げている人や歓談している人など様々にリラックスした警官。こんなにパリに集中していたら、地方で犯罪が起きたら、どうなる事やら？そんな疑問もわくほどです。式典そのものは見ることが出来なかったのですが、現地ツアコンダクターの方が、バスでの移動中にその様子を語りべのごとく話してくれて、まるで見たかのように満足しました。夜はライトアップされたエッフェル塔と共に記念の花火が見学出来ました。それもホテルの大きな窓から、ワインを片手に。私の歴史にも刻まれた素敵な記念日になりました。

Mentre aspettavamo di salire abbiamo fotografato tutto il fotografabile nella Place du Parvis di Notre Dame ;-) La salita sulle Torri di Notre Dame è stata per me una vera gioia..dallo scorso anno sognavo di salirci e di vedere da vicino i Gargoyle ed Emmanuel..è stato davvero stupendo. Una gran faticaccia salire e poi scendere i quasi 400 scalini (scala a chiocciola) ma ne valeva la pena!Una volta scesi ci siamo recati alla Conciergerie, a breve distanza da Notre Dame. Tra fila (con PMP) e controllo di sicurezza ci abbiamo messo si e no 20 minuti. Anche qua..una meraviglia. In tanti mi avevano detto di essere rimasti un po' delusi dalla Conciergerie. A me, anzi a noi, non è capitato. Sarà che a Parigi ogni cosa trasuda storia e noi adoriamo la storia (in modo particolare Luca) ma ne siamo rimasti davvero affascinati. Bellissimo anche il cortile interno con il lavatoio. Molto toccante leggere i nomi di tutti i ghigliottinati..Un po' meno interessante perché non originale, ma comunque meritevole di attenzione, è la ricostruzione di alcune celle.Una volta usciti dalla Conciergerie era l'ora di pranzo e ci siamo aggirati per le varie viuzze (riattraversando il Pont Neuf) alla ricerca di una boulangerie. Armati di baguette e bibita ce ne siamo tornati sull'Ile de la Cité in un angolino suggerito da un amico virtuale. Si tratta della punta dell'Ile della Cité, lungo la Senna. Per raggiungerlo si deve andare nella piazza con la statua di Henry IV a cavallo, la Square du Vert Galant; arrivati alle spalle della statua scendiamo le scalette che ci portano sotto Pont Neuf. Sbucheremo davanti all’ingresso di un piccolissimo parco, a destra vedremo l’approdo delle Vedettes du Pont Neuf, noi ci dirigiamoci a sinistra, e poi a destra in modo tale da passeggiare sul lungo Senna avendo il fiume alla nostra sinistra e il parco alla nostra destra. Arriviamo fino alla punta dove troveremo una sola panchina, in pietra, su cui accomodarci..un posticino delizioso e molto romantico.Dopo la sosta per il pranzo siamo ripartiti alla volta del Museo d'Orsay, poco distante dal Pont Neuf. Anche in questo caso breve fila per entrare, l'ingresso per chi ha il PMP è il C.Anche qui..siamo rimasti deliziati dalla bellezza del museo e dalle opere eccezionali che sono esposte. Noi ci siamo dedicati esclusivamente al 5° livello, interamente dedicato all'impressionismo, mia grande passione, e ne siamo usciti un paio d'ore più tardi..non prima di aver fatto una sosta sulla terrazza panoramica del Museo dalla quale si gode di una vista mozzafiato.Una volta usciti dal Museo d'Orsay abbiamo preso la RER e ci siamo recati alla Tour Eiffel..altra mia grande passione parigina..Ci siamo rilassati (le gambe iniziavano a far male...) nello Champ de Mars e poi abbiamo scattato una marea di foto alla torre..che piano piano iniziava ad illuminarsi con l'arrivo del tramonto.spese del secondo giorno:€ 11,00 per il pranzo€ 11,60 per la cena€ 6,48 per la spesa in un Monoprix vicino all'Hotel (bottigliette di acqua e qualche lattina)@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@23/09/09di buon'ora siamo andati alla Sainte Chapelle.Una volta entrati siamo andati subito alla Cappella Superiore...inutile dire che è stupenda da togliere il fiato..e ve lo dico nonostante gran parte delle vetrate fossero coperte per restauri. E' davvero molto molto bella. E si visita in breve tempo.Una volta usciti dalla Sainte Chapelle abbiamo deciso di andare al Louvre. Una bella passeggiata, foto varie alla Senna, alla Conciergerie...e poi si arriva al Museo. Brevissima coda, con il PMP si entra dal Passage Richelieu e non avevamo nessuno davanti. Ci siamo armati della Monguide, un piccolo palmare che aiuta a visitare il museo, e abbiamo cercato di organizzare la nostra visita. All'inizio ci siamo un po' persi..è esageratamente grande e un po' dispersivo. Ma poi, siamo riusciti a orientarci e abbiamo visitato tutte e tre le ali: Denon, Sully e Richelieu. Per ovvi motivi non ci siamo potuti soffermare su tutte le opere esposte..ci siamo dedicati principalmente alla scultura italiana, la pittura italiana, la scultura greca, la sezione etrusca, al Louvre medievale. Personalmente sono rimasta molto affascinata dalla bellezza della Venere di Milo..è a dir poco meravigliosa. La Gioconda..beh..si è molto bella, senza ombra di dubbio..però..non mi è piaciuto il contesto...si vede a vari metri di distanza, è protetta da un vetro, la sala è piena di turisti urlanti..insomma mi è sembrata un po' esagerata la cosa.. Mi è piaciuta molto di più la Vergine delle Rocce, sempre di Leonardo. Ma queste sono solo le mie impressioni.Abbiamo poi pranzato, con le gambe ormai a pezzi, verso le 15.30 all'interno del Louvre, in uno dei tanti bar, i prezzi sono abbastanza accessibili.Dopo il Louvre siamo andati nel 19° arrondissement per prendere il battello e fare una romantica crociera sul Canal Saint Martin ;-) Molto carina la crociera, interessante vedere tutta la serie di chiuse e di ponti. Ancora più bello il tratto finale nel quale ci troviamo sotto alla strada, nella parte del Canale che è stato interrato. Si arriva alla Bastille e si vede in tutto il suo splendore la Colonne di Juillet..Davvero una bella esperienza!spese del giorno:€ 12,00 per le due monguide€ 13,10 per il pranzo (una baguette, una focaccia farcita, una bibita e una birra)€ 22,00 per la crociera sul Canal Saint Martin€ 15,40 per la cena@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@24.09.09Mattinata dedicata a Versailles: si parte presto dall'hotel, come al solito. E con la RER C andiamo a Versailles. Nel giro di pochi minuti a piedi dalla stazione si raggiunge la Reggia. La fila sembra lunga (anche per chi ha il Pass) ma è molto scorrevole e nel giro di 10 minuti siamo dentro. Qui abbiamo fatto subito un bell'errore...siamo andati subito nei giardini.....ma una volta che si è nei giardini non c'è verso di rientrare nel palazzo a meno di rifare la fila...e quindi ci rimettiamo in coda e, non contenti della rapidità della prima, ce la sorbiamo per altri 20 minuti..A questo punto ci siamo dedicati alla visita del Palazzo...bello, bellissimo..un tripudio di ori, di lusso...Luigi XIV aveva davvero delle belle manie di grandezza :DIl Palazzo è incredibile, dalle finestre si gode di un'ottima visuale sui giardini che sono letteralmente a perdita d'occhio. Una volta terminata la visita del Castello, siamo usciti nei giardini e abbiamo deciso di prendere il trenino per andare a visitare il Grand Trianon e il Petit Trianon, nonché il Grand Canal. Che dirvi? E' un'esperienza da fare assolutamente. Merita davvero. A me ha molto colpito il Petit Trianon..un gran gusto Maria Antonietta ;-)Dopo le visite, ci siamo recati, sempre con il trenino, al Grand Canal. E qui con le nostre immancabili baguettes ci siamo goduti la bellezza e l'immensità dei giardini. Una favola ad occhi aperti..Nel pomeriggio siamo rientrati a Parigi e verso l'ora del tramonto, finalmente, ci siamo messi in fila per salire sulla Tour Eiffel :D con mia grande, grandissima gioia!Dopo una mezz'ora di coda siamo arrivati agli ascensori e siamo saliti fino alla sommità. Da lassù si gode di una vista incredibile..abbiamo anche avuto la fortuna di trovare una giornata abbastanza limpida e quindi la visibilità era molto buona! Foto foto a gogò! Fin verso le 21..poi siamo scesi (abbiamo fatto più fila per scendere che per salire..) e siamo andati a cena.spese del giorno:€ 11,80 per i biglietti per la RER per raggiungere Versailles (x 2 persone, AR)€ 9,80 per il pranzo (due baguette)€ 13,00 trenino x due persone€ 11,80 cartoline e francobolli€ 26,00 salita sulla Tour Eiffel x due persone€ 15,40 cena da Quick@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@25.09.09mattinata dedicata allo shopping: Galeries Lafayette, Fnac, Virgin Megastore.E nel pomeriggio abbiamo passeggiato tranquillamente per Montmartre..perdendoci tra le sue viuzze..che meraviglia!Siamo partiti dal Moulin Rouge per poi toccare alcuni dei punti secondo noi più meritevoli della Butte: Lapin Agile, Moulin de la Galette, Place des Abbesses, Place du Tertre.Zona davvero carinissima che lo scorso anno avevamo appena sfiorato. Un vero peccato non averla scoperta prima ma sono molto contenta di aver fatto questa passeggiata ;-)spese del giorno:€ 14,40 per il pranzo (due fettine di carne, due pepsi grandi, verdure a volontà)@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@26.09.09Ultimo giorno..anzi ultima mattina a Parigi...alle 15 dobbiamo trovarci a Port Maillot per il ritorno a casa :-(Guardiamo la nostra guida e alla fine Luca propone uno degli itinerari a piedi consigliati: optiamo per una bella passeggiata in una zona a noi del tutto sconosciuta, la Butte Aux Cailles.Zona carinissima, quartiere quasi interamente Art Nouveau..delizioso! Sembra quasi di essere in un piccolo paesino invece che in una metropoli come Parigi.Da qua ci dirigiamo con il metro verso la Moschea di Parigi che purtroppo però dalle 12 alle 14 resta chiusa e quindi possiamo solo sbirciare il meraviglioso interno..e quindi optiamo per rilassarci un po' al vicino Jardin des Plantes...All'ora di pranzo ci riavviciniamo al nostro hotel, pranziamo con 2 crepes a testa :D una salata e una alla Nutella in una creperie in Rue de la Bonne Nouvelle e poi via verso casa.....ciao Parigispese del giorno:€ 13,60 per il pranzo@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@le spese totali:per il viaggio:volo: € 149,44 per due persone ARshuttle: € 52,00 per due persone ARper il soggiorno:hotel: € 285,00 per due persone in camera matrimoniale con bagno doccia privato e colazione inclusaper il metro e la rer: 62,60 €per i pasti: 124,18 €per i musei: € 109,50 per due Paris Museum Pass per 4 giorni ordinati online e recapitati a casaper le spese extra (monguide Louvre, trenino Versailles, salita sulla Tour Eiffel, crociera): € 73,00per cartoline e francobolli: € 11,80in totale: € 867,52 in due..non male direi per 6 giorni a Parigi, no? ;)E' stata una settimana favolosa...fosse per me ci tornerei anche subito!!!!ciao ciaoMILENA"

10,“notte bianca 2009- nuit blanche”,"E' doveroso dire la verità sulla decantata notte bianca a Parigi che per citare Fantozzi è un CAG°°°° PAZZESCA.Non vi aspettate le nostre notti bianche, con concerti, rappresentazioni tratrali, musei aperti, negozi aperti...NO.Niente di tutto ciò.Tutto chiuso. Dai negozi ai musei ai LOCALI che chiudono alle 3, alla steffa Torre che si spegne tristemente alle 4 di mattina...la notte bianca francese, come confermato da altri che hanno visto le edizioni precedenti, consiste in 4 proiezioni di dubbio gusto, file lunghissime per vedre....""il nulla"".Insomma alle 23,00 si sbatte la testa al muro.La metropolitana chiude, i mezzi non passano, non si trova un taxy...insomma, lasciate proprio perdere!"

50,“il quartiere Latino ideale per giovani viaggiatori”,"Nel mese di Agosto ho trascorso una settimana di vacanza a Parigi. Abbiamo alloggiato in hotel ottimo per rapporto qualità prezzo ed era situato era il quartiere Latino ideale per i giovani viaggiatori maggiormente se studenti. Nel cuore del quartiere latino emerge la plurisecolare università della Sorbona, quindi colpisce fin dall'inizio l'elevato numero di studenti. Inoltre la presenza del Pantheon rende questo quartiere ancora più interessante sia per la bellezza del monumento con la piazza molto suggestiva al tramonto sia per la sua importanza visto che sono sepolti i ""grandi"" della Francia come Voltaire, Hugo, Dumas ecc. Nelle viuzze antiche verso sera ho apprezzato la vitalità di tanti ragazzi di tutte le nazioni che passeggiano e riempiono gli innumerevoli ristorantini che vanno dalla cucina francesa a quella dei paesi stranieri.Una delle vie antiche e movimentate è Rue Mouffetard, di giorno si passeggia tra il mercatino dove spicca la frutta e la verdura, di sera ideale per chi vuole stare tra i giovani e trascorrere dei momenti piacevoli in uno dei suoi ristoranti,bar, pub per tutti i gusti e per tutte le tasche.E' un quartiere molto ben collegato attraverso i mezzi di trasporto come le tante stazioni metro e gli autobus che passano di continuo. Una tappa obbligata del quartiere latino è la passeggiata con sosta nei giardini di Luxemburg con i giardini alla francese nel suo cuore e ai lati quelli all'inglese. Oltretutto il palazzo presente è sede del Senato di Francia. Amavo al primo mattino passeggiare e sostare sulle sue panchine magari gustando una briosche o pain au chocolat.Per me giovane è stata la scelta ideale soggiornare a Parigi in questo quartiere e sicuramente lo sceglierò la prossima volta che tornerò a Parigi."
40,“Paris.... romantica Paris.”,Estuve el año pasado en ella... llovio y llovio..Muy a parte de ello... los servicios de buses para turismo son una gran opcion y a pesar de la lluvia... si estas bien equipado es inolvidable sentarte en la parte superior del bus al aire libre... con el paraguas.. escuchando las explicaciones y con musica de antaño rememorando epocas y personajes.La ciudad es encantadora y romantica muy sobre el promedio ya que tiene muchas cosas que ver y magnificos lugares que visitar..El idioma ... no hablo frances pero no la pase mal entre el saludo en frances... la pregunta en ingles .... rellenar algo la conversacione en Spanglish ya que tambien me respondian en español y luego despedirme y dar las gracias por la respuesta nuevamente en frances.. la pase muy bien y fue gracioso incluso.La gente muy agradable.Ciudad a la que volveré imagino pronto..5 estrellas para Paris..
50,“il mio luogo preferito è PARIGI”,Vi consiglio di visitare Parigi perchè è una città ben collegataattraverso la Metro con tutti i monumenti principali ci sono cartelli che indicano molto bene quali mezzi prendere.Comunque appena scesi dall aereo comprata una carta che vi consente di prendere qualsiasi mezzoPoi a me è sembrata una città tranquilla non c è traffico viaggiano tutti con i mezzi l aria è pulita.Io ho alloggiato in un albergo al centro e ho visto che sono molto cordiali.Forse il mangiare non è dei migliori ma sè trovate un ristorante italiano mangiate bene e con poca spesa.Poi un posto da visitare è Eurodisney con tante attrazioni ve lo consiglio per qualunque età non credete che è un posto solo per bambini.
50,"“parigi non è niente, ma niente è senza parigi.”","parigi è sempre parigi,è inutile indicare i luoghi visitati, chi è che non li conosce, ma la cosa piu' bella da descrivere è come vivere parigi.partiamo dalla metro, faticosa, ma bellissima, con le fermate riccamente addobbate, dipinte, decorate, arricchite di quello spirito che ti fa piacere aspettare il metro' e volte prendi quello dopo perchè non hai finito di gaurdare bene.se andate al sacro cuore, scendete a Abbesses, qui attenzione, se non siete stanchi fate la salita a piediin una scla a chicciola, larga ma faticossisima, per ammirare la storia di parigi sui muri, fantastica.parlare di parigi delle sue strade, chiamamole minori, dove i parigini amano vivere la città.oppure il nuo vo quartiere della defence, dove c'è una parigi cosi' nuova, cosi' bella, che ti sembra di vivere in due città distinte, ma unite dallo spirito dalla sua aria fantastica.infine un giro nel battello di notte, oltre i classici monumenti, ma soprattutto per il giro intorno alla torre eiffel, dov si ammira il suo splendore dalle luci che la rendono meravigliosamente affascinante, come il resto della città.parigi non è niente, ma niente è senza parigi."
50,"“Parigi...vivibile,affascinante,tutta da scoprire!!”","Una città semplicemente bellissima...che non delude affatto le grosse aspettative dovuto al suo nome immortale! Parigi: affascinante,piena di attrazioni,monumenti,parchi...cose da fare! Dove la vita può essere frenetica,al caldo,al freddo,vissuta di giorno,di notte, o semplicemente in tranquillità! Ogni arrondissement ha una storia a sè! Da non perdere assolutamente la Tour Montparnasse,dalla quale si può ammirare Parigi,TUTTA PARIGI, ed è sensazionale! La basilica del Sacro Cuore toglie il fiato, la Tour Eiffel sia di giorno che di notte, nella sua maestosità, è davvero inimmaginabile! Le moulin rouge, caratteristico locale a luci russe, è d'obbligo vederlo dal di fuori e scattare una foto proprio sotto al mulino!! Un giro nel 1° arrondissement porta poi a visitare ed ammirare la grandissima cattedrale di Notre Dame de Paris, la Senna, il comune, l'hotel de Ville e poi...il Louvre...meravigliosamente fantastico! Con le sue piramidi crea un gioco di luci degno di essere osservato e, se vi piace l'arte, o semplicemente volete dare uno sguardo ad opere famosissime...fateci un salto...attraverso le biglietterie elettroniche evitate la coda ma...se avete meno di 25 anni e siete europei...è Gratis, quindi...buon giro al Louvre!! ;) Una crepe nei dintorni...mi raccomando non perdetevela...è la vera crepe...originale e buonissima! Altro da non perdere...l'hotel des invalides, con il suo museo delle armi. Se avete tempo a sufficienza e vi piace il genere ""parchi divertimento"" non dimenticate Disneyland Resort Paris...ad un'ora di treno dal centro (i collegamenti parigini metro-autobus-treno SONO MOLTO PIU' CHE EFFICIENTI!!) è adatto a bambini ed adulti, fiabesco e divertente, con giochi super adrenalinici che fanno parecchia concorrenza ai parchi di ""casa nostra"".....l'apparenza inganna!! Provare per credere ;) E che dire di Versailles......oro,giardini,lusso,caratteristicità,storia,ammirazione...ecco tutto quello che troverete, mozza il fiato soprattutto la bellezza dei giardini quindi...primavera e estate sono le stagioni perfette per goderseli pienamente! Grazie ad abbonamenti settimanali e turistici è possibilegirare in lungo e in largo per la città, semplicemente con un pezzettino di carta! Alcune tessere offrono anche importanti sconti in numerosi luoghi d'attrazione, Disneyland e Tour Montparnasse compresi...tutto dipende da ciò che farete, dal tempo, e da dove alloggerete...carnet di biglietti, carte orange, paris visite...non esiste IL MIGLIORE...tutto dipende dalla vostra personale vacanza!! Mangiare a Parigi? Inevitabilmente caro in bar, fast food, ristoranti, cafè...ma ottimo comportamente il ""fare la spesa""..certo se alloggiate presso qualche bed & breakfast o appartamento. Si può risparmiare, con piccoli accorgimenti! Se invece questo non vi preoccupa....fate un giro agli Champs Elysées, mangiate una pizza o un bel menù tipico in uno dei ristoranti, ma non dimenticatevi di assaggiare la tipica baguette francese!!! :) Ma...COME arrivare a Parigi? Via treno o aereo sono le migliori soluzioni, tutto dipende da dove vivete e da cosa preferite! Indubbiamente più economici sono i voli aerei, low cost ovviamente, ryanair in prima fila, le compagnie aeree low cost atterrano in aeroporti minori ma attraverso gli ottimi collegamenti parigini...in un'ora arriverete ovunque!! Che dire di più...è una città che non delude, c'è molto da vedere e, come già detto, può essere vissuta in mille modi diversi...c'è da scegliere l'arrondissement in base a che tipo di vacanza si vuol fare! Voglia di shopping? Gallerie La Fayette e Rue de Rivoli sono in pole position!! Si cammina molto, ci si stanca e le ore di sonno sono sempre poche ma...ne vale la pena!! Non mi resta che augurarvi BON VOYAGE!!! Spero che la mia guida sia stata utile e vi invito a contattarmi per qualunque informazione che non avete trovato qui descritta...ci sarebbe cosi tanto da dire!!!Un saluto a tutti!Daniela"
50,“パリのいいところ”,町全体が芸術作品みたいで感動しましたごみが落ちてたり路上駐車が残念すぎたのですが建物一つ一つは最高もう少し人が親切だったらいいのになぁいじわるですねきちんといいたいこといわないとつらい思いもでも美術館などみてたらそんなことも忘れますなン度も足を運びたいと思いましたさすがヨーロッパですね

50,“新婚旅行”,新婚旅行でフランスのパリに行きました。とても天気がよく充実した旅行でした。エッフェル塔、凱旋門、モンサンミッシェル、ディズニーランドパリなどなど。エッフェル塔は夕方から行き、セーヌ川クルージングしながらのイルミネーションが灯されたエッフェル塔は格別です。モンサンミッシェルはパリ中心部からパスで行き、結構時間がかかりましたが、CM等ではみたことありましたが、実物は壮大で日本では感じられない雰囲気を味わいました。モンサンミッシェルではオムレツが有名です。特別美味しいものではありませんでしたが、記念に食べる価値はあると思います。
40,“おしゃれな街”,街や人がおしゃれで気候も悪くなかったです。２月頃に研修旅行でおとずれたのですが、とても楽しくすごせました。しかし、どこに行ってもトイレが汚かったり、便座がなく便器がむき出しになっているところばかりで気持ちが悪かったです･･･。でもご飯はおいしかったです。ちょうどセールもやっていて、日本の三越デパートでお買い物させていただき、ブランドのバッグがセール＋免税でかなり安く変えました！
50,“晴天”,新婚旅行でフランスに行きました。初めての海外旅行でした。エッフェル塔、凱旋門、ルーブル美術館、モンサンミッシェル、ヴェルサイユ宮殿など４日間たっぷりとフランス巡りをしました。すべてがおしゃれでフランスに酔ってしまいました。ルーブル美術館は広すぎて全部廻りきるには丸一日必要なのではないのでしょうか？モンサンミッシェルは世界遺産です。そこではプーラルおばさんのオムレツが有名で食べましたが、特別美味しいというものではありません。それにしても、最初から最後までずっと天気がよく最高でした。
40,“女性はちょっと気をつけて”,パリは、もちろん、町並みもすばらしく、素敵なところでしたが、女性は少し気をつけたほうが良いと思います。友人が仕事で滞在していたので、昼間は一人で行動していました。一人でパリ大学のそばの信号待ちをしていたところ、隣に３５歳前くらいの男性がぴたっと立ったので、何気なく見ると、私にだけ見えるように、いわゆる成人向けの写真を広げていました。もちろん、信号が変わったらすぐに立ち去りましたが。後、リュクサンブール公園に行くのに地下鉄に乗ったら、６０才くらいの男性に英語で話しかけられ、無視するのも失礼と思い、少しだけ話(日本から来たとか、友人を訪ねてきたとか）をしたら、(その場で別のところに行くのだと思っていたら０、公園まで付いてきて、自宅にあるホームバーで一緒に飲もうとか、しつこく付きまとわれました。そのほか、女性が好きな国民性か、こういうことが結構ありました。昼間なので、このようなトラブルはたいしたことなかったのですが、女性の一人での行動は気をつけたほうが良いと思います。そのほかは、セーヌ川沿いで、星の王子様の絵葉書がたくさん売っていたので(星の王子様が好きなので）購入できたり、よかったです。
50,“真夏のパリ”,プライド高くフレンドリーではない！と噂を聞いていましたがとんでもなく英語・フランス語どちらで話しますか？など丁寧に聞いてくれたり日本語も話そうとする努力が溢れています。景色はもちろんのこと人の変化にびっくり！４年前に訪れたときとは大きく人が変化しているように思いました。メトロを使えばアクセスは便利だし、美術館巡りもやはり何度訪れても充実感がありますね。前回は秋、今回は夏。また季節を変えて訪れたくなりました。セーヌ川の船遊びはいろいろな会社からでていますがautobusがオススメです。１日何度hop on hop offしても１２ユーロ観光案内はありませんが主要な観光地のところで乗り降り可能。アクセスとしてもセーヌ川沿いの景色を楽しむにしても便利です。
40,“Parigi: tips e cose da evitare”,"Sono stata a Parigi con il mio ragazzo. Hotel della Catena IBIS (Accor), sono due stelle con servizi sopra la media dei due stelle francesi. Nonostante questo, siamo finiti in quello con le pessime condizioni... sia chiaro che andava sempre benissimo! Costo medio per notte 39 euro inclusa prima colazione (a persona), no male per essere la settimana di Ferragosto a Parigi!!Per Viaggiare: Visit Paris - carta che ti permette di girare su tutti i mezzi pubblici e di avere anche qualche sconticino per la visita di alcuni monumenti (non musei!!)Consiglio unico: acquistare online o da biglietterie autorizzate in città i tkt per louvre e versailles prima di andare. Al louvre mi è andata bene... sono andata alle macchine automatiche e non ho fatto fila! A versailles... 2 ore!!!! Anche se i tkt costeranno di +... nn ha prezzo il costo di saltare una fila chilometrica!!Abbiamo improvvisato una cena aperitivo sulla passerella di legno che porta al louvre... nn lasciatevi sfuggire la vista suggestiva della Senna... sulla sera.... addentando una baguette con il formaggio francese, prosciutto e un bel bicchiere di vino!!! Ovviamente.. comprato al quartiere latino e consumato a sedere in terra!Anche una dormitina nel giardini sotto la torre eiffel... veramente bella!!!!"
30,"“intimo, carino.”","Sono stata in questo hotel nel dicembre 2008. Centralissimo, piccolo, comodo. Non è un albergo lussuoso, ma si sta bene.La stanza era piccolina ma con tutto il necessario. La pulizia è nella norma della categoria. Colazione soddisfacente. La posizione è veramente bella,"
40,“Alfa Hotel Nation”,"Hotel non lussuoso, perfetto per chi, come me, preferisce risparmiare sull'albergo ed avere più soldi da spendere nella fantastica Parigi.Hotel piccolo, stanze con bagno privato piccol ma pulitissimi, salviette cambiate ogni giorno.Personale gentilissimo, colazione 4 € con thè, latte, baguette fresca, marmellata.Posizione non centrale ma strategica, place de la Nation che dista pochi metri, ci sono molte fermate del metrò e della rer."
40,“Una città Romantica e accogliente”,"Mai stato in questa città.... e sono stato molto molto contento di averlo fatto...Tutte queste case costruite ancora come una volta, rendono l'atmosfera accogliente e molto romantica.Noi ci siamo affidati alla guida della Lonely Planet, utilissima e veritiera.Vi lascio alcuni consigli utili e non (Parigi non ha bisogno di spiegazioni) :1 - Usate le biciclette per girare (impagabile) perchè invece di fare i topi nella metro avrete la possibilità di godervi gli scorci e tutte le strade stradine di Parigi. Costano 1 euro al giorno o 5 euro per tutta la settimana. E le potete utilizzare per un max di 30 min ... CONSECUTIVI.. Dopodichè dovrete fermarci in una delle tantissime postazioni Velib (quasi 1 ogni 300 m) e prendere su un'altra bicicletta per un altra mezzora...Parigi è grande ... ma se ci pensate .. 6 7 km in bici si fanno in 20 min. Tempo che serve per scendere alla metro ... e se poi dovete pure cambiare forse ce ne mettete pure di più.2 - L'abbonamento alla metro ... fate la carta Navigo, è valida dal lunedi alla domenica, quindi non per x giorni.. ma è + conveniente, anche se fate fino alla zona 5 (dove c'è l'aeroporto). Così evitate l'acquisto di un biglietto per arrivare a Parigi.Ovvio che dovrete programmare la vacanza ""in quel senso"".Altrimenti c'è la Paris Visit che dura 5 giorni da quando la fate.3 - Per mangiare i ristoranti generalmente sono una mazzata sui denti ... Con piatti antipasti e secondo da circa 20 25 € a portata.Consiglio quindi di beccare ristoranti che facciano la ""Formula"" un pò come i nostri menu completi... e ce ne sono ovunque.Con quelli andate dai 13 ai 19 € circa ... ma è un menù completo con antipasto e piatto e dolce (dove presente)... Non c'è coperto o altri costi ...P.s. prendete le caraffe di acqua ... (sono gratuite), una bottiglia di acqua ve la fan pagare anche 5 6 euro.Per qualsiasi info ... contattatemi pure.Saluti a tutti"
50,“the best”,"Excellent restaurant. l 'intérieur est très cosy (teintures rouges, copies de tableaux de Modigliani.carte avec un menu à 35 euros (ou plats a la carte,prix corrects mais un peu plus cher.) .Le menu est très bien.On peut choisir aussi un plateau ""rotonde"" : fruits de mer ,huitres bien fraiches , tourteau, crevettes mayonnaise etc..Je vous conseillerai un kir classique puis le menu qui comporte de delicieux desserts . Bonne carte des vins aussi.Direction très sympathique avec toujours un très bon accueil depuis des années."
50,“cuidad maravillosa”,"maravillosa y cosmopolita ciudad. recomendable por lo menos de visitar una vez en la vida, claro que se necesita mas de una vez para que te enamores mas de Paris"
50,“hotel acte V paris”,"ottimo albergo tre stelle, stanza ampia, in pieno Quartier Latin, pieno di locali, ristoranti, brasserie, pasticcerie, ecc. Consiglio: spendete un po' di più per le stanze interne: rue Monge può essere molto rumorosa!"
40,“高い”,公共の交通機関を使いまくりましょう。地図も充実していますし、日本の住所みたいに地図に番地が乱雑に並んでいるわけではなく、きちんと順序よく番地が決められているので、多少地図に慣れて、住所が分かれば、すぐに見つけられると思います。フランスの公共機関は比較的安いのでどんどん使って、アクティブに動いて下さい。いかんせん、パリは他のフランスの都市に比べて、高いので、レストランやカフェでも入るお店を選ばなければなりませんし、難しい。街の中心のお店は、倍ぐらいしますので覚悟をしておいてください。フランスの朝ご飯は、とても質素でパンとジャム、コーヒのみです。カフェで朝ご飯を頼むと、内容も上記の通り質素なもので、下手をすると１０００円近くとられかねません。朝ご飯を外で食べられるのあれば、パン屋さんの焼きたてのパンを買い、持ち込みでコーヒーをたのみましょう。また、スーパーに行けば、数えきれない種類のバターやチーズ、ハムが売っていますので、ひとつずつ試してみるのもいいです。味は格別で値段もお手頃です。ランチは比較的お手頃価格でボリュームもありますので、おすすめです。ルーブルやオルセーを代表するように１週間滞在しても、見きれない程の見所や博物館があります。訪れるなら計画をして行きましょう。センス良く飾られたお店のウィンドを眺めながらただ町並みを散歩するだけでも、楽しいです。
40,“Mein europäischer Favorit”,"Und das hat was zu heißen.Klar, es ist alles etwas teurer und man zahlt an gewissen Plätzen schonmal 7Euro für einen Organensaft.Aber es gibt soo viele tolle Sachen zu entdecken. Ich persönlich empfehle die Metro als Fortbewegungsmittel - sie ist sehr schnell, fährt alle paar Minuten und man kommt fast überall damit hin. Klar, Eiffelturm etc sollte man sich definitiv ansehen, aber man kann die Stadt mit all ihrer Schönheit auch einfach in einem der zigtausen Cafes genießen. Die Supermärkte haben bis 24Uhr oder die ganze Nacht auf, perfekt für Ferienwohnungsurlauber."
40,“Willkommen in Paris”,"Paris ist wirklich eine Reise wert.Sicherlich sind die Hotels teilweise heillos überteuert, aber kulturell gesehen, ist sie einfach unübertroffen.Eine vergleichbare Metropole mit entsprechendem Charme sucht man wahrscheinlich vergebens im restlichen Europa....und teuer muss Kaufen oder Essen auch nicht sein.Auf der Seite der Seine, die dem Louvre gegenüberliegt, gibt es herrliche kleine Straßen, die zum preiswerten Shoppen und Essen einladen.Viel Spaß in Paris!"

50,“Capodanno 2009 a Parigi!!!”,"Ci ho messo tanto perché non ho mai tempo e, a dire la verità, me ne ero un poco dimenticato! Oggi ho intenzione di raccontarvi molto sommariamente il mio magnifico capodanno passato in una delle più belle città in assoluto, a livello mondiale: Paris. Oui, messieurs.Io e la mia ragazza Stefania abbiamo deciso di trascorrere cinque giorni nella capitale e cercare di visitare il maggior numero di attrazioni possibili. Sapevamo che sarebbe stata un'impresa impossibile, ma sforzandoci siamo comunque riusciti a vedere la maggior parte delle bellezze di questa città.Siamo partiti il 31 Dicembre, mattino, dall'aeroporto malpensa, direzione Charles de Gaulle, con volo EasyJet. Viaggio puntuale, abbastanza comodo. Dopo aver depositato i bagagli in albergo, usciamo e ci dirigiamo subito nel cuore di Parigi, ovvero in Place de la Concorde e sugli Champs Elysées. La giornata non è delle migliori, infatti il cielo è nuvoloso come non mai e l'aria è a dir poco gelida. Ci colpisce subito La grande ruota panoramica in piazza, molto bella, anche se io preferisco quella di Londra. Ma soprattutto rimaniamo colpiti dalla maestosità dell'arco di trionfo che celebra le vittorie di Napoleone. Davvero immenso, almeno il triplo rispetto all'arco di Wellington a Londra. Decidiamo in quel momento che entro i cinque giorni lo visiteremo.Poi ci rechiamo alla famosissima Tour Eiffel. Prima impressione: Ma è Altissima! Io sì, mi immaginavo raggiungesse altezze impressionanti ma mai così eccezionali! Già il primo piano della torre è ad una altezza superiore a tutti i palazzi che si possono trovare in Parigi. Tuttavia, a causa del mio soffrire di vertigini, decido che non ci salirò mai! E' strano, in aereo non soffro per nulla, invece anche solo al terzo piano di un edificio ho una paura impressionante. Decidiamo poi di vedere almeno un museo in giornata. Ci dirigiamo sul Museo D'Orsay, che contiente alcuni dei più famosi dipinti d'arte moderna. C'è troppa coda all'ingresso, torneremo nel pomeriggio. E' necessario però munirsi di due ""pass"" , scopriremo poi, vitali. Un primo è ""Paris Visite"" il quale permette di utilizzare tutti i mezzi di trasporto. Ne esistono vari tipi, in base alle fasce in cui è divisa la città e in base ai giorni di validità. Siccome abbiamo intenzione anche di visitare Versailles, prendiamo quello più costoso (circa 50 euro), che ci permette di andare in tutte le zone della città (e periferia, compresi aeroporti) per cinque giorni. La seconda carta, fondamentale, è la ""Paris Museum Pass"". La quale permette di visitare tutti i musei della città senza pagare (facendoti risparmiare un sacco, se decidi di vedere almeno tre musei) ma soprattutto, saltare la coda. Sembra una cosa da poco conto ma non lo è. Un esempio: al Louvre abbiamo saltato circa quattro ore di coda, entrando da un accesso prioritario, facendone solo quindici minuti! Magnifico! Il costo di questa si aggira sulle 50 euro, per quattro giorni. Sembra molto, ma non lo è.Muniti di questa carta, il pomeriggio riusciamo agevolmente (facendo circa un ora di coda, ma era anche il 31 dicembre!) ad entrare nel Museo D'Orsay. Ci restiamo fino a sera. Si tratta di un museo molto bello con opere di rara fattura, famose. Ci sono quadri di Magritte, Monet, Manet e in quel periodo, un'ala dedicata a Picasso. Molto bello.Dopo aver salutato Veltroni sulle scale, e dopo avermi fatto gli auguri di buon anno, torniamo in albergo per darci una sistemata prima di uscire per la notte dell'ultimo dell'anno.La notte dell'ultimo dell'anno, decidiamo di passarla ai piedi della Tour Eiffel. Ci sembrava il posto migliore nonché il più caratteristico.Come dice il condittore di un programma su Discovery, Antony Bourdain (che mi piace un cifro), il cibo migliore lo si trova per strada, nelle bancarelle, nei mercatini. Seguendo questo spassionato consiglio, prendiamo dei panini super-unti, ma molto gustosi, proprio ai piedi della torre, lungo la Senna. Panino ottimo, ma immenso! Passeggiamo lungo gli Champs de Mars, e per mezzanotte facciamo in modo da posizionarci quasi sul lungo Senna, in modo da vedere la torre di fronte. La torre è illuminata d'azzurro, con le stelle europee luminose, gialle, posizionate sulla facciata.Tantissima gente, un freddo indefinibile, una stanchezza totale, ma un clima grandioso che ci esalta. Pochi secondi prima della mezzanotte, le stelle iniziano a spegnersi, una dopo l'altra finché l'ultima, spegnendosi, decreta la mezzanotte. A questo punto le luci della torre si spengono in un istante, per poi esplodere letteralmente con un luccichìo bianco, tipo albero di Natale, per poi mutarsi in giallo oro, dopo alcuni minuti. Grandioso, uno spettacolo eccezionale! Indimenticabile!Ahimé la serata non finisce qui, nel senso che dopo poco, decidiamo di tornare all'albergo. La metro chiude alla 1.30 e dobbiamo sbrigarci. Scegliamo la fermata in teoria meno incasinata: Iéna. Ma ci troviamo di fronte ugualmente una ressa indecente che ci schiaccia fin dentro nel tunnel della metro. Fa caldo e la gente spinge, troppo. Cerchiamo di resistere ma alla fine la Sté sta male e dobbiamo farci aiutare dalla Guardia Civile per uscire dalla metro.Oramai tutti i mezzi di trasporto sono fermi fino all'alba. Immaginavo che sarebbe stato così, anche a Roma lo scorso anno, la stessa cosa: i mezzi pubblici la notte di capodanno non vanno, incredibile ma vero. Ultima speranza per tornare a casa: il taxi. Mezz'ora di attesa per il primo, almeno trenta persone ci precedono, la gente scalcia, s'arrabbia, spinge, urla. Non è cosa. Il primo taxi lo prenderemmo alle sei di mattina. Dopo cinque minuti di riflessione, scegliamo l'unica cosa possibile, cioè tornare a piedi. Cinque chilometri ci separano dall'albergo, da fare in piena notte e con un freddo inaudito! Partiamo, direzione Lafayette. La strada è lunghissima, la giornata è stata veramente molto impegnativa, la notte prima abbiamo dormito poco e il giorno prima io ho lavorato. Ero stanco morto. Verso le 3.30 arriviamo all'albergo e ci addormentiamo in tronco. Prima giornata finita. Intensissima, piena, magnifica.Dopo la sconvolgente prima giornata, il secondo giorno dormiamo un po' di più. Ci alziamo verso le 11, direzione Montmartre. Il luogo, presumo il più alto di Parigi, dista poche centinaia di metri dal nostro albergo, tuttavia ci andiamo in metropolitana. Scendiamo e ci facciamo l'immensa scalinata che porta alla basilica del sacro cuore. Da qui, è possibile ammirare il panorama. Peccato ci sia un poco di nebbia, altrimenti avremmo potuto vedere senza dubbio la torre, il Louvre e il resto della città, peccato. Entriamo nella basilica e la ammiriamo nella sua piena magnificenza. Grandiosa, molto ben curata nei particolari. Scattiamo parecchie foto e poi scendiamo dalla scalinata principale che sfocia direttamente in quella che sarebbe la ""Rue des Artists"". A dire la verità non ci troviamo nulla di esaltante; si tratta di una strada molto caratteristica che ricorda le vie di una volta ma non v'è traccia di artisti da strada, quello che mi aspettavo. Probabilemente non era periodo, forse gennaio è troppo freddo. Facciamo un giro nel quartiere e subito notiamo la sua particolarità: le luci rosse! Infatti in questa via (non ricordo il nome) è pieno di sexy shop, uno dopo l'altro, con una densità direi di tre ogni 50 metri! incredibile. Atmosfera giovanile e divertente, che ci piace. Più in là troviamo la famosissima discoteca ""Le Pigalle"" (boh, io non l'ho mai sentita, forse perché non mi piace per nulla quella musica, ma la Sté la conosceva). Alcuni metri più avanti invece incontriamo uno dei simboli di Parigi, un monumento alla Belle Epoque.. il Moulin Rouge! Molto molto bello da vedere (all'esterno). Ci informiamo sui prezzi, e lasciamo perdere, proibitivi! La serata che costava meno era intorno ai 100 euro, cena e spettacolino. Forse ne valeva la pena, ma non avevo soldi, quindi rimando al futuro. Il pomeriggio facciamo un giretto nella zona della Tour Eiffel, poi ci dirigiamo con la RER sull'Ile de la cité, ovvero l'isola sulla Senna, dove si trova la arcinota cattedrale di Notre Dame. La visitiamo all'interno e rimaniamo colpiti non tanto dagli affreschi o dalle statue quanto dalla strepitosa altezza della cattedrale. Tentiamo quindi di salire sulle torri ma per sfortuna, essendo Gennaio, le scale (esterne) sono ghiacciate e c'è pericolo di scivolare, quindi non ci fanno salire! Passeggiamo un po' e torniamo all'albergo. La sera, usciamo per prendere una birra e vediamo il centro di sera, ma non stiamo molto, vogliamo andare a dormire abbastanza presto per svegliarci altrettanto, domani si va al Louvre! Il venerdì mattina capiamo che patiremo il freddo tutto il giorno, infatti nevica. Non molto, ma abbastanza da constringerci a coprirci il più possibile e a prendere l'ombrello. Il museo apre alle 9. Noi decidiamo di essere lì almeno alle 8, quindi partiamo alle 7.30. Arriviamo davanti al museo e, senza ricordarci di avere l'accesso prioritario, ci mettiamo in coda (consiglio: se volete visitare il Louvre in un giorno di festa, siate in coda almeno, minimo minimo, un'ora prima dell'apertura). Verso le nove meno un quarto capiamo che l'ingresso per i possessori di Paris Museum Pass è il passaggio Richelieu, sotto l'edificio di sinistra, e non l'ingresso della piramide.Quindici minuti di coda ed entriamo. Ah, il Louvre, ho sempre sognato di entrarci e visitarlo! Ed ero lì, con poca gente entrata, tanto tempo da dedicare. Corriamo letteralmente al primo piano, nell'ala dedicata ai dipinti italiani, per ammirare la Gioconda di Leonardo. Certe persone, solitamente, vedendola rimango male perché, dicono, sia aspettano un quadro più grande e bello. Le mie considerazioni personali invece sono opposte. Mi aspettavo un piccolo quadro, invece è mediamente grande e poi è magnifico, perfetto, importante. Mi piace molto. E' posizionato in centro alla sala, circondato da magnifici enormi quadri di autori italiani. Tutta l'ala italiana è straordinaria: qualunque dipinto che siete abituati a vedere sui libri, a studiare a scuola, si trova qui! Facciamo mille foto. Visitiamo quasi tutto il museo. Infatti è così tanto grande che per vederlo tutto, senza neanche molta attenzione, servirebbe una giornata intera. Scartiamo alcune sezioni dalla visita e ci dedichiamo ad altre.Maglifici dipinti, sculture, statue, appartamenti. C'è tutto. A me piace moltissimo! Ad esempio ritrovo ""Amore e Psiche"" di Canova e la ""Venere di Milo"" (solo per citarne due). Non mi basterebbero sei pagine per descrivere tutto quello che abbiamo visto in quel museo! Mi fermo qui, ma consiglio a tutti di andarci, almeno una volta nella vita. E' uno di quei posti irrinunciabili.Nel tardo pomeriggio ci rechiamo agli Champs Elysées per una merenda e poi saliamo dentro l'arco di trionfo. Dall'alto si gode di una magnifica vista, la torre, il boulevard, la place de la concorde. Wow che posto! La sera ceniamo in centro. Mi lascio attirare dalla presenza si Escargot (lumache) in un ristorante e ci entriamo. Dopo le escargot, buone ma lontane anni luce da quelle che si fanno ad Avignone, prendiamo la zuppa di pesce. Uno si aspetta almeno un caciucco, qualcosa di simile. Invece ci portano una brodaglia priva di pesce e col retrogusto amarognolo di taluni crostacei. 'na schifezza. Alla fine di veramente buono (escluse appunto le escargot) non abbiamo trovato niente, e sì che abbiamo speso un capitale per mangiare lì, non era un ristorante scarso. Mille volte il cibo italiano. (Tra l'altro, mi hanno pure sporcato il piumino, bianco, con una salsa giallastra. bah!) Il centro è pieno di gente, ma non c'è una calca eccessiva, forse per via del gran freddo (circa -6°C). Ah, che bella la Senna di sera..L'indomani, sabato, abbiamo in programma una gita a Versailles.Che voglia di visitare la residenza degli ultimi re di Francia! Sapevamo di sicuro che sarebbe stata un'esperienza favolosa. Dunque prendiamo il treno RER e ci dirigiamo a Versailles che resta un po' fuori dalla città. Qui da subito abbiamo la percezione che si tratta di una reggia immensa, solo a vedere il palazzo si resta impressionati. Entriamo e visitiamo tutte le stanze in cui abitavano il re Sole, Luigi XVI, Maria Antonietta. Molto bello e curato. Unica nota stonata, l'esposizione nelle sale settecentesche di uno (mi permetto di dirlo) sfigato che fa ""arte contemporanea"". C'erano palloncini e oggetti di plastica che, a dire la verità io non capisco e non mi permetto di giudicarla, ma assolutamente quello non era il luogo!Poi ci dirigiamo nell'immenso parco alle spalle del palazzo. Anche questo immenso, gigantesco, nel quale assolutamente ci si può perdere. Peccato fosse Gennaio, e le fontane fossero ghiacciate, se no sarebbe stato ancora un più bello spettacolo. Ora non sto a raccontare tutti i dettagli di quella visita, ma assolutamente ne è valsa la pena.L'ultimo giorno della nostra visita nella capitale francese lo dedichiamo a passeggiare per le vie del centro, che non abbiamo scoperto ancora bene. Siccome dobbiamo prendere l'aereo che ci riporta a casa il pomeriggio, abbiamo solo la mattina per visitare le viette caratteristiche di Parigi e la possibilità di pranzare fuori. Molto casualmente scegliamo di dirigerci nel quartiere vicino a Notre Dame, (fermata metro Chatelet). Un quartiere, scopriamo, magnifico, molto caratteristico, pieno di negozietti, ristorantini e un sacco di attività tipiche parigine. Potrei addirittura arrivare a definirlo il quartiere più bello è caratteristico della città. Già che siamo da quelle parti, facciamo un salto al museo di arte contemporanea. Molto bello il palazzo che lo ospita, per salire il quale bisogna fare rampe di scale esterne, coperte, tutte a vetrate. Per me che soffro di vertigini non è il massimo, ma si può fare. Qui vi erano dipinti di Pollock e di altri pittori molto famosi, contemporanei, ma che io non conosco molto bene. Più che altro era molto interessata la Sté.Concludiamo la nostra giornata bevendo un tè al ""Buon Pastore"". Un locale molto tipico di una Parigi quasi oramai scomparsa.Direi che è stato uno dei capodanni più belli della mia vita, e a chiunque legge questo post, consiglio molto caldamente di visitare questa splendida città. Ne avrete solo da guadagnare!A presto.."
40,"“Une belle ville, assurément”","On peut dire ce qu'on veut mais Paris reste une ville féerique. Il n'y a qu'à voir les yeux des touristes qui se mettent à briller à la simple évocation de cette ville.Paris reste en effet un coin de rêve, très romantique et lumineux (tour Eiffel qui scintille de mille feux la nuit!...).Pas étonnant donc que cette ville fasse partie des plus visitées au monde!"
50,“Muß man gesehen haben”,"Paris ist eine Stadt, die man mindestens einmal (besser mehrmals) im Leben gesehen haben muß.Das Erste, mit dem man sich auseinandersetzen sollte, ist das Metronetz, denn damit, kann man alles gut und schnell erreichen (keine Angst,es ist sehr einfach zu verstehen).Falls man mit dem eigenen Auto anreist, sollte man darauf achten, daß Abstellmöglichkeiten am Hotel vorhanden sind (meist kostenpflichtig). Das wars dann auch mit dem Auto, -An- und Abreise.Mit dem eigenen Auto die Stadt zu erkunden sollte man besser nicht versuchen. Neben der Metro, muß man Paris mit den eigenen Füßen erkunden (WICHTIG: Gute,bequeme Schuhe).Der Fußweg vom Louvre über die Champ Elysee zum Triumpfbogen ist unvergesslich, -besonders in der Vorweihnachtszeit ein traumhaftes Lichtermeer.Die Sehenswürdigkeiten in Paris sind für mehr als eine Woche ausreichend, deshalb sollte man sich an Hand eines Reiseführers vorher einen Plan machen. Was sein muß, ist der Eifelturm bei Dunkelheit, -mein Tip: mit der Metro zur Station Travestere fahren, von dort hat man den besten Blick und dann zum Eifelturm hinuntergehen. Unterwegs daran denken, ein schneller Kaffee oder Espresso ist im Stehen am Thresen günsiger als wenn man sich hinsetzt und wenn man Wert auf Frühstück legt, sollte man ein Hotel mit internationalem Frühstück wählen, denn sonst kann es nur einen Kaffee mit Crossant geben."
30,“Mi opinión de Paris”,"La ciudad demuestra ser ya vieja, El metro lo considero sucio y para entenderlo me costó un rato sentado, considero complicado de etenderlo (mas no difícil).Aunque Paris es como un sueño para todo latinoamericano, me llevé una decepción en los siguientes lugares:* Jardines de Luxemburgo, esperaba un jardin que ""vomitara"" flores, pero no lo fue. Es un lugar muy bonito, sin embargo esperaba más.* Jardin de TulleríasDefinitivamente es una ciudad cara para lo que realmente ofrece. No discuto que es una ciudad muy bonita, pero creo que una Ciudad de México, Nueva York, San José incluso Sao Paulo ofrecen muchísimo más en cuanto a gastronomía, gente, hoteles, atractivos, cultura, y no son tan caras.La gente con el turista, al menos con la que yo traté (personal del hotel, un McDonalds y una persona que me vio con cara de ""por dónde"" en el metro). El personal del metro si me tocó fuera grosera conmigo (módulos de informacion), no apoyandome en mi ignoracia de no ´saber moverme en el metro que por su actitud de voz preferí perderme que verle la cara al oficial nuevamente.Estuve los días17 y 18 de Abril de 2009"
50,“très bon hôtel”,"Très bon rapport qualité prix. Déco sympa , confortable, personnel charmant. Une bonne adresse pour un WE à Paris."
50,"“Un petit ""coin"" de Paris”","Pour le week-end de Pâques, nous avons choisi une escapade à Paris.La météo annoncée n'étais guère enchanteresse, mais le ciel est resté clément.Arrivés à Paris, par Tgv, vers 18h30, le samedi, nous avons rejoint notre hotel, situé à 2 pas de l'Arc de Triomphe, dans une avenue bordée d'arbres , extrêmement sympathique et hyper tranquille, situé Avenue Carnot,à 2 pas du métro.Restaurant, théatre et exposition Kandisky, ont agréablement complété ce week-end bien agréable.Installé au 6ème étage de l'hotel, nous avions une très belle vue dominante sur le quartier...Pour les amoureux, et les amoureux de Paris..."
50,“bon choix pour un séjour à paris”,"très bon hôtel - chambre, service, accueil;très bon petit déjeuner.a quelques minutes du métro ou des champs elysées.parking, minibar et spa à prix prohibitifs."
40,“¿me siento seguro?”,"Hemos estado en Paris del 5 al 9 de Abril,la visita ha estado un poco empañada por las imnumerables colas en todos los lugares debido a las medidas de ""seguridad"" la mayor parte de ellas un a mera comedia para justificar el gasto,esto ha hecho que subir a la torre eiffel,entrar a la sante chapelle,al louvre y a cualquier otro lugar interesante se convirtiera en una espera agobiante,por otro lado la presencia de numerosos policias e incluso el ejercito patrullando armado no ha contribuido a que nos sintieramos seguros sino todo lo contrario,ah y estoy harto de tener que descalzarme en los aero puertos"
40,“美術館めぐり”,日本ではほとんどしない美術館めぐりをしました。ルーブルはもちろん、オルセーなど。ただ、ルーブルは、映画人気のせいで、とにかく、観光客が沢山いて、有名な絵の前は、人だかりでした。オルセーは、ルーブルよりも人は少なくまた、有名な絵画も沢山ゆっくりと見られるのでお勧めです。ぜひ、何時間もかけて鑑賞してみてください。
50,“結構、安全です！”,場所：パリ（フランス）日付：２００８年５月はじめてのパリでした。事前に聞いていたのは、治安がよくないしスリも多いとか・・・実際は、思ったより平気でした。主な交通手段も、安全を考えタクシーにしようと思いましたが、地下鉄は、暗いですが大丈夫でした。ただし、夜おそくは絶対のらないほうがいいと思います。観光を美術館を中心にまわりたい方におすすめなのが　「ミュージアムパス」　です。いろいろな所が見れるし、出入りも自由だし便利です。オルセー美術館よかったです♪♪　絵画が好きな方いいと思います。
40,“La ville de tous les rêves”,Pour des vacances culturels ou simplement pour prendre du bon temps ; c'est la destination idéale pour tous!!
50,“レストラン”,ポルトマイヨーにある「ル・ルレ・ド・ブニーズ」はとても楽しいステーキ専門店です。パリでステーキ？？？とお思いでしょうが、とにかく楽しい。スタッフは笑顔をたやさないし、フレンドリー。メニューは１コースのみというのも語学力に自信のない人にはありがたいです。どれほどワクワク楽しいレストランかというのは毎日オープン前から出来る長い行列に加わった時からはじまるはずです。パリ在住の地元の人はもちろん、イタリア人、イギリス人、アメリカ人などなど、世界各国の言葉が飛び交っています。２４ユーロという値段でこれだけ楽しく食事が出来るレストランはお値打ちです。
30,“illusione parigi”,"Erano tanti anni che volevo visitarla e quando è arrivato il momento sono rimasta delusa!!!L'ho trovata immensa con i suoi viali e gli enormi palazzi,caotica, con poche aree pedonali.Non mi è sembrata ne romantica ne incantata, bella si, ma non esageratamente."
50,“異国情緒”,パリの街並みは、ただ歩くだけでも楽しい。ゴシック様式の建物が立ち並び、異空間に迷いこんだような錯覚におちいる。日常生活にちょっと疲れ、気分転換したい人には「ただ町を歩くだけのパリ旅行」がお勧めです。
50,“パリで気に入ったところ”,パリといえば、古い街並みや建物、おいしいお料理が真っ先に浮かびます。それらは当然堪能できるのですが、何よりも今回驚いたのが、パリの人がみな、想像していたよりも（人から聞いていたよりも）ずっと親切で、アジア人だからと言って失礼な扱いを受けることも無く、始終快適に過ごせたことです。それから、挨拶の文化というのがすばらしいと思います。スーパーのレジでも、一言挨拶をするだけで、気持ちよく買い物ができるし、少々のレジ内の遅さも全くイライラしません。訪れたのは季節柄、観光オフシーズンですが、それでもたくさんの各国からの観光客をみかけました。しかし、治安が聞いていたよりずっとよく、一度もスリにあうこともなく、ぼったくられることもなく、安全にすごせました。（もっと観光客の多いオンシーズンだとまた違うのかもしれませんが・・・）とにかく、旅行を終えて唯一嫌な思い出といえば、飛ぶかもめに糞をおとされたことくらいで、とても楽しい旅行となりました！
50,“モンマルトルの丘で似顔絵”,モンマルトルの丘で、念願の似顔絵を描いてもらいました。大勢の絵描きさんがいますが、ホントいろいろです。私は、じっくり描いているを見て回り、それから絵描きさんを決めました。漫画チックに描く人から、東洋人を描いても西洋風になる人まで腕前は様々。じっくり見て、やっと決めました。しかし、そこから待つこと１時間半。やっと自分の番が来ました。どんな風に描いてくれるか、仕上がりまで見れないので、とてもわくわく。でも、いろいろな人が私と絵を比べて反応してくれるです。かなりの人がニコニコしていたり、グーサインをしてくれたり。これは期待出来そう。そして、完成。いや～、写真と思えるほどのできですごい満足でした。
20,“La imaginaba distinta”,"Sin querer menospreciar al resto de ciudades del mundo, Paris es esplendorosa. Está llena de cultura y vida. Pero al visitarla por primera vez, en Enero de 2009, la encontré sucia, con trenes y vagones de metro llenos de papeles, basura y con mal olor (olor a baño y cañería). En las calles es usual encontrar heces de perros.No es una ciudad preocupada por el ambiente y la ecología.Muchas calzadas y áreas públicas, como el área circunvencina a Notre Dame y al Louvre, son espacios cubiertos por tierra y piedras, no por calzadas bien estructuradas.La mayoría de los franceses con los que tuve oportunidad de encontrarme son muy fríos, siendo su trato muy tosco hacia el turista. La sociedad la noté muy dividida, entre los franceses y las diferentes colonias de inmigrantes. No ví a Paris como una ciudad del mundo, sino como una ciudad de Francia.Por último, esta ciudad es sumamente cara. El pago de los servicios no corresponde a su calidad."
50,“見どころたくさん憧れのパリ”,ジュネーブーからフランス新幹線TGVに乗りパリに到着。早速観光地巡りに出発です。中世ゴシックの名建築ノートルダム寺院は荘厳で、寺院内のバラ窓をはじめとするステンドグラスはやわらかな光に照らされて息をのむほどにきれいでした。エッフェル塔の向こう側には緑美しいトラカデロ広場とシャイヨー宮。ルーヴル美術館では、ミロのヴィーナスの後ろ姿をじっくりと眺めてしまいました。夜はセーヌ川クルーズ。ライトアップされ闇に浮かび上がるエッフェル塔やオルセー美術館はとても幻想的でした。翌日はヴェルサイユ宮殿へ。鏡の間・王妃の寝室・礼拝堂・たくさんの肖像画…どこもここも煌びやかでゴージャス！ただただため息でした。予習にベルばらを読んでいくことをおススメします。夕食はムーランルージュ。ショーの合間にマジック・コント・歌…日本の歌も飛び出して（たしかテレサ・テンだったかと）素晴らしいステージを満喫した夜でした。ただ冷房が効きすぎていてとても寒かったので、真夏でもストールを持っていくといいかも。大きな老舗デパートのギャラリー・ラファイエットでは、地下の書籍コーナーで可愛い絵葉書をお土産用に買いました。結構好評だったのでお試しを。まだまだ行きたいところがいっぱいのパリ。近いうちにまた行きたいと思っています。
50,“おすすめスポット　スーパーマーケット”,フランスのスーパーではまったのが、モノプリなどのスーパー。ジャムの１つにしても、かわいー。フランスといえば、高級なチョコレートやスイーツも魅力ですが、スーパーにこそフランス＝酪農大国が納得。チーズやバター、ヨーグルトなどの豊富なこと（しかも激安）。普通のお菓子もバターや卵が新鮮なのか、とにかくおいしいのです。おみあげや夕飯などにも活用できます。
50,“永远的浪漫之都”,法兰西共和国的首都----巴黎，是世界著名的最繁华的大都市之一，素有“世界花都”之称。它不仅是法国，也是西欧的一个政治、经济和文化中心。巴黎香水驰誉全球，有“梦幻工业”之称，被法人国视为国宝。巴黎的金融、证券、保险业十分繁荣。巴黎，一直是我无限向往的地方。雄伟的埃菲尔铁塔、美仑美奂的卢浮宫、风光漪旎的塞纳河、繁华的香榭丽舍大街……巴黎的优美和气度、巴黎的绚丽和多彩，深深吸引着来自世界各地的游人。包括我！此行欧洲，最主要的目的地就是巴黎！当大巴车载着我们开始在这个城市的大街上行驶时，望着车窗外充满艺术气息又整齐划一城市建筑，我仿佛嗅到了巴黎城弥散在空气中的芳香……于是，所有的细胞都欢腾跳跃起来！法兰西，我来了！巴黎，我来了！法国文化、法国香水、法国时装、法国葡萄酒、法国人的浪漫、“世界上最优美的语言”——法语；巴尔扎克、雨果、大仲马、莫奈、罗丹、毕加索、居里夫人……真可谓星河灿烂，万千风情，令人心驰神往。
50,“美術館巡り”,第一日曜日の美術館無料サービスを利用して、教会や美術館を好きなだけ巡ることができましたパリのSOLDで買い物も楽しめて満喫できました。訪れる時期選びは重要です。
40,“町自体が美術館”,フランスは美術館があり結構楽しめました。ルーブル美術館も行きましたが予習が足りませんでした。昔世界史を学んでいたわずかな知識を頼りに見ていましたがモット勉強していけばよかったと後悔しています町並みも綺麗でちょっとした喫茶店に入ってケーキセットを食べましたが男の俺にとっては結構甘すぎました、
30,“エッフェル塔”,パリと言えばエッフェル塔！ということでエッフェル塔を観に行くことにした。ケーブルカーで上まで昇って、降りてきた。特にこれといったものはないけど、パリに来た感じはする。それにしてもパリは寒すぎる。あたたかくしてきたほうが良い。食べものはイタリアに比べてあまりパッとしない印象かな。それでも量はあるので、がっつり食べたい人には良いかも知れない。
40,“una citta' fantastica!”,trovo che parigi sia una citta' favolosa ci voglio tornare l'unica cosa che non mi e' piaciuta e che e' sprovvista di cestini dell'immondizia la citta' e' molto sporca anche se la puliscono continuamente pero' credo che sia il caso di prevenire lo scarto dei rifiuti per strada mettendo a disposizione piu' raccogitori per l'immondizia visto che e visitata da milioni di turisti ogni giorno! per esempio londra l'ho trovata molto piu' pulita!!!!!!!!NON E' UN PECCATO SECONDO VOI? inoltre ci terrei a rimarcare imparate l'italiano cari parigini perche' l'italia vi porta bei soldoni!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
50,“教会で毎晩コンサートざんまい”,パリへ旅行するなんて、「いかにも」って思っていて、これまで選択肢から外していたのですが、ふらっと行ってみました。そしたら、これまでの思いこみが１８０度変わりました。パリは最高でした。◎パリは安全－朝型人間なので日の出前からパリ市内をほっつき歩いたりしましたが、まったくノープロブレム！観光客が安心して町歩きを楽しめる街、それがパリでした。◎パリは安い－交通手段はメトロを使い、フリーパスを購入したのですが、メトロは市内をくまなくカバーしていてどこへでも行けました。空港から市内へも直行バスが出ていて安く短時間で到着することが出来ます。美術館もミュージアム・パスを購入すれば期間中入り放題、ルーブルへは毎日行きました。ホテルも探せばリーズナブルなところがたくさんあって低予算でも十分楽しめます！（もちろん宿泊も食事もお金をかけようと思えばいくらでも豪華さを追求することも出来ます。）◎パリは静かに楽しむことも出来る－クリスマスから新年にかけて旅行したのですが、マルモッタン等ちょっと離れたところにある美術館や、サクレ・クール等の超有名スポットでもちょっと早い時間だと人影はまばら、また、あちこちの教会で毎晩コンサートが開催されるのでクラシックファンにはたまりません。オペラ座もよかったですがこうした教会コンサートの方が落ち着いて楽しめました。しかも安いですよ！そのほかにも、英語が分からないふりをする人間が多いと聞いていましたが、そんなことも全くなく、言葉でいやな思いをすることも皆無でした。また行きたくなる街パリ！
40,“Tre giorni a Parigi”,"Se non siete appassionati di musei,anche se il Louvre almeno è d'obbligo,3 gg sono sufficienti per avere un'idea di questa bellissima città.Abbiamo soggiornato all'Etap Hotel zona la Villette e x chi conosce la categoria di alberghi,ci si trova bene (colazione compresa) senza costi eccessivi (57 euro una camera doppia con colazione).E' servito da 2 metropolitane x cui ci si sposta facilmente.Anche dall'aeroporto con la RER si arriva alla metro e quindi in albergo.Da visitare :sicuramente il Sacro cuore e Montmatre,segue il grattacielo di Montparnasse che vi elimina le file stratosferiche per salire sulla torre ed in 37 secondi al 59° piano vi offre un panorama mozzafiato con di fronte anche la tour.Il Louvre è spettacolare ,come l'hotel de ville (comune) ,l'arco di trionfo e champe elysèe ,Notre Dame,l'ile de la citè.Dalla tuor Eiffel si passa al Trocadero ,dal quale si ha una visione migliore della tour ,anche x fotografarla.Ed infine i grandi magazzini La Fayette sulla via dell'Operà,il quartiere latino, dove si mangia bene ed a prezzi abbordabili.Se volete mangiare dell'ottimo coquillage vi indicherei ,vicino alla bastiglia il ""bar a huites"",ristorante molto elegante ,ma ne val la pena.Se siete romantici,per finire ,un bel giro di sera sul bateau.Buon viaggioProvare x credere!!!

50,“花の都、パリ”,パリには3回ほど、一人で行ったり友人と行ったりしたが、本当に飽きない場所だ。歴史や文化を街全体が物語っているような重厚感は圧巻ですね。
10,“パリの地下鉄”,自由行動で使った地下鉄には色んなスリに出会った。中学生ぐらいから中年まで活字からは感じとれないくらいひどいものでであった。被害がなかったのが、幸いであった。駅構内はストリートミュージシャンや浮浪者があふれていた。列車のつくりは古く半自動ドアは危険を感じ、事故がないのが不思議なくらいであった。列車も落書きだらけで、市民レベルの低さに驚いた。
40,“Cuidado con algunos personajes parisinos”,"No pretendo criticar a los parisinos, en realidad y en su gran mayoría nos hemos encontrado con buena gente que nos ha ayudado mucho, a pesar que no entendíamos el idioma han puesto empeño en entendernos y extendernos una mano. Pero... en tres oportunidades nos ha ocurrido lo siguiente: viene de frente una persona y hace que encuentra un anillo de oro (DORADO) frente a vos, pretendiendo que se le pague algunos euros y él o ella te dan el anillo. CUIDADO, sólo tienes que seguir sin darle importancia."
40,“パリはサイコー★★”,パリに行ってきましたー！！成田空港からＡＮＡの直行便でパリに入りました。パリの街は交通便がよく、街中はメトロでどこにでも行けます。ルーブル美術館の近くに宿をとり、４泊６日でパリの観光地を散策。ここは行かないと！という有名な観光名所には基本的にメトロを使えば行けたと思います。エッフェル塔、凱旋門、シャンゼリゼ通り、オペラ座、ルーブル美術館、オランジュリー美術館、オルセー美術館、マドレーヌ寺院、チュイルリー庭園、コンコルド広場、シテ島のノートルダム大聖堂・・・ここに書き出すだけでも、このくらいは簡単にメトロ＆徒歩で散策できました。東京と同じような感覚で、充実したメトロ線に驚きました。初めてのパリは個人旅行でしたが、下調べさえしていれば自由に散策でき満足のいく旅行になると思います。英語も満足に話せない私でも度胸で乗り切り、こわい思いや、不便さなどは感じることもなく満喫できました。少し足をのばし、モンサンミッシェルにも出かけました。モンパルナス駅からＴＧＶでレンヌまで行き、バスに乗り換え、モンサンミッシェル向かいました。５時間ほどで到着しました。バスツアーなどのオプショナルツアーに参加すると簡単に行くこともできますが、モンサンミッシェルでの散策時間も少なくバスで長時間の道のり・・・早朝から２２時ごろにパリに戻るようなものしかありません。個人旅行でモンサンミッシェルに観光に出かける方には、ＴＧＶとバスで行かれることをお勧めします♪歩いて一番上の修道院までたどり着いたときには足が少しだるくなっていましたが、そこから見える景色は最高です！！歩きながら見るお土産店やレストラン、みんなかわいい店構えでとても印象的でした。有名なオムレツは・・・食べてみましたが、期待しすぎていたせいか・・・味は普通で残念でした(笑)あっ、パリの街中ではお菓子やパンがおいしかったですよ。食の街パリ、歴史ある街パリ、おしゃれな街パリをぜひ楽しんでみてください☆★
40,“Pulitissimo e rinnovato”,"Ho soggiornato un week-end all'Hotel Apollon (Novembre 2008) e l'esperienza è stata piacevole.Punti positivi dell'Hotel:1. pulizia immacolata della camera, pavimenti, moquette, bagno, asciugamani (cambiati quotidianamente)2. stato dell'arredamento, perfetto, appena rinnovato con gusto e senso estetico3. stato del bagno, anche questo nuovissimo e appena ristrutturato con materiali di qualità e gusto4. posizione comodissima al metro (a 50 metri)5. prezzo decisamente conveniente per Parigi (80,00 euro circa per una camera una doppia con bagno)6. Silenziosità della camera che affacciava su una strada molto poco trafficata (e comunque le finestre sono nuove e con doppi vetri)7. Posteggio a tariffa convenzionata (se prenotato assieme alla camera) pratico e a 20 metri dell'hotelQualche (piccola) nota meno positiva, relativa all'ampiezza delle camere: l'ambiente era proprio piccino, anche se completo di tutto, e il letto era a 2 piazze ma piccolo. Una donna non credo trovi problemi ma un uomo grande e grosso forse si potrebbe sentire meno a suo agio. Idem per il bagno, piccino, anche se molto funzionale e completo di phon, vasca con doccia e lavabo (il bidet, come in quasi tutti i paesi eccetto l'Italia...è assente).Ma visto che in camera si sta così poco tempo...io se devo scegliere tra ampiezza e pulizia della camera e della piacevolezza dell'arredo...vado sicuramente per la pulizia e il décor!Non abbiamo provato la colazione, quindi su questo non posso dire nulla.Altra minima nota devo farla sui lavori di ristrutturazione che stanno rinnovando le camere (con un bel risultato, devo dire). Al momento della prenotazione forse vi conviene chiedere una camera su un piano senza lavori, per evitare noiosi rumori (che comunque non dovrebbero disturbare prima delle 10/10,30 del mattino).Godetevi Parigi e scegliete questo Hotel senza tentennamenti...se tornerò a Parigi sarò senz'altro pronta a prenotarlo di nuovo."
40,“お初のパリで試された度胸と根性！！”,今ではすっかり大好きなパリですが、初めて訪れた時を思い出すと、なんとも恐ろしく、ほんのり苦い体験でした・・・。まず、パリの玄関口であるシャルルドゴール空港に降り立った私は、市内へ向かうのにTaxiか電車、バスの交通手段で迷いました。そんな時、近くにいた同世代のフランス人カップルに、Hotelの住所から、どの手段で行ったらいいか尋ねたところ、彼らは電車を使い、下車する場所は違うが同じ方向ということで、一緒に乗ろうということになりました。独り旅で、しかも初のパリだったので、切符の買い方から、車内でのおしゃべりなど、旅の良い幸先を感じながら、電車にのんびり揺られていました。でも、彼らが下車した後、まさかHotelまでたどり着くのに乗車した時間以上もかかるなんて想像していませんでした・・・。今、思い出すだけでもホントよくやったなぁーという感じです。(笑)で、さっきのフランス人カップルに教えてもらった駅で下車したのはいいのですが、時間も夜の8時頃にしては閑散としたホームで、薄暗く、男性の吼える声が聞こえたりと、何となく不気味さを感じながら、とにかく改札は人も居ることを期待しつつ、ドでかいスーツケースを引きずり向かいました。・・・が、なんと、そこは無人駅(笑)さらに、電気が壊れていて薄暗く、ゴミや新聞がぐちゃぐちゃになってその辺に捨られていたり、通っていく人は浮浪者のような身なりで、これってヤバイ！と思いました。さすがにここは旅のうかれ気分とは違い、気を引き締め、危険モード全快のスイッチがOnになりました(笑)・・・そして今度は、地上に明かりを求め期待しつつも、地上へはエスカレーターはなく、長～い階段のみでした。その時、身なりの良いビジネスマン風の男性が横を通り、その人に手を貸してもらおうと、急ぎ足で呼び止めようとしました・・・が、男性はスタスタ行ってしまい、仕方なく自力で、スーツケースを持ち上げ階段を一歩ずつ上ると、そこは・・・真っ暗で簡素な通りで、車さえ通っていない！もちろんTaxiなんて通りやしない所でした。仕方なく、今、自分のいる現在地を把握しないと・・・と思い、地図を見ると、ホテルの最寄の駅ではなく、少し離れた場所に降り立っていることが判明！！ついさっきまで電車でおしゃべりしていたフランス人カップルとの和やかな情景とは一変、現実はお先真っ暗で、かなり焦っている自分がいる。かといって、親切に教えてくれた彼らのせいにも出来ない。「これは自分の度胸を試させられているんだっ！」と思い、とにかくこんな格好でその場にいてもマズイので、ホテルのある方向へひたすら重～いスーツケースを引きずりながら歩きました。どうやら、かなり歩いたせいか(成果？）、明るい通りが見えてきて、行きかう人も普通の人がちらほら・・・・ホッと一安心。そして、やっとの思いでホテルに到着！！でも、あの頃が若かったのか、認識不足なのか世間知らずなのか・・・ホテルは4星で期待していたものとは違い、今となっては歴史的に情緒ある建物で素敵だと感じるのが当然なのだが、当時は初ヨーロッパということもあり、日本の近代的なホテルに慣れていることもあって、想像していたのとはまるっきり異なり、ホント若過ぎました・・・(笑)エレベーターは二重ドアで、超スロー。その時はただただくたびれたホテルと思い、パリに来たばかりで弾けていた心は、行きの道中のどたんばもあってか、だんだんしおれていきそうでした。そして、お部屋に案内され、やっと落ち着きましたが、お腹もすいている・・・でも、外には出たくない気分でした。とりあえず、トイレを使おうと思ったら、便器らしきものが2つ。でも、片方はどうやってしようするのか？？でした。そう、それはビデ用。日本人の私には電自動のビデしかしらず、ヨーロッパ式のビデなんて知るはずもありませんでした。・・・なので私はその物体を、赤ちゃん専用のオマルか、バスタブと思い、独りで文化の違いに感心していました(笑)でも、静かな部屋で独りだったので、急に寂しくなり、ホテルまでの道程に心身ともに疲れていたので、母親に思わず泣き寝入りの国際電話をしてしまいました(笑)・・・若かった！今では、未熟だったなぁと思います(反省)で、母親の声に元気を取り戻し、お腹もすいたので、やっ‘パリ’これがパリ！って思う食べものを食べてみたいと思いホテルを出ました。でも、時間は22時過ぎ・・・辺りはどこも閉店。かといって遠くへ行く気力もないので、仕方なくホテルの近くにあるPABでその日は食事をしました。メニューはアメリカ？！って思うようなラインナップでしたが、もう期待と希望は明日に託し、その日は満たされないまま疲れた身体をベッドへ休ませることにしました。翌日からは、これがパリって思うような素敵なお店や景色に心も身体も弾み、無事ぶ何も危ないこともなく、ちょっとおマヌケな旅は今でもその後の旅の教訓へとつながりました。今から考えると、これら全てが一つ一つ旅の思い出として、、旅行先での度胸や根性も試させられて良かったと思います(笑)また、今では私の中でパリは特別な場所となり、毎回訪れると新しい発見もあり、本当に心をワクワクさせる楽しい魅惑の町です。パリで経験してきた数々の思い出は、本当に自分が居心地良く、快適に過ごせる頼もしい教材となり、それは訪れるたびに、私のパリ滞在を色濃く楽しませてくれます♪皆さんも苦い経験から学んだことを活かして、より自分の居心地の良いトラベルStyleを想い描いていってください！そして、最後に皆さんにとって旅を通じて沢山の素敵な出会いと感動、発見がありますようにっ☆☆☆
50,“パリ旅行”,パリに2年前に一人で行きました。それまで、3回行っていたのですが、何かと嫌な思いをする事が多いです。特に女性の店員は感じ悪く感じる事がありました。でも2年前に行ったときはなぜか愛想の良い応対をされました。なぜかと考えると、今回の旅行は服装を普段遊びに行く程度の服にしたからかもしれません。いつもはスニーカに鞄斜め掛けにしてました。今回はローファで、鞄は肩にかけました。（地下鉄などに乗るときは斜め掛けにしました！）それがよかったのかどうかわかりませんが、とても楽しい旅になりました。美術館が好きで、特にオルセー美術館が好きなので、パリミュージアムパスを買って、毎日見に行っています。今回はロダン美術館にも行きました。接吻など有名は彫刻がすぐそばで見る事ができました。ここは、庭園もきれいで、のんびりできます。パリは有名な美術品が目白押しなので、絵画好きの方は、ぜひ行ってください。日本で見るような混み具合はありません。絵画にガラスがないものが多いです。
40,“パリの街を自転車で走る　Velib”,最近パリでは自転車を乗り回す観光客をよく見かけるようになりました。これはVelibというパリ市の貸し自転車のシステムで、暗証番号の分かるクレジットカードを持っていれば、街中にあるスタンドからすぐに借りることができます。一日1ユーロで後は30分以内ずつにスタンドに返していれば無料。150ユーロの保証金がカードに一時チャージされますが、ちゃんと返していれば、引き落とされることはありません。本当に街中にスタンドがあるし、狭いパリの街では、地下鉄よりずっと便利。パリにいく時は、リュックか肩掛け鞄持参で、街を疾走しましょう。自転車をスタンドから外すときに少しコツがあるようで、タイヤを真っ直ぐにしないと抜けません。私も何度か失敗しましたが、外れなければ、その場で返したことになるので、また借りなおせば大丈夫。パリでは、道はかなり整備されていて、バスと自転車用レーンも多いのですが、基本的には自動車扱いなので、歩行者レーンを走ることの多い日本の自転車とは少し感覚が違います。車と同じく右を走り、たくさんある一方通行なども守らなくてはいけません。きちんと交通ルールを守って走りましょう。
40,“ルーブルのアクセサリー屋さん”,ルーブル美術館の地下街にある、ちいさいアクセサリー屋さん。リーズナブルで、若い人にぴったりのかわいいピアスとかいっぱい（18ユーロくらい）。日本にはないオーソドックスなものからいろいろ。動物の小さいストラップ(6ユーロくらいだったか）は私のお気に入りです。
40,“お土産をいろいろと買います。”,海外旅行って、お土産もバカにならないですよね。パリ旅行の際はモノプリって言うスーパーで購入します。今回、カプチーノ１０袋入りを数箱お土産として、または自宅使用で購入しました。帰国して、開封すると１０袋以外にもパウダーも付いていて、とてもオススメです。もちろん美味しかったです。また、このスーパーは平日24時まで営業しているので大変便利です。
50,“Balzac parisiense”,"Conocí París hace unos años yncreo que es la ciudad más bella del mundo.Balzac fué un privilegiado pues sus obras se refieren a la Ciudad Luz como marco histórico y a la sociedad que allí vivía con sus personajes clásicos como Le Pere GORIOT y sus hijas,Nucingen el millonario,los estudiantes,las prostitutas,los hampones,enfin retratos de seres humanos inolvidables.Quisiera volver a París para imaginar de nuevo a La Comedia Humana,compendio de la sociedad francesa y por extensión de la sociedad humana de viejos tiempos,que viene a ser la misma de ahora,guardadas las proporciones."
10,“parigi senza parigini”,"nel 18° arrondissenent (montmartre)non ci sono piu' parigini be nsi' negri e arabi ,insegne dei negozi esclusivamente in arabo, lingua parlata,arabo!coprifuoco dalle ore 20.00 consigliato dall'albergo(e pensare che il proprietario un nord africano!).dov'è finito il piu' romantico quartiere di parigi? è dunque questo il futuro che ci aspetta?"
50,“ただです！”,大晦日にパリのシャルル・ド・ゴール空港からパリ市内に行くのにRERのB線を使用しました。チケットを購入しようと自販機に向かうと張り紙が…。ストか事故かと暗い気持ちになっていたところ張り紙には「夕方から運賃なしのフリー」とあるではないですか！周りを見渡すとフランス人はゲートを勝手に開けて出入りしているので無銭乗車は怖いと思いながらも市内へ。そして次の日お正月にメトロに乗ろうとしたらまたまたただ！ルーブルなど開いていない所も多いですが元旦も開いているエッフェル塔までメトロで移動。気が付くと午後のある時間から地元の人達は切符を買ってました。とにかく知らなかったのでお得気分でした。
40,“la mia città preferita”,"Parigi... che dire di una città denominata ""La Ville Lumière""??E' una città da sogno... ad ogni angolo, in ogni viuzza trovi uno spunto per goderti un panorama spettacolare.Secondo me non bisogna visitare solo i soliti musei o le attrazioni tipo La Tour Eiffel o il Louvre che, per carità, meritano la loro fama.Oltre a visitare questi monumenti, bisogna vivere la città, conoscere la gente e le loro abitudini.Per questo mi sono trovata benissimo nel quartiere degli artisti.Qui ho trovato le persone più strampalate che abbia mai visto ma che si sono dimostrate anche molto semplici e disponibili.Insomma, se potete andate di corsa a Parigi, visitate i suoi monumenti, i musei, le attrazioni ma fate anche una sosta in un piccolo bistrot a chiaccherare un pò con le persone e vivete in prima persona la magia che sprigiona da questa città!"
40,“ultimo a parigi”,"Quest'anno ho deciso di passare l'ultimo dell'anno a Parigi.Ho fatto in totale 6 giorni al Citea tilsit, ottimo (vedi recensione).In questi giorni ho visitato un po tutto quello che si poteva vedere, Disneyland (vedi recensione), montmartre con la zona degli artisti e con visita alla chiesa (siamo arrivati con funicolare) ;pettacolo al moulin rouge dove ragazze stupende danzavano in maniera eccezionale e il pubblico brindava con champagne...Il louvre dove ho potuto vedere moltissime opere tra cui la gioconda (peccato che le opere migliori siano sempre italiane)!Museo delle armi e tomba di napoleone, il museo è molto interessante e parla delle varie guerre e di vari periodi, si possono trovare dalle armature a tutto quello che riguarda la seconda guerra mondiale.La tomba di napoleone invece è piuttosto maestosa, visitatela perchè ne vale la pena.Bello anche l'arco...da sopra potrete avere una vista su molti dei monumenti e su tutti gli Champs-Elysées che in questo periodo erano in festa e piene di illuminazioni.(dei colori della bandiera francese)Attenzione però perchè per salire ci sono moltissimi scalini.Visita alla cattedrale di notre dame, anche questa molto molto bella, l'interno piuttosto cupo ma con dei rosoni stupendi.L'esterno maestoso con tutte le statue e i gargouilles.Dalla cima la vista è stupenda e anche da qui si possono vedere moltissimi edifici vecchi e nuovi di parigi.Altra visita al palazzo reale trasformato poi in prigione dove si può vedere la ricostruzione (in parte originale)della cella di maria antonietta.Bella anche place della concorde con il suo obelisco egizio e i suoi mattoni (la pavimentazione viene dalla prigione della bastiglia).Bella la passeggiata sugli Champs-Elysées con moltissimi negozi e luci, ma se volete la vera moda bisogna andare a rou de la montaigne (scusate il mio francese) vicino agli Champs-Elysées all'altezza del grand palace, circa.Non poteva mancare una visita (se pure solo esterna) di Versailles, immensa e grandiosa con i suoi giardini (ricordate che è fuori mani ma raggiungibile con i mezzi)Visita della torre eiffel (dove era impensabile pensare di salire per via delle code)Tra gli altri monumenti da vedere c'è l'opera,i vari ponti, i palazzi che ora son musei ecc.Vi consiglio di effettuare un giro sui vari bus che fanno il giro di tutti i monumenti e vi dicono la storia.Interessante anche fare il giro sulla senna, i monumenti son sempre quelli ma navigando si ha una bellissima visuale.Putroppo questo periodo è super pieno cosi molto molto tempo lo si è passato in coda e non si è potuto vedere tutto tuttavia grazie al pass dei monumenti abbiamo potuto saltare alcune code.(tra cui il louvre)Utile avere anche il paris visite che vi permette di utilizzare RER,Metro e funicolare....a Parigi i mezzi pubblici sono molto molto efficienti e si può praticamente raggiungere ogni punto.Nel fare la scenta della carta ricordate che Versaille, disneyland. aeroporti sono nella zona 5.....Altra pecca l'ultimo dell'anno...gli Champs-Elysées erano strapieni ma non c'era un bagno e non si è fatto ne un conto alla rovescia ne un fuocherello per far capire che arrivava il nuovo anno...Per vedere foto o per qualsiasi info chiedete pure...CiaoAndrea"
50,“La hermosa Ciudad Luz”,"Una ciudad maravillosa. Algo antigua, pero es justamente eso lo que la hace tan especial.Lo mejor: La Torre Eiffel, el Arco de Triunfo, el Hôtel des Invalides, el museo del Louvre y el río Sena."
50,“La hermosa París”,"Pienso que estar en París fue cumplir un sueño: visitar el Louvre, caminar por los Champs Elysses. Todo, todo en París es glamour y belleza.Para mi fue, ademas, especialmente interesante pues me he dedicado a leer sobre las Cortes Francesas y recientemente terminé un libro sobre Enrique IV, Rey de Francia. Quien estuvo casado con Margarita, hija de Catalina de Medicis. Y quien vivió en su castillo del Louvre.Al caminar por sus patios me imaginaba como era la vida en ese lugar. Claro, con la conciencia de que mucho ha cambiado, que han habido reparaciones y no se encuentra en el mismo estado.Igualmente fascinante fue la Torre Eiffel, toda luz y hermosura. Fue hermoso acostarme en la grama soolo a verla, grabarla en mi memoria para siempre.El Museo de Orsay tambien me pareció impresionante por la cantidad de obras importantes que en él se encuentran.De las iglesias la que mas me impresionó fue la del Sagrado Corazón, quizas porque no teníamos idea de su magnificienciay y fue sorprendente conseguirnos con una obra de esa envergadura. Es realmente magnifica, al igual que la maravillosa imagen de París que se tiene desde su balcón. Es mucho lo que se puede decir de Paris, pero no hay nada como estar allí. Invito a todo el que pueda a visitarla, no lo defraudará."
40,“Il mio paradiso ....”,"Ed eccomi qua .... alla mia scrivania a riguardare le foto della settimana pù bella della mia vita ....Ho compiuto 21 anni quest'anno e ho voluto come regalo il meglio, una fetta di paradiso .... Una settimana a Parigi ....Non so spiegare come mai, ma Parigi è la mia città .... Mi fa stare bene, tutte le volte che scendo dall'aereo e sento lo speaker che da gli annunci in francese mi appare sul volto un sorriso ... come un neonato quando vede le cose per la prima volta ....Subito mi dirigo al rerb e mi appiccico al finestrino a gustare un paesaggio completamente diverso dal nostro ... Un paesaggio fine ... delicato ... sofisticato ....Giusto il tempo di prendere possesso dell'appartamento, una doccia rapida, un cambio di vestiti e subito sulla metropolitana ... per salire sull'arco di trionfo .... e poi passeggiare per gli Champs Elysèes ... e poi sempre dritti ... fino alla Senna .... per poi seguire la torre e,non si come, ritrovarsi ai suoi piedi .... e lì, uno spettacolo stupendo .. La torre illuminata: mille luci che si accendono e spengono .... Che si uniscono ai mille flash di turisti estasiati che sanno che niente da loro è così bello ... ma è solo l'inizo... perchè tutto a parigi è bello ... perchè tutto a parigi è luminoso ... perchè tutto a parigi è irripetibile ....Purtroppo lo stomaco brontola .... e anche se qui è scritto in poche righe nella realtà è un pomeriggio .... e allora riprendiamo la metro e ci mischiamo ai parigini che tornano dal lavoro, ascolto i loro discorsi ... le loro lamentele ...e mi chiedo :""Come possono lamentarsi, sono Parigini!?!?!?""Usciamo dall'appartamento e cerchiamo un ristorantino nel marais .... Ovviamente buono, ma ovviamente caro ... ma è solo un dettaglio ....Passeggiatina nel quartiere latino ....ovviamente passeggiando si nota la bellezza di parigi ... i ponti ... le strade ... le chiese, tutto lì attorno è bello ... tutto lì attorno è eterno ....Qualunque innovazione tecnologica l'uomo inventa, si perde davanti all'imponenza di notre dame .... alle rotondità del sacro cuore ... e al lento scorrere della senna ....Tutta la settimana continua nel susseguirsi di scoperte meravigliose .... di attimi mozzafiato .... di gustose leccornie ....Era semplicemente splendido passeggiare e essere invasi dal profumo delle baguettes e dei pains au chocolat .....Superare il pantheon per poi scoprire la moschea ... Passeggiare per il quartiere ebraico e poi di nuovo rientrare nel mondo occidentale ... e tutto col massimo rispetto ... con l'osservanza delle varie culture, con la consapevolezza che solo i grandi uomini portano rispetto anche per cio che non capiscono ,,,, Parigi è questo, Parigi accetta tutti, senza dimenticare se stessa ... Parigi è la Francia, è la rivoluzione ... é la prima costituzione ... ma nello stesso tempo è lo sfarzo e il lusso del re sole ... la forza di Napoleone ... e soprattutto l'armonia degli artisti, poeti e scrittori , musicisti e ballerini, scultori e quant'altro, che l'hanno popolata e la popoleranno sempre, che con le loro opere rendono semplicemente magico il viaggio di chiunque cammini nelle sue vie ....Su parigi potrei scrivere mille pagine .... ma non ho la conoscenza per farlo ... ho semplicemente espresso le emozioni che mi provoca passeggiare per les rues e i boulevards, della mia città preferita ...è una magia, che se ti contagia, non ti abbandona mai ...."
30,“una settimana a Parigi”,"Ero pronta a sfoderare il meglio del mio Inglese, invece con mia grande sorpresa posso usare la mia lingua madre, ma che bellezza!Adesso viene il bello: parlare di Parigi è come parlare di Roma, Venezia,Londra, New York; praticamente è stato detto di tutto e di più e poi non vi ho passato abbastanza tempo per poterla vivere a fondo come piacerebbe a me ogni qualvolta faccio una vacanza.Non è stata una settimana all'insegna della vita notturna, niente teatro, niente Folies Bergères, nè Moulin rouge o Crazy Horse.Ho scarpinato (in dolce compagnia) tanto durante il giorno che la sera non vedevo l'ora di rinchiudermi in quel delizioso appartamentino di Montmatre lasciatomi da un amico concittadino tornato a casa per quel periodo, che coincideva con il weak end dei Santi.E non scandalizzatevi se vi dico che per scelta ho anche evitato tutti i musei (Monna Lisa inclusa, ecchesaràmai?): ho preferito vivere Parigi per le strade, all'aria aperta, quella stupenda aria da ""indian summer"", girovagare per Il Marais, quartiere molto trendy e vivace, pieno di negozietti originali e stravaganti o passeggiare per le Champs Elisées, che, non me ne vogliate, mi hanno un po' deluso, così trafficati e rumorosi.....Le Sacré Coeur di notte con la piazzetta degli artisti vicinissima: se siete come me un pò pigri utilizzate la funicolare: ha lo stesso prezzo di una corsa con il bus ma ricordatevi che chiude alle 00.30.Se poi siete possessori della ""carte orange"" non pagate nulla.A questo proposito ve la voglio consigliare: con appena € 16 circa girate a volontà per una settimana sulla metropolitana e sui bus per le zone 1 e 2 che coprono abbondantemente tutto il centro fino alle porte e vi assicuro che vi stancherete di girare.La metropolitana di Parigi, come quella di Londra è molto semplice da utilizzare, ma allenatevi prima di partire: ci sono un'infinità di scale da scendere e salire e le scale mobili sono (ahimè) davvero pochine....Io sono andata in aereo, ma per un viaggio così breve (h. 1.30 circa da Bologna) ci ho messo qualcosa come 10 ore circa tra presentarsi 2 ore circa prima della partenza all'aereoporto, fila al check in, attesa per il recupero bagagli, naetta per il centro - l'aereoporto Charles de Gaulles dista circa Km 35 da Parigi -Un'esagerazione, anche se naturalmente questo vale per i viaggi a piccolo raggio:Allora mi son presa la briga di consultare il sito di Trenitalia, e ho scoperto che con lo stesso tempo arrivo a Parigi dormendo , senza neanche accorgermene alla modicissima cifra di € 60 !!!!Ma attenzione, questa era una promozione, ma vi cosiglierei di farci un pensierino, perchè, nonostante io adori viaggiare in aereo, ho considerato che arrivare in pieno centro - alla gare du Nord- belli, freschi e riposati (le soluzioni per le cuccette variano di prezzo a seconda dei posti letto) senza problemi di bagaglio, file, preoccupazioni di bagaglio a mano e di quello che abbiamo potuto metterci dentro involontariamente col rischio di vedercelo sequestrare sotto gli occhi....Un altro consiglio: questa, insieme alla primavera, è la stagione migliore per visitare questa maestosa capitale, ma è un po' una regola che vale per tutte le capitale Europee!O.K. questo è tutto, ho tralasciato la visita ai monumenti vari, per questo ci sono le guide (a proposito evitate la Guida Verde di una nota casa editrice che trovate anche nelle edicole, secondo me non vale niente, sapeste come ho rimpianto la cara vecchia guida del Touring!!!).Spero di esservi stata un po' d'aiuto anche se la mia descrizione nion è stata molto tecnica, in ogni caso......BUON VIAGGIO !!E non perdetevi una bella passeggiata romantica sui quais della Senna!"
